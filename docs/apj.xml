<title>Let There Be Neutrons! Hadronic Photoproduction from a Large Flux of High-energy Photons</title>

We propose that neutrons may be generated in high-energy, high-flux photon environments via photo-induced reactions on pre-existing baryons. These photohadronic interactions are expected to occur in astrophysical jets and surrounding material. Historically, these reactions have been attributed to the production of high-energy cosmic rays and neutrinos. We estimate the photoproduction off of protons in the context of gamma-ray bursts, where it is expected there will be sufficient baryonic material that may be encompassing or entrained in the jet. We show that typical stellar baryonic material, even material completely devoid of neutrons, can become inundated with neutrons in situ via hadronic photoproduction. Consequently, this mechanism provides a means for collapsars and other astrophysical sites containing substantial flux of high-energy photons to be favorable for neutron-capture nucleosynthesis.

<title>Dynamical Friction by Coupled Dark Energy</title>

In this paper, we examine dynamical friction at galactic scales within the framework of coupled dark energy (CDE). This model posits dark energy as coupled quintessence, which maintains a minimal coupling to gravity but interacts nonminimally with both dark matter and baryonic matter. Since our focus is primarily on the Newtonian regime within galaxies, we begin by deriving the Newtonian limit of the model. Subsequently, we calculate the dynamical friction force using three different approaches. We demonstrate that, in the absence of interaction between dark energy and matter, standard quintessence does not generate any dynamical friction at the galactic scale. However, the presence of interaction does cause dynamical friction. By applying the resulting analytic expressions to a real self-gravitating system, namely the Fornax galaxy, and by implementing the constraints on the free parameter of the model obtained from galactic observations, we demonstrate that the CDE model leads to significant deviations from the standard cold dark matter model at galactic scales. On the other hand, if the cosmological constraints are assumed for the free parameter, the effects of the model are expected to be negligible at the galactic level, at least in dynamical friction.

<title>The Multiwavelength Extinction Law and Its Variation in the Coalsack Molecular Cloud Based on the Gaia, APASS, SMSS, 2MASS, GLIMPSE, and WISE Surveys</title>

Accurate interpretation of observations relies on the interstellar dust extinction law, which also serves as a powerful diagnostic for probing dust properties. In this study, we investigate the multiwavelength extinction law of the quiescent, starless molecular cloud Coalsack and explore its potential variation across different interstellar environments: the surrounding region, the nearby high Galactic latitude region, the inner dense region, and the inner diffuse region. Using a sample of 368,524 dwarf stars selected from Gaia DR3 as tracers, we establish the effective temperature Teff–intrinsic color relations to derive the intrinsic color indices and optical−mid-infrared (MIR) color excess (CE) for 20 bands. Linear fits to the CE–CE diagrams provide CE ratios, which are subsequently converted into relative extinction. The resulting extinction curves for different environments exhibit steep slopes in the near-infrared (NIR) and flat profiles in the MIR. In the optical–NIR range, the Coalsack extinction law is consistent with the RV = 3.1 of S. Wang & X. Chen and B. S. Hensley & B. T. Draine, while in the MIR, it follows the RV = 5.5 of J. C. Weingartner & B. T. Draine, similar to the results of active star-forming clouds. At an angular resolution of , our extinction map reveals fine cloud structures. No correlation is found between RV and EB,V for EB,V > 0.3 mag, implying a uniform optical extinction law in the Coalsack cloud. The derived average RV value is 3.24 ± 0.32.

<title>Turbulent Suppression of Alfvénic Wave Resonances in Coronal Loops</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb48b</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb48b</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Alfvénic wave turbulence is a leading mechanism for explaining the heating of the solar corona and the acceleration of the solar wind. Alfvénic waves are observed to be prevalent throughout the inner corona. An intriguing aspect of the observed waves is that active-region loops show decayless standing Alfvénic oscillations, while quiet-Sun loops show only propagating Alfvénic waves. Given the weaker rates of resonant damping found in the quiet Sun (compared to those estimated from decaying oscillations of active-region loops), the reason for the lack of observed standing oscillations is unclear. We suggest that this may be due to the presence of efficient (or strong) Alfvénic wave turbulence in the quiet Sun, which limits the ability of waves to form resonant oscillations in the coronal cavity. To test this idea, we model the coronal velocity fluctuations using a previously developed 3D reduced magnetohydrodynamic model. In this model, we implement a semi-realistic profile for atmospheric plasma conditions along the magnetic field and a homogeneous plasma perpendicular to the magnetic field. Results are presented for different models of the background atmosphere that effectively have different levels of coronal turbulence. For the Alfvénic waves in the simulation, we see that resonant modes are present when the coronal turbulence is in a weak regime. However, decreasing the nonlinear timescale leads to a faster development of turbulence. This can suppress the presence of standing modes when the nonlinear timescale is comparable to or shorter than the Alfvén travel time.

<title>Introducing the DREAMS Project: DaRk mattEr and Astrophysics with Machine Learning and Simulations</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb8e5</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We introduce the DaRk mattEr and Astrophysics with Machine learning and Simulations (DREAMS) project, an innovative approach to understanding the astrophysical implications of alternative dark matter (DM) models and their effects on galaxy formation and evolution. The DREAMS project will ultimately comprise thousands of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations that simultaneously vary over DM physics, astrophysics, and cosmology in modeling a range of systems—from galaxy clusters to ultra-faint satellites. Such extensive simulation suites can provide adequate training sets for machine-learning-based analyses. This paper introduces two new cosmological hydrodynamical suites of warm dark matter (WDM), each comprising 1024 simulations generated using the arepo code. One suite consists of uniform-box simulations covering a volume, while the other consists of Milky Way zoom-ins with sufficient resolution to capture the properties of classical satellites. For each simulation, the WDM particle mass is varied along with the initial density field and several parameters controlling the strength of baryonic feedback within the IllustrisTNG model. We provide two examples, separately utilizing emulators and convolutional neural networks, to demonstrate how such simulation suites can be used to disentangle the effects of DM and baryonic physics on galactic properties. The DREAMS project can be extended further to include different DM models, galaxy formation physics, and astrophysical targets. In this way, it will provide an unparalleled opportunity to characterize uncertainties on predictions for small-scale observables, leading to robust predictions for testing the particle physics nature of DM on these scales.

<title>Statistical Analysis of Comet Disconnection Events Using STEREO HI and a Data-assimilative Solar Wind Model</title>

Comets tails can reveal information about the local solar wind conditions. They can exhibit various signatures of interactions with the solar wind including bending, developing kinks, and sometimes undergoing tail disconnections. In this study, we investigate comet tail disconnection events observed in the STEREO HI data during the period of 2007–2023. Using the Heliospheric Upwind eXtrapolation model with a time-dependency (HUXt) solar wind model alongside novel solar wind data assimilation (DA) techniques, each disconnection event was investigated to determine its cause. The resulting statistical analysis led to three main conclusions: (1) for every heliospheric current sheet (HCS) crossing predicted by HUXt that occurs when the comet is within the region of influence of DA, a tail disconnection follows; (2) for HCS crossings that occur outside the region where DA can be applied, 54.5% are followed by a tail disconnection; and (3) there is an approximately linear relationship between the speed of the solar wind at the HCS crossing and the time delay to the onset of a disconnection given by the equation Vrel (km s−1) = (2.23 ± 0.35)Δt (hr) + (400 ± 10)(km s−1).

<title>Simulating a Stellar Binary Merger. II. Obtaining a Light Curve*</title>

Luminous red novae are enigmatic transient events distinguished by a rapid rise in luminosity, a plateau in luminosity, and spectra, which become redder with time. The best-observed system before, during, and after the outburst is V1309 Sco. We model a candidate V1309 Sco progenitor binary configuration (1.52 + 0.16 M⊙) using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code StarSmasher with a modified energy equation that implements flux-limited emission-diffusion radiative transport in a Lagrangian case. We developed an imaging technique allowing us to capture the flux an observer would measure. In this novel method, the outgoing radiative flux of each SPH particle in the observer's direction is attenuated by other particles along the path to the observer. We investigated how the light curve is affected in various models: with and without dust formation; constant, Planck, or Rosseland mean opacities; different donor star sizes; different companion star masses and types; radiative heating included in our modified energy equation; and different SPH simulation resolutions. The resulting evolution in bolometric luminosity and spectrum peak temperature is in good agreement with V1309 Sco observations. Our simulations rule out V1309 Sco models that do not assume dust formation.

The improved sensitivity of interferometric facilities to the 21 cm line of atomic hydrogen (H i) enables studies of its properties in galaxies beyond the local Universe. In this work, we perform a 21 cm line spectral stacking analysis combining the MeerKAT International GigaHertz Tiered Extragalactic Exploration and COSMOS H i Large Extra-galactic Survey surveys in the COSMOS field to derive a robust H i–stellar mass relation at z ≈ 0.36. In particular, by stacking thousands of star-forming galaxies subdivided into stellar mass bins, we optimize the signal-to-noise ratio of targets and derive mean H i masses in the different stellar mass intervals for the investigated galaxy population. We combine spectra from the two surveys, estimate H i masses, and derive the scaling relation . Our findings indicate that galaxies at z ≈ 0.36 are H i richer than those at z ≈ 0 but H i poorer than those at z ≈ 1, with a slope consistent across redshift, suggesting that stellar mass does not significantly affect H i exchange mechanisms. We also observe a slower growth rate H i relative to the molecular gas, supporting the idea that the accretion of cold gas is slower than the rate of consumption of molecular gas to form stars. This study contributes to understanding the role of atomic gas in galaxy evolution and sets the stage for future development of the field in the upcoming Square Kilometre Array era.

<title>VERITAS and Multiwavelength Observations of the Blazar B3 2247+381 in Response to an IceCube Neutrino Alert</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
While the sources of the diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux detected by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory are still largely unknown, one of the promising methods to improve our understanding of them is investigating the potential temporal and spatial correlations between neutrino alerts and the electromagnetic radiation from blazars. We report on the multiwavelength target-of-opportunity observations of the blazar B3 2247+381, taken in response to an IceCube multiplet alert for a cluster of muon neutrino events compatible with the source location between 2022 May 20 and 2022 November 10. B3 2247+381 was not detected with VERITAS during this time period. The source was found to be in a low-flux state in the optical, ultraviolet, and gamma-ray bands for the time interval corresponding to the neutrino event, but was detected in the hard X-ray band with NuSTAR during this period. We find the multiwavelength spectral energy distribution is described well using a simple one-zone leptonic synchrotron self-Compton radiation model. Moreover, assuming the neutrinos originate from hadronic processes within the jet, the neutrino flux would be accompanied by a photon flux from the cascade emission, and the integrated photon flux required in such a case would significantly exceed the total multiwavelength fluxes and the VERITAS upper limits presented here. The lack of flaring activity observed with VERITAS, combined with the low multiwavelength flux levels, as well as the significance of the neutrino excess being at a 3σ level (uncorrected for trials), makes B3 2247+381 an unlikely source of the IceCube multiplet. We conclude that the neutrino excess is likely a background fluctuation.

<title>Ca ii K Polar Network Index of the Sun: A Proxy for Historical Polar Magnetic Field</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb3a8</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The Sun’s polar magnetic field is pivotal in understanding solar dynamo processes and forecasting future solar cycles. However, direct measurements of the polar field have only been available since the 1970s. The chromospheric Ca ii K polar network index (PNI; the fractional area of the chromospheric network regions above a certain latitude) has recently emerged as a reliable proxy for polar magnetic fields. In this study, we derive PNI estimates from newly calibrated, rotation-corrected Ca ii K observations from the Kodaikanal Solar Observatory (1904–2007) and modern data from the Rome Precision Solar Photometric Telescope (2000–2022). We use both of those Ca ii K archives to identify polar network regions with an automatic adaptive threshold segmentation technique and calculate the PNI. The PNI obtained from both the archives shows a significant correlation with the measured polar field from the Wilcox Solar Observatory (Pearson correlation coefficient r > 0.93) and the derived polar field based on an Advective Flux Transport Model (r > 0.91). The PNI series also shows a significant correlation with faculae counts derived from Mount Wilson Observatory observations (r > 0.87) for both Kodaikanal Solar Observatory and Rome Precision Solar Photometric Telescope data. Finally, we use the PNI series from both archives to reconstruct the polar magnetic field over a 119 yr long period, which includes the last 11 solar cycles (Cycles 14–24). We also obtain a relationship between the amplitude of solar cycles (in 13 month smoothed sunspot number) and the strength of the reconstructed polar field at the preceding solar cycle minimum to validate the prediction of the ongoing solar cycle, Cycle 25.

<title>ODIN: High Clustering Strength of Protoclusters at Cosmic Noon</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb624</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The One-hundred-deg2 DECam Imaging in Narrowbands (ODIN) survey is carrying out a systematic search for protoclusters during Cosmic Noon, using Lyα-emitting galaxies (LAEs) as tracers. Once completed, ODIN aims to identify hundreds of protoclusters at redshifts of 2.4, 3.1, and 4.5 across seven extragalactic fields, covering a total area of up to 91 deg2. In this work, we report the high clustering strength of the ODIN protoclusters, determined via measurements of their cross-correlation with LAEs. Our sample consists of 150 protocluster candidates at z = 2.4 and 3.1, identified in two ODIN fields with a total area of 13.9 deg2. At z = 2.4 and 3.1, the inferred protocluster biases are and , corresponding to mean halo masses of and , respectively. By the present day, these protoclusters are expected to evolve into virialized galaxy clusters with a mean mass of ∼1014.5M⊙. By comparing the observed number density of protoclusters to that of halos with the same measured clustering strength, we find that the completeness of our sample is of order unity. Finally, the similar descendant masses derived for our samples at z = 2.4 and 3.1, assuming that the halo number density remains constant, suggest that they represent similar structures observed at different cosmic epochs. As a consequence, any observed differences between the two samples can be understood as redshift evolution. The ODIN protocluster samples will thus provide valuable insights into the cosmic evolution of cluster galaxies.

<title>Probing the Galactic Neutrino Flux at Neutrino Energies above 200 TeV with the Baikal Gigaton Volume Detector</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Recent observations of the Galactic component of the high-energy neutrino flux, together with the detection of the diffuse Galactic gamma-ray emission up to sub-PeV energies, open new possibilities to study the acceleration and propagation of cosmic rays in the Milky Way. At the same time, both large nonastrophysical backgrounds at TeV energies and the scarcity of neutrino events in the sub-PeV band currently limit these analyses. Here, we use the sample of cascade events with estimated neutrino energies above 200 TeV, detected by the partially deployed Baikal Gigaton Volume Detector (GVD) in 6 yr of operation, to test the continuation of the Galactic neutrino spectrum to sub-PeV energies. We find that the distribution of the arrival directions of Baikal-GVD cascades above 200 TeV in the sky suggests an excess of neutrinos from low Galactic latitudes with the chance probability of 1.4 × 10−2. We also find the excess above 200 TeV in the most recent IceCube public data sets, both of cascades and tracks. The chance probability of the excess in the combined IceCube and Baikal-GVD analysis is 3.4 × 10−4. The flux of Galactic neutrinos above 200 TeV challenges often-used templates for neutrino search based on cosmic-ray simulations.

<title>Direct Evidence for Active Galactic Nuclei Feedback from Fast Molecular Outflows in Reionization-era Quasars</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Galactic outflows driven by rapidly accreting quasars at high redshift are widely expected to play a key role in the short- and long-term future evolution of their host galaxies. Using new and archival Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array data, we observed the OH 119 μm doublet lines in order to search for cold molecular outflows in a sample of 11 unobscured, IR-luminous quasars at z > 6. This represents the first survey for molecular winds in reionization-era quasars, and we detect unambiguous outflows in 8/11 (73%) of the quasars. The outflows we find are substantially faster, by ≈300 km s−1 on average, than outflows observed in a roughly coeval sample of nonquasar IR-luminous galaxies, suggesting that the active galactic nuclei (AGN) drive the winds to higher velocities. On the other hand, the implied molecular outflow rates are relatively modest given the high luminosities, suggesting typical mass-loading factors ~0.5 in the cold gas. The outflows are consistent with expectations for momentum-driven winds regardless of the driving source, but the kinetic energy in the outflows suggests that the AGN must be at least partially responsible for driving the winds. Accordingly, we find trends between the outflow properties and the Eddington ratio of the black hole accretion, though this may be linked to the underlying trend with AGN luminosity. We find that the kinetic power carried in the cold outflow phase is typically only ~0.1% of the total AGN luminosity. Our study provides evidence in favor of AGN feedback on the cold molecular gas in z > 6 quasar host galaxies, demonstrating that cold outflows are very common and powerful in the most extreme reionization-era quasars.

<title>Revisiting the Hubble Constant, Sound Horizon, and Cosmography from Late-time Universe Observations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The Hubble tension has become one of the central problems in cosmology. In this work, we determine the Hubble constant H0 and sound horizon rd by using the combination of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) from DESI surveys, time-delay lensed quasars from H0LiCOW collaborations, and the Pantheon supernova (SN) observations. We consider two cosmological approaches, i.e., Taylor series and Padé polynomials, to avoid cosmological dependence. The reason for using this combination of data is that the absolute distance provided by strong gravitational lensing helps anchor the relative distance of BAOs, and SNe provide a robust history of Universe evolution. Combining the six time-delay distance (6DΔt) plus four angular diameter distance to the deflector (4Dd) measurements of time-delay lensed quasars, the BAOs, and the Type Ia SN data sets, we obtain a model-independent result of Mpc and for the Taylor series cosmography and Mpc and for the Padé polynomial cosmography. The determination of rd and H0 prefers larger H0 and smaller rd than Planck data under the assumption of a flat Lambda cold dark matter model. However, the values of H0 are consistent with the H0 determination from the SH0ES collaboration.

<title>Comparison of HMG and Flat Rotation Velocities Inferred from Galaxy–Galaxy Weak Lensing</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Despite the success of dark matter models, unresolved issues require exploring alternatives such as modified gravity theories. In this context, we examine the compatibility of the hyperconical modified gravity (HMG) with galaxy rotation curves inferred from weak-lensing data. The research addresses the existing limitations of modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND), which often struggle with universal applicability across different galactic scales. By assuming local validity of general relativity and analyzing recent data on circular velocities from galaxy–galaxy weak lensing, our findings interpret the flat rotation curves as an effect of fictitious acceleration inherited from the cosmic expansion, without invoking dark matter. The results indicate that HMG successfully reproduces flat velocity curves on scales of 1 Mpc slightly better than MOND. Therefore, these observations support HMG as a viable gravitational model, highlighting its potential to account for dynamics on galaxies and other scales. Further research with extensive data sets is required to confirm these preliminary insights.

<title>Blowing Star Formation Away in AGN Hosts (BAH). II. Investigating the Origin of the H2 Emission Excess in Nearby Galaxies with JWST MIRI</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb8dd</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We use James Webb Space Telescope Mid-Infrared Instrument Medium-resolution Spectrometer observations of 3C 293 (UGC 8782), CGCG 012-070 and NGC 3884 to investigate the origin of the H2 emission. These three nearby active galactic nucleus (AGN) hosts are known to present H2 emission excess relative to star-forming galaxies, as traced by the H2 S(3)/PAH11.3 μm line ratio. We define the kinematically disturbed region (KDR) by the AGN and the virially dominated region based on the H2 line widths, using the W80 parameter. From the correlations between W80 and H2 S(3)/PAH11.3 μm, as well as the higher H2 S(5)/H2 S(3) and [Fe ii]5.34 μm/PAH11.3 μm ratios and flatter power-law temperature distributions observed in the KDR, we conclude that the H2 emission in the KDR is primarily driven by shock-heated gas. For 3C 293, the KDR is cospatial with the radio core, indicating that the origin of the shocks is the interaction of the radio jet with the interstellar medium, which is also responsible for the observed molecular and ionized gas outflows in this source. The other galaxies are weak radio sources; however, due to the lack of high-resolution radio images, we cannot rule out low-power jets as the origin of the shock-heated H2. Our results indicate that the excess H2 emission excess is associated with shock heating of the gas, generated by outflows or by the interaction of the radio jet with the ambient gas.

<title>Parameter Estimation with Nonstationary Noise in Gravitational-wave Data</title>

The sensitivity of gravitational-wave (GW) detectors is characterized by their noise curves, which determine the detector’s reach and ability to measure the parameters of astrophysical sources accurately. The detector noise is typically modeled as stationary and Gaussian for many practical purposes and is characterized by its power spectral density (PSD). However, due to environmental and instrumental factors, physical changes in the state of detectors may introduce nonstationarity into the noise. Misestimation of the noise behavior directly impacts the posterior width of the signal parameters. It becomes an issue for studies that depend on accurate localization volumes, such as (i) probing cosmological parameters (e.g., the Hubble constant) using cross-correlation methods with galaxies and (ii) doing electromagnetic follow-up using localization information from parameter estimation done from premerger data. We study the effects of dynamical noise on the parameter estimation of the GW events. We develop a new method to correct dynamical noise by estimating a locally valid pseudo-PSD normalized along a potential signal’s time–frequency track. We do simulations by injecting binary neutron star merger signals in various scenarios where the detector goes through a period of nonstationarity with reference noise curves of third-generation detectors (Cosmic Explorer, the Einstein telescope). As an example, for a source where mismodeling of the noise biases the signal-to-noise estimate by even 10%, one would expect the estimated sky localization to be either under- or overreported by ∼20%; errors like this, especially in low latency, could potentially cause follow-up campaigns to miss the actual source location.

<title>Tidal Disruption of “Snow Clouds” by Unassociated Stars</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
It has been suggested that star-forming galaxies may host a substantial, dark reservoir of gas in the form of planetary-mass molecular clouds that are so cold that H2 can condense. Here we investigate the process of tidal disruption of such “snow clouds” by close passage of field stars. We construct a suite of simulations using the hydrodynamic formalism introduced by Carter and Luminet, and use it to explore the properties of the resulting tidal debris. The debris streams are tiny structures that are highly over-pressured relative to the ambient interstellar medium (ISM). They are also unusual in their composition—initially consisting of cold, gaseous He together with H2 “snowballs” that may be as much as a meter in size. Each stream expands and cools and is subsequently shocked as it plows through the ISM; the snowballs are gradually eroded by the shocked gas. Snowballs streaming through the shocked ISM create microstructured plasma that is somewhat reminiscent of the “scattering screens” revealed by radio-wave scintillation studies. However, the tidal disruption rate is too low to account for the observed number of scattering screens if, as we assume here, the stars and clouds have no prior physical association so that disruptions occur as a result of chance encounters between stars and clouds.

<title>A Simplified Theory of External Occulters for Solar Coronagraphs</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada270</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a first-principles analytic treatment of modern multivane occulters in circular (coronagraph) and linear (heliospheric imager) geometry, develop a simplified theory that is useful for designing and predicting their performance, explain certain visual artifacts, and explore the performance limits of multivane occulters. Multivane occulters are challenging to design in part because they violate the conditions for both the Fraunhofer and Fresnel approximations to diffraction theory, and new designs have therefore generally required explicit simulation, empirical measurement, “guesstimation,” or all three. Starting from the Kirchoff diffraction integral, we develop a “successive plane-wave” approximate analytic theory that is suitable for predicting the performance of multivane occulters, and use it to derive closed-form expressions for the performance of new designs. We review the fundamental 2D system of an occulter edge, discuss how it applies to real 3D systems by extrusion or revolution, present the reason for observed bright quasi-achromatic fringing around coronagraph occulters, develop the successive plane wave approximation in 2D and explore its limits, describe the relevance of the 2D theory to practical 3D instruments, and discuss implications for multivane occulter design in current and future instruments.

<title>Early Time Small-scale Structures in Hot Exoplanet Atmosphere Simulations</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb0ce</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report on the critical influence of small-scale flow structures (e.g., fronts, vortices, and waves) that immediately arise in hot exoplanet atmosphere simulations initialized with a resting state. A hot, 1:1 spin–orbit synchronized Jupiter is used here as a clear example; but, the phenomenon is generic and important for any type of a hot synchronized planet—gaseous, oceanic, or telluric. When the early time structures are not captured in simulations (due to, e.g., poor resolution and/or too much dissipation), the flow behavior is markedly different at later times, in an observationally significant way; for example, the flow at large scales is smoother and much less dynamic. This results in the temperature field, and its corresponding thermal flux, to be incorrectly predicted in numerical simulations, even when the quantities are spatially averaged.

<title>On the Number of Confirmed Pulsar Planets: The Rule of Six</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb1a8</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Since the first definitive exoplanet detection, the three planets around millisecond radio pulsar PSR B1257+12, few more pulsar planets (PPs) have been reported. The peer-reviewed literature is ambiguous about the identity of confirmed PPs, with the number 6 appearing repeatedly, although it is generally not the same six listed pulsars or planets. We examined all claims, finding eight confirmed planets distributed among six pulsars. These objects overlap with the black widow pulsar population, there being 12 millisecond pulsars with credible companion masses below 10 Jupiter masses and little reason to choose between them. If, on the other hand, evidence for a planetary disk origin were adopted as a defining criterion, then only PSR B1257+12 with its three planets would qualify. Other claimed PP candidates have been either retracted, ruled out by subsequent studies, doubted because of mutually exclusive planetary solutions, or based on alternative theories. Long-lived quasiperiodic timing residuals are major culprits with several claimed orbital periods closely matching the data durations. Widely used exoplanet repositories differ in their inclusion criteria for PPs, resulting in large numerical discrepancies ranging from 6/8 confirmed pulsars/planets (NASA Exoplanet Archive) to 71/74 (Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia), which more importantly obscure a crucial distinction between planetary systems and ablated low-mass substellar companions. Tentative evidence for a spin–orbit correlation is found for the confirmed PPs, whereas such coupling is ruled out for black widows as a class. Surveys show PPs are extremely rare, yet their existence and physical properties present major challenges to understanding supernova explosions and planet formation around millisecond pulsars.

<title>Effect of Viewing Angle in Gamma-Ray Burst Properties</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb1e0</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The empirical classification of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is based on their distribution in the plane of burst duration and spectral hardness. Two distinct distributions, long-soft and short-hard bursts, are observed in this plane, forming the basis for the long and short classification scheme. Traditionally, this scheme was mapped to two different GRB progenitor classes. However, several recent bursts have challenged this mapping. This work investigates how an observer’s viewing angle relative to the jet axis influences the duration-hardness plane. We simulate single-pulse GRBs using an optically and geometrically thin homogeneous top-hat jet model. Bursts are simulated with an isotropic viewing angle distribution, and we calculate the pulse duration and spectral hardness corresponding to FERMI GBM energy bands. The viewing angle significantly impacts spectral hardness for our assumed broken power-law spectra, while its effect on duration is less pronounced. Our analysis indicates that soft and low-luminous bursts are likely off-axis events. It is possible that some of the fast X-ray transients and X-ray-rich GRBs observed by the Einstein Probe and the Space Variable Objects Monitor missions originate from off-axis jets.

<title>ALMA Reveals Thermal and Nonthermal Desorption of Methanol Ice in the HD 100546 Protoplanetary Disk</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Methanol (CH3OH) and formaldehyde (H2CO) are chemically coupled organic molecules proposed to act as an intermediate step between simple molecules and more complex prebiotic compounds. Their abundance distributions across disks regulate the prebiotic potential of material at different disk radii. We present observations of multiple methanol and formaldehyde transitions toward the Herbig Ae disk HD 100546 obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, building upon the previous serendipitous detection of methanol in this source. We find that methanol has a higher rotational temperature (Trot) than formaldehyde toward both the centrally concentrated emission component in the inner disk (0–110 au) and a radially separate dust ring farther out in the disk (180–260 au). Trot decreases for methanol and formaldehyde from the inner ( K and K) to the outer disk ( K and K), suggesting that we are tracing two different chemical environments. Trot for both species in the inner disk is consistent with thermal desorption as the origin, while the outer disk reservoir is driven by nonthermal desorption. The CH3OH/H2CO column density ratio decreases from in the inner disk to in the outer disk, consistent with modeling predictions. The CH3OH/H2CO column density ratio for the inner disk is consistent with the median value in the range of column density ratios compiled from solar system comets, which would have formed at a similar distance. This supports the notion that interstellar ice is inherited and preserved by protoplanetary disks around solar-mass and intermediate-mass stars as we are seeing “fresh” ice sublimation, as well as providing more evidence for the presence of prebiotic precursor molecules in planet-forming regions.

<title>Laboratory Measurements of n >= 3 K-shell Transition Energies of Sulfur Ions from F-like S viii to Li-like S xiv</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Inner-shell transitions are ubiquitous in nonequilibrium collisionally ionized plasmas, such as supernova remnants, and in photoionized plasmas, such as outflows from active galactic nuclei and X-ray binaries. Inner-shell X-ray emission can help determine key parameters of these systems, such as ionization time, τ, and ionization parameter, ξ. Despite their importance, only theoretical inner-shell transition energies are available for many ions. To provide experimental benchmarks, we have measured the dominant n → 1 K-shell transitions of sulfur ions where n ≥ 3 from Li-like S xiv to F-like S viii using LLNL’s SuperEBIT electron beam ion trap and the NASA/GSFC EBIT Calorimeter Spectrometer (ECS). We identify over 30 spectral features and measure their energies with uncertainties in the ∼0.1–1 eV range. We compare these results to Flexible Atomic Code (FAC) and multireference Møller–Plesset (MR-MP) calculations and find differences between theory and experiment of ∼1 eV for FAC and <0.5 eV for most MR-MP calculations. We also compare these results to two widely used atomic databases, AtomDB and CHIANTI, and find discrepancies as high as 7 eV. Furthermore, many transitions are missing from these databases despite being prominent in our data.

<title>Deep Neural Emulation of the Supermassive Black Hole Binary Population</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
While supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries are not the only viable source for the low-frequency gravitational wave background (GWB) signal evidenced by the most recent pulsar timing array (PTA) data sets, they are expected to be the most likely. Thus, connecting the measured PTA GWB spectrum and the underlying physics governing the demographics and dynamics of SMBH binaries is extremely important. Previously, Gaussian processes (GPs) and dense neural networks have been used to make such a connection by being built as conditional emulators; their input is some selected evolution or environmental SMBH binary parameters and their output is the emulated mean and standard deviation of the GWB strain ensemble distribution over many Universes. In this paper, we use a normalizing flow (NF) emulator that is trained on the entirety of the GWB strain ensemble distribution, rather than only mean and standard deviation. As a result, we can predict strain distributions that mirror underlying simulations very closely while also capturing frequency covariances in the strain distributions as well as statistical complexities such as tails, non-Gaussianities, and multimodalities that are otherwise not learnable by existing techniques. In particular, we feature various comparisons between the NF-based emulator and the GP approach used extensively in past efforts. Our analyses conclude that the NF-based emulator not only outperforms GPs in the ease and computational cost of training but also outperforms in the fidelity of the emulated GWB strain ensemble distributions.

<title>Gas Accretion Traced by Blue-dominated Lyα Emission and Redshifted UV Absorption Lines in Protocluster Galaxies at z = 2.3 from the KBSS-KCWI Survey* †</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Lyα emission with a dominant blueshifted peak can probe gas flowing through the circumgalactic medium as it accretes onto galaxies and fuels new star formation, although it has seldom actually been observed. Here we present new Keck Cosmic Web Imager observations of the extended Lyα halos surrounding Q1700-BX710 and Q1700-BX711, a pair of UV continuum-selected Keck Baryonic Structure Survey galaxies at z = 2.3 in the HS1700+643 protocluster. We find that BX710's and BX711’s Lyα halos are aligned with a large-scale galaxy filament consisting of 13 spectroscopically identified protocluster galaxies. By measuring the peak separation and blue-to-red peak flux ratio of the Lyα emission profiles throughout these galaxies’ Lyα halos, we have obtained measurements of their spatially varying velocity structure. The prevalence of blue-dominated Lyα emission profiles throughout BX711’s Lyα halo suggests actively accreting gas. We fit a clumpy, multiphase Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer model, which assumes a radially varying clump velocity to the spatially resolved Lyα emission throughout BX710's and BX711’s Lyα halos and simultaneously fit these galaxies’ average down-the-barrel UV absorption profile with a radially varying velocity model. The results of these models are consistent with a combination of H i and higher-metallicity gas accretion for both galaxies, especially BX711, which exhibits inflow-driven kinematics throughout most of its Lyα halo. We consider various accretion scenarios to explain these findings, including accretion of metal-enriched gas from the cosmic web, galaxy interactions, and recycled gas from the circumgalactic medium, all of which are compatible with our current observations.

<title>Cyclic C4 + as the Carrier of the Diffuse Interstellar Band at 503.9 nm?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) have remained a mystery in astronomy since their discovery over a century ago. The only currently known carrier is , responsible for five DIBs, while more than 550 are yet to be interpreted. The spectra of short carbon chain cations , which are considered one of the most promising classes of species for the role of carriers of DIBs, are successfully recorded using He-tagging spectroscopy. The comparison of laboratory spectra with observations demonstrates a close match of two absorption bands of with the broad DIB at 503.9 nm. This defines a high abundance of these ions in the interstellar medium (ISM), which should exceed those of other similar-sized carbon chain cations. It is anticipated that all other short carbon chain cations will exhibit linear geometry and, as a consequence, will have a long vibrational progression. However, the distinctive cyclic geometry of is postulated to underpin the elevated abundance of these ions in the ISM, as well as the distinctive spectrum of this ion, which displays a single, strong, relatively narrow absorption band that exceeds in intensity all other absorption bands in the visible range.

<title>Ejecta Wakes from Companion Interaction in Type Ia Supernova Remnants</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb7db</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Type Ia supernovae are triggered by accretion onto a white dwarf from a companion that is most likely Roche lobe–filling at the time of the explosion. The collision between the ejecta and a surviving companion carves out a conical wake, which could manifest as an asymmetry when the ejecta reaches the remnant phase. We simulate the companion interaction using the Athena++ hydrodynamics solver to determine the ejecta structure for a double-degenerate type Ia supernova. Ejecta in the wake is of lower density and higher velocity than the unperturbed ejecta. We then evolve the ejecta for several thousand years using the expanding-grid code Sprout. The forward shock within the wake is initially indented, but becomes spherical after roughly a thousand years due to transverse motion of shocked ejecta that fills the wake. The reverse shock travels quickly within the wake, leading to an off-center convergence of the reverse shock and leaving the remnant with an asymmetrical core. This also draws material from the interstellar medium deep into the remnant, eventually reaching the center. Large Rayleigh–Taylor plumes are found around the edge of the wake, creating a toroidal structure composed primarily of ejecta. Estimates of the thermal X-ray emission show that such remnants exhibit observable asymmetries for thousands of years.

<title>Challenges in Forming Millisecond Pulsar–Black Holes from Isolated Binaries</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Binaries harboring a millisecond pulsar (MSP) and a black hole (BH) are a key observing target for current and upcoming pulsar surveys. We model the formation and evolution of such binaries in isolation at solar metallicity using the next-generation binary population synthesis code POSYDON. We examine neutron star (NS)–BH binaries where the NS forms first (labeled NSBH), as the NS must be able to spin up to MSP rotation periods before the BH forms in these systems. We find that NSBHs are very rare and have a birth rate <1 Myr−1 for a Milky Way–like galaxy in our typical models. The NSBH formation rate is 2–3 orders of magnitude smaller than that for NS–BH binaries where the BH forms first (labeled BHNS). These rates are also sensitive to model assumptions about the supernova (SN) remnant masses, natal kicks, metallicity, and common-envelope (CE) evolution parameters. We find that 100% of NSBHs undergo a mass ratio reversal before the first SN and up to 52% of NSBHs undergo a double CE phase after the mass ratio reversal occurs. Most importantly, no NSBH binaries in our populations undergo a mass transfer phase, either stable or unstable, after the first SN. This implies that there is no possibility of pulsar spin-up via accretion, and thus MSP–BH binaries cannot form. Thus, dynamical environments and processes may provide the only formation channels for such MSP–BH binaries.

<title>Measurement of Energy Reduction of Inertial Alfvén Waves Propagating through Parallel Gradients in the Alfvén Speed</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We have studied the propagation of inertial Alfvén waves through parallel gradients in the Alfvén speed using the Large Plasma Device at the University of California, Los Angeles. The reflection and transmission of Alfvén waves through inhomogeneities in the background plasma are important for understanding wave propagation, turbulence, and heating in space, laboratory, and astrophysical plasmas. Here we present inertial Alfvén waves under conditions relevant to solar flares and the solar corona. We find that the transmission of the inertial Alfvén waves is reduced as the sharpness of the gradient is increased. Any reflected waves were below the detection limit of our experiment, and reflection cannot account for all of the energy not transmitted through the gradient. Our findings indicate that, for both kinetic and inertial Alfvén waves, the controlling parameter for the transmission of the waves through an Alfvén speed gradient is the ratio of the Alfvén wavelength along the gradient divided by the scale length of the gradient. Furthermore, our results suggest that an as-yet-unidentified damping process occurs in the gradient.

<title>Hinode/EIS Observation of the Alfvénic Fluctuations in the Quiet Sun</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Alfvénic fluctuations in the corona are regularly observed in EUV imaging and infrared spectroscopic data. We report here on the Doppler velocity fluctuations within the data from the Extreme-Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) on board Hinode. The capabilities of EIS provide an opportunity to detect fluctuations in the solar atmosphere and confirm the previous results from ground-based spectroscopic data using EIS’s EUV spectra and in seeing-free conditions. We analyzed Doppler velocity time series for a particular date of observation, 2007 September 27, above the limb. The Fourier transform of the observed signals show the Doppler velocity has a broad spectrum distributed as a power law with a power enhancement around 3–4 mHz. This result is consistent with previous observational results obtained with Coronal Multi-Channel Polarimeter data, and hence we interpret the Doppler velocity fluctuations as Alfvénic in nature. We performed nonlinear regression on the power spectra to determine the index of the power law and to parameterize the properties of the enhancement. We find good agreement between the estimated values and those from previous studies. Furthermore, correlation analysis shows that the observed oscillations are spatially coherent perpendicular to the magnetic field on the length scale L⊥ ∼ 8 Mm, providing an estimate on the energy injection scale of a bundle of coherently oscillating loops.

<title>The Role of Magnetic and Rotation Axis Alignment in Driving Fast Radio Burst Phenomenology</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb8e6</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb8e6</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We propose a scenario that can describe a broad range of fast radio burst (FRB) phenomenology, from nonrepeating bursts to highly prolific repeaters. Coherent radio waves in these bursts are produced in the polar cap region of a magnetar, where magnetic field lines are open. The angle between the rotation and magnetic axes, relative to the angular size of the polar cap region, partially determines the repetition rate and polarization properties of FRBs. We discuss how many of the properties of repeating FRBs—such as their lack of periodicity, energetics, small polarization angle (PA) swing, spectro–temporal correlation, and inferred low source density— are explained by this scenario. The systematic PA swing and the periodic modulation of long-duration bursts from nonrepeaters are also natural outcomes. We derive a lower limit of about 400 on the Lorentz factor of FRB sources applying this scenario to bursts with a linear polarization degree greater than 95%.

<title>3D Simulations of Semiconvection in Spheres: Turbulent Mixing and Layer Formation</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb8ec</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb8ec</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Semiconvection occurs in regions of stars and planets that are unstable to overturning convection according to the Schwarzschild criterion, but stable according to the Ledoux criterion. Previous simulations in Cartesian boxes have advanced our understanding of the semiconvective instability, layer formation, and transport properties. However, much less is known about semiconvection in spherical geometry and under the influence of rotation or magnetic fields. We present 3D simulations of semiconvection in the full sphere (including r = 0) and accounting for rotation. We find that the formation and evolution of semiconvective layers in nonrotating spheres occurs in a similar way to that in nonrotating Cartesian boxes, in the sense that the critical density ratio at which layers are expected to form is approximately the same in both geometries. Layers rapidly merge once they form, ultimately leading to a fully mixed convective sphere. The transport properties measured through the Nusselt numbers and the buoyancy flux ratio are also similar to results from previous studies in boxes. When rotation is added to the system, layer formation and evolution proceed in a similar fashion to the nonrotating runs. However, rotation hampers the radial transport of heat and composition, and, as a result, the time that it takes for the sphere to become fully mixed gets longer as the flow becomes more rotationally constrained. We also find that semiconvective layers exhibit spherical mixing in nonrotating cases, whereas in rotating cases the mixing becomes more cylindrical. We discuss what is needed for future work to build more realistic models.

<title>The UNCOVER Survey: First Release of Ultradeep JWST/NIRSpec PRISM Spectra for ∼700 Galaxies from z ∼ 0.3–13 in A2744</title>

We present the design and observations of low-resolution JWST/NIRSpec PRISM spectroscopy from the Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam ObserVations before the Epoch of Reionization (UNCOVER) Cycle 1 JWST Treasury program. Targets are selected using JWST/NIRCam photometry from UNCOVER and other programs, and cover a wide range of categories and redshifts to ensure the legacy value of the survey. These categories include the first galaxies at z ≳ 10, faint galaxies during the Epoch of Reionization (z ∼ 6−8), high-redshift active galactic nuclei (z ≳ 6), Population III star candidates, distant quiescent and dusty galaxies (1 ≲ z ≲ 6), and filler galaxies sampling redshift–color–magnitude space from z ∼ 0.1−13. Seven NIRSpec microshutter array masks across the extended A2744 cluster were observed, along with NIRCam parallel imaging in nine filters (F090W, F115W, F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F410M, F444W, and F480M) over a total area of ∼26 arcmin2, overlapping existing Hubble Space Telescope coverage from programs including the Hubble Frontier Fields and BUFFALO. We successfully observed 553 objects down to mF444W ∼ 30 AB, and by leveraging mask overlaps, we reach total on-target exposure times ranging from 2.4 to 16.7 hr. We demonstrate the success rate and distribution of the confirmed redshifts, and also highlight the rich information revealed by these ultradeep spectra for a subset of our targets. An updated lens model of A2744 is also presented, including 14 additional spectroscopic redshifts and finding a total cluster mass of MSL = (2.1 ± 0.3) × 1015M⊙. We publicly release reduced 1D and 2D spectra for all objects observed in summer 2023 along with a spectroscopic redshift catalog and the updated lens model of the cluster (https://jwst-uncover.github.io/DR4.html).

<title>Empirical SED Templates for Star Clusters Observed with HST and JWST: No Strong PAH or IR Dust Emission after 5 Myr</title>

JWST observations, when combined with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data, promise to improve age estimates of star clusters in nearby spiral galaxies. However, feedback from young cluster stars pushes out the natal gas and dust, making cluster formation and evolution a challenge to model. Here, we use JWST+ HST observations of the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 628 to produce spectral energy distribution (SED) templates of compact star clusters spanning 275 nm through 21 μm. These preliminary SEDs capture the cluster stars and associated gas and dust within radii of ≈0 12–0 67 (corresponding to ≈6–33 pc at the distance of NGC 628). One important finding is that the SEDs of 1, 2, 3, and 4 Myr clusters can be differentiated in the infrared. Another is that, in 80%–90% of the cases we study, the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and Hα emission track one another, with the dust responsible for the 3.3 μm PAH emission largely removed by 4 Myr, consistent with pre-supernova stellar feedback acting quickly on the surrounding gas and dust. Nearly embedded cluster candidates have infrared SEDs that are quite similar to optically visible 1–3 Myr clusters. In nearly all cases, we find there is a young star cluster within a few tenths of an arcsec (10–30 pc) of the nearly embedded cluster, suggesting the formation of the cluster was triggered by its presence. The resulting age estimates from the empirical templates are compatible both with dynamical estimates based on CO superbubble expansion velocities, as well as the TODDLERS models, which track spherical evolution of homogeneous gas clouds around young stellar clusters.

<title>Foreground Removal and Angular Power Spectrum Estimation of 21 cm Signal Using Harmonic Space ILC Method</title>

Mapping the distribution of neutral atomic hydrogen (H i) in the Universe through its 21 cm emission line provides a powerful cosmological probe to map the large-scale structures and shed light on various cosmological phenomena. The baryon acoustic oscillations at low redshifts can potentially be probed by sensitive H i intensity mapping experiments and constrain the properties of dark energy. However, the 21 cm signal detection faces formidable challenges owing to the dominance of various astrophysical foregrounds, which can be several orders of magnitude stronger. Our current work introduces a novel and model-independent internal linear combination (ILC) method in harmonic space using the principal components of the 21 cm signal for accurate foreground removal and power spectrum estimation. We estimate the principal components by incorporating prior knowledge of the theoretical 21 cm covariance matrix. We test our methodology by detailed simulations of radio observations, incorporating synchrotron emission, free–free radiation, extragalactic point sources, and thermal noise. We estimate the full-sky 21 cm angular power spectrum after application of a mask on the full-sky cleaned 21 cm signal by using the mode–mode coupling matrix. These full-sky estimates of angular spectra can be directly used to measure the cosmological parameters. For the first time, we demonstrate the effectiveness of a foreground-model-independent ILC method in harmonic space to reconstruct the 21 cm signal.

<title>Lyα Processing of Solid-state Ethanolamine: Potential Precursors to Sugar and Peptide Derivatives</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb486</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb486</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Ethanolamine (EA), a key component of phospholipids, has recently been detected in the interstellar medium within molecular clouds. To understand this observation, laboratory studies of its formation and destruction are essential and should be complemented by astrochemical models. This study investigates the photostability of EA ice under Lyα (10.2 eV) irradiation at 10 K, and explores its potential role in the formation of simple and complex organic molecules (COMs) in molecular clouds. The UV-destruction cross section of EA was estimated to be (4.7 ± 0.3) × 10−18 cm2, providing insight into its half-life of 6.5 × 107 yr in dense interstellar clouds. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and quadrupole mass spectrometry were used to identify various photoproducts, with their formation pathways discussed. Ethylene glycol and serine were tentatively detected during the warming-up process following irradiation, suggesting that EA could contribute to the formation of prebiotic molecules such as sugars, peptides, and their derivatives. High-mass signals detected in the mass spectrometer suggest the presence of several COMs, and further analysis of residues at room temperature is planned for future work. The results suggest that EA could contribute to the formation of prebiotic molecules in space, with implications for the origin of life.

<title>Investigating Coronal Mass Ejections through Multispacecraft Measurements: STEREO-A and L1 in 2022–2023</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The angular width of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and the variations of CME properties for various crossings through the structure remain insufficiently studied and inadequately understood, primarily due to the rarity of multispacecraft measurements. From 2022 January to 2023 August, STEREO-A was in relative proximity to the Sun–Earth first Lagrangian (L1) point, with the STEREO-A–L1 angular separation reducing from 35∘ to 0∘, corresponding to a time with an increasing activity of solar cycle 25 approaching its maximum. This provides a unique time period to obtain multispacecraft measurements of CMEs and to analyze their properties as observed by Wind/ACE and STEREO-A. Among 49 total CMEs measured by either spacecraft over the 20 months, only 15 were simultaneously detected at both spacecraft, indicating that only 31% of CMEs impacted both within a longitudinal separation of 0∘–35∘. While 80%–100% of CMEs were observed by both spacecraft within 10∘, this percentage rapidly dropped to approximately 30% beyond 10∘, and near 30∘, it fell further to 10%. These findings suggest that the average CME angular width near 1 au is likely between 20∘and 35∘, smaller than previously suggested. Furthermore, the analysis of these 15 events reveals that average CME properties like magnetic field strength and proton speed are largely consistent regardless of angular separation. However, correlations and rms error analyses highlight significant variability in CME properties even within separations of 10∘–20∘, when examining their internal variations in detail. This study raises numerous questions about our knowledge of CME properties.

<title>Rare Event Classification with Weighted Logistic Regression for Identifying Repeating Fast Radio Bursts</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb623</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb623</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An important task in the study of fast radio bursts (FRBs) remains the automatic classification of repeating and nonrepeating sources based on their morphological properties. We propose a statistical model that considers a modified logistic regression to classify FRB sources. The classical logistic regression model is modified to accommodate the small proportion of repeaters in the data, a feature that is likely due to the sampling procedure and duration and is not a characteristic of the population of FRB sources. The weighted logistic regression hinges on the choice of a tuning parameter that represents the true proportion τ of repeating FRB sources in the entire population. The proposed method has a sound statistical foundation, direct interpretability, and operates with only five parameters, enabling quicker retraining with added data. Using the CHIME/FRB Collaboration sample of repeating and nonrepeating FRBs and numerical experiments, we achieve a classification accuracy for repeaters of nearly 75% or higher when τ is set in the range of 50%–60%. This implies a tentative high proportion of repeaters, which is surprising, but is also in agreement with recent estimates of τ that are obtained using other methods.

<title>Planetary Formation Constrained by Collisions between Millimeter-sized Lunar Particles and Lunar Surface from Chang’E-4 Mission</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Exploring low-velocity collisions is crucial for unraveling intricate processes in planetary formation, particularly the bouncing barrier that impedes the aggregation of dust into sizable planetesimals. Observational data on extraterrestrial collision processes remain limited. Here, we quantify collision parameters for millimeter-sized lunar particles impacting the porous lunar surface at speeds ranging from 2.3 to 76.8 cm s−1 under lunar gravity, leveraging Chang’E-4 imagery. This study represents the first tangible acquisition of extraterrestrial collision data. Our findings reveal that speeds exceeding 7.0 ± 2.6 cm s−1 result in bouncing, yielding coefficients of restitution ranging from 0.51 to 0.80. In contrast to particle–particle collisions, interactions between lunar particles and the porous lunar surface exhibit a heightened sticking threshold speed, facilitating particles to overcome the bouncing barrier. Diminished coefficients of restitution expedite collapses, significantly reducing dust cloud collapse times. This implies that porous particles foster favorable conditions for overcoming the bouncing barrier and promoting growth. Our results unveil the conducive conditions enabling extraterrestrial samples to overcome the bouncing barrier, advancing our comprehension of planetary formation and providing crucial observational constraints for relevant theories.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present three separate void catalogs created using a volume-limited sample of the DESI Data Release 1 Bright Galaxy Survey. We use the algorithms VoidFinder and V2 to construct void catalogs out to a redshift of z = 0.24. Excluding voids affected by the boundaries of the survey, we obtain 1489 voids with VoidFinder, 389 with V2 using REVOLVER pruning, and 297 with V2 using VIDE pruning. Comparing our catalogs with overlapping Sloan Digital Sky Survey void catalogs, we find generally consistent void properties but significant differences in the void volume overlap, which we attribute to differences in the galaxy selection and survey masks. These catalogs are suitable for studying the variation in galaxy properties with cosmic environment and for cosmological studies.

<title>The Proxima Centauri Campaign—First Constraints on Millimeter Flare Rates from ALMA</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada5f2</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Proxima Centauri (Cen) has been the subject of many flaring studies due to its proximity and potential to host habitable planets. The discovery of millimeter flares from this M dwarf with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) has opened a new window into the flaring process and the space-weather environments of exoplanets like Proxima b. Using a total of ~50 hr of ALMA observations of Proxima Cen at 1.3 mm (233 GHz), we add a new piece to the stellar flaring picture and report the first cumulative flare frequency distribution (FFD) at millimeter wavelengths of any M dwarf. We detect 463 flares ranging from energies 1024 to 1027 erg. The brightest and most energetic flare in our sample reached a flux density of 119 ± 7 mJy, increasing by a factor of 1000× the quiescent flux, and reaching an energy of 1027 erg in the ALMA bandpass, with t1/2 ≈ 16 s. From a log–log linear regression fit to the FFD, we obtain a power-law index of αFFD = 2.92 ± 0.02, much steeper than αFFD values (~2) observed at X-ray to optical wavelengths. If millimeter flare rates are predictive of flare rates at extreme-UV wavelengths, the contribution of small flares to the radiation environment of Proxima b may be much higher than expected based on the shallower power-law slopes observed at optical wavelengths.

<title>The Long-lived Broadband Afterglow of Short Gamma-Ray Burst 231117A and the Growing Radio-detected Short Gamma-Ray Burst Population</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada9e5</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada9e5</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present multiwavelength observations of the Swift short γ-ray burst GRB 231117A, localized to an underlying galaxy at redshift z = 0.257 at a small projected offset (∼2 kpc). We uncover long-lived X-ray Chandra X-ray Observatory and radio/millimeter (VLA, MeerKAT, and ALMA) afterglow emission, detected to ∼37 days and ∼20 days (rest frame), respectively. We measure a wide jet (∼10 4) and relatively high circumburst density (∼0.07 cm−3) compared to the short GRB population. Our data cannot be easily fit with a standard forward shock model, but they are generally well fit with the incorporation of a refreshed forward shock and a reverse shock at <1 day. We incorporate GRB 231117A into a larger sample of 132 X-ray detected events, 71 of which were radio-observed (17 cm-band detections), for a systematic study of the distributions of redshifts, jet and afterglow properties, galactocentric offsets, and local environments of events with and without detected radio afterglows. Compared to the entire short GRB population, the majority of radio-detected GRBs are at relatively low redshifts (z < 0.6) and have high circumburst densities (>10−2 cm−3), consistent with their smaller (<8 kpc) projected galactocentric offsets. We additionally find that 70% of short GRBs with opening angle measurements were radio-detected, indicating the importance of radio afterglows in jet measurements, especially in the cases of wide (>10°) jets where observational evidence of collimation may only be detectable at radio wavelengths. Owing to improved observing strategies and the emergence of sensitive radio facilities, the number of radio-detected short GRBs has quadrupled in the past decade.

<title>An X-Ray View of the Cataclysmic Variable V902 Mon: Discovery of an X-Ray Eclipse</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb4f1</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb4f1</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
V902 Mon is one of a few eclipsing intermediate polars (IPs) and shows deep eclipses in the optical lightcurves. The presence of a strong Fe Kα fluorescence line in its X-ray spectrum and its low X-ray flux compared to other IPs suggests significant absorption, most likely from an accretion disk. In an observation carried out using the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR), we confirm the presence of an X-ray eclipse in the energy-resolved lightcurves, coincident with the optical AAVSO/CV-band lightcurves. Broadband X-ray spectral analysis using NuSTAR and XMM-Newton observations confirm a strong absorption NH ∼ 1023 cm−2 local to the source, along with a high equivalent width of about 0.7 keV for an Fe Kα fluorescence line. We interpret this using a model similar to an accretion disk corona source, which has a very high inclination, and the compact object is heavily obscured by the body of the accretion disk. We propose that the primary X-rays from the accretion column in V902 Mon are hidden from our direct view at all times by the accretion disk. In this scenario, the observed scattered X-rays indicate substantial absorption of direct X-rays by the accretion disk. Additionally, a strong Fe fluorescence line suggests reprocessing of the radiation by a more extended region, such as the pre-shock region, which could be located a few white dwarf radii above the orbital plane.

<title>Beyond the Goldilocks Zone: Identifying Critical Features in Massive Black Hole Formation</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb4f7</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Most galaxies, including the Milky Way, host a supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the center. These SMBHs can be observed out to high redshifts (z ≥ 6) if the accretion rate is sufficiently large. However, we do not fully understand the mechanism through which these black holes form at early times. The heavy (or direct collapse) seeding mechanism has emerged as a probable contender in which the core of an atomic cooling halo directly collapses into a dense stellar cluster that could host supermassive stars that proceed to form a black hole seed of mass ∼ 105M⊙. We use the Renaissance Simulations to investigate the properties of 35 direct collapse black hole (DCBH) candidate host halos at z = 15–24 and compare them to noncandidate halos. We aim to understand what features differentiate halos capable of hosting a DCBH from the general halo population with the use of statistical analysis and machine learning methods. We examine 18 halo, central, and environmental properties. We find that DCBH candidacy is more dependent on a halo’s core internal properties than on exterior factors such as Lyman–Werner (LW) flux and distance to the closest galaxy; our analysis selects density and radial mass influx as the most important features (outside candidacy establishing features). Our results concur with the recent suggestion that DCBH host halos neither need to lie within a “Goldilocks zone” nor have a significant amount of LW flux to suppress cooling. This paper presents insight to the dynamics possibly occurring in potential DCBH host halos and seeks to provide guidance to DCBH subgrid formation models.

<title>Dynamical Models of the Milky Way in Action Space with LAMOST DR8 and Gaia EDR3</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work explores dynamical models of the Milky Way (MW) by analyzing a sample of 86,109 K giant stars selected through cross-matching the LAMOST DR8 and Gaia EDR3 surveys. Our earlier torus models of Q. Wang et al. did not include Gaia data, making them incompatible with the new sample’s proper motion distributions. Here, we refine the construction of action-based, self-consistent models to constrain the three-dimensional velocity distribution of K giants over a larger parameter space, drawing on a series of existing MW models. This approach produces several new MW models. Our best-fit model for the local kinematics near the Sun indicates an MW virial mass of 1.35 × 1012 M⊙, a local stellar density of 0.0696 M⊙ pc−3, and a local dark matter density of 0.0115 M⊙ pc−3. Our main conclusion supports a thicker and more extended thick disk, alongside a cooler thin disk, compared to the best-fitting model of Q. Wang et al. Near the Sun, our model aligns well with observations, but it is less satisfactory at distances far from the Galactic center, perhaps implying unidentified structures. Further high-precision observations will be critical for understanding the dynamics in these outer Galactic regions and will require a more realistic model.

<title>Evidence for an Accretion Bridge in the DX Cha Circumbinary System from VLTI/MATISSE Observations*</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
DX Cha (HD 104237) is a spectroscopic binary consisting of a Herbig A7.5Ve–A8Ve primary star and a K3-type companion. Here we report on new 3.55 μm interferometric observations of this source with the Multi Aperture Mid-Infrared Spectroscopic Experiment (MATISSE) at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer. To model the four MATISSE observations obtained between 2020 and 2023, we constructed a time-dependent interferometric model of the system, using the oimodeler software. The model consists of an asymmetric ring and two point sources on a Keplerian orbit. Our best-fit model consists of a circumbinary ring with a diameter of 0.86 au (8.1 mas), featuring a strong azimuthal asymmetry. We found that the position angle of the asymmetry changes tens of degrees between the MATISSE epochs. The ring is relatively narrow, with a full width at half-maximum of ∼0.13 au (1.23 mas). The presence of circumstellar dust emission so close to the binary is unexpected, as previous hydrodynamic simulations predicted an inner disk cavity with a diameter of ∼4 au (∼37.5 mas). Thus, we argue that the narrow envelope of material we detected is probably not a gravitationally stable circumbinary ring but may be part of tidal accretion streamers channeling material from the inner edge of the disk toward the stars.

<title>Estimation of Transit Time of CMEs from the Sun to Earth</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb84b</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) can cause severe geomagnetic storms on Earth, making it essential to forecast their arrival. However, predicting the transit time (TT) of Earth-directed CMEs is challenging due to the complex factors involved, such as CME dynamics, the state of the interplanetary medium, and CME interactions. Our goal is to predict the TT of Earth-directed CMEs without relying on computationally expensive methods. CMEs observed from L1 are significantly affected by projection effects, which underestimate their speed and overestimate their size and mass. To address this, we use the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) to study the kinematics of halo and partial halo CMEs in quadrature and near-quadrature configurations. We analyzed a data set of 44 Earth-directed CMEs, dividing it into two categories: 25 CMEs in STEREO’s quadrature field of view (FOV) and 19 CMEs in the near-quadrature FOV. Three different proxies were used to prepare empirical models for estimating TT. Our findings indicate that, for the considered sample of events, the empirical model based on the maximum speed of CMEs observed in STEREO’s FOV yields the most accurate TT estimates. Our model achieved a maximum error of 16.46 hr and a mean error of 7.25 hr in estimating the TT of 44 Earth-directed CMEs.

<title>Scylla. IV. Intrinsic Stellar Properties and Line-of-sight Dust Extinction Measurements toward 1.5 Million Stars in the SMC and LMC</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
By analyzing the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of resolved stars in nearby galaxies, we can constrain their stellar properties and line-of-sight dust extinction. From the Scylla survey, we obtain ultraviolet to near-infrared photometry from Wide Field Camera 3 on board the Hubble Space Telescope for more than 1.5 million stars in the SMC and LMC. We use the Bayesian Extinction and Stellar Tool (BEAST) to analyze the multiband SEDs of these sources and characterize their initial masses, ages, metallicities, distances, and line-of-sight extinction properties (e.g., AV, RV). We apply quality cuts and perform validation simulations to construct a catalog of over 550,000 stars with high-reliability SED fits, which we use to analyze the stellar content and extinction properties of the SMC and LMC. We detect stars with masses as low as 0.6 M⊙. BEAST stellar age distributions show a jump in observed stars around 6 Gyr ago, which agrees with star formation histories. Extinctions (AV) in both galaxies follow a log-normal distribution. We compare AV with ancillary gas and dust tracers like H i, Hα, and far-infrared (FIR) dust emission and find positive correlations on a field-by-field basis. We convert observed AV to predicted dust surface densities using the Draine et al. model and find AV-based dust surface densities are a factor of ∼2.5 lower than observed FIR-based dust surface densities, a correction factor similar to other studies.

<title>A Search for Low-frequency Radio Pulses from Long Gamma-Ray Bursts with the Murchison Widefield Array</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
It has been proposed that coherent radio emission could be emitted during or shortly following a gamma-ray burst (GRB). Here we present a low-frequency (170–200 MHz) search for radio pulses associated with long-duration GRBs using the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). The MWA, with its rapid-response system, is capable of performing GRB follow-up observations within approximately 30 s. Our single pulse search, with temporal and spectral resolutions of 100 μs and 10 kHz, covers dispersion measures up to 5000 pc cm−3. Two single pulse candidates are identified with significance greater than 6σ, surviving a friends-of-friends analysis. We rule out random fluctuations as their origin at a confidence level of 97% (2.2σ). We caution that radio frequency interference from digital TV (DTV) is most likely the origin of these pulses since the DTV frequency bands almost cover the entire observing frequency band. If they are astrophysical signals, we estimate the peak flux densities for our pulse candidates of 3.6 ± 0.6 and 10.5 ± 1.5 Jy, with corresponding fluences of 431 ± 74 and 211 ± 37 Jy ms, respectively. Based on these observations and the assumption of a magnetar origin for the pulse, we constrain the radio emission efficiency as ϵr ∼ 10−3 for both candidates, which is consistent with pulsar observations. Our results highlight the promising potential of new-generation radio telescopes such as the MWA to probe the central engines of GRBs.

We present the results of deep Hubble Space Telescope photometry of the dwarf galaxy DDO 68-C, proposed as possibly associated with the isolated peculiar dwarf DDO 68. The new data resolve for the first time the stars of DDO 68-C down to well below the tip of the red giant branch (RGB), revealing a low-mass (M⋆ ≃ 1.5 × 107 M⊙) star-forming galaxy with a backbone of old stars. By means of a fully homogeneous analysis and using the RGB tip as a standard candle, we find that DDO 68 and DDO 68-C lie at the same distance from us, within the uncertainties (D = 12.6 ± 0.3 Mpc and D = 12.7 ± 0.4 Mpc, respectively), thus confirming that the two dwarfs are physically associated. While paired dwarf galaxies with a mutual projected distance similar to DDO 68 and DDO 68-C are not exceptional in the Lynx-Cancer void where they live, DDO 68 remains a unicum as, in addition to the newly confirmed companion, it records the evidence of at least two other satellites.

<title>Revisiting the Galactic Winds in M82. II. Development of Multiphase Outflows in Simulations</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada38c</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We performed a suit of three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with a resolution of ~10 pc to investigate the development of multiphase galactic wind in M82. The star formation and related feedback processes are solved self-consistently using a sink particle method, rather than relying on various assumptions that were used in previous studies. Our simulations produce a starburst event lasting around 25 Myr, which has a total stellar mass of 1.62–3.34 × 108M⊙, consistent with observational estimates. The total injected supernova energy is between 1.14 × 1057 and 2.4 × 1057 erg. Supernova feedback heats portions of the cool gas in the central disk to warm and hot phases, and then drives the gas in all three phases out, eventually forming multiphase outflows. These outflows can replicate key properties of the winds observed in M82, such as morphology, mass outflow rates of cool and hot phases, and X-ray emission flux, provided the gas return from star-forming clumps to the diffuse interstellar medium is implemented appropriately. The maximum mass outflow rate of all gas (hot) is about 6–12 (2–3) M⊙ yr−1 at r ~ 4.0 kpc, corresponding to a mass loading factor of 2–4. However, the outflow velocities in our simulations are slower than observational estimates by ~20%–60%. The gas return process significantly influences the outflow properties, while the initial gas distribution in the nuclear region has a moderate effect. Yet, our results face some challenges in achieving convergence as the resolution increases. We discuss potential improvements to address these issues in future work.

<title>Quenching and Recovery of Persistent X-Ray Emission during a Superburst in 4U 1820–30</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb726</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report the superburst from 4U 1820–30 in 2021 observed by the Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image and Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER). During the tail of the superburst, we found that the NICER light curve unexpectedly increased from 1080 to 2204 counts s−1 over 6.89 hr. From the time-resolved superburst spectra, we estimated the burst decay time of ≈2.5 hr, the ignition column depth of ≈0.3 × 1012 g cm−2, the energy release per unit mass of ≈2.4 × 1017 erg g−1, the fluence of ≈4.1 × 10−4 erg cm−2, and the total energy release of ≈3.5 × 1042 erg. Notably, we found a gradual increase in the Comptonization flux from 8.9 × 10−10 erg s−1 cm−2 to the preburst level during the superburst. This increase can be interpreted as a consequence of superburst radiation depleting the inner accretion disk, leading to a near-complete quenching of the persistent emission. As the burst radiation decayed, the inner accretion disk gradually returned to its preburst state, as evidenced by the best-fit spectral parameters. Additionally, we observed a prominent absorption line that exhibited a gravitational redshift, shifting from 4.15 to 3.62 keV during the recovery phase of persistent emission. This absorption feature likely originates from the inner accretion disk rather than from burst emission on the neutron star (NS) surface. The observed changes in the absorption line energy suggest that the inner disk approached the NS to a distance as close as ≈17 km.

<title>On the Average Ultraviolet Emission-line Spectra of High-redshift Galaxies: Hot and Cold, Carbon-poor, Nitrogen Modest, and Oozing Ionizing Photons</title>

We determine the spectroscopic properties of ≃1000 ostensibly star-forming galaxies at redshifts (z = 4–10) using prism spectroscopy from JWST/NIRSpec. With rest-wavelength coverage between Lyα and [S ii] in the optical, we stack spectra as a function of nebular conditions, and compare UV spectral properties with stellar age. This reveals UV lines of N iii], N iv], C iii], C iv, He ii, and O iii] in the average high-z galaxy. All of the UV lines are more intense in younger starbursts. We measure electron temperatures from the collisionally excited [O iii] line ratios, finding Te = 18,000–22,000 K for the O++ regions. We also detect a significant nebular Balmer jump, from which we estimate only Te = 8000–13,000 K. Accounting for typical temperature offsets between zones bearing doubly and singly ionized oxygen, these two temperatures remain discrepant by around 40%. We use the [O iii] temperatures to estimate abundances of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. We find that log(C/O) is consistently ≃ −1, with no evolution of C/O with metallicity or stellar age. The average spectra are mildly enhanced in nitrogen, with higher N/O than low-z starbursts, but are less enhanced than samples of recently reported, high-z, extreme galaxies that show N iii] and N iv] emission in the UV. Whatever processes produce the N-enhancement in the individual galaxies must also be ongoing, at lower levels, in the median galaxy in the early Universe. The strongest starbursts are a source of significant ionizing emission: ionizing photon production efficiencies reach 1025.7 Hz erg−1, and show multiple signatures of high Lyman continuum escape, including Mg ii escape fractions nearing 100%, significant deficits in [S ii] emission, high degrees of ionization, and blue UV colors.

We report a search for high-energy astrophysical neutrino multiplets, detections of multiple neutrino clusters in the same direction within 30 days, based on an analysis of 11.4 yr of IceCube data. A new search method optimized for transient neutrino emission with a monthly timescale is employed, providing a higher sensitivity to neutrino fluxes. This result is sensitive to neutrino transient emission, reaching per-flavor flux of approximately from the Northern Sky in the energy range E ≳ 50 TeV. The number of doublets and triplets identified in this search is compatible with the atmospheric background hypothesis, which leads us to set limits on the nature of neutrino transient sources with emission timescales of one month.

<title>Relight the Candle: What Happens to High-redshift Massive Quenched Galaxies</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8b4b</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A puzzling population of extremely massive quiescent galaxies at redshifts beyond z = 3 has recently been revealed by JWST and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, some of them with stellar ages that show their quenching times to be as high as z = 6, while their stellar masses are already above 5 × 1010 M⊙. These extremely massive yet quenched galaxies challenge our understanding of galaxy formation at the earliest stages. Using the hydrodynamical cosmological simulation suite Magneticum Pathfinder, we show that such massive quenched galaxies at high redshifts can be successfully reproduced with similar number densities as observed. The stellar masses, sizes, formation redshifts, and star formation histories of the simulated quenched galaxies match those determined with JWST. Following these quenched galaxies at z = 3.4 forward in time, we find 20% to be accreted onto a more massive structure by z = 2, and from the remaining 80% about 30% rejuvenate up to z = 2, another 30% stay quenched, and the remaining 40% rejuvenate on a very low level of star formation. Stars formed through rejuvenation are mostly formed on the outer regions of the galaxies, not in the centers. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the massive quenched galaxies do not reside in the most massive nodes of the cosmic web, but rather live in side nodes of approximately Milky Way halo mass. Even at z = 0, only about 10% end up in small-mass galaxy clusters, while most of the quenched galaxies at z = 3.4 end up in group-mass halos, with about 20% actually not even reaching 1013 M⊙ in halo mass.

<title>The Response of Planetary Atmospheres to the Impact of Icy Comets. I. Tidally Locked Exo-Earths</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Impacts by rocky and icy bodies are thought to have played a key role in shaping the composition of solar system objects, including the Earth’s habitability. Hence, it is likely that they play a similar role in exoplanetary systems. We investigate how an icy cometary impact affects the atmospheric chemistry, climate, and composition of an Earth-like, tidally locked, terrestrial exoplanet, a prime target in the search for a habitable exoplanet beyond our solar system. We couple a cometary impact model, which includes thermal ablation and pressure driven breakup, with the 3D Earth system model WACCM6/CESM2 and use this model to investigate the effects of the water and thermal energy delivery associated with an R = 2.5 km pure water ice cometary impact on an Earth-like atmosphere. We find that water is the primary driver of longer timescale changes to the atmospheric chemistry and composition by acting as a source of opacity, cloud ice, and atmospheric hydrogen/oxygen. The water opacity drives heating at ∼5 × 10−4 bar and cooling below, due to a decreased flux reaching the surface. The increase in atmospheric hydrogen and oxygen also drives an increase in the abundance of hydrogen/oxygen-rich molecules, with the exception of ozone, whose column density decreases by ∼10%. These atmospheric changes are potentially observable for ∼1–2 yr postimpact, particularly those associated with cloud ice scattering. They also persist, albeit at a much reduced level, to our quasi–steady state, suggesting that sustained bombardment or multiple large impacts have the potential to shape the composition and habitability of terrestrial exoplanets.

<title>The Physical Origin of Extreme Emission Line Galaxies at High Redshifts: Strong [O iii] Emission Lines Produced by Obscured Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adaf1b</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present deep Subaru/FOCAS spectra for two extreme emission line galaxies (EELGs) at z ∼ 1 with strong [O iii] λ5007 emission lines, exhibiting equivalent widths (EWs) of Å and Å, comparable to those of EELGs at high redshifts that are now routinely identified with JWST spectroscopy. Adding a similarly large [O iii] EW ( Å) EELG found at z ∼ 2 in the JWST CEERS survey to our sample, we explore the physical origins of the large [O iii] EWs of these three galaxies with the Subaru spectra and various public data including JWST/NIRSpec, NIRCam, and MIRI data. While there are no clear signatures of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) identified by the optical line diagnostics, we find that two out of two galaxies covered by the MIRI data show strong near-infrared excess in the spectral energy distributions (SEDs), indicating obscured AGNs. Because none of the three galaxies show clear broad Hβ lines, the upper limits on the flux ratios of broad Hβ to [O iii] lines are small, ≲0.15 that are comparable with Seyfert 1.8–2.0 galaxies. We conduct Cloudy modeling with the stellar and AGN incident spectra, allowing a wide range of parameters, including metallicities and ionization parameters. We find that the large [O iii] EWs are not self-consistently reproduced by the spectra of stars or unobscured AGNs, but obscured AGNs that efficiently produce O++ ionizing photons with weak nuclear and stellar continua that are consistent with the SED shapes.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The Virgo Cluster is the nearest substantial cluster of galaxies to the Milky Way and a cornerstone of the extragalactic distance scale. Here, we present JWST/NIRCam observations that simultaneously cover the cores and halos of 10 galaxies in and around the Virgo Cluster and are designed to perform simultaneous measurements of the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) and surface brightness fluctuations (SBF). Seven of the targets are within the Virgo Cluster and where we are able to resolve some of the cluster’s substructure, while an additional three provide important constraints on Virgo infall. The seven galaxies within Virgo itself all have SBF measurements from the Advanced Camera for Surveys Virgo Cluster Survey (ACSVCS). After adjusting the ACSVCS measurements for the offset from our new JWST TRGB measurements, we determine a distance to the Virgo Cluster of d = 16.17 ± 0.25 (stat) ± 0.47 (sys) Mpc. The work presented here is part of a larger program to develop a Population II distance scale through the TRGB and SBF that is completely independent of the prominent Cepheid + Type Ia supernova ladder. The TRGB distances to the galaxies presented here, when combined with future SBF measurements, will provide a crucial step forward for determining whether or not systematic errors can explain the well-known “Hubble tension” or if there is significant evidence for cracks in the ΛCDM model.

<title>Accretion-disk Reflection in the Seyfert 1 Galaxy NGC 3783 as Viewed by Chandra Grating Spectroscopy</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In active galactic nuclei, X-ray illumination of the accretion disk around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) results in the production of the Kα fluorescent line of iron, which provides insights into accretion physics and SMBH spins. In this work, we studied X-ray reflection from the accretion disk in the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 3783 using all the data collected by the Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer. We used hardness-ratio diagrams to distinguish between different spectral states and conducted spectral analysis of all the multiepoch data sets, as well as the source in the observed spectral states. Our hardness analysis indicates that the source gradually evolved into a harder state (2013–2016) compared to the previous epochs (2000–2001). Our spectral modeling implies that the relativistically broadened iron emission from the innermost accretion disk is associated with a near-maximal SMBH spin ( ) in all the data sets, even though the hard state was present in 17% of them, and a consistent spin is also found in different spectral states. In addition, the narrow, bright Fe Kα line from distant regions has an excess velocity of km s−1 relative to the rest frame, implying that some distant layers of the disk could be twisted. Our results suggest that, despite long-term changes in the X-ray brightness of NGC 3783, likely caused by eclipsing material, the relativistic reflection can be constrained thanks to the substantial counts provided by the multiepoch observations, while a warped disk structure may be present.

<title>The Molecular Cloud Life Cycle. I. Constraining H2 Formation and Dissociation Rates with Observations</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb3a6</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb3a6</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Molecular clouds (MCs) are the birthplaces of new stars in galaxies. A key component of MCs are photodissociation regions (PDRs), where far-ultraviolet radiation plays a crucial role in determining the gas’s physical and chemical state. Traditional PDR models assume a chemical steady state (CSS), where the rates of H2 formation and photodissociation are balanced. However, real MCs are dynamic and can be out of CSS. In this study, we demonstrate that combining H2 emission lines observed in the far-ultraviolet or infrared with column density observations can be used to derive the rates of H2 formation and photodissociation. We derive analytical formulae that relate these rates to observable quantities, which we validate using synthetic H2 line emission maps derived from the SILCC-Zoom hydrodynamical simulation. Our method estimates integrated H2 formation and dissociation rates with an accuracy ≈30% (on top of the uncertainties in the observed H2 emission maps and column densities). Our simulations, valid for column densities N ≤ 2 × 1022 cm−2, cover a wide dynamic range of H2 formation and photodissociation rates, showing significant deviations from CSS, with 74% of the MC’s mass deviating from CSS by a factor greater than 2. Our analytical formulae can effectively distinguish between regions in and out of CSS. When applied to actual H2 line observations, our method can assess the chemical states of MCs, providing insights into their evolutionary stages and lifetimes. A NASA Small Explorer mission concept, Eos, will be proposed in 2025 and is specifically designed to conduct the types of observations outlined in this study.

<title>On the Significance of Rare Objects at High Redshift: The Impact of Cosmic Variance</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb422</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb422</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The discovery of extremely luminous galaxies at ultra-high redshifts (z ≳ 8) has challenged galaxy formation models. Most analyses of this tension have not accounted for the variance due to field-to-field clustering, which causes the number counts of galaxies to vary greatly in excess of Poisson noise. This super-Poissonian variance is often referred to as cosmic variance. Since cosmic variance increases rapidly as a function of mass, redshift, and smaller observing areas, the most massive objects in deep JWST surveys are severely impacted by cosmic variance. We construct a simple model, including cosmic variance, to predict the distribution of the mass of the most massive galaxy for different surveys, which increases the tension with observations. The distributions differ significantly from previous predictions using the Extreme Value Statistics formalism, changing the position and shape of the distributions. We test our model using the UniverseMachine simulations, where the predicted effects of cosmic variance are clearly identifiable. We find that the high skew in the distributions of galaxy counts for typical deep surveys imply a high statistical variance on the cosmic variance itself. This impacts the calibration of the cosmic variance, as well as the expected mass of the most massive galaxy. We also find that the impact of cosmic variance dominates the impact of any realistic scatter in the stellar-to-halo-mass relation at z ≳ 12. It is therefore crucial to accurately account for the impact of cosmic variance in any analysis of tension between early extreme galaxies and galaxy formation models.

<title>VODKA-JWST: Synchronized Growth of Two Supermassive Black Holes in a Massive Gas Disk? A 3.8 kpc Separation Dual Quasar at Cosmic Noon with the NIRSpec Integral Field Unit</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The search for dual supermassive black holes (SMBHs) is of immense interest in modern astrophysics. Galaxy mergers may fuel and produce SMBH pairs. Actively accreting SMBH pairs are observed as dual quasars, which are vital probes of SMBH growth. Dual quasars at cosmic noon are not well characterized. Gaia observations have enabled a novel technique to identify dual quasars at kiloparsec scales based on the small jitters of the light centroid as the two quasars vary stochastically. We present the first detailed study of a z = 2.17, 0 46, 3.8 kpc separation dual quasar, J0749+2255, using JWST/NIRSpec integral field unit spectroscopy. Identified by Gaia, J0749+2255 is one of the most distant small-separation dual quasars known. We detect the faint ionized gas of the host galaxy, traced by the narrow Hα emission. Line ratios indicate ionization from the two quasars and from intense star formation. Spectral analysis of the two quasars suggests that they have similar black hole properties, hinting at the possible synchronized accretion activity or lensed quasar images. Surprisingly, the ionized gas kinematics suggest a rotating disk rather than the disturbed system expected in a major gas-rich galaxy merger. Numerical simulations show that this is a plausible outcome of a major gas-rich galaxy merger several tens of Myr before coalescence. Whether J0749+2255 reflects an interesting phase of dual quasar evolution or is a lensed quasar remains unclear. Thus, this study underscores the challenges in definitively distinguishing between dual and lensed quasars, with observations supporting either scenario.

<title>Application of Resolved Low-J Multi-CO Line Modeling with RADEX to Constrain the Molecular Gas Properties in the Starburst M82</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The distribution and physical conditions of molecular gas are closely linked to star formation and the subsequent evolution of galaxies. Emission from carbon monoxide (CO) and its isotopologues traces the bulk of molecular gas and provides constraints on the physical conditions through their line ratios. However, a comprehensive understanding of how the particular choice of line modeling approach impacts derived molecular properties remains incomplete. Here, we study the nearby starburst galaxy M82, known for its intense star formation and molecular emission, using the large set of available multi-CO line observations. We present high-resolution (∼85 pc) emission of seven CO isotopologue lines, including 12CO, 13CO, and C18O from the J = 1–0, 2–1, and 3–2 transitions. Using RADEX for radiative transfer modeling, we analyze M82’s molecular properties with (i) a one-zone model and (ii) a variable density model, comparing observed and simulated emissions via a minimum χ2 analysis. We find that inferred gas conditions—kinetic temperature and density—are consistent across models, with minimal statistical differences. However, due to their low critical densities (<104 cm−3), low-J CO isotopologue lines do not effectively probe higher-density gas prevalent in starburst environments like that of M82. Our results further imply that this limitation extends to high-redshift (z ⪆ 1) galaxies with similar conditions, where low-J CO lines are inadequate for density constraints. Future studies of extreme star-forming regions like M82 will require higher-J CO lines or alternative molecular tracers with higher critical densities.

<title>The Initial-to-final Mass Relation of White Dwarfs in Intermediate-separation Binaries</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb5f2</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb5f2</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We examine the applicability of the initial-to-final mass relation (IFMR) for white dwarfs (WDs) in intermediate-separation binary systems (∼1 au), using astrometric binaries identified in open clusters from Gaia DR3. A careful analysis of the astrometric orbits and spectral energy distributions isolates 33 main-sequence (MS) stars with highly likely WD companions. By combining cluster age estimates, dynamically measured WD masses, and, where available, WD cooling temperatures, we derive progenitor masses for 26 WD candidates. Our analysis suggests the presence of two distinct WD populations: (i) low-mass WDs, likely shaped by binary interactions during the progenitor’s red giant phase; and (ii) “spender” WDs, which experienced higher-than-expected mass loss and have progenitor masses above the IFMR predictions. The rest of the candidates, referred to as the “others,” represent systems with inconclusive formation mechanisms. We suggest that at least some of these systems might be hierarchical triples, where the companion to the MS is a double WD or a double-WD merger product. However, follow-up studies are required to determine the nature of each case. These results highlight significant deviations from the IFMR derived for isolated WDs, emphasizing the role of binary evolution. Follow-up observations, particularly in the far-ultraviolet, are crucial for refining these findings and advancing our understanding of mass transfer processes and binary evolution pathways.

<title>Signature of Strange Star as the Central Engine of GRB 240529A</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb711</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb711</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
GRB 240529A is a long-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB) whose light curve of prompt emission is composed of a triple-episode structure, separated by quiescent gaps of tens to hundreds of seconds. More interestingly, its X-ray light curve of afterglow exhibits two plateau emissions, namely, an internal plateau emission that is smoothly connected with a ∼t−0.1 segment and followed by a ∼t−2 power-law decay. The three episodes in the prompt emission, together with two plateau emissions in X-ray, are unique in the Swift era. They are very difficult to explain with the standard internal/external shock model by invoking a black hole central engine. However, it could be consistent with the prediction of a supramassive magnetar as the central engine, the physical process of phase transition from a magnetar to a strange star, as well as the cooling and spin-down of the strange star. In this paper, we propose that the first- and second-episode emissions in the prompt gamma ray of GRB 240529A are from the jet emission of a massive star collapsing into a supramassive magnetar and the reactivity of the central engine, respectively. Then, the third-episode emission of the prompt is attributed to the phase transition from a magnetar to a strange star. Finally, the first and second plateau emissions of the X-ray afterglow are powered by the cooling and spin-down of the strange star, respectively. The observational data of each component of GRB 240529A are roughly coincident with the estimations of the above physical picture.

Exoplanet research has moved from the discovery of new classes of planets toward creating a census of exoplanet population demographics across the spectrum of exoplanet and host star masses. This census will constrain possible exoplanet formation and evolution theories. Direct imaging and ground-based microlensing surveys excel at detecting long-period exoplanets. The Roman Space Telescope microlensing survey (RMS) will help complete the census by possibly discovering hundreds of long-period and free-floating exoplanets. Long-period gas giants are difficult to form by the classic core-accretion mechanism, whereas the gas disk gravitational instability (GDGI) mechanism can form gas giants at distances of 10 au and beyond for AFGKM host stars. The Enzo 2.6 adaptive mesh refinement three-dimensional hydrodynamics code is used to model the formation of gas giant protoplanets by GDGI around solar-mass protostars, for future comparison with the RMS, which will provide convincing evidence about whether GDGI is needed to explain exoplanet demographics. Previous Enzo models have shown that a robust GDGI is able to form enough gas giants in a single system to result in the ejection of a significant fraction within ∼2000 yr, a likely source of free-floating exoplanets. The present models investigate the GDGI outcomes for a larger range of initial protoplanetary disk masses and outer disk temperatures than in the previous work of A. P. Boss, resulting in the formation of abundant substellar companions with masses in the range of ∼0.1 to ∼100 MJup on orbits ranging from ∼3 to ∼30 au.

<title>Unsupervised Machine Learning for Classifying CHIME Fast Radio Bursts and Investigating Empirical Relations</title>

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are highly energetic millisecond-duration astrophysical phenomena typically categorized as repeaters or nonrepeaters. However, observational limitations may result in misclassifications, potentially leading to a higher proportion of repeaters than currently identified. In this study, we leverage unsupervised machine learning techniques to classify FRBs using data from the CHIME/FRB catalogs, including both the first catalog and a recent repeater catalog. By employing Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for dimensionality reduction and clustering algorithms (k-means and Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise), we successfully segregate repeaters and nonrepeaters into distinct clusters, identifying over 100 potential repeater candidates. Our analysis reveals several empirical relations within the clusters, including the , , and r–γ correlations, where Δtsc, Δtrw, TB, r, and γ represent the scattering time, rest-frame width, brightness temperature, spectral running, and spectral index, respectively. The Chow test results reveal that while some repeaters and nonrepeaters share similar empirical relationships, the overall distinctions between the two groups remain significant, reinforcing the classification of FRBs into repeaters and nonrepeaters. These findings provide new insights into the physical properties and emission mechanisms of FRBs. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of unsupervised learning in classifying FRBs and identifying potential repeaters, paving the way for more precise investigations into their origins and applications in cosmology. Future improvements in observational data and machine learning methodologies are expected to further enhance our understanding of FRBs.

<title>Measurement and Modeling of Polarized Atmosphere at the South Pole with SPT-3G</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada35d</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the detection and characterization of fluctuations in linearly polarized emission from the atmosphere above the South Pole. These measurements make use of data from the SPT-3G receiver on the South Pole Telescope in three frequency bands centered at 95, 150, and 220 GHz. We use the cross-correlation between detectors to produce an unbiased estimate of the power in Stokes I, Q, and U parameters on large angular scales. Our results are consistent with the polarized signal being produced by the combination of Rayleigh scattering of thermal radiation from the ground and thermal emission from a population of horizontally aligned ice crystals with an anisotropic distribution described by Kolmogorov turbulence. The measured spatial scaling, frequency scaling, and elevation dependence of the polarized emission are explained by this model. Polarized atmospheric emission has the potential to significantly impact observations on the large angular scales being targeted by searches for inflationary B-mode CMB polarization. We present the distribution of measured angular power spectrum amplitudes in Stokes Q and I for 4 yr of Austral winter observations, which can be used to simulate the impact of atmospheric polarization and intensity fluctuations at the South Pole on a specified experiment and observation strategy. We present a mitigation strategy that involves both downweighting significantly contaminated observations and subtracting a polarized atmospheric signal from the 150 GHz band maps. In observations with the SPT-3G instrument, the polarized atmospheric signal is a well-understood and subdominant contribution to the measured noise after implementing the mitigation strategies described here.

<title>Tripling the Census of Dwarf AGN Candidates Using DESI Early Data</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb1dd</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb1dd</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Using early data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey, we search for active galactic nuclei (AGN) signatures in 410,757 line-emitting galaxies. By employing the BPT emission-line ratio diagnostic diagram, we identify AGNs in 75,928/296,261 (≈25.6%) high-mass ( 9.5) and 2444/114,496 (≈2.1%) dwarf ( 9.5) galaxies. Of these AGN candidates, 4181 sources exhibit a broad Hα component, allowing us to estimate their BH masses via virial techniques. This study more than triples the census of dwarf AGNs and doubles the number of intermediate-mass black hole (MBH ≤ 106M⊙) candidates, spanning a broad discovery space in stellar mass (7 12) and redshift (0.001 < 0.45). The observed AGN fraction in dwarf galaxies (≈2.1%) is nearly four times higher than prior estimates, primarily due to DESI’s smaller fiber size, which enables the detection of lower-luminosity dwarf AGN candidates. We also extend the MBH–M⋆ scaling relation down to 8.5 and 4.4, with our results aligning well with previous low-redshift studies. The large statistical sample of dwarf AGN candidates from current and future DESI releases will be invaluable for enhancing our understanding of galaxy evolution at the low-mass end of the galaxy mass function.

<title>Baryon Acoustic Oscillations Analyses with Density-split Statistics</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb4f0</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Accurate modeling for the evolution of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) is essential for using it as a standard ruler to probe cosmology. We explore the nonlinearity of the BAO in different environments using the density-split statistics and compare them to the case of the conventional two-point correlation function (2PCF). We detect density-dependent shifts for the position of the BAO with respect to its linear version using halos from N-body simulations. Around low/high-densities, the scale of the BAO expands/contracts due to nonlinear peculiar velocities. As the simulation evolves from redshift 1 to 0, the difference in the magnitude of the shifts between high- and low-dense regions increases from the subpercent to the percent level. The width of the BAO around high density regions increases as the universe evolves, similar to the known broadening of the BAO in the 2PCF due to nonlinear evolution. In contrast, the width is smaller and stable for low density regions. We discuss possible implications for the reconstructions of the BAO in light of our results.

<title>Propagation of Waves in Weakly Ionized Two-fluid Plasmas. I. Small-amplitude Alfvénic Waves</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb713</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The large abundance of electrically neutral particles has a remarkable impact on the dynamics of many astrophysical plasmas. Here, we use a two-fluid model that includes charge-neutral elastic collisions and Hall’s current to study the propagation of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves in weakly ionized plasmas. We derive the dispersion relation for small-amplitude incompressible transverse waves propagating along the background magnetic field. Then, we focus on the polarization relations fulfilled by the eigenmodes and their corresponding ratios of magnetic to kinetic energies, and we study their dependence on the relations between the oscillation, collision, and cyclotron frequencies. For low wave frequencies, the two components of the plasma are strongly coupled, the damping due to the charge-neutral interaction is weak, and the effect of Hall’s term is negligible. However, as the wave frequency increases, phase shifts between the velocity of charges, the velocity of neutrals, and the magnetic field appear, leading to enhanced damping. The effect of collisions on the propagation of waves strongly depends on their polarization state, with the left-handed circularly polarized ion-cyclotron modes being more efficiently damped than the linearly polarized Alfvén waves and the right-handed circularly polarized whistler modes. Moreover, the equipartition relation between the magnetic energy and the kinetic energy of Alfvén waves does not hold in general when the collisional interaction and Hall’s current are taken into account, with the magnetic energy usually dominating over the kinetic energy. This theoretical result extends previous findings from observational and numerical works about turbulence in astrophysical scenarios.

<title>Analytical Insights into Inaccurate Normal Vector Determination by Minimum Variance Analysis of Magnetic Fields</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb847</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
It has been widely recognized that the minimum variance analysis of magnetic fields (MVAB) often fails to accurately predict the direction normal to a discontinuity or current sheet, compared with multiple-spacecraft methods. However, there is a lack of analytical proof to support this claim. In this paper, the accuracy of MVAB is tested using an analytical tangential and rotational discontinuity, where the exact normal is known. To evaluate the performance of MVAB, random fluctuations generated from a normal distribution, with varying magnitudes of variance ( ), are imposed on the component. Results show that the MVAB normal is misaligned with the exact normal when is comparable to or larger than . Here, is the eigenvalue of the intermediate variance direction at = 0. To achieve good accuracy, it is required that > 4.0, < 0.3, and 0.3, where and are the eigenvalues of the intermediate and minimum variance directions, and and are the variances of the magnetic field components along the normals, predicted from the MVAB with the constraint = 0 and the cross-product method, respectively, within the MVAB interval. Notably, and closely match the designated . These two variance ratios, and , are introduced for the first time as measures to assess the accuracy of MVAB. Two event studies are presented: one demonstrates an accurate MVAB normal, while the other shows an unreliable one. The accuracy of MVAB follows the criteria for the three variance ratios.

<title>An Unexplained Origin for the Unusual Globular Cluster System in the Ultradiffuse Galaxy FCC 224</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adae11</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adae11</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We study the quiescent ultradiffuse galaxy FCC 224 in the Fornax cluster using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, motivated by peculiar properties of its globular cluster (GC) system revealed in shallower imaging. The surface brightness fluctuation distance of FCC 224 measured from HST is 18.6 ± 2.7 Mpc, consistent with the Fornax cluster distance. We use Prospector to infer the stellar population from a combination of multiwavelength photometry (HST, ground-based, Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer) and Keck Cosmic Web Imager spectroscopy. The galaxy has a mass-weighted age of ∼10 Gyr, metallicity [M/H] of ∼−1.25 dex, and a very short formation e-folding time of τ ∼ 0.3 Gyr. Its 12 candidate GCs exhibit highly homogeneous g475 − I814 colors, merely 0.04 mag bluer than the diffuse starlight, which supports a single-burst formation scenario for this galaxy. We confirm a top-heavy GC luminosity function, similar to the two dark matter deficient galaxies NGC 1052-DF2 and DF4. However, FCC 224 differs from those galaxies with relatively small GC sizes of ∼3 pc (∼35% smaller than typical for other dwarfs), and with radial mass segregation in its GC system. We are not yet able to identify a formation scenario to explain all of the GC properties in FCC 224. Follow-up measurements of the dark matter content in FCC 224 will be crucial because of the mix of similarities and differences among FCC 224, DF2, and DF4.

<title>Global Turbulent Solar Convection: A Numerical Path Investigating Key Force Balances in the Context of the Convective Conundrum</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Understanding solar turbulent convection and its influence on differential rotation has been a challenge over the past two decades. Current models often overestimate giant convection cells' amplitude, leading to an effective Rossby number (Ro) too large and a shift toward an antisolar rotation regime. This convective conundrum underscores the need for improved comprehension of solar convective dynamics. We propose a numerical experiment in the parameter space that controls Ro while increasing the Reynolds number (Re) and maintaining solar parameters. By controlling the Nusselt number (Nu), we limit the energy transport by convection while reducing viscous dissipation. This approach enabled us to construct a Sun-like rotating model (SBR97n035) with strong turbulence (Re ∼ 800) that exhibits prograde equatorial rotation and aligns with observational data from helioseismology. We compare this model with an antisolar rotating counterpart and provide an in-depth spectral analysis to investigate the changes in convective dynamics. We also find the appearance of vorticity rings near the poles, whose existence on the Sun could be probed in the future. The Sun-like model shows reduced buoyancy over the spectrum, as well as an extended quasi-geostrophic equilibrium toward smaller scales. This promotes a Coriolis–inertia (CI) balance rather than a Coriolis–inertia–Archimedes (CIA) balance, in order to favor the establishment of a prograde equator. The presence of convective columns in the bulk of the convection zone, with limited surface manifestations, also hints at such structures potentially occurring in the Sun.

<title>A Data-driven M Dwarf Model and Detailed Abundances for ∼17,000 M Dwarfs in SDSS-V</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The cool temperatures of M dwarf atmospheres enable complex molecular chemistry, making robust characterization of M dwarf compositions a long-standing challenge. Recent modifications to spectral synthesis pipelines have enabled more accurate modeling of M dwarf atmospheres, but these methods are too slow for characterizing more than a handful of stars at a time. Data-driven methods such as The Cannon are viable alternatives, and can harness the information content of many M dwarfs from large spectroscopic surveys. Here, we train The Cannon on M dwarfs with FGK binary companions from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-V/Milky Way Mapper (SDSS-V/MWM), with spectra from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment. The FGK-M pairs are assumed to be chemically homogeneous and span −0.56 < [Fe/H] < 0.31 dex. The resulting model is capable of inferring M dwarf Teff and elemental abundances for Fe, Mg, Al, Si, C, N, O, Ca, Ti, Cr, and Ni with median uncertainties of 13 K and 0.018–0.029 dex, respectively. We test the model by verifying that it reproduces the reported abundance values of M dwarfs in open clusters and benchmark M dwarf data sets, as well as the expected metallicity trends from stellar evolution. We apply the model to 16,590 M dwarfs in SDSS-V/MWM and provide their detailed abundances in our accompanying catalog.

<title>Luminous Type II Short-plateau SN 2023ufx: Asymmetric Explosion of a Partially Stripped Massive Progenitor</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb0bb</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb0bb</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present supernova (SN) 2023ufx, a unique Type IIP SN with the shortest known plateau duration (tPT ∼ 47 days), a luminous V-band peak (MV = −18.42 ± 0.08 mag), and a rapid early decline rate (s1 = 3.47 ± 0.09 mag (50 days)−1). By comparing observed photometry to a hydrodynamic MESA+STELLA model grid, we constrain the progenitor to be a massive red supergiant with MZAMS ∼ 19–25 M⊙. Independent comparisons with nebular spectral models also suggest an initial He-core mass of ∼6 M⊙, and thus a massive progenitor. For a Type IIP, SN 2023ufx produced an unusually high amount of nickel (56Ni) ∼0.14 ± 0.02 M⊙, during the explosion. We find that the short plateau duration in SN 2023ufx can be explained with the presence of a small hydrogen envelope ( ∼ 1.2 M⊙), suggesting partial stripping of the progenitor. About ∼0.09 M⊙ of circumstellar material through mass loss from late-time stellar evolution of the progenitor is needed to fit the early time (≲10 days) pseudo-bolometric light curve. Nebular line diagnostics of broad and multipeak components of [O i] λλ6300, 6364, Hα, and [Ca ii] λλ7291, 7323 suggest that the explosion of SN 2023ufx could be inherently asymmetric, preferentially ejecting material along our line of sight.

<title>Diverse Rotation Curves of Galaxies in a Simulated Universe: The Observed Dependence on Stellar Mass and Morphology Reproduced</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We use the IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamical simulation to study the rotation curves of galaxies in the local universe. To do that, we first select the galaxies with 9.4 < < 11.5 to make a sample comparable to that of SDSS/MaNGA observations. We then construct the 2D line-of-sight velocity map and conduct the fit to determine the rotational velocity and the slope of the rotation curve in the outer region (Rt < r < 3 × rhalf,*). The outer slopes of the simulated galaxies show diverse patterns that are dependent on morphology and stellar mass. The outer slope increases as galaxies are more disky, and decreases as galaxies are more massive, except for the very massive early-type galaxies. The outer slope of the rotation curves shows a correlation with the dark matter fraction, slightly better than for the gas mass fraction. Our study demonstrates that the observed dependence of galaxy rotation curves on morphology and stellar mass can be successfully reproduced in cosmological simulations, and provides a hint that dark matter plays an important role in shaping the rotation curve. The sample of simulated galaxies in this study could serve as an important test bed for the subsequent study tracing galaxies back in time, enabling a deeper understanding of the physical origin behind the diverse rotation curves.

<title>A 3D Simulation of a Type II-P Supernova: From Core Bounce to beyond Shock Breakout</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In order to better connect core-collapse supernova (CCSN) theory with its observational signatures, we have developed a simulation pipeline from the onset of the core collapse to beyond shock breakout from the stellar envelope. Using this framework, we present a 3D simulation study from 5 s to over 5 days following the evolution of a 17 M⊙ progenitor, exploding with ∼1051 erg of energy and ∼0.1 M⊙ of 56Ni ejecta. The early explosion is highly asymmetric, expanding most prominently along the southern hemisphere. This early asymmetry is preserved to shock breakout, ∼1 day later. Breakout itself evinces strong angle-dependence, with as much as 1 day delay in the shock breakout by direction. The nickel ejecta closely tail the forward shock, with velocities at the breakout as high as ∼7000 km s−1. A delayed reverse shock forming at the H/He interface on hour timescales leads to the formation of Rayleigh–Taylor instabilities, fast-moving nickel bullets, and almost complete mixing of the metal core into the hydrogen envelope. For the first time, we illustrate the angle-dependent emergent broadband and bolometric light curves from simulations evolved in 3D in entirety, continuing through hydrodynamic shock breakout from a CCSN model of a massive stellar progenitor evolved with detailed, late-time neutrino microphysics and transport. Our case study of a single progenitor underscores that 3D simulations generically produce the cornucopia of observed asymmetries and features in CCSNe observations, while establishing the methodology to study this problem in breadth.

<title>Where is the Supervirial Gas? II. Insight from the Survey of Galactic Sightlines</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Recent observations have revealed a supervirial temperature gas phase at log(T/K) ∼ 7 in the Milky Way, challenging existing galaxy formation models. This hot gas phase was discovered toward extragalactic absorption sightlines and blank-sky emission fields, both at high Galactic latitudes. The location of this hot component is unknown; is it in the extended circumgalactic medium (CGM) or in the interstellar medium (ISM) instead? We analyzed X-ray spectra from Chandra’s High-Energy Transmission Grating observations of 27 Galactic X-ray binaries (XRBs) to investigate whether the hot gas component is present in the ISM. We searched for absorption lines of S xvi Kα, Si xiv Kα, and Ne x Kα, which are the telltale signatures of the hot gas and which have been detected toward extragalactic sightlines. Of the 27 targets, these lines were detected in the spectra of only 7, with two sources displaying broad line features likely intrinsic to the XRB systems. Additionally, most of the detected lines are time variable, reinforcing their likely association with the XRBs. Our results suggest that the supervirial temperature gas is not a widespread component of the ISM but may instead be located in extraplanar regions or the extended CGM, which aligns with some recent simulation results.

<title>The Ultraviolet Slopes of Early Universe Galaxies: The Impact of Bursty Star Formation, Dust, and Nebular Continuum Emission</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
JWST has enabled the detection of the ultraviolet (UV) continuum of galaxies at z > 10, revealing extremely blue, potentially dust-free galaxies. However, interpreting UV spectra is complicated by the well-known degeneracy between stellar ages, dust reddening, and nebular continuum. The main goal of this paper is to develop a theoretical model for the relationship between galaxy UV slopes (β), bursty star formation histories, dust evolution, and nebular contributions using cosmological zoom-in simulations. We build a layered model where we simulate increasingly complex physics, including the impact of (i) unattenuated intrinsic stellar populations, (ii) reddened populations using a new on-the-fly evolving dust model, and (iii) populations including dust and nebular continuum. Unattenuated stellar populations with no nebular emission exhibit a diverse range of intrinsic UV slopes (β0 ≈ −3 → −2.2), with an inverse correlation between UV slope and specific star formation rate. When including dust, our model galaxies demonstrate a rapid rise in dust obscuration between z ≈ 8 and 10. This increase in dust mass is due to high grain–grain shattering rates, and enhanced growth per unit dust mass in very small grains, resulting in UV-detected galaxies at z ∼ 12 descending into Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array–detectable galaxies by z ∼ 6. The rapid rise in dust content at z ≈ 8–10 leads to a systematic reddening of the UV slopes during this redshift range. Nebular continuum further reddens UV slopes by a median Δβneb ≈ 0.2–0.4, though notably the highest-redshift galaxies (z ≈ 12) are insufficiently blue compared to observations; this may imply an evolving escape fraction from H ii regions with redshift.

<title>The Evolution of Hypervelocity Supernova Survivors and the Outcomes of Interacting Double White Dwarf Binaries</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb42e</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The recent prediction and discovery of hypervelocity supernova survivors has provided strong evidence that the “dynamically driven double-degenerate double-detonation” (D6) Type Ia supernova scenario occurs in nature. In this model, the accretion stream from the secondary white dwarf (WD) in a double WD binary strikes the primary WD violently enough to trigger a helium shell detonation, which in turn triggers a carbon/oxygen core detonation. If the secondary WD survives the primary’s explosion, it will be flung away as a hypervelocity star. While previous work has shown that the hotter observed D6 stars can be broadly understood as secondaries whose outer layers have been heated by their primaries’ explosions, the properties of the cooler D6 stars have proven difficult to reproduce. In this paper, we show that the cool D6 stars can be explained by the Kelvin–Helmholtz contraction of helium or carbon/oxygen WDs that underwent significant mass loss and core heating prior to and during the explosion of their WD companions. We find that the current population of known D6 candidates is consistent with ∼2% of Type Ia supernovae leaving behind a hypervelocity surviving companion. We also calculate the evolution of hot, low-mass oxygen/neon stars and find reasonable agreement with the properties of the LP 40–365 class of hypervelocity survivors, suggesting that these stars are the kicked remnants of near-Chandrasekhar-mass oxygen/neon WDs that were partially disrupted by oxygen deflagrations. We use these results as motivation for schematic diagrams showing speculative outcomes of interacting double WD binaries, including long-lived merger remnants, Type Ia supernovae, and several kinds of peculiar transients.

<title>Using Lithium and Beryllium to Study Structure and Evolution of Rotating Stars</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The chemical composition of the Sun is still a highly controversial issue. No solar model has yet been able to simultaneously reproduce the solar lithium and beryllium abundances, along with helioseismic results, including the rotation profile. Lithium and beryllium are fragile elements that are highly sensitive to the physical conditions, as well as to transport and mixing processes within and below the convective zone (CZ). Uncovering the transport mechanisms responsible for the depletion of Li and Be in the Sun is crucial for using them as tools to understand stellar interiors and the associated transport and mixing processes. We constructed rotating solar models based on Magg’s abundance scale, incorporating the effects of convective overshoot and magnetic fields. The rotating model exhibits superior sound speed and density profile and successfully reproduces the observed ratios r02 and r13. It also matches the seismically inferred CZ depth, surface helium abundance, and rotation profile, as well as the detected Li and Be abundances and neutrino fluxes within 1σ. The depletion of Li is dominated by convective overshoot and rotational mixing, while Be depletion is primarily driven by gravitational settling and rotational mixing. The presence of the tachocline accelerates Li depletion but slows down Be depletion. These distinct depletion mechanisms result in the surface abundances of Li and Be evolving differently over time.

<title>Discovery of a New Phase-transient Cyclotron Line in A0535+26: Constraints on the Accretion Geometry</title>

In 2020 November, A0535+26 underwent one of its brightest outbursts, reaching nearly 12 Crab in X-ray flux. Observed by Insight-HXMT, NuSTAR, NICER, and AstroSat, this event provided valuable insights into Be/X-ray binaries. The pulse profiles evolved significantly with luminosity, transitioning from pencil-beam to fan-beam geometries. A0535+26, known for its fundamental cyclotron line at ∼44 keV, became only the second source to exhibit a negative correlation between cyclotron line energy and flux at high luminosities, with a plateau phase preceding the transition from positive to negative correlation. We report the discovery of a phase-transient low-energy cyclotron line, detected in a narrow phase range (∼16%) across all seven NuSTAR observations during the rising, peak, and declining phases of the outburst. The new line exhibited dramatic variations with pulse phase and luminosity. We explain this behavior using an accretion geometry where the accretion column sweeps across the line of sight.

<title>Hydrostatic Equilibrium Constraints in X-COP Galaxy Clusters: Testing Hyperconical Modified Gravity in Hot-gas-dominated Regions</title>

Modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) was originally proposed to model galaxy rotation curves without dark matter. However, MOND presents difficulties in explaining the radial acceleration relation observed in galaxy clusters, and moreover, it does not completely eliminate the need for dark matter, since it requires using nonluminous particles (e.g., cold molecular gas or dust, or neutrinos) to explain the observed hydrostatic equilibrium of the hot gas. Hyperconical modified gravity (HMG) offers a relativistic framework that recovers the success of MOND in galaxy rotation curves as a natural particular case, and it could potentially reconcile the previously described discrepancies without invoking any type of dark matter. This paper analyzes the performance of the HMG model for hydrostatic equilibrium in 12 XMM Cluster Outskirts Project galaxy clusters, with a special focus on 5 objects with available complete stellar mass information: A1795, A2029, A2142, A2319, and A644. Specifically, we used high-resolution X-ray data with which gas density and mass profiles were previously derived to constrain modified gravity models. Our results show that the hydrostatic equilibrium of analyzed cluster gas is more naturally adjusted to the HMG model beyond 1 Mpc, reducing the need to fit parameters, but further research is required to expand to more spatial scales.

<title>BASS. XLVII. 22 GHz Radio Atlas of Swift-BAT Selected AGN</title>

We present the third phase of the largest high-frequency, high-resolution imaging survey of 231 nearby, hard X-ray selected active galactic nuclei (AGNs), with a very high 98% ± 1% detection fraction. This survey presents VLA 22 GHz radio observations with 1″ spatial resolution covering over 6 orders of magnitude in radio luminosity in nearby AGNs that span ∼4 orders of magnitude in black hole mass and X-ray luminosity. We identify three different radio morphologies: 44% ± 3% (102/231) are compact or unresolved, 46% ± 3% (106/231) show an extended structure (star formation, possible one-sided jets, etc.), and 8% ± 2% (19/231) have a biconical or two-sided jet-like morphology. The remaining 2% ± 1% (4/231) sources are nondetections. The radio-to-X-ray luminosity ratios of the Swift-BAT AGNs in our sample (LR/L14−195keV ∼ 10−5.5 and LR/L2−10keV ∼ 10−5 with a scatter of ∼0.5 dex) are similar to that of coronally active stars (LR/LX ∼ 10−5). For most targets, extended emission in radio-quiet objects is broadly consistent with the expectation for star formation from previous far-infrared observations once the contribution from the radio core has been subtracted. Our sample represents nearby analogs of distant AGNs at the peak of black hole growth, and thus the high detection fraction in our work has important implications for future high frequency AGN radio surveys with the next generation Very Large Array or Square Kilometre Array, both of which should detect large fractions of more distant AGNs.

<title>The Unexpected Lack of Asymmetry in the Horizon-scale Image of Sagittarius A*</title>

The ring-like images of the two supermassive black holes captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) provide powerful probes of the physics of accretion flows at horizon scales. Specifically, the brightness asymmetry in the images carries information about the angular velocity profile of the inner accretion flow and the inclination of the observer, owing to the Doppler boosts photons experience at their site of emission. In this paper, we develop a method for quantifying the brightness asymmetry of black hole images in the Fourier domain, which can be measured directly from interferometric data. We apply this method to current EHT data and find that the image of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) has an unusually low degree of asymmetry that is even lower than that inferred for M87. We then use a covariant semianalytic model to obtain constraints on the inclinations and velocity profiles of the inner accretion flow for Sgr A*. We find that the lack of significant brightness asymmetry forces the observer inclination to uncomfortably small values (6°–10∘), if the plasma velocity follows Keplerian profiles. Alternatively, larger inclination angles can be accommodated if the plasma velocities are significantly sub-Keplerian and the black hole is not spinning rapidly.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present measurements of the neutral atomic hydrogen (H i) mass function (HiMF) and cosmic H i density (ΩH I) at 0 ≤ z ≤ 0.088 from the Looking at the Distant Universe with MeerKAT Array (LADUMA) survey. Using LADUMA Data Release 1 (DR1), we analyze the HiMF via a new “recovery matrix” method that we benchmark against a more traditional modified maximum likelihood (MML) method. Our analysis, which implements a forward modeling approach, corrects for survey incompleteness and uses extensive synthetic source injections to ensure robust estimates of the HiMF parameters and their associated uncertainties. This new method tracks the recovery of sources in mass bins different from those in which they were injected and incorporates a Poisson likelihood in the forward modeling process, allowing it to correctly handle uncertainties in bins with few or no detections. The application of our analysis to a high-purity subsample of the LADUMA DR1 spectral line catalog in turn mitigates any possible biases that could result from the inconsistent treatment of synthetic and real sources. For the surveyed redshift range, the recovered Schechter function normalization, low-mass slope, and “knee” mass are Mpc−3 dex−1, , and , respectively, which together imply a comoving cosmic H i density of . Our results show consistency between recovery matrix and MML methods and with previous low-redshift studies, giving confidence that the cosmic volume probed by LADUMA, even at low redshifts, is not an outlier in terms of its H i content.

<title>The Young Ages of 70 μm Dark Clumps Inferred from Carbon Chain Chemistry</title>

The physical conditions of the earliest environment of high-mass star formation are currently poorly understood. To that end, we present observations of the carbon chain molecules HC5N, CCS, and HC7N in the 22–25 GHz band toward 12 high-mass 70 μm dark clumps (SMDC) with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. We detect HC5N and CCS toward 11 of these SMDC sources. We calculate column densities and abundances relative to H2 for HC5N and CCS. We do not find any clear HC7N detections in the 11 sources individually, but by stacking the HC7N spectra, we do detect HC7N on average in these sources. We also calculate the ratio of the column densities of HC5N to HC7N using the stacked spectra of both species. We compare our measured abundances of HC5N and our measured ratio of HC5N to HC7N to the UMIST dark cloud chemistry models to constrain an age for the gas assuming a fixed volume density and temperature. The chemical models favor a chemical evolutionary age <1 Myr at densities of n(H2) ≈ 2 × 104 cm−3. The consistent carbon-chain detections and young model-derived ages support the conclusion that these 11 70 μm dark clumps lack high-mass protostars because they are young and not because they are inefficient and incapable of high-mass star formation.

<title>Signatures of Black Hole Spin and Plasma Acceleration in Jet Polarimetry</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We study the polarization of black hole jets on scales of 10−103GM/c2 and show that large spatial swings in the polarization occur at three characteristic distances from the black hole: the radius where the counter-jet dims, the radius where the magnetic field becomes azimuthally dominated (the light cylinder), and the radius where the plasma reaches its terminal Lorentz factor. To demonstrate the existence of these swings, we derive a correspondence between axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic outflows and their force-free limits, which allows us to analytically compute the plasma kinematics and magnetic field structure of collimated, general relativistic jets. We then use this method to ray trace polarized images of black hole jets with a wide range of physical parameters, focusing on roughly face-on jets like that of M87. We show that the location of the polarization swings is strongly tied to the location of the light cylinder and thus to the black hole’s spin, illustrating a new method of measuring spin from polarized images of the jet. This signature of black hole spin should be observable by future interferometric arrays like the (Next Generation) Event Horizon Telescope, which will be able to resolve the polarized emission of the jet down to the near-horizon region at high dynamic range.

<title>MAGICS. III. Seeds Sink Swiftly: Nuclear Star Clusters Dramatically Accelerate Seed Black Hole Mergers</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Merger rate predictions of massive black hole (MBH) seeds from large-scale cosmological simulations differ widely, with recent studies highlighting the challenge of low-mass MBH seeds failing to reach the galactic center, a phenomenon known as the seed sinking problem. In this work, we tackle this issue by integrating cosmological simulations and galaxy merger simulations from the MAGICS-I and MAGICS-II resimulation suites with high-resolution N-body simulations. Building on the findings of MAGICS-II, which showed that only MBH seeds embedded in stellar systems are able to sink to the center, we extend the investigation by incorporating nuclear star clusters (NSCs) into our models. Utilizing N-body resimulations with up to 107 particles, we demonstrate that interactions between NSCs and their surrounding galactic environment, particularly tidal forces triggered by cluster interactions, significantly accelerate the sinking of MBHs to the galactic center. This process leads to the formation of a hard binary in ≲500 Myr after the onset of a galaxy merger. Our results show that in eight out of 12 models, the high stellar density of the surrounding NSCs enhances MBH hardening, facilitating gravitational-wave mergers by redshift z = 4. We conclude that at z > 4, dense NSCs serve as the dominant channel for MBH seed mergers, producing a merger rate of 0.3–0.6 yr−1 at z = 4, which is approximately 300–600 times higher than in non-NSC environments. In contrast, in environments without NSCs, surrounding dark matter plays a more significant role in loss-cone scattering.

<title>Correlated Molybdenum, Ruthenium, and Barium Isotope Anomalies in Presolar Silicon Carbide Grains</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb308</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We have analyzed molybdenum, ruthenium, and barium isotopes simultaneously in 55 individual presolar silicon carbide (SiC) grains from the Murchison CM2 meteorite using the Chicago Instrument for Laser Ionization (or CHILI). Most grains show clear s-process signatures, which are strongly correlated for molybdenum and ruthenium. For all three elements, we provide estimates for s-process contributions from low-mass AGB stars with unprecedented precision. Variations in s-process production observed for some nuclides reflect a strong dependence on physical properties, neutron density, temperature, and timing, affecting various s-process branch points. Significant contamination can be excluded for a majority of grains. Instead, distributions along mixing lines in three-isotope diagrams reflect mixing between initial parent star material and matter synthesized in the star. The results suggest that the ratios between p- and r-process isotopes of molybdenum, ruthenium, and barium in presolar SiC from many parent stars are the same as the ones inferred for the solar system. This indicates that the products of these processes were well mixed by the time the molecular cloud collapsed to form the stars that eventually grew the SiC grains, and that this mixture did not change between formation of the precursor stars and formation of the Sun.

<title>The Impacts of Magnetogram Projection Effects on Solar Flare Forecasting</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work explores the impacts of magnetogram projection effects on machine-learning-based solar flare forecasting models. Utilizing a methodology proposed by D. A. Falconer et al., we correct for projection effects present in Georgia State University’s Space Weather Analytics for Solar Flares benchmark data set. We then train and test a support vector machine classifier on the corrected and uncorrected data, comparing differences in performance. Additionally, we provide insight into several other methodologies that mitigate projection effects, such as stacking ensemble classifiers and active region location-informed models. Our analysis shows that data corrections slightly increase both the true-positive (correctly predicted flaring samples) and false-positive (nonflaring samples predicted as flaring) prediction rates, averaging a few percent. Similarly, changes in performance metrics are minimal for the stacking ensemble and location-based model. This suggests that a more complicated correction methodology may be needed to see improvements. It may also indicate inherent limitations when using magnetogram data for flare forecasting.

<title>Candidate Intermediate-mass Black Hole Discovered in an Extremely Young Low-metallicity Cluster in the Tadpole Galaxy KUG 1138+327</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We explore what unusual products a starburst of about 6% solar metallicity and a mean estimated age of ∼5 × 105 yr can produce in KUG 1138+327 at a distance of 24.5 Mpc. Chandra X-ray observations show a dominant point-like source with an average 0.3–10 keV luminosity of 1040.3 erg s−1 and variability by a factor of ∼2 over months. This extreme ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) is apparently associated with the young central cluster. A multicolor disk modeling of the X-ray spectrum of the source suggests a standard accretion around a black hole. It also has a morphologically elongated nonthermal radio continuum counterpart on the scale of ∼200 pc, probably the longest detected from such a source. The radio, optical, and X-ray findings suggest that it could well be an intermediate-mass black hole undergoing sub-Eddington accretion from a massive star companion. Accounting for the presence of the ULX and the prominent emission lines HeIIλ4658 and [Ar IV]λ4711 while lacking Wolf–Rayet spectral features, we estimate the true age of the starburst to be about 2–4 Myr. Only with such a moderate age can the starburst host this extraordinary ULX, probably triggered by a recent influx of extremely low-metallicity gas. This study demonstrates the potential of multiwavelength studies of low-metallicity starbursts to provide insights into what may commonly occur in high-redshift galaxies.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We examine the light curves of a sample of novae, classifying them into single-peaked and multiple-peaked morphologies. Using accurate distances from Gaia, we determine the spatial distribution of these novae by computing their heights, Z, above the Galactic plane. We show that novae exhibiting a single peak in their light curves tend to concentrate near the Galactic plane, while those displaying multiple peaks are more homogeneously distributed, reaching heights up to 1000 pc above the plane. A K-S test rejects the null hypothesis that the two distributions originate from the same population at a significance level corresponding to 4.2σ.

<title>On the Feasibility of Deriving Pseudo-redshifts of Gamma-Ray Bursts from Two Phenomenological Correlations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Accurate knowledge of gamma-ray burst (GRB) redshifts is essential for studying their intrinsic properties and exploring their potential applications in cosmology. Currently, only a small fraction of GRBs have independent redshift measurements, primarily due to the need for rapid follow-up optical/IR spectroscopic observations. For this reason, many have utilized phenomenological correlations to derive pseudo-redshifts of GRBs with no redshift measurement. In this work, we explore the feasibility of analytically deriving pseudo-redshifts directly from the Amati and Yonetoku relations. We simulate populations of GRBs that: (i) fall perfectly on the phenomenological correlation track; and (ii) include intrinsic-scatter matching observations. Our findings indicate that in the case of the Amati relation, the mathematical formulation is ill-behaved, in that it yields two solutions within a reasonable redshift range z ∈ [0.1, 10]. When realistic scatter is included, it may result in no solution, or the redshift error range is excessively large. In the case of the Yonetoku relation, while it can result in a unique solution in most cases, the large systematic errors of the redshift call for attention, especially when attempting to use pseudo-redshifts to study GRB population properties.

<title>Shear Particle Acceleration in Structured Gamma-Ray Burst Jets. II. Viewing Angle Effect on the Prompt Emission and Application to GRB 170817A</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Multimessenger observations suggest that the gamma-ray burst on 2017 August 17 (GRB 170817A) resulted from off-axial observations of its structured jet, which consists of a narrow ultrarelativistic jet core surrounded by a wide mild-relativistic cocoon. In a serious paper, we explore the emission of shear-accelerated electrons in the mixed jet-cocoon region in a series of papers. This paper focuses on the viewing angle effect for a structured jet by considering the emission from the shear-accelerated electrons. It is found that the observed synchrotron (Syn) emission peaks at the infrared band and the Syn self-Compton emission peaks at the band of hundreds of keV. They are not sensitive to the viewing angle. In the off-axis observations scenario, the prompt emission spectrum is dominated by the emission of the shear-accelerated electrons. The prompt gamma-ray spectrum of GRB 170817A can be well explained with our model by setting the velocity of the inner edge of the cocoon region as 0.9c, the magnetic field strength as 21 G, the injected initial electron Lorentz factor as 103, and the viewing angle as 0.44 rad. We argue that the joint observations in the infrared/optical and X-ray bands are critical to verify our model.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The electron antineutrino flux limits are presented for the brightest gamma-ray burst (GRB) of all time, GRB221009A, over a range of 1.8–200 MeV using the Kamioka Liquid Scintillator Antineutrino Detector. Using multiple time windows ranging from minutes to days surrounding the event to search for electron antineutrinos coincident with the GRB, we set an upper limit on the flux under the assumption of several power-law neutrino source spectra, with power-law indices ranging from 1.5 to 3 in steps of 0.5. No excess was observed in any time windows ranging from seconds to days around the event trigger time T0. For a power-law index of 2 and a time window of T0 ± 500 s, a flux upper limit of 2.34 × 109 cm−2 was calculated. The limits are compared to the results presented by IceCube.

<title>Cosmic-Ray-driven Thermal Modes in Partially Ionized Viscous Plasma with Hall Current</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This research investigates the dynamics of cosmic-ray-driven thermal modes within a partially ionized plasma permeated by a magnetic field. A two-fluid model is adopted to capture the intricate physics arising from the presence of neutral dynamics. The ion–cosmic fluid is described using a nonideal magnetohydrodynamic framework, incorporating ion and neutral viscosities, the Hall current, and ion–neutral collisions. Neutral dynamics are characterized by neutral viscosity, pressure, and collisional interactions. The derived general dispersion relation reveals two dominant modes: a collisional neutral thermal viscous mode and a Hall-modified cosmic magnetothermal viscous mode. The domains of instability for the neutral thermal viscous mode are determined, while the stability of the ion–cosmic thermal viscous mode is assessed using the Routh–Hurwitz criterion, yielding critical lengths for isochoric, isobaric, and isentropic modes. In the collisional regime, a seventh-order dispersion relation is derived and analyzed numerically. Next, the second dominant mode of the general dispersion relation is further analyzed in both transverse and longitudinal directions relative to the magnetic field. In the transverse direction, a seventh-order collisional cosmic magnetothermal viscous mode is obtained, influenced by ion and neutral viscosities, the diffusion coefficient, collisions, and the cosmic and ion acoustic speeds. This mode is further investigated analytically and numerically. Numerical estimates demonstrate that the diffusion coefficient and cosmic pressure enhance the growth rate of thermal modes. The critical wavelength of the magnetothermal cosmic mode is calculated. In the longitudinal direction, the obtained modes exhibit no substantial cosmic influence, but instead represent Hall-modified collisional Alfvén waves.

<title>An In-depth Study of Gamma Rays from the Starburst Galaxy M82 with VERITAS</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Assuming Galactic cosmic rays originate in supernovae and the winds of massive stars, starburst galaxies should produce very-high-energy (VHE; E > 100 GeV) gamma-ray emission via the interaction of their copious quantities of cosmic rays with the large reservoirs of dense gas within the galaxies. Such VHE emission was detected by VERITAS from the starburst galaxy M82 in 2008–09. An extensive, multiyear campaign followed these initial observations, yielding a total of 254 hr of good-quality VERITAS data on M82. Leveraging modern analysis techniques and the larger exposure, these VERITAS data show a more statistically significant VHE signal (∼6.5 standard deviations, σ). The corresponding photon spectrum is well fit by a power law (Γ = 2.3 ± 0.3stat ± 0.2sys), and the observed integral flux is F (>450 GeV) = (3.2 ± 0.6stat ± 0.6sys) × 10−13 cm−2 s−1, or ∼0.4% of the Crab Nebula flux above the same energy threshold. The improved VERITAS measurements, when combined with various multiwavelength data, enable modeling of the underlying emission and transport processes. A purely leptonic scenario is found to be a poor representation of the gamma-ray spectral energy distribution (SED). A lepto-hadronic scenario with cosmic rays following a power-law spectrum in momentum (index s ≃ 2.25) and with significant bremsstrahlung below 1 GeV provides a good match to the observed SED. The synchrotron emission from the secondary electrons indicates that efficient nonradiative losses of cosmic-ray electrons may be related to advective escape from the starburst core.

Small-scale jets, such as chromospheric and transition region (TR) network jets, are of great interest regarding coronal heating and solar wind acceleration. Spectroscopic analysis based on multiple spectral lines with different formation temperatures is essential for understanding the physical properties and driving mechanisms of jets. Here, we conduct an investigation of the physical properties of a small-scale chromospheric jet in a quiet-Sun network region and its TR counterpart. This jet is recorded from formation to extinction using the Fast Imaging Solar Spectrograph at the Goode Solar Telescope and the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph. The chromospheric component of the jet exhibits a high line-of-sight speed of up to 45 km s−1 during its ascending phase, accompanied by spectral profiles akin to rapid blueshifted excursion and downflowing rapid redshifted excursion during the descending phase. Using a cloud model combined with a Multi-Layer Spectral Inversion, we quantify the jet’s temperature during its ascending phase, which starts at approximately 11,000 K and increases by only 1000 K over 1 minute, much smaller than a few 104 K, the excess temperature expected in an ideal gas reconnection jet at an outflow speed of 45 km s−1. The TR counterpart exhibits a Si iv 1394 Å line profile with a non-Gaussian shape, including a blueshifted component and a large nonthermal width. Our results suggest that if the jet is driven by magnetic reconnection in the chromosphere, the heat released by the reconnection may be mostly used to ionize the hydrogen rather than to increase the temperature so that the gas may appear almost isothermal.

<title>The Origin Channels of Hierarchical Binary Black Hole Mergers in the LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA O1, O2, and O3 Runs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We infer the origin channels of hierarchical mergers observed in the LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA (LVK) O1, O2, and O3 runs using a hierarchical Bayesian analysis under a parametric population model. By assuming the active galactic nucleus (AGN) disk and nuclear star cluster (NSC) channels, we find that NSCs likely dominate the hierarchical merger rate in the Universe, corresponding to a fraction of at 90% credible intervals in our fiducial model; AGN disks may contribute up to nearly half of hierarchical mergers detectable with LVK, specifically . We investigate the impact of the escape speed, along with other population parameters on the branching fraction, suggesting that the mass, mass ratio, and spin of the sources play significant roles in population analysis. We show that hierarchical mergers constitute at least ∼10% of the gravitational-wave events detected by LVK during the O1–O3 runs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it is challenging to effectively infer detailed information about the host environment based solely on the distribution of black hole merger parameters if multiple formation channels are considered.

<title>The Effect of Rotation on Triggering S Doradus Instabilities in Luminous Blue Variables</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb581</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb581</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Luminous blue variables (LBVs) are an intermediate stage in the evolution of high-mass stars characterized by extreme mass loss and substantial variability. The stars show large irregular episodic variations on timescales of years to decades in their effective temperatures (called “S Dor variations”). Observations show that these variations are triggered when the stars are in a well-defined strip in the H-R diagram that corresponds to the Modified Eddington Limit, where the atmospheric radiation pressure almost balances gravity. In this work we consider the role that rotation plays in the instability that leads to the triggering of S Dor variations in luminous post-main-sequence LBVs. We adopt the existing instability criterion that the effective surface gravity is reduced to 10% of the Newtonian gravity due to radiation pressure in the atmosphere of nonrotating stars. We then specifically describe how rotation impacts this instability. By carrying out numerical simulations of model LBVs at both solar and subsolar metallicities, we confirm that most LBVs should be unstable at both the equator and the poles, and that rotation exacerbates this effect; some models also produce enhanced mass loss at the pole or equator. Our numerical models also predict dense equatorial disks or rings and high-velocity bipolar outflows, in agreement with existing observations of LBV circumstellar nebulae.

<title>Simulation of the Tianwen-4 Mission Contribution to Jupiter Gravity Field Improvement</title>

This study comprehensively evaluates the impact of the expected Chinese Tianwen-4 mission, in conjunction with the existing data from the Juno mission, on enhancing the understanding of Jupiter’s gravity field. Integrating simulated data from both missions. The methodology incorporates detailed simulations of Tianwen-4’s orbit, assessing its influence on Jupiter’s gravity field estimations across various orbital inclinations. It also explores the integration of multimission tracking data, combining simulated Juno and Tianwen-4 data. In addition to the static gravity coefficient, the analysis extends to include the tidal effect knm, which quantifies the tidal response of Jupiter’s gravity field to forcing it by the Galilean satellites. The results indicate clear potential improvements in the precision of the gravity field models compared to those derived from the Juno mission alone, particularly in the lower degree harmonics, where accuracy improves by an average factor of 20.08 in the first 12°, gradually decreasing to 2.46, with an overall enhancement of 7.43. These enhancements underscore the value of integrating data from multiple missions, which provides a more nuanced understanding of Jupiter’s gravitational properties. Improving the gravity field model is essential for gaining deeper insights into Jupiter’s internal structure and dynamics, which ultimately enhances our understanding of giant planets and their formation. Accurate gravity models are crucial for interpreting a planet’s physical and chemical properties, leading to better comprehension of planetary systems.

<title>Characterizing the Multiple Protostellar System VLA 1623-2417 with JWST, ALMA, and VLA: Outflow Origins, Dust Growth, and an Unsettled Disk</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Utilizing the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), and the Very Large Array (VLA), we present high angular resolution (0 06–0 42), multiwavelength (4 μm–3 cm) observations of the VLA 1623-2417 protostellar system to characterize the origin, morphology and, properties of the continuum emission. JWST observations at 4.4 μm reveal outflow cavities for VLA 1623 A and, for the first time, VLA 1623 B, as well as scattered light from the upper layers of the VLA 1623 W disk. We model the millimeter-centimeter spectral energy distributions to quantify the relative contributions of dust and ionized gas emission, calculate dust masses, and use spectral index maps to determine where optical depth hinders this analysis. In general, all objects appear to be optically thick down to ∼90 GHz, show evidence for significant amounts (tens to hundreds of M⊕) of large (>1 mm) dust grains, and are dominated by ionized gas emission for frequencies ≲15 GHz. In addition, we find evidence of unsettled millimeter dust in the inclined disk of VLA 1623 B possibly attributed to instabilities within the circumstellar disk, adding to the growing catalog of unsettled Class 0/I disks. Our results represent some of the highest-resolution observations possible with current instrumentation, particularly in the case of the VLA. However, our interpretation is still limited at low frequencies (≲22 GHz) and thus motivates the need for next-generation interferometers operating at centimeter wavelengths.

<title>Multifrequency Radio Observations of the Dissociative Cluster Merger CIZA J0107.7+5408</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb1c5</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present new radio observations of the galaxy cluster merger CIZA J0107.7+5408 (CIZA0107), a large, roughly equal mass, postcore passage, dissociative binary system at z = 0.1066. CIZA0107 is an elongated, disturbed system, hosting two subclusters with optical galaxy number density peaks offset from their associated X-ray density peaks and double-peaked diffuse radio structure. We present new 240–470 MHz and 2.0–4.0 GHz Very Large Array observations of CIZA0107. We image the diffuse emission at high resolution, constrain its integrated spectrum, and map the spectral index distribution. We confirm the presence of steep-spectrum (α ∼ −1.3) emission on a scale of ∼0.5 Mpc in both subclusters. We identify two smaller ultrasteep spectrum (α < −2) regions, superimposed on larger-scale radio emission associated with the southwestern subcluster. At 340 MHz, we detect a radio edge bounding the emission to the south and show that it is coincident with a weak (M ∼ 1.2) shock identified in the Chandra image. At 3 GHz, the emission does not show any corresponding edgelike feature, and in fact it extends beyond the shock. We investigate the nature of the emission in CIZA0107 and find that, while the system may host a double halo structure, we cannot rule out a scenario in which the emission arises from two relics projected on the central cluster regions.

<title>On Finding Black Holes in Photometric Microlensing Surveys</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb1d7</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb1d7</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
There are expected to be millions of isolated black holes in the galaxy resulting from the deaths of massive stars. Measuring the abundance and properties of this remnant population would shed light on the end stages of stellar evolution and the evolution paths of black hole systems. Detecting isolated black holes is currently only possible via gravitational microlensing, which has so far yielded one definitive detection. The difficulty in finding microlensing black holes lies in having to choose a small subset of events, based on characteristics of their light curves, to allocate expensive and scarce follow-up resources to confirm the identity of the lens. Current methods either rely on simple cuts in parameter space without using the full distribution information or are only effective on small subsets of events. In this paper, we present a new lens classification method. The classifier takes in posterior constraints on light-curve parameters and combines them with a Galactic simulation to estimate the lens class probability. This method is flexible and can be used with any set of microlensing light-curve parameters, making it applicable to large samples of events. We make this classification framework available via the popclass Python package. We apply the classifier to ∼10,000 microlensing events from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment survey and find 23 high-probability black hole candidates. Our classifier also suggests that the only known isolated black hole is an observational outlier, according to current Galactic models, and the allocation of astrometric follow-up on this event was a high-risk strategy.

<title>Evaluating Short-warning Mitigation via Intentional Robust Disruption of a Hypothetical Impact of Asteroid 2023 NT1</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb289</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb289</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We investigate various short-warning mitigation scenarios via fragmentation for a hypothetical impact of asteroid 2023 NT1, a near-Earth object (NEO) that was discovered on 2023 July 15, two days after its closest approach to Earth on July 13. The asteroid passed by Earth within ∼0.25 lunar distances, with a closest approach of ∼1 × 105 km and a velocity of 11.27 km s−1. Its size remains largely uncertain, with an estimated diameter range of 26–58 m and a most probable estimate of 34 m (JPL Sentry, 2023 September 15; weighted by the NEO size frequency distribution). If 2023 NT1 had collided with Earth, it could have caused significant local damage. Assuming a spherical asteroid with a diameter of 34 m, uniform density of 2.6 g cm−3, and impact velocity of 15.59 km s−1, a collision would have yielded an estimated impact energy of ∼1.5 Mt, approximately 3 times the energy of the Chelyabinsk airburst in 2013. We analyze the effectiveness of mitigation via intentional robust disruption for objects similar to 2023 NT1. We utilize Pulverize It (PI), a NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts study of planetary defense via fragmentation, to model potential mitigation scenarios through simulations of hypervelocity asteroid disruption and atmospheric ground effects in the case of a terminal defense mode. Simulations suggest that PI is an effective multimodal approach for planetary defense that can operate in extremely short interdiction modes, in addition to long interdiction timescales with extended warning. Our simulations support the proposition that threats like 2023 NT1 can be effectively mitigated with intercepts of 1 day (or less) prior to impact, yielding minimal to no ground damage.

<title>Milky Way Classical Cepheid Distances from Calibrated Infrared Period–Luminosity–Metallicity Relations</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb39d</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb39d</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Classical Cepheids (DCEPs) serve as fundamental standard candles for measuring cosmic distances and investigating the structure and evolution of the Milky Way disk. However, accurate distance estimation faces challenges due to severe extinction, particularly toward the Galactic center. Although the Gaia Wesenheit magnitude reduces extinction effects, its reliance on a constant optical extinction law introduces significant uncertainties in regions of heavy obscuration. Infrared period–luminosity relations, combined with 3D extinction maps, offer an alternative, but these maps become unreliable beyond approximately 5 kpc. In this work, we calibrate the period–luminosity–metallicity (PLZ) relations for DCEPs across three near-infrared bands (J, H, KS) and four mid-infrared bands (W1, W2, [3.6], and [4.5]). This includes the first calibration of the W1 and W2 bands. To correct for extinction, we employ the infrared multi-passband optimal distance method and the BP–RP method, which complement and validate each other. These homogeneous PLZ relations, combined with reliable extinction corrections, yield the most accurate Galactic DCEP distances to date, covering 3452 DCEPs with an average relative distance error of 3.1%.

<title>Origin of the Unusual Composition of 3He-rich Solar Energetic Particles</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb48d</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb48d</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We examine 3He-rich solar energetic particles (SEPs) detected on 2023 October 24–25 by Solar Orbiter at 0.47 au. Measurements reveal that heavy-ion enhancements increase irregularly with mass, peaking at S. C, and especially N, Si, and S, stand out in the enhancement pattern with large abundances. Except for 3He, heavy-ion spectra can only be measured below 0.5 MeV nucleon−1. At 0.386 MeV nucleon−1, the event shows a huge 3He/4He ratio of 75.2 ± 33.9, larger than previously observed. Solar Dynamics Observatory extreme-ultraviolet data show a minifilament eruption at the solar source of 3He-rich SEPs that triggered a straight tiny jet. Located at the boundary of a low-latitude coronal hole, the jet base is a bright, small-scale region with a supergranulation scale size. The emission measure (EM) provides relatively cold source temperatures of 1.5–1.7 MK between the filament eruption and nonthermal type III radio burst onset. Analysis suggests that the EM distribution of temperature in the solar source could be a factor that affects the preferential selection of heavy ions for heating or acceleration, thus shaping the observed enhancement pattern. Including previously reported similar events indicates that the eruption of the minifilament is a common feature of events with heavy-ion enhancement not ordered by mass. Surprisingly, sources with weak magnetic fields show extreme 3He enrichment in these events. Moreover, the energy attained by heavy ions seems to be influenced by the size and form of the jets.

<title>Measuring the Interstellar Medium Content of Nearby, Luminous, Type 1 and Type 2 QSOs through CO and [C ii]</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb13b</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb13b</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present observations of CO(1–0) and CO(2–1) lines from the Institut de radioastronomie millimétrique 30 m telescope toward 20 nearby, optically luminous type 2 quasars (QSO2s) and observations of the [C ii] 158 μm line from the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy for five QSO2s in the CO sample and five type 1 quasars (QSO1s). In the traditional evolutionary scenario explaining different types of QSOs, obscured QSO2s emerge from gas-rich mergers observed as luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) and then turn into unobscured QSO1s as the black holes clear out the obscuring material in a blowout phase. We test the validity of this theoretical prediction by comparing the gas fractions and star formation efficiencies among LIRGs and QSOs. We find that CO luminosity, CO-derived gas masses, and gas fractions in QSO1s are consistent with those estimated for QSO2s, while LIRGs exhibit a closer resemblance to QSO2s in terms of CO-derived gas masses and gas fractions. Comparisons between [C ii] luminosity and star formation tracers such as the CO and infrared luminosity imply additional sources of [C ii] emission in QSO1s likely tracing neutral atomic or ionized gas with the caveat of a small sample size. All three types of galaxies have statistically indistinguishable distributions of star formation efficiency. Our results are consistent with part of the evolutionary scenario where nearby QSO2s could emerge from LIRGs, but they may not be the precursors of nearby QSO1s.

<title>New Potential Ultracompact X-Ray Binaries for Space-based Gravitational-wave Detectors from a Low-mass Main-sequence Companion Channel</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb618</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb618</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We investigate the formation and evolution of ultracompact X-ray binaries (UCXBs) using the COMPAS binary evolution code, starting from the zero-age main sequence (MS). Focusing on the low-mass MS companion channel, we simulate gravitational-wave (GW) signals from UCXBs with LEGWORK and evaluate their detectability by space-based observatories such as Taiji and TianQin. By incorporating signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) calculations with a threshold of SNR > 5, we provide a realistic framework to assess the detectability of the GW source. Our analysis suggests that the Milky Way currently hosts 7–32 observable UCXBs from the MS companion channel. Taiji or LISA alone could detect one to six sources over an 8 yr observation period, while TianQin, due to its high-frequency sensitivity, contributes to detecting systems with extremely short orbital periods and can also detect one to four sources. Comparison with sensitivity curves validates UCXBs as detectable GW sources, particularly at greater Galactic distances. This study improves our understanding of the evolution of UCXBs and their role as GW sources. By integrating population synthesis, SNR-based analyses, and observational data, we establish UCXBs as significant targets for GW astronomy, paving the way for future missions and theoretical studies of compact binary systems.

<title>The Source of the 2017 Cosmic-ray Half-year Modulation Event</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb61c</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In 2017, as the solar cycle approached solar minimum, an unusually long and large depression was observed in galactic cosmic-ray (GCR) protons, detected with the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, lasting for the second half of that year. The depression, as seen in the Bartel-rotation-averaged proton flux, has the form of a Forbush decrease (FD). Despite this resemblance, however, the cause of the observed depression does not have such a simple explanation as an FD, due to coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which typically last for a few days at 1 au rather than half a year. In this work, we seek the cause of the observed depression and investigate two main possibilities. First, we consider a minicycle—a temporary change in the solar dynamo that changes the behavior of the global solar magnetic field and, by this, the modulation of GCRs. Second, we investigate the behavior of solar activity, both CMEs and corotating/stream interaction regions (CIRs/SIRs), during this period. Our findings show that although there is some evidence for minicycle behavior prior to the depression, the depression is ultimately due to a combination of recurrent CMEs, SIRs, and CIRs. A particular characteristic of the depression is that the largest impacts that help to create and maintain it are due to four CMEs from the same, highly active, magnetic source that persists for several solar rotations. This active magnetic source is unusual, given the closeness of the solar cycle to solar minimum, which also helps to make the depression more evident.

<title>UNCOVER: 404 Error—Models Not Found for the Triply Imaged Little Red Dot A2744-QSO1*</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada613</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada613</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
JWST has revealed an abundance of compact, red objects at z ≈ 5–8 dubbed “little red dots” (LRDs), whose SEDs display a faint blue UV continuum followed by a steep rise in the optical. Despite extensive study of their characteristic V-shaped SEDs, the nature of LRDs remains unknown. We present a new analysis of the NIRSpec/PRISM spectrum of A2744-QSO1, a triply imaged LRD at z = 7.04 from the UNCOVER survey. The spectrum shows a strong Balmer break and broad Balmer emission lines, both of which are difficult to explain with models invoking exclusively AGN or stellar contributions. Our fiducial model decomposes the spectrum into a post-starburst galaxy dominating the UV-optical continuum and a reddened AGN being subdominant at all wavelengths and contributing at a level of ∼20%. However, this model infers a stellar mass of M⋆ ≈ 4 × 109M⊙ within a radius of re < 30 pc, driving its central density to the highest among observations to date. This high central density could be explained if A2744-QSO1 is the early-forming core of a modern-day massive elliptical galaxy that later puffed up via the inside-out growth channel. The models also necessitate an unusually steep dust extinction law to preserve the strong break strength, though this steepness may be explained by a deficit of large dust grains. It is also probable that these challenges reflect our ignorance of A2744-QSO1's true nature. Future variability and reverberation mapping studies could help disentangle the galaxy and AGN contribution to the continuum, and deeper redder observations could also unveil the dust properties in LRDs.

<title>BATSRUS GPU: Faster-than-real-time Magnetospheric Simulations with a Block-adaptive Grid Code</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adaf15</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Block-Adaptive-Tree Solar-wind Roe-type Upwind Scheme (BATSRUS), our state-of-the-art extended magnetohydrodynamic code, is the most used and one of the most resource-consuming models in the Space Weather Modeling Framework. It has always been our objective to improve its efficiency and speed with emerging techniques, such as GPU acceleration. To utilize the GPU nodes on modern supercomputers, we port BATSRUS to GPUs with the OpenACC API. Porting the code to a single GPU requires rewriting and optimizing the most used functionalities of the original code into a new solver, which accounts for around 1% of the entire program in length. To port it to multiple GPUs, we implement a new message-passing algorithm to support its unique block-adaptive grid feature. We conduct weak scaling tests on as many as 256 GPUs and find good performance. The program has 50%–60% parallel efficiency on up to 256 GPUs and up to 95% efficiency within a single node (four GPUs). Running large problems on more than one node has reduced efficiency due to hardware bottlenecks. We also demonstrate our ability to run representative magnetospheric simulations on GPUs. The performance for a single A100 GPU is about the same as 270 AMD “Rome” CPU cores (2.1 128-core nodes), and it runs 3.6 times faster than real time. The simulation can run 6.9 times faster than real time on four A100 GPUs.

<title>Signature of a Seyfert-like Component in Blazar 3C 273 and Its Reflection-based Explanation</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb0ca</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb0ca</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the results of blazar 3C 273 from simultaneous observations obtained using the XMM-Newton and NuSTAR satellites during the period 2015–2019 in five epochs. When the spectra are modeled with a power law, significant residuals arise below ∼2 keV and in the energy range of 30–78 keV in NuSTAR data. Residuals in the lower energy band represent soft X-ray excess, while at higher energies it likely represents a Compton reflection hump, which might be a weak component arising from dense and cold material. A faint iron line is present in XMM-Newton observations. We interpret such features as being attributed to the coronal emission plus those produced through reflection from an accretion disk. We model the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) with the single-zone inverse Compton (IC) jet model based on synchrotron self-Compton and external Compton phenomena. It is found that a one-zone synchrotron+IC model explains the SEDs quite well, but the jet component alone fails to fit the multiband X-ray emission for the low flux state of this object in 2018 and 2019, which arises owing to spectral flattening at low-energy X-rays, indicating that an additional Seyfert-like thermal component must be present at X-rays. This is further supported by a big blue bump present in the optical/UV band in all SEDs. Finally, we analyzed all the epochs using the relxill model to incorporate relativistic reflection and to model those residuals of soft excess and Compton hump in the X-ray bands.

We analyzed the 7.92 × 1011 cosmic-ray-induced muon events collected by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory from 2011 May 13, when the fully constructed experiment started to take data, to 2023 May 12. This data set provides an up-to-date cosmic-ray arrival direction distribution in the Southern Hemisphere with unprecedented statistical accuracy covering more than a full period length of a solar cycle. Improvements in Monte Carlo event simulation and better handling of year-to-year differences in data processing significantly reduce systematic uncertainties below the level of statistical fluctuations compared to the previously published results. We confirm the observation of a change in the angular structure of the cosmic-ray anisotropy between 10 TeV and 1 PeV, more specifically in the 100–300 TeV energy range. For the first time, we analyzed the angular power spectrum at different energies. The observed variations of the power spectra with energy suggest relatively reduced large-scale features at high energy compared to those of medium and small scales. The large volume of data enhances the statistical significance at higher energies, up to the PeV scale, and smaller angular scales, down to approximately 6° compared to previous findings.

<title>Photoevaporation from Inner Protoplanetary Disks Confronted with Observations</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb396</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The decades-long explorations on the dispersal of protoplanetary disks involve many debates about photoevaporation versus magnetized wind launching mechanisms. This work argues that the observed winds originating from the inner disk (R ≲ 0.3 au) cannot be explained by the photoevaporative mechanism. Heating the gas to proper temperatures for the observed forbidden lines (especially [O i] λ6300) will overionize it, suppressing the abundances of species responsible for the emission. Even if adequate emissivity is achieved by fine-tuning the physical parameters, the total cooling power will become unattainable by the radiative heating alone. Energy conservation requires the presumed photoevaporative winds to be heated to ≳105 K when launched from inner disks. However, due to efficient thermal accommodation with dust grains and cooling processes at high densities, X-ray irradiation at energies above 1 keV cannot efficiently launch winds in the first place because of its high penetration. Some studies claiming X-ray wind launching have oversimplified the thermochemical couplings. Confirmed by semianalytic integrations of thermochemical fluid structures, such high ionizations contradict the observed emission of neutral and singly ionized atoms from the winds originating from the inner disks.

<title>Gas-phase Oxygenation and Sulfurization Processes of Fullerene Cations</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb42d</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb42d</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Atomic oxygen and sulfur are known to efficiently react with fullerenes and may thus form a long list of oxygenated and sulfurated fullerene species in the interstellar medium (ISM). In this work, the gas-phase collision reactions between fullerene (C60 and C54/56/58) cations and 18O or S atoms are investigated. Oxygenated and sulfurated fullerene cations ([C6018O1−6]+, [C54/56/5818O1−3]+ and [C60S1−4]+, [C54/56/58S1−4]+) are efficiently formed. Under laser irradiation, O-atom and CO-unit loss channels are identified in the photodeoxygenation processes; [C60O]+ only has an O-atom loss channel. Smaller fullerene cations can be produced through sequential steps, and species with repeatedly lost CO units, i.e., fullerenes containing odd carbon numbers (e.g., 55 or 57 C atoms), can be produced in the photodeoxygenation processes of oxygenated fullerene cations. A S-atom loss channel and no CS-unit loss channel are identified in the photodesulfurization processes. Through theoretical calculations, the structures of oxygenated and sulfurated fullerene cations (e.g., [C6018O]+ and [C60S]+) and the bonding energies for the formation reaction pathways are investigated, together with their IR spectra. The exothermic energy for each reaction pathway is relatively high. Consequently, the oxygenation or sulfurization states and forms of fullerene compounds are intricate and complex. In addition, different types of oxygenation and sulfurization bonds are obtained with their evolution. Importantly, we infer that the photodeoxygenation of mono-oxygenated fullerene species or the photodesulfurization of sulfurated fullerene species is not involved in the top-down chemical evolution routes of buckminsterfullerene (C60) in the ISM.

<title>Anticorrelation Between Flux and Photon Index of Hard-X-Ray Emission from the Crab</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Using Swift Burst Alert Telescope event-mode data during gamma-ray burst occurrences, we conduct spectral analysis for the Crab system. From 38 good observations, which span a period of 18 yr from 2006 to 2023, we find that the Crab’s X-ray flux not only flickers but also significantly anticorrelates to its spectral power-law photon index. Since the emission contribution of the Crab pulsar in this energy range is small, this anticorrelation is mainly about the emission of the Crab nebula. We suggest that this anticorrelation provides observational supporting evidence for the long-standing notion that the nebula emission is due to synchrotron radiation of shocked pulsar winds in the nebula.

<title>Experimental and Numerical Studies of the Collapse of Dense Clouds Induced by Herbig–Haro Stellar Jets</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study investigates the influence of Herbig–Haro jets on initiating star formation in dense environments. When molecular clouds are nearing gravitational instability, the impact of a protostellar jet could provide the impetus needed to catalyze star formation. A high-energy-density experiment was carried out at the LULI2000 laser facility, where a supersonic jet generated by a nanosecond laser was used to compress a foam or plastic ball, mimicking the interaction of a Herbig–Haro jet with a molecular cloud. Simulations using the 3D radiation hydrodynamics code TROLL provided comprehensive data for analyzing ball compression and calculating jet characteristics. After applying scaling laws, similarities between stellar and experimental jets were explored. Diagnostic simulations—including density gradient, emission, and X-ray radiographies—showed strong agreement with experimental data. The results of the experiment, supported by simulations, demonstrate that the impact of a protostellar jet on a molecular cloud could reduce the Bonnor–Ebert mass by approximately 9%, thereby initiating collapse.

<title>Physical Origins of Outflowing Cold Clouds in Local Star-forming Dwarf Galaxies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We study the physical origins of outflowing cold clouds in a sample of 14 low-redshift dwarf (M* ≲ 1010M⊙) galaxies from the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph Legacy Archive Spectroscopic SurveY (CLASSY) using Keck/ESI data. Outflows are traced by broad (FWHM ∼260 km s−1) and very-broad (VB; FWHM ∼1200 km s−1) velocity components in strong emission lines like [O iii] λ5007 and Hα. The maximum velocities ( ) of broad components correlate positively with star formation rate, unlike the anticorrelation observed for VB components, and are consistent with superbubble models. In contrast, supernova-driven galactic wind models better reproduce the of VB components. Direct radiative cooling from a hot wind significantly underestimates the luminosities of both broad and VB components. A multiphase wind model with turbulent radiative mixing reduces this discrepancy to at least 1 dex for most VB components. Stellar photoionization likely provides additional energy since broad components lie in the starburst locus of excitation diagnostic diagrams. We propose a novel interpretation of outflow origins in star-forming dwarf galaxies—broad components trace expanding superbubble shells, while VB components originate from galactic winds. One-zone photoionization models fail to explain the low-ionization lines ([S ii] and [O i]) of broad components near the maximal starburst regime, which two-zone photoionization models with density-bounded channels instead reproduce. These two-zone models indicate anisotropic leakage of Lyman continuum photons through low-density channels formed by expanding superbubbles. Our study highlights extreme outflows ( ) in nine out of 14 star-forming dwarf galaxies, comparable to active galactic nucleus–driven winds.

<title>The Emergence of the Star Formation Main Sequence with Redshift Unfolded by JWST</title>

We investigate the correlation between stellar mass (M⋆) and star formation rate (SFR) across the stellar mass range . We consider almost 50,000 star-forming galaxies at z ≈ 3–7, leveraging data from COSMOS/SMUVS, JADES/GOODS-S, and MIDIS/XDF. This is the first study spanning such a wide M⋆ range without relying on gravitational lensing effects. We locate our galaxies on the SFR–M⋆ plane to assess how the location of galaxies in the star formation main sequence (MS) and starburst (SB) region evolves with M⋆ and redshift. We find that the two star-forming modes tend to converge at , with all galaxies found in the SB mode. However, deeper observations will be instrumental for reaching lower SFRs and M⋆ to further validate this scenario. By dissecting our galaxy sample in M⋆ and redshift, we show that the emergence of the star formation MS is M⋆ dependent: while in galaxies with the MS is already well in place at z = 5–7, for galaxies with it only becomes significant at z < 4. Overall, our results are in line with previous findings that the SB mode dominates among low stellar-mass galaxies. The earlier emergence of the MS for massive galaxies is consistent with galaxy downsizing.

<title>The AURORA Survey: An Extraordinarily Mature, Star-forming Galaxy at z ∼ 7</title>

We present the properties of a massive, large, dusty, metal-rich, star-forming galaxy at zspec = 6.73. GOODSN-100182 was observed with JWST/NIRSpec as part of the Assembly of Ultradeep Rest-optical Observations Revealing Astrophysics (AURORA) survey, and is also covered by public multiwavelength Hubble Space Telescope and JWST imaging. While the large stellar mass of GOODSN-100182 (∼1010M⊙) was indicated prior to JWST, NIRCam rest-frame optical imaging now reveals the presence of an extended disk (reff ∼ 1.5 kpc). In addition, the NIRSpec R ∼ 1000 spectrum of GOODSN-100182 includes the detection of a large suite of rest-frame optical nebular emission lines ranging in wavelength from [O ii] λ3727 up to [N ii] λ6583. The ratios of Balmer lines suggest significant dust attenuation ( ), consistent with the red rest-frame UV slope inferred for GOODSN-100182 (β = −0.50 ± 0.09). The star formation rate based on dust-corrected Hα emission is , well above the z ∼ 7 star-forming main sequence in terms of specific star formation rate. Strikingly, the ratio of [N ii] λ6583/Hα emission suggests almost solar metallicity, as does the ratio ([O iii] λ5007/Hβ)/([N ii] λ6583/Hα) and the detection of the faint [Fe ii] λ4360 emission feature. Overall, the excitation and ionization properties of GOODSN-100182 more closely resemble those of typical star-forming galaxies at z ∼ 2–3 rather than z ∼ 7. Based on public spectroscopy of the GOODS-N field, we find that GOODSN-100182 resides within a significant galaxy overdensity, and is accompanied by a spectroscopically confirmed neighbor galaxy. GOODSN-100182 demonstrates the existence of mature, chemically enriched galaxies within the first billion years of cosmic time, whose properties must be explained by galaxy formation models.

<title>Simulating ULXs and Blazars as GRMHD Accretion Flows Around a Black Hole</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
General relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations have been instrumental in our understanding of high-energy astrophysical phenomena over the past two decades. Their robustness and modularity make them a great tool for understanding the dynamics of various astrophysical objects. In this paper, we have used GRMHD simulations to understand the accretion flows of ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) and blazars. ULXs are enigmatic sources that exhibit very high luminosities (super-Eddington for stellar mass black holes) even in their low-hard state. Numerical steady-state calculations have shown that this behavior can be explained by considering ULXs to be highly magnetized advective accretion sources around stellar-mass black holes. Our simulation confirms that such an accretion flow can indeed produce the high luminosities observed in ULXs. Further to continue toward the supermassive black holes, we have also modeled blazars and have used our simulation results to explain the apparent dichotomy in the two blazar classes: flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) and BL Lacertae (BL Lacs). Our results show that FSRQ and BL Lacs show different spectral characteristics due to a difference in their magnetic field characteristics. The different categories of FSRQs and BL Lacs have also been explained by the interplay between the spin, magnetic field, and accretion rate of the central supermassive black hole.

<title>The Starburst Acceleration of High-velocity Clouds in the Galactic Center</title>

High-velocity clouds (HVCs) in the Galactic center have garnered significant attention due to their mysterious formation, potentially linked to starburst events or supermassive black hole activity in the region. However, it remains challenging to explain the observed column density and velocity distribution of HVCs. The discovery of high-velocity molecular clouds, which are denser and more massive, adds to this complexity. To address this, we conduct three-dimensional numerical simulations to explore the origin and magnetohydrodynamic evolution of HVCs in the context of a starburst in the Galactic center. By incorporating magnetic fields and an initial tangential velocity for the clouds, our simulation results align with the observed properties of HVCs, supporting the notion that these clouds can originate from a starburst process. In addition, ∼5% of the total mass of initial clouds can survive after 3.5 Myr; as a result, the following star formation will be more efficient than a feedback process that destroys all cool clouds.

Radial stellar population gradients within dwarf galaxies provide a promising avenue for disentangling the drivers of galaxy evolution, including environment. Within the Local Volume, radial stellar age gradient slopes correlate with interaction history, contrary to model predictions, so dwarfs that are isolated provide a critical control sample. We measure radial stellar age gradients in the relatively isolated gas-rich dwarf irregular Wolf–Lundmark–Melotte Galaxy (WLM), combining JWST NIRCam and NIRISS imaging with six archival Hubble Space Telescope fields over semimajor axis equivalent distances of 0 ≲ RSMA ≲ 4 kpc (≲3 Rhl). Fitting lifetime star formation histories to resolved color–magnitude diagrams, radial age gradients are quantified using τ90 and τ50, the lookback times to form 90% and 50% of the cumulative stellar mass. We find that globally, the outskirts of WLM are older on average, with (δτ90, δτ50)/δRSMA = (0.82 , 1.60 ) Gyr kpc−1 (stat.), in good agreement with simulations. However, we also detect an azimuthal dependence of radial stellar age gradients, finding that stars on the leading edge of WLM (relative to its proper motion) are both younger and have a flatter age gradient compared to the trailing edge. This difference persists over 0.6 ≲ RSMA ≲ 3.2 kpc (∼0.5–2.5 Rhl) and lookback times up to ∼8 Gyr, and is robust to the assumed stellar evolutionary model. Our results are consistent with star formation triggered by ram pressure stripping from a circumgalactic and/or intergalactic medium, suggested by recent H I observations. If confirmed, processes typifying dense environments, such as ram pressure stripping, may be more relevant to the evolution of isolated galaxies than previously thought.

Wide-field high-precision photometric observations such as the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) allowed the investigation of the stellar magnetic activity of cool stars. M dwarf starspots and stellar flares are the main indicators of magnetic activity. The present study focuses on modeling light curves (LCs) to analyze the distribution and characteristics of starspots, e.g., location, temperature, and spot size. The TESS LCs of two selected young M dwarfs, i.e., GJ 182 and 2MASS J05160212+2214528, were reconstructed using the Best rAndom StarSpots Model calculAtioN software, obtaining a three-spot model for GJ 182 and two-spot model for 2MASS J05160212+2214528, describing their LCs. For GJ 182, the mean spot temperature was estimated to be approximately 3279 K, covering 5%–8.5% of the stellar surface, while for 2MASS J05160212+2214528, the average spot temperature was approximately 2631 K, with a mean spottedness of about 5.4%. Using the 2 minute cadence LC data, we identified and analyzed 48 flare events from GJ 182, while no flares were detected in 2MASS J05160212+2214528. The estimated bolometric flare energy ranges from 1032 to 1035 erg, while in the TESS bandpass, it ranges from 1031 to 1033 erg. We derived the power-law index of −1.53 ± 0.12 and −1.86 ± 0.22 for flare frequency distribution in sectors 5 and 32, respectively, in the flare energy range 1033–1035 erg, consistent with previous studies for M dwarfs. A positive linear correlation between flare energy and duration was found with a slope of 0.67 ± 0.02, suggesting a similar mechanism followed by stellar superflares and solar flares. By assuming the similarities with solar flares, we also estimated a lower limit of the magnetic field strength of around 12–232 G to produce such superflare events.

<title>Cosmological and Astrophysical Parameter Inference from Stacked Galaxy Cluster Profiles Using CAMELS-zoomGZ</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a study on the inference of cosmological and astrophysical parameters using stacked galaxy cluster profiles. Utilizing the CAMELS-zoomGZ simulations, we explore how various cluster properties—such as X-ray surface brightness, gas density, temperature, metallicity, and Compton-y profiles—can be used to predict parameters within the 28-dimensional parameter space of the IllustrisTNG model. Through neural networks, we achieve a high correlation coefficient of 0.97 or above for all cosmological parameters, including Ωm, H0, and σ8, and over 0.90 for the remaining astrophysical parameters, showcasing the effectiveness of these profiles for parameter inference. We investigate the impact of different radial cuts, with bins ranging from 0.1R200c to 0.7R200c, to simulate current observational constraints. Additionally, we perform a noise sensitivity analysis, adding up to 40% Gaussian noise (corresponding to signal-to-noise ratios as low as 2.5), revealing that key parameters such as Ωm, H0, and the initial mass function slope remain robust even under extreme noise conditions. We also compare the performance of full radial profiles against integrated quantities, finding that profiles generally lead to more accurate parameter inferences. Our results demonstrate that stacked galaxy cluster profiles contain crucial information on both astrophysical processes within groups and clusters and the underlying cosmology of the Universe. This underscores their significance for interpreting the complex data expected from next-generation surveys and reveals, for the first time, their potential as a powerful tool for parameter inference.

<title>A Scalable Gaussian Process Approach to Shear Mapping with MuyGPs</title>

Analysis of cosmic shear is an integral part of understanding structure growth across cosmic time, which in turn provides us with information about the nature of dark energy. Conventional methods generate shear maps from which we can infer the matter distribution in the universe. Current methods (e.g., Kaiser–Squires inversion) for generating these maps, however, are tricky to implement and can introduce bias. Recent alternatives construct a spatial process prior for the lensing potential, which allows for inference of the convergence and shear parameters given lensing shear measurements. Realizing these spatial processes, however, scales cubically in the number of observations—an unacceptable expense as near-term surveys expect billions of correlated measurements. Therefore, we present a linearly scaling shear map construction alternative using a scalable Gaussian process prior called MuyGPs. MuyGPs avoids cubic scaling by conditioning interpolation on only nearest neighbors and fits hyperparameters using batched leave-one-out cross-validation. This work is the first step toward a full, scalable mass mapping method. We work in a simplified regime where we validate our method by interpolating and analyzing maps given noisy point-estimate data from all three shear fields, taken from a suite of N-body ray-tracing simulations. We also show that we can perform these operations at the scale of billions of galaxies on high-performance computing platforms.

<title>Probing Conditions for Strong Clumping by the Streaming Instability: Small Dust Grains and Low Dust-to-gas Density Ratio</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb311</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb311</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The streaming instability (SI) is a leading mechanism for concentrating solid particles into regions dense enough to form planetesimals. Its efficiency in clumping particles depends primarily on the dimensionless stopping time (τs, a proxy for particle size) and dust-to-gas surface density ratio (Z). Previous simulations identified a critical Z (Zcrit) above which strong clumping occurs, where particle densities exceed the Hill density (thus satisfying a condition for gravitational collapse), over a wide range of τs. These works found that, for τs ≤ 0.01, Zcrit was above the interstellar medium value (∼0.01). In this work, we reexamine the clumping threshold using 2D axisymmetric, stratified simulations at high resolution and with relatively large (compared to many previous simulations) domain sizes. Our main results are as follows: First, when τs = 0.01, strong clumping occurs even at Z ≲ 0.01, lower than Zcrit found in all previous studies. Consequently, we revise a previously published fit to the Zcrit curve to account for this updated Zcrit. Second, higher resolution results in a thicker dust layer, which may result from other instabilities manifesting, such as the vertically shearing SI. Third, despite this thicker layer, higher resolution can lead to strong clumping even with a lower midplane dust-to-gas density ratios (which results from the thicker particle layer) so long as Z ≳ Zcrit. Our results demonstrate the efficiency of the SI in clumping small particles at Z ∼ 0.01, which is a significant refinement of the conditions for planetesimal formation by the SI.

We present a wide-field study of a dense region within the Polaris Flare using 12CO, 13CO, and C18O (J = 1–0) observations at 15″ resolution, obtained with the Nobeyama 45 m Radio Telescope. The analysis reveals molecular gas formation occurring at column densities up to ∼1021 cm−2, evidenced by an anticorrelation between H i and CO distributions, indicating active atomic-to-molecular gas conversion. We found a threshold column density for molecular formation at ∼5 × 1020 cm−2, which is common among more evolved molecular clouds. The CO-to-H2 conversion factor, XCO, was found to be 0.7 × 1020 H2 cm−2 (K km s−1)−1, lower than the solar neighborhood average. Our chemical models estimate the cloud’s age to be ∼105–106 yr, suggesting an early stage of molecular cloud evolution. This interpretation is consistent with the observed low XCO factor. While virial analysis suggests that the entire cloud is gravitationally unbound, we identified several filamentary structures extending from the main cloud body. These filaments show systematic velocity gradients of 0.5–1.5 km s−1 pc−1, and analysis of the velocities shows that the molecular gas within them is falling toward the main cloud body, following a freefall model. This suggests ongoing mass accumulation processes through the filaments, demonstrating that gravitational processes can be important even at column densities of ∼1021 cm−2.

Gravitationally strongly lensed quasars (SL-QSO) offer invaluable insights into cosmological and astrophysical phenomena. With the data from ongoing and next-generation surveys, thousands of SL-QSO systems can be discovered expectedly, leading to unprecedented opportunities. However, the challenge lies in identifying SL-QSO from enormous data sets with high recall and purity in an automated and efficient manner. Hence, we developed a program based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) for finding SL-QSO from large-scale surveys and applied it to the Kilo-degree Survey Data Release 5. Our approach involves three key stages: first, we preselected 10 million bright objects (with r-band MAG_AUTO < 22), excluding stars from the data set; second, we established realistic training and test sets to train and fine-tune the CNN, resulting in the identification of 4195 machine candidates, and the false-positive rate of ∼1/2000 and recall of 0.8125 evaluated by using the real test set containing 16 confirmed lensed quasars; third, human inspections were performed for further selections, and then, 272 SL-QSO candidates were eventually found in total, including 16 high-score, 118 median-score, and 138 lower-score candidates, separately. Removing the systems already confirmed or identified in other papers, we end up with 229 SL-QSO candidates, including 7 high-score, 95 median-score, and 127 lower-score candidates, and the corresponding catalog is publicly available online (https://github.com/EigenHermit/H24). We have also included an excellent quad candidate in the Appendix, discovered serendipitously during the fine-tuning process of the CNN.

<title>Survival of the Fittest: Testing Superradiance Termination with Simulated Binary Black Hole Statistics</title>

The superradiance instability of rotating black holes (BHs) leads to the formation of an ultralight boson cloud with distinctive observational signatures, making BHs an effective probe of ultralight bosons. However, around BHs in a binary system, the superradiance effect of such clouds can be terminated by tidal perturbations from the companion, leading to cloud depletion. In this study, we focus on the superradiance of a scalar boson, and perform the first analysis of the impact of this termination effect on superradiant BH binaries, which are realistically modeled after their statistics in our Galaxy. Working with a data set of approximately 107 BH binaries simulated using the Stellar Evolution for N-body population synthesis code, we identify the superradiant candidates and those that manage to survive the termination effect. We then calculate the cloud survival rate for various boson masses and BH spin models. Our findings reveal that the l = m = 1 cloud modes are generally stable against termination, whereas the l = m = 2 modes can be significantly affected, with survival rates dropping below 10% for boson masses below approximately 0.5 × 10−12 eV. In addition, our analysis indicates that clouds that overcome termination typically exhibit a higher superradiant growth rate and therefore a higher detectability.

<title>Can the Dynamo of Spiral-arm Galaxies Be Explained by Anisotropic Conductivity?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The possibility of generating a magnetic field by a dynamo effect with anisotropic electrical conductivity rather than turbulent flow has been demonstrated theoretically and experimentally. If the electrical conductivity is anisotropic, the electrical currents will flow preferentially in certain directions rather than others, and a simple differential rotation will suffice to generate a magnetic field. In a galaxy with spiral arms, it is reasonable to assume that the electrical conductivity will be twice as large along the arms than in the perpendicular direction, suggesting the possibility of an anisotropic dynamo. However, a further geometrical criterion must be satisfied to obtain a dynamo. It is given by , where p is the pitch angle of the spiral arms, with , and is the radial shear of the angular velocity. We find that the usual spiral-arm galaxies, which satisfy , do not satisfy this dynamo condition because they have trailing arms instead of leading arms. Even galaxy NGC 4622, which has both trailing and leading arms, does not satisfy this dynamo condition either. This is confirmed by numerical simulations of the induction equation. Thus, for all spiral-arm galaxies known to date, the anisotropy of the spiral arms cannot explain the existence of galactic magnetic fields until further notice.

<title>Deep Learning for Active Region Classification: A Systematic Study from Convolutional Neural Networks to Vision Transformers</title>

Solar active regions can significantly disrupt the Sun–Earth space environment, leading to severe space weather events such as solar flares or coronal mass ejections. Consequently, the automatic classification of active region groups is a crucial starting point for accurately and promptly predicting solar activity. This study presents our application of deep learning techniques to classify active region cutouts based on the Mount Wilson classification scheme. We explore the latest advantages in image classification architectures, ranging from convolutional neural networks to vision transformers, alongside modern training procedures, including on-the-fly data augmentations and transfer learning. We aim at evaluating the respective strengths and limitations of different neural network architectures in classifying solar active region cutouts. We observed that combining magnetogram and continuum image types enhances model performance by leveraging complementary features from diverse inputs. When considering only magnetograms, data-efficient image transformers achieve the best performance, suggesting that these models can better capture the spatial complexity of magnetograms. Models trained exclusively on continuum images exhibit overall lower performance, suggesting that continuum images, due to their more homogeneous nature, offer less spatial variability.

<title>Galactic Structure Dependence of Cloud–Cloud-collision-driven Star Formation in the Barred Galaxy NGC 3627</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
While cloud–cloud collisions (CCCs) have been proposed as a mechanism for triggering massive star formation, it is suggested that higher collision velocities (vcol) and lower giant molecular cloud (GMC) mass (MGMC) and/or density (ΣGMC) tend to suppress star formation. In this study, we choose the nearby barred galaxy NGC 3627 to examine the star formation rate and star formation efficiency (SFE) of a colliding GMC ( and ϵCCC) and explore the connections between and ϵCCC, MGMC(ΣGMC) and vcol, and galactic structures (disk, bar, and bar end). Using Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array CO (2–1) data (60 pc resolution), we estimated vcol within 500 pc apertures, based on line-of-sight GMC velocities, assuming random motion in a two-dimensional plane. We extracted apertures where at least 0.1 collisions occur per 1 Myr, identifying them as regions dominated by CCC-driven star formation, and then calculated and ϵCCC using attenuation-corrected Hα data from MUSE on the Very Large Telescope. We found that both and ϵCCC are lower in the bar (median values: 103.84M⊙ and 0.18%) and higher in the bar end (104.89M⊙ and 1.10%) compared to the disk (104.28M⊙ and 0.75%). Furthermore, we found that structural differences within the parameter space of vcol and MGMC(ΣGMC), with higher MGMC(ΣGMC) in the bar end and higher vcol in the bar compared to the disk, lead to higher star formation activity in the bar end and lower activity in the bar. Our results support the scenario in which variations in CCC properties across different galactic structures can explain the observed differences in SFE on a kiloparsec scale within a disk galaxy.

<title>A Study of Abundance Patterns in the Sextans and Sculptor Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxies</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb57c</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb57c</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this work, we employ a multicomponent decomposition model to study the Sextans and Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxies, which have distinct evolutionary histories. Sextans exhibits massive stars dominating in the early stages of its evolution and a lower contribution from type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). With increasing metallicity, the evolution of massive stars in Sextans shows two turning points, at [Fe/H] ∼ −2.8 and [Fe/H] ∼ −2.0, indicating episodes of accretion events and galactic winds during its evolution. In the late stages, influenced by galactic winds, the contribution from massive stars ceases, and SNe Ia become the dominant evolutionary process. Sculptor exhibits contributions from the main r-process, early very massive stars, massive stars, SNe Ia, and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. In its early stages, the contributions from early very massive stars and massive stars are dominant, while the contribution from SNe Ia is low. Around [Fe/H] ∼ −2, the contribution from early very massive stars starts to decline, while the contributions from SNe Ia and massive stars continue to increase. At [Fe/H] ∼ −1.7, the contribution from massive stars gradually decreases and approaches the level of the solar neighborhood, while the contribution from AGB stars continues to rise with increasing metallicity. Both dwarf galaxies exhibit characteristic features of similar initial mass functions, but the Sextans dwarf galaxy exhibits a high-mass cutoff, while the Sculptor dwarf galaxy does not. Additionally, through decomposition, we can analyze the contributions of different astrophysical processes to [α/Fe] versus [Fe/H], [iron-group/Fe] versus [Fe/H], and [neutron-capture/Fe] versus [Fe/H].

<title>Dormancy and Reawakening over Years: Eight New Recurrent Changing-look AGNs</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adadf3</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report the discovery of eight new recurrent changing-look (CL) active galactic nuclei (AGNs), consisting of seven rebrightening turn-off AGNs and one fading turn-on AGN. These systems are valuable for placing constraints on the duration of dim and bright states, which may be linked to the AGN duty cycle or disk instability. Long-term analysis of optical light curves reveals that many objects in our sample exhibit a prolonged plateau during the dim states lasting 5–7 yr, with a gradual turn-on/off process. We observe no significant difference between the turn-on and turn-off timescales, and this timescale is broadly consistent with the propagation timescale for the heating/cooling front. Comparison between the optical and infrared variations supports the idea that these transitions are driven by changes in accretion disk emission rather than dust obscuration. Our discovery significantly increases the previously identified recurrent CL AGN sample, demonstrating that some AGNs can enter dormancy and reawaken on timescales of a few years, which provides useful information for understanding episodic AGN accretion.

<title>Introducing the Condor Array Telescope. VI. Discovery of Extensive Ionized Gaseous Filaments of the Cosmic Web in the Direction of the M81 Group</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We used the Condor Array Telescope to obtain deep imaging observations through luminance broadband and He ii, [O iii], He i, Hα, [N ii], and [S ii] narrowband filters of an extended region of the M81 Group spanning ≈8 × 8 deg2 on the sky centered near M81 and M82. Here, we report aspects of these observations that are specifically related to (1) a remarkable filament known as the “Ursa Major Arc” that stretches ≈30° across the sky roughly in the direction of Ursa Major, (2) a “giant shell of ionized gas” that stretches ≈0.8 deg across the sky located ≈0.6 deg northwest of M82, and (3) a remarkable network of ionized gaseous filaments revealed by the new Condor observations that appear to connect the arc, the shell, and various galaxies of the M81 Group and, by extension, the group itself. We measure flux ratios between the various ions to help to distinguish photoionized from shock-ionized gas, and we find that the flux ratios of the arc and shell are not indicative of shock ionization. This provides strong evidence against a previous interpretation of the arc as an interstellar shock produced by an unrecognized supernova. We suggest that all of these objects, including the arc, are associated with the M81 Group and are located at roughly the distance (≈3.6 Mpc) of M81, that the arc is an intergalactic filament, and that the objects are associated with the low-redshift cosmic web.

<title>Observing Rayleigh–Taylor Stable and Unstable Accretion Through a Kalman Filter Analysis of X-Ray Pulsars in the Small Magellanic Cloud</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Global, three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of Rayleigh–Taylor instabilities at the disk–magnetosphere boundary of rotating, magnetized compact stellar objects reveal that accretion occurs in three regimes: the stable regime, the chaotic unstable regime, and the ordered unstable regime. Here we track stochastic fluctuations in the pulse period P(t) and aperiodic X-ray luminosity L(t) time series of 24 accretion-powered pulsars in the Small Magellanic Cloud using an unscented Kalman filter to analyze Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer data. We measure time-resolved histories of the magnetocentrifugal fastness parameter ω(t) and we connect ω(t) with the three Rayleigh–Taylor accretion regimes. The 24 objects separate into two distinct groups, with 10 accreting in the stable regime and 14 accreting in the ordered unstable regime. None of the 24 objects except SXP 293 visit the chaotic unstable regime for sustained intervals, although several objects visit it sporadically. The Kalman filter output also reveals a positive temporal cross-correlation between ω(t) and the independently measured pulse amplitude A(t), which agrees with simulation predictions regarding the pulse-forming behavior of magnetospheric funnel flows in the three accretion regimes.

<title>A Study of Emission Lines in Carbon Stars</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Carbon stars are chemically peculiar stars with high carbon abundance, showing strong carbon molecule bands and rare emission lines in their spectra. This paper explores the stellar activity of carbon stars by identifying emission line features in their spectra. An outlier detection method based on morphological feature extraction and interval representation is used to identify 88 targets presenting emission lines from 3546 carbon star spectra. Of these, 55 targets present Balmer series emissions, 35 show forbidden lines ([O i]λ6301 Å, [O iii], [N ii], [S ii], with only 2 of the 35 spectra that present forbidden lines not showing [O i]) and only 2 objects presenting two types of emission lines, and 51 spectra showing Balmer series emissions are C-N stars. This indicates the existence of a continuous stellar wind forming shock waves around the star, suggesting the presence of mass loss or tidal effects and exchange of materials from the companion star. In addition, 23 spectra presenting [O i] emissions are from C-H carbon stars. These are mainly concentrated in a high-Galactic-latitude region with , where the influence of halo clusters could lead to relatively strong magnetic activity. Other objects in the Galactic disk may also show stronger magnetic activity due to the influence of a dense medium or magnetic field, rotation, and convection within stars. In addition, one spectrum shows both [O i] and Balmer series emissions, probably caused by magnetic activity and wave shock. Another spectrum shows both Balmer series and [O iii] emissions, presumably contaminated by an unknown nebula.

<title>You Shall Not Pass! The Propagation of Low-/Moderate-powered Jets Through a Turbulent Interstellar Medium</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Feedback from black-hole-powered jets has been invoked in many cosmological simulations to regulate star formation and quench galaxies. Despite this, observational evidence of how jets might be able to affect their hosts remains scarce, especially for low-power jets in halos smaller than clusters. Recent observations of outflows around FR0 galaxies, which host compact radio-loud sources, imply that lower-power jetted active galactic nuclei (AGN) may have a significant impact on their hosts through jet interactions with the interstellar medium (ISM). Using the Arepo code, we launch jets of low and intermediate power (1038–1043 erg s−1) within a ∼kiloparsec-scale periodic box with driven turbulence, to study how the jets propagate through a turbulent ISM. Our simulation results broadly fit into three different scenarios—jets penetrating easily through the ISM, becoming completely stalled, or, an interesting intermediate stage, jets being highly disturbed and redirected. We suggest that intermediate-power jets do not have enough ram pressure to affect the turbulent structure of the ISM and so only fill preexisting cavities. Low-power jets are able to drive outflows in a hot phase (>104.4 K). However, warm (∼104 K) ionized gas outflows appear under certain conditions. This work is part of the “Learning the Universe” collaboration, aiming to build next-generation cosmological simulations that incorporate a new prescription for AGN feedback.

Light–matter interactions lie at the heart of our exploration of exoplanetary atmospheres. Interpreting data obtained by remote sensing is enabled by meticulous, time- and resource-consuming work aiming at deepening our understanding of such interactions (i.e., opacity models). Recently, P. Niraula et al. pointed out that due primarily to limitations on our modeling of broadening and far-wing behaviors, opacity models needed a timely update for exoplanet exploration in the JWST era, and thus argued for a scalable approach. In this proof-of-concept study, we introduce an end-to-end solution from ab initio calculations to pressure broadening, and use a perturbation framework to address the need for precision to a level of ∼10%. We focus on the CO2–H2 system as CO2 is a key absorption feature for exoplanet research (primarily in many gas giants) at ∼4.3 μm as pressure-broadening parameters required for interpreting such observations remain sparse. We compute elastic and inelastic cross sections for the collisions of ortho-H2 with CO2, in the ground vibrational state, and at the coupled-channel fully converged level. For scattering energies above ∼20 cm−1, moderate precision intermolecular potentials are indistinguishable from high-precision ones in cross sections. Our calculations agree with the currently available measurements within 7%, i.e., well beyond the precision requirements.

<title>The Evolution of Molecular Clouds: Turbulence-regulated Global Radial Collapse</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb131</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The star formation efficiency (SFE) measures the proportion of molecular gas converted into stars, while the star formation rate (SFR) indicates the rate at which gas is transformed into stars. Here we propose such a model in the framework of a turbulence-regulated global radial collapse in molecular clouds being in quasi-virial equilibrium, where the collapse velocity depends on the density profile and the initial mass-to-radius ratio of molecular clouds, with the collapse velocity accelerating during the collapse process. This simplified analytical model allows us to estimate a lifetime of giant molecular clouds of approximately 0.44−7.36 × 107 yr, and a star formation timescale of approximately 0.5–5.88 × 106 yr. Additionally, we can predict an SFE of approximately 1.59%, and an SFR of roughly 1.85 M⊙ yr−1 for the Milky Way in agreement with observations.

<title>The Stationary Point: A New Method for Solar Wind Speed Measurements from a Moving Vantage Point</title>

The WISPR imager on Parker Solar Probe (PSP) provides a unique view of the young solar wind as it flies through solar wind structures at high speed. It is of interest to use WISPR image sequences to measure the velocity of both large features (such as coronal mass ejections) and the background, ambient wind. However, WISPR’s close-up, rapidly moving perspective makes the usual methods for measuring velocities from images difficult or impossible to apply, as most apparent motion through the image is due to the motion or rotation of the imager. In this work, we propose a new method of looking for features at the “stationary point”—a direction from which some plasma parcels appear to approach the spacecraft, remaining at a constant direction in the image sequence. This direction is a function of the plasma’s radial velocity, the encounter geometry, and the spacecraft velocity, allowing the former two to be inferred. We demonstrate the technique with forward-modeled images, and we apply it to WISPR observations, inferring the speed and trajectory of a particular density feature. This method promises to enable speed measurements of the young solar wind in an important acceleration region, from a close-up perspective and at latitudes well outside the PSP orbital plane. And while we present this method in a solar wind context, it is broadly applicable to any situation of a moving viewpoint traveling through an expanding cloud of features.

<title>Revision of Two-temperature Magnetically Arrested Flows onto a Black Hole</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We revisit the radiative properties of 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) two-temperature magnetically arrested disk (MAD) models in which electrons are heated by a magnetic turbulent cascade. We focus on studying the model emission, whose characteristics include variability in both total intensity and linear/circular polarizations as well as rotation measures at energies around the synchrotron emission peak in millimeter waves. We find that the radiative properties of MAD models with turbulent electron heating are well converged with respect to the numerical grid resolution, which has not been demonstrated before. We compare radiation from two-temperature simulations with turbulent heating to single-temperature models with electron temperatures calculated based on the commonly used R(β) prescription. We find that the self-consistent two-temperature models with turbulent heating do not significantly outperform the R(β) models and, in practice, may be indistinguishable from the R(β) models. Accounting for physical effects such as radiative cooling and the nonthermal electron distribution function makes a weak impact on properties of millimeter emission. Models are scaled to Sgr A*, an accreting black hole in the center of our galaxy, and compared to the most complete observational data sets. We point out the consistencies and inconsistencies between the MAD models and observations of this source and discuss future prospects for GRMHD simulations.

<title>X-Ray Spectra from General Relativistic Radiation Magnetohydrodynamic Simulations of Thin Disks</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We compare X-ray emission from several general relativistic, multifrequency, radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations of thin black hole accretion disks with different accretion rates and spins. The simulations were performed using the M1 closure scheme, resolved with 12 frequency (energy) bins logarithmically spaced from 5 × 10−3 to 5 × 103 keV. We apply a general relativistic Monte Carlo transport code to postprocess the simulation data with greater fidelity in frequency resolution and Compton scattering treatment. Despite the relatively few energy bins and Kompaneets approximation to Compton scattering utilized in the M1 method, we find generally good agreement between the methods. Both produce prominent thermal profiles with peaks around 2–2.5 keV, where agreement is particularly strong and representative of the soft state. Both also find weaker (lower-luminosity) thermally sourced emission extending out to 100 keV due to the hotter innermost regions of the disks. Inverse Compton scattering becomes increasingly effective at hardening spectral outputs with increasing black hole spin, and becomes the dominant mechanism for photons that escape with energies between 10 to several hundred keV. At very high rates of spin, the radiation flux in this upscattered component becomes comparable to the thermal flux, a phenomenon typically associated with intermediate states. Beyond 104 keV, we observe faint, free–free emission from hot, optically thin coronal regions developing near the horizon, common to both spinning and nonspinning black holes.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report the discovery of PSR J0031–5726 in the Galactic and Extragalactic All-sky Murchison Widefield Array Extended imaging survey at a Galactic latitude of b ≈ −60∘. The pulsar exhibits both sporadic, extremely bright pulses reminiscent of rotating radio transients (RRATs) as well as persistent, dimmer pulses. The bright pulses tend to arrive at later rotation phases than their dimmer counterparts and have dramatically varying polarization angle curves, such that the integrated profile appears almost completely depolarized down to the system noise level. The rotation measure of individual pulses was found to sometimes vary by up to ∼0.8 rad m−2, but was otherwise generally consistent with its average (ionosphere-corrected) value of 10.0 ± 0.1 rad m−2. We surmise that J0031–5726 may represent a class of pulsars that is intermediate between normal pulsars and RRATs.

<title>Amplifying Resonant Repulsion with Inflated Young Planets, Overlooked Inner Planets, and Nonzero Initial Δ</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Most multiplanet systems around mature (∼5 Gyr old) host stars are nonresonant. Even the near-resonant planet pairs still display 1%–2% positive deviation from perfect period commensurabilities (Δ) near first-order mean motion resonances (MMRs). Resonant repulsion due to eccentricity tides was one of the first mechanisms proposed to explain the observed positive Δ. However, the inferred rates of tidal dissipation are often implausibly rapid (with a reduced tidal quality factor ). In this work, we attempt to amplify eccentricity tides with three previously ignored effects. (1) Planets tend to be inflated when they were younger. (2) Kepler-like planets likely form as resonant chains parked at the disk inner edge; overlooked inner planets could have contributed to tidal dissipation of the whole system. (3) Disk migration captures planets into first-order MMR with nonzero initial deviation Δ, thereby lowering the amount of dissipation needed. We show that even after accounting for all three effects, can only be amplified by about 1 order of magnitude, and still falls short of values of solar system planets. Therefore, eccentricity tides alone cannot fully explain the observed Δ distribution. Other effects such as obliquity tides, planetesimal scattering, expanding disk inner edge, disk turbulence, divergent encounters, and dynamical instabilities must have contributed to dislodging planets from first-order MMR.

<title>Contaminating Electromagnetic Transients in LISA Gravitational-wave Localization Volumes. I. The Intrinsic Rates</title>

The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will soon detect gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by massive black hole (MBH) mergers. Some theoretical models have predicted transient electromagnetic (EM) emission from these mergers, enabling the association of LISA GW sources with their EM counterparts via telescope follow-up. However, the number of unrelated EM transients that might contaminate telescope searches for the true transient counterparts of LISA MBH mergers is unknown. We investigate the expected numbers of unrelated EM transients that will coincide with simulated LISA localization volumes of MBH mergers as a function of the merger total mass and redshift. We find that the number of potential contaminants in LISA localization volumes drops to unity for mergers at z ≲ 0.8 and at 1 hr before coalescence. After coalescence, the parameter space corresponding to a maximum of one potential contaminant expands to z ≲ 1.5. In contrast, if the redshifts for all transients detected in LISA sky localization regions are not available, the number of potential contaminants increases by an average factor of ∼100 and never drops below unity. Overall, we expect the average number of contaminating transients in telescope follow-up of LISA MBH mergers to be nonnegligible, especially without redshift information for the detected transients. We recommend that endeavors designing follow-up strategies of LISA events should focus on (1) building large redshift catalogs for host galaxies, (2) developing robust real-time transient classification algorithms, and (3) coordinating telescope resources to obtain redshifts for candidate transient EM counterparts in a timely manner.

<title>Radial Evolution of a Density Structure within a Solar Wind Magnetic Sector Boundary</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb39a</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb39a</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study focuses on a radial alignment between Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar Orbiter (SolO) on 2021 April 29 (during a solar minimum), when the two spacecraft were, respectively, located at ∼0.075 and ∼0.9 au from the Sun. A previous study of this alignment allowed the identification of the same density enhancement (with a timescale of ∼1.5 hr) and substructures (timescales of ∼20–30 minutes), passing first by PSP and then by SolO after a ∼138 hr propagation time in the inner heliosphere. We show here that this structure belongs to the large-scale heliospheric magnetic sector boundary. In this region, the density is dominated by radial gradients, whereas the magnetic field reversal is consistent with longitudinal gradients in the Carrington reference frame. We estimate the density structure radial size to remain of the order LR ∼ 106 km, while its longitudinal and latitudinal sizes are estimated to expand from Lφ,θ ∼ 104–105 km in the high solar corona to Lφ,θ ∼ 105–106 km at PSP and Lφ,θ ∼ 106–107 km at SolO. This implies a strong evolution of the structure’s aspect ratio during the propagation, due to the plasma’s nearly spherical expansion. The structure’s shape is therefore inferred to evolve from elongated in the radial direction at ∼2–3 solar radii (high corona) to sizes of nearly the same order in all directions at PSP and then becoming elongated in the directions transverse to the radial at SolO. Measurements are not concordant with local reconnection of open solar wind field lines, so we propose that the structure has been generated through interchange reconnection near the tip of a coronal streamer.

<title>Simultaneous Existence of Oscillations, Counterstreaming Flows, and Mass Injections in Solar Quiescent Prominences</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Solar prominences are very spectacular structures embedded in the tenuous and hot solar corona. Counterstreaming flows, a common feature in solar quiescent prominences, have been discovered for more than 20 yr. However, the mechanism driving the counterstreaming flows is still elusive. To unveil the nature of this phenomenon, we analyzed data of a quiescent prominence observed by the New Vacuum Solar Telescope, the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph, and the Solar Dynamical Observatory. It is found that there is a distinct longitudinal oscillation of prominence plasma along the higher part of the prominence spine in Hα observations. The oscillation period is approximately 83 minutes and the amplitude is about 32 Mm. The counterstreaming flows are dominant in the middle part of the prominence spine. The velocities of the counterstreaming flows range from about 4 to 11 km s−1. Moreover, intermittent mass flows with upward plumes from the top of the bubbles and tornado-like barbs are observed to be injected into the lower part of the prominence spine from the lower atmosphere. The velocities of these injected mass flows range from about 3 to 30 km s−1. Some injected mass flows exhibit redshifted Doppler signals, while others exhibit blueshifted signals. Based on these high-resolution observations, it is found that different parts of the prominence spine exhibit different dynamic characteristics. These results further advance the understanding of the ubiquitous counterstreaming flows in solar quiescent prominences.

<title>Early Accretion of Large Amounts of Solids for Directly Imaged Exoplanets</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
As the number of planetary-mass objects (PMOs; ⪅13 MJupiter) at wider separation (⪆10 au) grows, there is emerging evidence that they form differently from their higher-mass brown dwarf counterparts. Specifically, PMOs’ atmospheres are often enriched by metals and show a large dispersion of metallicity, which is usually interpreted as a sign of solid accretion. As a first step toward a population-level study of the amount and timing of solid accretion, we analyze a sample of seven directly imaged exoplanets with measured stellar and planetary chemical abundances (51 Eri b, β Pic b, HIP 65426 b, HR 8799c and e, AF Lep b, and YSES 1 c). Our analysis uses existing data of stellar and planetary atmospheric metallicities and adopts a Bayesian framework that marginalizes the probabilities of disk conditions, formation locations, planetary interior structures, and accretion physics. We show that these PMOs accrete large amounts of solids regardless of whether they form via core accretion or disk instability. On average, ⪆50 M⊕ of solids are accreted to enrich planet atmospheres. An individual planet accretes between 23.3 and 223.2 M⊕ of solid mass, more than 75% of which is assumed to stay in the atmosphere and increase the observed metallicity. The result implies that the solid accretion process and therefore the planet formation process likely take place at an early stage (⪅2 Myr) when large amounts of solids are available in young massive protoplanetary disks.

<title>Connecting Dust and Outflows in Active Galactic Nuclei: The Intriguing Case of NGC 6860</title>

Cosmic dust plays a crucial role in the evolution of galaxies, significantly influencing star formation and the interstellar medium. However, in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), the role and origin of dust remain poorly understood. High-resolution X-ray spectroscopy is a powerful tool for probing the properties of dust in AGN. NGC 6860, an X-ray bright type-1 quasar, is an ideal target for investigating the connection between dust and winds in AGN. It exhibits reddening and X-ray absorption by both dust and winds. By modeling high-resolution X-ray spectra from XMM-Newton and Chandra observations, we determine the properties of dust and outflows in this AGN. Our analysis finds four photoionized components, outflowing with velocities of 50–300 km s−1. The first two are relatively highly ionized with and . The results of our photoionization modeling suggest that these two components are thermally unstable. The third component is ionized, with , and is located farther away from the central black hole. The fourth component is less ionized and is possibly located in the host galaxy. The application of dust models enables us to probe the abundance and location of the dust in NGC 6860. Our findings suggest that dust absorption and reddening originates from the extended narrow-line region and its host galaxy.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present measurements of the gas-phase oxygen and nitrogen abundances obtained by applying the direct method to JWST NIRspec R ∼ 1000 spectroscopy for six galaxies at redshift greater than 3. Our measurements are based on rest-frame optical nitrogen [N ii]λλ6548,6583 lines and are complemented by six additional objects from the literature at 3 ≤ z ≤ 6. We find that 9 out of 12 objects have values of log(N/O) that are compatible with those found for low-redshift, metal-poor, dwarf galaxies and for H ii regions of more luminous local galaxies. However, 3 out of 12 objects have log(N/O) values that are overabundant compared to what is expected on the basis of their oxygen abundance. We explore a few standard scenarios to explain the observations and conclude that, within the limited statistics available to us, none of them can be definitely excluded even though we prefer dilution by pristine gas infall in between star formation bursts, as this is predicted by simulations to take place as a natural part of bursty star formation.

<title>A New Spectral Library for Modeling the Surfaces of Hot, Rocky Exoplanets</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada9eb</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada9eb</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
JWST’s MIRI LRS provides the first opportunity to spectroscopically characterize the surface compositions of close-in terrestrial exoplanets. Models for the bare-rock spectra of these planets often utilize a spectral library from R. Hu et al., which is based on room-temperature reflectance measurements of materials that represent archetypes of rocky planet surfaces. Here we present an expanded library that includes hemispherical reflectance measurements for a greater variety of compositions, varying textures (solid slab, coarsely crushed, and fine powder), as well as high-temperature (500–800 K) emissivity measurements for select samples. We incorporate this new library into version 6.3 of the open-source retrieval package PLATON and use it to show that planetary surfaces with similar compositions can have widely varying albedos and surface temperatures. We additionally demonstrate that changing the texture of a material can significantly alter its albedo, making albedo a poor proxy for surface composition. We identify key spectral features—the 5.6 μm olivine feature, the transparency feature, the Si-O stretching feature, and the Christiansen feature—that indicate silicate abundance and surface texture. We quantify the number of JWST observations needed to detect these features in the spectrum of the most favorable super-Earth target, LHS 3844 b, and revisit the interpretation of its Spitzer photometry. Lastly, we show that temperature-dependent changes in spectral features are likely undetectable at the precision of current exoplanet observations. Our results illustrate the importance of spectroscopically resolved thermal emission measurements, as distinct from surface albedo constraints, for characterizing the surface compositions of hot, rocky exoplanets.

<title>A Planet Candidate Orbiting near the Hot Jupiter TOI-2818 b Inferred through Transit Timing</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adac63</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adac63</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
TOI-2818 b is a hot Jupiter orbiting a slightly evolved G-type star on a 4.04 day orbit that shows transit timing variations (TTVs) suggestive of a decreasing orbital period. In the most recent year of TESS observations, transits were observed ∼8 minutes earlier than expected for a constant period. The implied orbital decay rate is 1.35 ± 0.25 s yr−1, too fast to be explained by tidal dissipation, even considering the evolved nature of the host star. Radial velocity (RV) monitoring and astrometric data make the possibility of perturbations from a long-period companion unlikely; further Doppler spectroscopy observations can efficiently confirm or rule out such a companion. Apsidal precession due to the tidal distortion of the planet is also physically implausible. The most plausible explanation for the TTVs appears to be gravitational perturbations from a hitherto undetected planet with mass ≲10 M⊕ that is in (or near) a mean-motion resonance with the hot Jupiter. Such a planet could be responsible for the observed TTVs while avoiding detection with the available RV and transit data.

<title>Effect of Deviations from General Relativity on Searches for Gravitational-wave Microlensing and Type II Strong Lensing</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
As the gravitational-wave (GW) detector network is upgraded and the sensitivity of the detectors improves, novel scientific avenues open for exploration. For example, tests of general relativity (GR) will become more accurate as smaller deviations can be probed. Additionally, the detection of lensed GWs becomes more likely. However, these new avenues could also interact with each other, and a GW event presenting deviations from GR could be mistaken for a lensed one. Here, we explore how phenomenological deviations from GR or binaries of exotic compact objects could impact those lensing searches focusing on a single event. We consider strong lensing, millilensing, and microlensing, and find that certain phenomenological deviations from GR may be mistaken for all of these types of lensing. Therefore, our study shows that future candidate lensing events would need to be carefully examined to avoid a false claim of lensing where instead a deviation from GR has been seen.

<title>SOFIA Polarization Spectrum of Three Star-forming Clouds</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada447</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The dust emission polarization spectrum—how the polarization percentage changes with wavelength—serves as a probe of dust grain properties in star-forming regions. In this paper, we present 89–214 μm polarization spectrum measurements obtained from SOFIA/HAWC+ for three star-forming clouds: OMC1, M17, and W3. We find that all three clouds have an overall decreasing polarization percentage with increasing wavelength (i.e., a “falling polarization spectrum”). We use SOFIA and Herschel data to create column density and temperature maps for each cloud. We fit for the slope of the polarization spectrum at each sky position in each cloud, and using the Pearson r coefficient, we probe each cloud for possible correlations of slope with column density and slope with temperature. We also create plots of slope versus column density and slope versus temperature for each cloud. For the case of OMC1, our results are consistent with those presented by J. Michail et al., who carried out a similar analysis for that cloud. Our plots of polarization spectrum slope versus column density reveal that for each cloud there exists a critical column density below which a falling polarization spectrum is not observed. For these more diffuse sight lines, the polarization spectrum is instead flat or slightly rising. This finding is consistent with a hypothesis presented 25 yr ago in a paper led by R. Hildebrand based on Kuiper Airborne Observatory data. This hypothesis is that regions shielded from near-IR radiation are required to produce a sharply falling polarization spectrum.

<title>Search for Neutrino Emission from Hard X-Ray AGN with IceCube</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are promising candidate sources of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos, since they provide environments rich in matter and photon targets where cosmic-ray interactions may lead to the production of gamma rays and neutrinos. We searched for high-energy neutrino emission from AGN using the Swift-BAT Spectroscopic Survey catalog of hard X-ray sources and 12 yr of IceCube muon track data. First, upon performing a stacked search, no significant emission was found. Second, we searched for neutrinos from a list of 43 candidate sources and found an excess from the direction of two sources, the Seyfert galaxies NGC 1068 and NGC 4151. We observed NGC 1068 at flux = TeV−1 cm−2 s−1 normalized at 1 TeV, with a power-law spectral index γ = 3.10 , consistent with previous IceCube results. The observation of a neutrino excess from the direction of NGC 4151 is at a posttrial significance of 2.9σ. If interpreted as an astrophysical signal, the excess observed from NGC 4151 corresponds to a flux = TeV−1 cm−2 s−1 normalized at 1 TeV and γ = 2.83 .

<title>B-fields and Dust in Interstellar Filaments Using Dust Polarization (BALLAD-POL). III. Grain Alignment and Disruption Mechanisms in G34.43+0.24 Using Polarization Observations from JCMT/POL-2</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Polarization of starlight and thermal dust emission due to aligned non-spherical grains helps us to trace magnetic field (B-field) morphology in molecular clouds and to study grain alignment mechanisms. In this work, we study grain alignment and disruption mechanisms in a filamentary infrared dark cloud G34.43+0.24 using thermal dust polarization observations from JCMT/POL-2 at 850 μm. We study three regions: the North harboring the MM3 core, the Center harboring the MM1 and MM2 cores, and the South harboring no core. We find the decrease in polarization fraction P with increasing total intensity and gas column density, known as polarization hole. To disentangle the effect of magnetic field tangling on the polarization hole, we estimate the polarization angle dispersion function. We find depolarizations in the North and Center regions are due to a decrease in the net alignment efficiency of grains, but in the South region, the effect of magnetic field tangling is significant to cause depolarization. To test whether the radiative torque (RAT) mechanism can reproduce the observational data, we calculate minimum alignment and disruption sizes of grains using RAT theory, and our study finds that the RAT alignment (RAT-A) mechanism can explain the depolarizations in the North and Center regions where the B-field tangling effect is less important, except for core regions. We find hints of RAT disruption (RAT-D) in the core regions of MM3 in the North, and MM1 and MM2 in the Center. We also find that the high P value of around 8%–20% in the outer regions of the filament can potentially be explained by the magnetically enhanced RAT alignment mechanism.

<title>A Detailed Look at a Trio of Changing-look Quasars: Spectral Energy Distributions and the Dust Extinction Test* †</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Changing-look quasars (CLQs) exhibit dramatic variability in broad emission-line fluxes on short timescales. This behavior is challenging to many models of the quasar broad-line region, due in large part to the short transition times between high and low states. In order to constrain the cause of the dramatic variability, we obtained contemporaneous Hubble Space Telescope ultraviolet and Hobby Eberly Telescope optical spectra of three CLQs caught in their low state. We use these spectra, along with archival spectra taken during both the high and low states, to investigate potential scenarios for the change in state. Our data strongly disfavor a variable dust obscuration scenario for these three CLQs, and instead suggest that the observed transformation reflects a change in the intrinsic luminosity of the central engine. We also find that the low-state spectral energy distributions of all three quasars are reminiscent of those of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei, which suggests that the transition may result from a change in accretion flow structure caused by a reduced Eddington ratio.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a 5 month NICER X-ray monitoring campaign for two low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs)—NGC 4594 and IC 1459—with complementary Swift and NuSTAR observations. Utilizing an absorbed power-law and thermal source model combined with NICER’s SCORPEON background model, we demonstrate the effectiveness of joint source–background modeling for constraining emission from faint, background-dominated targets. Both sources are dominated by nuclear power-law emission with photon indices Γ ∼ 1.5–2, with NGC 4594 being slightly harder than IC 1459. The thermal contribution in both sources is fainter, but constant, with kT ∼ 0.5 keV (∼5 × 106 K). The power-law flux and Γ are strongly anticorrelated in both sources, as has been seen for other LLAGNs with radiatively inefficient accretion flows. NGC 4594 is the brighter source and exhibits significant aperiodic variability. Its variability timescale with an upper limit of 5–7 days indicates emission originating from ≲100 rg, at the scale of the inner accretion flow. A spectral break found at ∼6 keV, while tentative, could arise from synchrotron/inverse Compton emission. This high-cadence LLAGN X-ray monitoring campaign underlines the importance of multiwavelength variability studies for a sample of LLAGNs to truly understand their accretion and outflow physics.

Many of the stars in the Galaxy are members of binary systems, the widest of which can eventually become disrupted due to a combination of kicks from passing objects and the Galactic tidal field. If the Galactic disk were purely axisymmetric, the stars from a disrupted binary system would slowly drift apart on nearly identical orbits. We study how the existence of nonaxisymmetric structures, such as a rigidly rotating bar, can greatly alter this picture. In particular, we show how the orbital dynamics near the resonances sourced by these nonaxisymmetric perturbations create local fluctuations in the distribution of disrupted binary separations. We simulate the evolution of wide binary systems embedded in a gravitational potential with a rotating galactic bar, and show how features and fluctuations in the distribution of disrupted binaries can be used to locate bar resonances and constrain the bar’s pattern speed and amplitude.

<title>On Gamma Rays as Predictors of Ultra-high-energy Cosmic-Ray Flux in Active Galactic Nuclei</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are among the main candidates for ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray (UHECR) sources. However, while some theoretical and phenomenological works favor AGNs as the main sources, recent works have shown that using the very-high-energy γ-ray flux as a proxy for the UHECR flux leads to a bad agreement with data. In this context, the energy spectrum and composition data are hardly fitted. At the same time, the arrival directions map is badly described and a spurious dipole direction is produced. In this work, we propose a possible solution to these contradictions. Using the observed γ-ray flux as a proxy may carry the implicit assumption of beamed UHECR emission and, consequently, its beam will remain collimated up to its detection on Earth. We show that assuming an isotropic UHECR emission and correcting the γ-ray emission proxy by Doppler boosting can overcome the problem. The combined fit of the spectrum and composition is improved, with a change of reduced χ2 from 4.6 to 3.1. In particular, the tension between the observed and modeled dipole directions can be reduced from 5.9 (2.1)σ away from the data to 3.5 (1.1)σ for E > 8 EeV (E > 32 EeV). We also show that this effect is particularly important when including AGNs of different classes in the same analysis, such as radio galaxies and blazars.

<title>RIOJA. Complex Dusty Starbursts in a Major Merger B14-65666 at z = 7.15</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present JWST NIRCam imaging of B14-65666 (“Big Three Dragons”), a bright Lyman-break galaxy system (MUV = −22.5 mag) at z = 7.15. The high angular resolution of NIRCam reveals the complex morphology of two galaxy components: galaxy E has a compact core (E-core), surrounded by diffuse, extended, rest-frame optical emission, which is likely to be tidal tails; and galaxy W has a clumpy and elongated morphology with a blue UV slope (βUV = −2.2 ± 0.1). The flux excess, F356W − F444W, peaks at the E-core ( mag), tracing the presence of strong [O iii] λλ4960,5008 emission. Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array archival data show that the bluer galaxy W is brighter in dust continua than the redder galaxy E, while the tails are bright in [O iii] 88 μm. The UV/optical and submillimeter spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting confirms that B14-65666 is a major merger in a starburst phase as derived from the stellar mass ratio (3:1 to 2:1) and the star formation rate, ≃1 dex higher than the star formation main sequence at the same redshift. Galaxy E is a dusty (AV = 1.2 ± 0.1 mag) starburst with a possible high dust temperature (≥63–68 K). Galaxy W would have a low dust temperature (≤27–33 K) or patchy stellar-and-dust geometry, as suggested by the IR excess and βUV diagram. The high optical-to-far-IR [O iii] line ratio of the E-core shows its lower gas-phase metallicity (≃0.2–0.4 Z⊙) than galaxy W. These results agree with a scenario where major mergers disturb morphology and induce nuclear dusty starbursts triggered by less-enriched inflows. B14-65666 shows a picture of complex stellar buildup processes during major mergers in the epoch of reionization.

<title>A Spectroscopic Analysis of the Ionizing Photon Production Efficiency in JADES and CEERS: Implications for the Ionizing Photon Budget</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb1ab</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We have used a combined sample of JADES and CEERS objects in order to constrain ionizing photon production efficiency (ξion) from JWST/NIRSpec and JWST/NIRCam data. We examine 163 objects at 1.06 < z < 6.71 with significant (3σ) spectroscopic detections of Hα and Hβ in order to constrain intrinsic Hα luminosities corrected from nebular dust attenuation via Balmer decrements. We constrain dust-corrected UV luminosities from best-fit spectral energy distribution modeling. We find a sample median , assuming fesc = 0 for the escape fraction of Lyman continuum (LyC) emission. We find significant (Spearman rs = 0.19, p = 0.01) correlation between ξion,0 and z, with objects at z > 4.64 having median , with those below having . We also find significant, positive correlations between ξion,0 and LUV; Wλ([O iii]); [O iii]λ5007/[O ii]λλ3726, 3729; and inverse correlations with metallicity. In contrast with some previous results, we find no trends between ξion,0 and stellar mass, stellar dust attenuation, or UV slope. Applying a multivariate fit to ξion,0, z, and MUV to an empirically motivated model of reionization, and folding in fesc estimates from direct observations of the LyC at z ∼ 3 from the Keck Lyman Continuum Spectroscopic Survey, we find that the number of ionizing photons entering the IGM causes reionization to end at z ∼ 5–7.

<title>Unimolecular Chemical Kinetics in the Interstellar Environment: Competition of Infrared Radiation and Collision Activation Mechanisms</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb1df</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb1df</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Unimolecular gas phase chemical reactions could be activated by both infrared (IR) radiation and intermolecular collision in the interstellar environment. Understanding the interplay and competition between the radiation and collision activation mechanisms is crucial for assessing accurate reaction rate constants with an appropriate model. In this work, guided by an extended version of the Lindemann theory, we show that the relative importance of the two mechanisms can be measured by a dimensionless number PR that is the ratio of the collision frequency to the radiation absorption rate of the molecule. The reaction kinetics is dominated by collision activation or radiation activation depending on whether PR is larger or smaller than a reference value PR*, which is determined to be PR* ≈ 10 based on magnitudes of molecular properties, and is verified by detailed calculations of a number of typical interstellar unimolecular reactions. The determination of the PR number requires only information on the environment and molecular properties rather than detailed simulations of chemical reactions; thus, the PR number can serve as an indicator for a priori evaluations before detailed calculations. This method of evaluating the relative importance of the two mechanisms is checked against master equation calculations of two interstellar reactions, the dissociation reaction of silicic acid around an asymptotic giant branch star and the methyl radical association in Titan’s atmosphere, and the validity is verified. The method can be used in the future to help determine the appropriate and effective modeling approach for chemical reactions in astrophysical environments.

<title>Multiwavelength Observations of a Jet Launch in Real Time from the Post-changing-look Active Galaxy 1ES 1927+654</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adaea0</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adaea0</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present results from a high-cadence multiwavelength observational campaign of the enigmatic changing-look active galactic nucleus 1ES 1927+654 from 2022 May to 2024 April, coincident with an unprecedented radio flare (an increase in flux by a factor of ∼60 over a few months) and the emergence of a spatially resolved jet at 0.1–0.3 pc scales. Companion work has also detected a recurrent quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in the 2–10 keV band with an increasing frequency (1–2 mHz) over the same period. During this time, the soft X-rays (0.3–2 keV) monotonically increased by a factor of ∼8, while the UV emission remained nearly steady with <30% variation and the 2–10 keV flux showed variation by a factor ≲2. The weak variation of the 2–10 keV X-ray emission and the stability of the UV emission suggest that the magnetic energy density and accretion rate are relatively unchanged and that the jet could be launched owing to a reconfiguration of the magnetic field (toroidal to poloidal) close to the black hole. Advecting poloidal flux onto the event horizon would trigger the Blandford–Znajek mechanism, leading to the onset of the jet. The concurrent softening of the coronal slope (from Γ = 2.70 ± 0.04 to Γ = 3.27 ± 0.04), the appearance of a QPO, and the low coronal temperature ( ) during the radio outburst suggest that the poloidal field reconfiguration can significantly impact coronal properties and thus influence jet dynamics. These extraordinary findings in real time are crucial for coronal and jet plasma studies, particularly as our results are independent of coronal geometry.

<title>A Second Radio Flare from the Tidal Disruption Event AT2020vwl: A Delayed Outflow Ejection?</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb0b1</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb0b1</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the discovery of a second radio flare from the tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2020vwl via long-term monitoring radio observations. Late-time radio flares from TDEs are being discovered more commonly, with many TDEs showing radio emission thousands of days after the stellar disruption, but the mechanism that powers these late-time flares is uncertain. Here, we present radio spectral observations of the first and second radio flares observed from the TDE AT2020vwl. Through detailed radio spectral monitoring, we find evidence for two distinct outflow ejection episodes or a period of renewed energy injection into the preexisting outflow. We deduce that the second radio flare is powered by an outflow that is initially slower than the first flare but carries more energy and shows tentative indication of accelerating over time. Through modelling the long-term optical and UV emission from the TDE as arising from an accretion disk, we infer that the second radio outflow launch or energy injection episode occurred approximately at the time of the peak accretion rate. The fast decay of the second flare precludes environmental changes as an explanation, while the velocity of the outflow is at all times too low to be explained by an off-axis relativistic jet. Future observations that search for any link between the accretion disk properties and late-time radio flares from TDEs will aid understanding of what powers the radio outflows in TDEs and confirm if multiple outflow ejections or energy injection episodes are common.

<title>On the Magnetic and Thermodynamic Properties of Dark Fibrils in the Chromosphere</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb0b4</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb0b4</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Fibrillar structures are ubiquitous in the solar chromosphere. An accurate determination of their properties requires the use of advanced high-resolution observations, which are now becoming broadly available from different observatories. We exploit the capabilities of multi-atom, multiline spectropolarimetric inversions using the Stockholm Inversion Code. Non–local thermodynamic equilibrium inversions of a fibril-rich area are performed using spectropolarimetric observations on the Ca ii 854.2 nm line obtained with the CRISP imaging spectropolarimeter and spectroscopic observations on the Ca ii H line obtained with the CHROMospheric Imaging Spectrometer at the Swedish 1 m Solar Telescope. Additionally, co-observations on the Mg ii h and k lines obtained with the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph are used in the inversions to better constrain the thermodynamic properties of the fibrils. The incorporation of multiple atomic species and spectral lines proves to better constrain the properties of the plasma constituting the fibrils. In particular, the tracing of a large number of fibrils allowed for the study of the variation of the temperature and magnetic field along their projected length over the field of view. The results provide a view of fibrils possessing hot footpoints of about 5900 K. The temperature drop away from the footpoints is on average 250 K, with a larger drop of around 500 K for the longer fibrils. The magnetic field is also reported to be larger at the footpoints, being almost twice as large as the minimum value reported at the middle point of the fibrils.

<title>Unusual X-Ray Oxygen Line Ratios of SN 1987A Arising from the Absorption of Galactic Hot Interstellar Medium</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb0b5</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb0b5</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Recent high-resolution X-ray spectroscopic studies have revealed unusual oxygen line ratios, such as the high O vii forbidden-to-resonance ratio, in several supernova remnants. While the physical origin is still under debate, for most of them it has been suggested that this phenomenon arises from either charge exchange (CX) or resonant scattering (RS). In this work, we report the high O vii G-ratio (≳1) and high O viii Lyβ/Lyα ratio (≳0.2) found in multiepoch XMM-Newton Reflection Grating Spectrometer observations of SN 1987A. The line ratios cannot be fully explained by nonequilibrium ionization effects, CX, or RS. We suggest the absorption of foreground hot gas as the most likely origin, which plays the major role in modifying line fluxes and line ratios. Based on this scenario, we introduced two Gaussian absorption components at the O vii resonance line and the O viii Lyα line and constrained the optical depth of the two lines as τO VII ∼ 0.6 and τO VIII ∼ 0.2. We estimated the temperature as kTe ∼ 0.15 keV and the oxygen column density as NO ∼0.5 × 1016 cm−2 for the absorbing gas, which is consistent with the hot interstellar medium in the Galactic halo. Neglecting this absorption component may lead to an underestimation of the O abundance. We revised the O abundance of SN 1987A, which is increased by ∼20% compared with previous results. The N/O ratio by number of atoms is revised to be ∼1.2.

<title>Powerful Explosions from the Collapse of Rotating Supermassive Stars</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb0b8</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We perform new general relativistic hydrodynamics simulations for collapses of rotating supermassive star cores with an approximate nuclear burning up to carbon and a detailed equation of state. For all the models we investigate, the energy generation by nuclear burning plays only a minor role, leading to the formation of a black hole without a nuclear-powered explosion. For rotating models, however, the stellar explosion associated with shock heating is driven from a torus, which forms after the black hole formation. The explosion energy is up to 10−4 of the mass energy of the supermassive star cores (∼1055–1056 erg). We find that, even if we increase the rotational angular momentum of the progenitor, the ejecta mass saturates at ∼1% of the total mass of the initial stellar core. The average ejecta velocity also saturates at ≈20% of the speed of light. As a result, the ejecta kinetic energy is approximately proportional to the initial mass of the supermassive star core for the rapidly rotating case. We also perform viscous hydrodynamics simulations to explore the evolution of the remnant torus. Although the viscous heating drives an outflow from the torus, we find that its effect is subdominant in terms of the kinetic energy because of the small velocity (≈0.07c) of the ejecta component.

<title>Probing X-Ray Timing and Spectral Variability in the Blazar PKS 2155–304 over a Decade of XMM-Newton Observations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Blazars, a class of active galactic nuclei (AGN) powered by supermassive black holes, are known for their remarkable variability across multiple timescales and wavelengths. Despite significant advancements in our understanding of AGN central engines, thanks to both ground- and space-based telescopes, the details of the mechanisms driving this variability remain elusive. The primary objective of this study is to constrain the X-ray variability properties of the TeV blazar PKS 2155–304. We conducted a comprehensive X-ray spectral and timing analysis, focusing on both long-term and intraday variability (IDV), using data from 22 epochs of XMM-Newton observations collected over 15 yr (2000–2014). For the timing analysis, we estimated the fractional variability, variability amplitude, minimum variability timescales, flux distribution, and power spectral density. In the spectral analysis, we fitted the X-ray spectra using power-law, log-parabola, and broken power-law models to determine the best-fitting parameters. We observed moderate IDV in the majority of the light curves (LCs). Seven out of the 22 observations showed a clear bimodal flux distribution, indicating the presence of two distinct flux states. Our analysis revealed a variable power spectral slope. Most hardness ratio plots did not show significant variation with flux, except for two observations, where the hardness ratio changed considerably with flux. The fitted X-ray spectra favored the broken power-law model for the majority of observations, indicating a break in the spectral profiles. The findings of this work shed light on the IDV of blazars, providing insights into the nonthermal jet processes that drive the observed flux variations.

<title>Using Neural Networks to Automate the Identification of Brightest Cluster Galaxies in Large Surveys</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb1ad</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb1ad</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) lie deep within the largest gravitationally bound structures in existence. Though some cluster finding techniques identify the position of the BCG and use it as the cluster center, other techniques may not automatically include these coordinates. This can make studying BCGs in such surveys difficult, forcing researchers to either adopt oversimplified algorithms or perform cumbersome visual identification. For large surveys, there is a need for a fast and reliable way of obtaining BCG coordinates. We propose machine learning to accomplish this task and train a neural network to identify positions of candidate BCGs given no more information than multiband photometric images. We use both mock observations from The Three Hundred project and real ones from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and we quantify the performance. Training on simulations yields a squared correlation coefficient, R2, between predictions and ground truth of R2 ≈ 0.94 when testing on simulations, which decreases to R2 ≈ 0.60 when testing on real data owing to discrepancies between data sets. Limiting the application of this method to real clusters more representative of the training data, such as those with a BCG r-band magnitude rBCG ≤ 16.5, yields R2 ≈ 0.99. The method performs well up to a redshift of at least z ≈ 0.6. We find this technique to be a promising method to automate and accelerate the identification of BCGs in large data sets.

<title>Using Polar Faculae to Determine the Sun’s High-latitude Rotation Rate. II. Simulations and New Measurements</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb1af</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb1af</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In a previous paper, I described a new way of determining the high-latitude solar rotation rate statistically from spacetime maps of polar faculae observed in the 6767 Å continuum by the Michelson Doppler Interferometer on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory. Now, I have tested the technique by applying it to simulated images whose faculae have known speeds, and I have been able to recover those speeds with an accuracy better than 0.01 km s−1. Repeated measurements of the Sun’s polar faculae gave the same high-latitude profile as before, but with a slightly faster synodic rotation rate of and a rotation period of 39.6 days. Applying this spacetime tracking procedure to magnetic flux elements observed with the Helioseismic Magnetic Imager on the Solar Dynamics Observatory, I obtained a similar rotation profile with a speed of 9.55° day−1 and a synodic rotation period of 37.7 days. These rates are comparable to polar rotation rates, obtained by other techniques, but the new latitude profiles are noticeably flatter than the quartic fits to those prior measurements.

<title>Spiral Density Waves in the Multiple-armed Galaxy NGC 628</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Radial profiles of pattern speeds are measured at subkiloparsec resolution for NGC 628. The radial profiles are directly measured using a general form of the Tremaine–Weinberg method that allows for the pattern speed to vary with radius. The method is applied to both stars and CO, H i, and Hα spectral lines. The trends in the results are consistent for all of the data, showing that sources and sinks in the interstellar medium have a negligible effect when applying the integrated continuity equation. The spiral pattern rotates at a greater angular frequency in the inner region of the disks than in their outer region. Most of the measured values of the pattern speed are less than the material speed. The results for the inner disk show an approximately constant trend, consistent with rigidly rotating density waves. The offsets in stellar photometric and spectral line intensity data corroborate this result. There are radially decreasing trends in the results for the outer region of the disks that are similar to the material speed, consistent with shearing patterns or what is expected for overlapping wave modes of decreasing pattern speed. There is no single theory for the origin of the spiral patterns that can explain all of the results, but the results fail to provide evidence for a single global wave mode.

<title>A Quasar-anchored Protocluster at z = 6.6 in the ASPIRE Survey. II. An Environmental Analysis of Galaxy Properties in an Overdense Structure</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present in this paper (Paper II of the series) a 35 arcmin2 JWST/NIRCam imaging and wide-field slitless spectroscopy mosaic centered on J0305–3150, a luminous quasar at z = 6.61. The F356W grism data reveal 124 [O iii]+Hβ emitters at 5.3 < z < 7, 53 of which constitute a protocluster spanning (10 cMpc)2 across 6.5 < z < 6.8. We find no evidence of any broad-line active galactic nucleus (AGN) in individual galaxies or stacking, reporting a median Hβ FWHM of 585 ± 152 km s−1; however, the mass–excitation diagram and “little red dot” color and compactness criteria suggest that there are a few AGN candidates on the outskirts of the protocluster. We fit the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the [O iii] emitters with Prospector and Bagpipes and find that none of the SED-derived properties (stellar mass, age, or star formation rate) correlate with proximity to the quasar. While there is no correlation between galaxy age and local galaxy density, we find modest correlations of local galaxy density with increasing stellar mass, decreasing 10–100 Myr star formation rate ratios, and decreasing nebular line equivalent widths. We further find that the protocluster galaxies are consistent with being more massive, being older, and hosting higher star formation rates than the field sample at the 3σ level, distributed in a filamentary structure that supports inside-out formation of the protocluster. There is modest evidence that galaxy evolution proceeds differently as a function of the density of local environment within protoclusters during the epoch of reionization, and the central quasar has little effect on the galaxy properties of the surrounding structure.

A SPectroscopic survey of bIased halos in the Reionization Era is a quasar legacy survey primarily using JWST to target a sample of 25 z > 6 quasars with NIRCam slitless spectroscopy and imaging. The first study in this series found evidence of a strong overdensity of galaxies around J0305−3150, a luminous quasar at z = 6.61, within a single NIRCam pointing obtained in JWST Cycle 1. Here we present the first results of a JWST Cycle 2 mosaic that covers 35 arcmin2 with NIRCam imaging/wide-field slitless spectroscopy of the same field to investigate the spatial extent of the putative protocluster. The F356W grism data target [O iii]+Hβ at 5.3 < z < 7 and reveal a population of 124 line emitters down to a flux limit of 1.2 × 10−18 erg s−1 cm−2. Fifty-three of these galaxies lie at 6.5 < z < 6.8 spanning 10 cMpc on the sky, corresponding to an overdensity within a 2500 cMpc3 volume of 12.5 ± 2.6, anchored by the quasar. Comparing to the [O iii] luminosity function from the Emission line galaxies and Intergalactic Gas in the Epoch of Reionization project, we find a dearth of faint [O iii] emitters at log(L/erg s−1) < 42.3, which we suggest is consistent with either bursty star formation causing galaxies to scatter around the grism detection limit or modest suppression from quasar feedback. While we find a strong filamentary overdensity of [O iii] emitters consistent with a protocluster, we suggest that we could be insensitive to a population of older, more massive Lyman break galaxies with weak nebular emission on scales >10 cMpc.

<title>X-Ray Emission Properties of a Compact Symmetric Object Sample</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb1e6</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a comprehensive analysis of the X-ray observations obtained from XMM-Newton and Chandra for a sample of bona-fide Compact Symmetric Objects (CSOs) to investigate their X-ray emission properties. Ultimately, we obtain 32 effective X-ray observational spectra from 17 CSOs. Most spectra can be well described by an absorbed single power-law model, with the exception of six spectra requiring an additional component in the soft X-ray band and two spectra exhibiting an iron emission line component. The data analysis results unveil the diverse characteristics of X-ray emission from CSOs. The sample covers X-ray luminosity ranging within 1040−1045 erg s−1, intrinsic absorbing column density ( ) ranging within 1020−1023 cm−2, and photon spectral index (ΓX) ranging within 0.75–3.0. None of the CSOs in our sample have > 1023 cm−2, indicating that the X-ray emission in these CSOs is not highly obscured. The distribution of ΓX for these CSOs closely resembles that observed in a sample of radio-loud quasars and low-excitation radio galaxies (RGs). In the radio–X-ray luminosity panel, these CSOs exhibit a distribution more akin to FR I RGs than FR II RGs, characterized by higher luminosities. The positive correlation between ΓX and the Eddington ratio, which has been noted in radio-quiet active galactic nuclei, is not observed in these CSOs. These findings suggest that although the contribution of the disk-corona system cannot be completely ruled out, jet/lobe radiation likely plays a dominant role in the X-ray emission of these CSOs.

<title>Building on the Archives: Connecting the CN/CO Intensity Ratio with Global Galaxy Properties in Nearby U/LIRGs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We use the CN/CO intensity ratio to obtain the dense gas fraction, fdense, for a sample of 16 ultraluminous and luminous infrared (IR) galaxies and compare fdense with a suite of global galaxy properties. We find a significant correlation between fdense and star formation rate calculated using both IR luminosities and radio continuum, although there is significant scatter in each relation. We find no trend between global or peak fdense and merger stage. We find no correlation between global fdense and X-ray luminosity; however, the correlation becomes significant when we measure fdense at the location of peak X-ray emission. Our interpretation is that the dense gas is co-localized with strong X-ray emission from active galactic nuclei or strong central star formation.

<title>Expansion-induced Three-part Morphology of the 2021 December 4 Coronal Mass Ejection</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The typical structure of a coronal mass ejection (CME) was identified as a three-part morphology, which includes a bright front, a dark cavity, and a bright core, with the cavity and the core generally regarded as flux rope and eruptive prominence. However, there are three-part CMEs that are not associated with prominences. In this work, we conduct a high-resolution simulation of the 2021 December 4 CME mimicked with a spheromak flux rope to investigate the formation of the three-part morphology in the solar corona. The CME, with no signatures of prominence at the beginning, evolves into a high–low–high-density structure, which appears in a coronagraph image as a bright front immediately followed by a dark cavity with a bright core behind. The moving and expanding spheromak flux rope sweeps up the solar wind plasma and meanwhile, the plasma at its utmost edge is compressed, which produces the high-density front overlying the flux rope. It is also found that the expansion of the flux rope is uneven, with strong expansion at its outlying area and weak expansion at its central and rear parts. The differential expansion rates lead to the distinct rarefaction rates of the plasma, which results in the formation of the low-density cavity and the high-density core within the flux rope. Our three-dimensional study for the first time demonstrates that the evolution of the flux rope can self-consistently generate the three-part density structure, which improves the understanding of CME’s morphologies in coronagraph images.

Recent studies suggest that cold dark matter subhalos are hard to disrupt and almost all cases of subhalo disruption observed in numerical simulations are due to numerical effects. However, these findings primarily relied on idealized numerical experiments, which do not fully capture the realistic conditions of subhalo evolution within a hierarchical cosmological context. Based on the Aquarius simulations, we identify clear segregation in the population of surviving and disrupted subhalos, which corresponds to two distinct acquisition channels of subhalos. We find that all of the first-order subhalos accreted after redshift 2 survive to the present time without suffering from artificial disruption. On the other hand, most of the disrupted subhalos are sub-subhalos accreted at high redshift. Unlike the first-order subhalos, sub-subhalos experience preprocessing and many of them are accreted through major mergers at high redshift, resulting in very high mass loss rates. We confirm these high mass loss rates are physical through both numerical experiments and semianalytical modeling, thus supporting a physical origin for their rapid disappearance in the simulation. Even though we cannot verify whether these subhalos have fully disrupted or not, their extreme mass loss rates dictate that they can at most contribute a negligible fraction to the very low mass end of the subhalo mass function. We thus conclude that current state-of-the-art cosmological simulations have reliably resolved the subhalo population.

<title>Source Materials and Heating of Alfvénic Slow and Hot Solar Wind Revealed by Heavy Ions</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb420</link>

This work quantitatively studies the differences of heavy ions among non-Alfvénic slow wind (N-ASSW), classical fast wind (FSW), and Alfvénic slow and hot wind (ASSW and AHSW) by effect size and Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic. Statistics of ACE measurements in solar cycle 23 show that He/O and Fe/O in ASSW and AHSW are significantly similar to those in N-ASSW, but are distinct from FSW. The mean Fe16+/Fe13+ in ASSW (AHSW) is in the middle of the two mean values of FSW and N-ASSW. However, Fe16+/Fe13+ in the three categories of solar wind are similarly low during solar minimum. Charges of C and O ions in ASSW and AHSW are significantly different from those in FSW during solar minimum, but have obvious overlaps to those in FSW during solar maximum. Besides, the speed ratio of He2+, C5+, O6+, and Fe10+ against protons is studied, and that of O6+ in ASSW and AHSW is most like that in FSW. AHSW has two peaks of proton specific entropy showing negative and positive relations to electron temperature. The results support that ASSW, AHSW, and N-ASSW experience the same fractionation in the chromosphere. The heating in ASSW (AHSW) differs from N-ASSW between the freeze-in heights of O and Fe during solar maximum, possibly caused by interchange reconnection. The preferential acceleration of heavy ions may be proportional to the gyroradius scale. Dissipation of Alfvén waves to electrons may happen in AHSW.

<title>Two 100 TeV Neutrinos Coincident with the Seyfert Galaxy NGC 7469</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb031</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In 2013, the IceCube collaboration announced the detection of a diffuse high-energy astrophysical neutrino flux. The origin of this flux is still largely unknown. The most significant individual source is the close-by Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068 at the 4.2σ level with a soft spectral index. To identify sources based on their counterpart, IceCube releases real-time alerts corresponding to neutrinos with a high probability of astrophysical origin. We report here the spatial coincidence of two neutrino alerts, IC 220424A and IC 230416A, with the Seyfert galaxy NGC 7469 at a distance of 70 Mpc. We evaluate, a posteriori, the chance probability of such a coincidence and discuss this source as a potential neutrino emitter based on its multiwavelength properties and in comparison to NGC 1068 by performing a goodness-of-fit test. A test statistic is derived from a likelihood ratio that includes the neutrino angular uncertainty and the source distance. We apply this test first to a catalog of active galactic nucleus sources and second to a catalog of Seyfert galaxies only. Our a posteriori evaluation excludes the possibility of an accidental spatial coincidence of both neutrinos with the Seyfert galaxy NGC 7469 at the 3.2σ level, leaving open the possibility that either one or both neutrinos originated from the source. To be compatible with nondetections of TeV neutrinos, the source would need to have a hard spectral index.

<title>Spatially Resolved Galactic Winds at Cosmic Noon: Outflow Kinematics and Mass Loading in a Lensed Star-forming Galaxy at z = 1.87</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada95b</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We study the spatially resolved outflow properties of CSWA13, an intermediate-mass (M* = 109M⊙), gravitationally lensed star-forming galaxy at z = 1.87. We use Keck/KCWI to map outflows in multiple rest-frame UV interstellar medium (ISM) absorption lines, along with fluorescent Si ii* emission, and nebular emission from C iii] tracing the local systemic velocity. The spatial structure of the outflow velocity mirrors that of the nebular kinematics, which we interpret to be a signature of a young galactic wind that is pressurizing the ISM of the galaxy but is yet to burst out. From the radial extent of Si ii* emission, we estimate that the outflow is largely encapsulated within 3.5 kpc. We explore the geometry (e.g., patchiness) of the outflow by measuring the covering fraction at different velocities, finding that the maximum covering fraction is at velocities v ≃ −150 km s−1. Using the outflow velocity (vout), radius (R), column density (N), and solid angle (Ω) based on the covering fraction, we measure the mass-loss rate and mass loading factor for the low-ionization outflowing gas in this galaxy. These values are relatively large and the bulk of the outflowing gas is moving with speeds less than the escape velocity of the galaxy halo, suggesting that the majority of the outflowing mass will remain in the circumgalactic medium and/or recycle back into the galaxy. The results support a picture of high outflow rates transporting mass and metals into the inner circumgalactic medium, providing the gas reservoir for future star formation.

<title>Searching for Low-redshift Hot Dust-obscured Galaxies</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adabe3</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adabe3</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Hot dust-obscured galaxies (Hot DOGs), discovered by the “W1W2 dropout” selection at high redshifts (z ∼ 2–4), are a rare population of hyperluminous obscured quasars. Their number density is comparable to similarly luminous type 1 quasars in the same redshift range, potentially representing a short, yet critical stage in galaxy evolution. The evolution in their number density toward low redshift, however, remains unclear as their selection function is heavily biased against objects at z ≲ 2. We combine data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer and Herschel archives to search for Hot DOGs at z < 0.5 based on their unique spectral energy distributions. We find 68 candidates, and spectroscopic observations confirm that 3 of them are at z < 0.5. For those three, we find their black hole accretion is close to the Eddington limit, with lower bolometric luminosities and black hole masses than those of higher-z Hot DOGs. Compared to high-z systems, these low-z systems are closer to the local relation between host galaxy stellar mass and black hole mass but still lie above it, and we discuss several possible scenarios for it. Finally, we also find the surface number density of z < 0.5 Hot DOGs is 2.4 × 10−3 deg−2, about an order of magnitude lower than high-z Hot DOGs but comparable to hyperluminous unobscured quasars in the same redshift range. These results further support the idea that Hot DOGs may be a transitional phase of galaxy evolution.

<title>A New X-Ray Census of Rotation Powered Pulsars</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
To date, over 4000 pulsars have been detected. In this study, we identify 231 X-ray counterparts of Australia Telescope National Facility (ATNF) pulsars by performing a spatial cross match across the Chandra, XMM-Newton observational catalogs. This data set represents the largest sample of X-ray counterparts ever compiled, including 98 normal pulsars (NPs) and 133 millisecond pulsars (MSPs). Based on this significantly expanded sample, we re-establish the correlation between X-ray luminosity and spin-down power, given by across the whole X-ray band. The strong correlation is also observed in hard X-ray band, while in soft X-ray band there is no significant correlation. Furthermore, LX shows a strong correlation with spin period and characteristic age for NPs. For the first time, we observe a strongly positive correlation between LX and the light cylinder magnetic field (Blc) for MSPs, with both NPs and MSPs following the relationship , consistent with the outer-gap model of pulsars that explains the mechanism of X-ray emission. Additionally, we investigate potential X-ray counterparts for Galactic Plane Pulsar Snapshot pulsars, finding a lower likelihood of detection compared to ATNF pulsars.

<title>Mapping Our Path through the Local Interstellar Medium: High-resolution Ultraviolet Absorption Spectroscopy of Sight Lines along the Sun’s Historical Trajectory</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Using high-resolution UV data obtained from the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on board the Hubble Space Telescope, we focus on eight sight lines along the Sun’s historical trajectory to reconstruct the morphology of our most recent interstellar environment and evaluate its effects on the Sun’s heliosphere over the past five million years. Of the eight targets (each within 50 pc), we detect interstellar absorption in six, primarily Mg ii and Fe ii. We observe C ii and O i absorption in target HD 32147. In each analyzed sight line, the Local Interstellar Cloud (LIC) is observed and bears a similar column density. We detected the Blue and Aur clouds, both of which the Sun may have encountered before entering the LIC. In at least one sight line a fourth cloud is detected. Even in this compact sample, we observe variation in absorption across neighboring sight lines, reflecting the complexity of local interstellar medium (ISM) small-scale structure. We report the discovery of an astrosphere around target GJ J173, observable due to excess Lyα absorption caused by interaction between the star’s stellar wind and the ISM. Over the past ∼five million years, the Sun spent the majority of the time in a low-density plasma region. We see no evidence of any cold, dense material along the observed sight lines. We present timelines for heliospheric response assuming a range of plausible hydrogen densities (0.1 and 0.2 cm−3). In both cases, we see the Sun, and the heliosphere, traversing significant density variations in its most recent past and most immediate future.

<title>Estimating Black Hole Masses in Obscured Active Galactic Nuclei from X-Ray and Optical Emission Line Luminosities</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb0bf</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb0bf</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We test a novel method for estimating black hole masses (MBH) in obscured active galactic nuclei (AGN) that uses proxies to measure the FWHM of broad Hα (FWHMbHα) and the accretion disk luminosity at 5100 Å (λL5100 Å). Using a published correlation, we estimate FWHMbHα from the narrow optical emission line ratio L[O iii]/LnHβ. Using a sample of 99 local obscured AGN from the Swift Burst Alert Telescope AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS), we assess the agreement between estimating λL5100 Å from the intrinsic 2 to 10 keV X-ray luminosity and from narrow optical emission lines. We find a mean offset of 0.32 ± 0.68 dex between these methods, which propagates to a factor of ∼2 uncertainty when estimating MBH using a virial mass formula where L[O iii]/LnHβ serves as a proxy of FWHMbHα (MBH,[O iii]/nHβ). We compare MBH,[O iii]/nHβ with virial MBH measurements from broad Paschen emission lines. For the 14 (12) BASS AGN with broad Paα (Paβ) detections, we find MBH,[O iii]/nHβ to be systematically higher than MBH,Paα (MBH,Paβ) by a factor of 0.39 ± 0.44 dex (0.48 ± 0.51 dex). Since these offsets are within the scatter, more data are needed to assess whether MBH,[O iii]/nHβ is biased high. For 151 BASS AGN with measured stellar velocity dispersions (σ*), we find that the σ*-derived MBH agrees with MBH,[O iii]/nHβ to within 0.08 dex, albeit with wide scatter (0.74 dex). The method tested here can provide estimates of MBH in thousands of obscured AGN in spectroscopic surveys when other diagnostics are not available, though with an uncertainty of ∼3–5.

<title>PSR J1231–1411 Revisited: Pulse Profile Analysis of X-Ray Observation</title>

One of the primary goals of Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER)-like X-ray missions is to impose stringent constraints on the neutron star equation of state by precisely measuring their masses and radii. NICER has recently expanded the data set of inferred mass–radius relations for neutron stars, including four rotation-powered millisecond pulsars PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0740+6620, PSR J0437–4715, and PSR J1231–1411. In this work, the mass–radius relation and X-ray emitting region properties of PSR J1231–1411 are inferred with an independent pulse profile modeling based on the spherical star Schwarzschild spacetime and Doppler approximation. With one single-temperature elongated hot spot and one single-temperature crescent hot spot, the inferred gravitational mass is M = 1.12 ± 0.07 M⊙ and the inferred equatorial radius is km (68% credible intervals). It provides an alternative geometry configuration of the X-ray emitting region for PSR J1231–1411 to sufficiently explain the observation data of NICER and XMM-Newton. The inferred radius is smaller than that derived by T. Salmi et al. ( M⊙, Req = 12.6 ± 0.3 km), and the inferred mass is slightly higher in this work. The inferred geometry configurations of the X-ray emitting region in both works are nonantipodal, which is not consistent with a centered dipole magnetic field and suggests a complex magnetic field structure.

<title>Supernova Siblings and Spectroscopic Host Galaxy Properties</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Over the past century, supernova (SN) searches have detected multiple supernovae (SNe) in hundreds of individual galaxies. So-called SN siblings discovered in the same galaxy present an opportunity to constrain the dependence of the properties of SNe on those of their host galaxies. To investigate whether there is a connection between sibling SNe in galaxies that have hosted multiple SNe and the properties of galaxies, we have acquired integrated optical spectroscopy of 59 galaxies with multiple core-collapse SNe. Perhaps surprisingly, a strong majority of host galaxy spectra fall within the composite region of the Baldwin–Phillips–Terlevich (BPT) diagram. We find a statistically significant difference (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test p-value = 0.044) between the distributions of the [N ii] λ6583/Hα of galaxies that have hosted a majority of SNe Ibc and those that have hosted a majority of Type II supernovae (SNe II), where the majority of Type Ibc supernovae (SNe Ibc) galaxies have, on average, higher ratios. The difference between the distributions of [N ii] λ6583/Hα may arise from either increased contribution from active galactic nuclei or low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions in SNe Ibc host galaxies, greater metallicity for SNe Ibc host galaxies, or both. When comparing the inferred oxygen abundance and the ionization parameter for the galaxies in the star-forming region on the BPT diagram, we find statistically significant differences between the distributions for SNe Ibc hosts and SNe II hosts (p = 0.008 and p = 0.001, respectively), as well as SNe Ib hosts and SNe II hosts (p = 0.030 and p = 0.006, respectively). We also compare the Hα equivalent width distributions, also integrated across the galaxies, and find no significant difference.

<title>Swift-XRT and NuSTAR Monitoring of Obscuration Variability in Mrk 477</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adaf18</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adaf18</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the analysis of 15 X-ray observations of Mrk 477, a nearby Seyfert 2 active galactic nucleus, with the objective to monitor its obscuring column density variability. The full data set consists of five archival observations, split into two XMM-Newton, two NuSTAR and one Chandra observation, plus two dedicated monitoring campaigns. The monitoring campaigns were performed with Swift-XRT and NuSTAR, containing five observations each. We performed a simultaneous analysis using self-consistent torus models, deriving geometric properties of the torus as well as the obscuration along the line of sight. Mrk 477 is best modeled with a torus with a large covering factor yet low column density (on average). Its line-of-sight column density oscillates between 1.5 and 7 × 1023 cm−2. Mrk 477 presents frequent obscuring column density variability, on timescales as short as ∼2 weeks. The probability of drawing a pair of obscuration-variable observations for Mrk 477 when having two, three, and four observations is 40%, 78%, and 95%, respectively. Adding the results of this work to those of another 26 sources, we find a trend of increasing obscuration variability with time (from ∼20% at Δt < 10 days, to ∼60%–70% at timescales larger than 5 yr). We discuss whether this is compatible with the majority of obscuration variability coming from broad-line region clouds.

<title>Habitability in 4D: Predicting the Climates of Earth Analogs across Rotation and Orbital Configurations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Earth-like planets in the circumstellar habitable zone (HZ) may have dramatically different climate outcomes depending on their spin–orbit parameters, altering their habitability for life as we know it. We present a suite of 93 ROCKE-3D general circulation models (GCMs) for planets with the same surface conditions and average annual insolation as Earth, but with a wide range of rotation periods, obliquities, orbital eccentricities, and longitudes of periastra. Our habitability metric fHZ is calculated based on the temperature and precipitation in each model across grid cells over land. Latin hypercube sampling aids in sampling all four of the spin–orbit parameters with a computationally feasible number of GCM runs. Statistical emulation then allows us to model fHZ as a smooth function with built-in estimates of statistical uncertainty. We fit our emulator to an initial set of 46 training runs, then test with an additional 46 runs at different spin–orbit values. Our emulator predicts the directly GCM-modeled habitability values for the test runs at the appropriate level of accuracy and precision. For orbital eccentricities up to 0.225, rotation period remains the primary driver of the fraction of land that remains above freezing and with precipitation above a threshold value. For rotation periods greater than ~20 days, habitability drops significantly (from ~70% to ~20%), driven primarily by cooler land temperatures. Obliquity is a significant secondary factor for rotation periods less than ~20 Earth days, with a factor of 2 impact on habitability that is maximized at intermediate obliquity.

<title>Compact [O iii] Emission-line Regions (“Green Seeds”) in Hα Emitters at Cosmic Noon from JWST Observations</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adad69</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a rest-frame optical, spatially resolved analysis of more than 100 Hα emitters (HAEs) at z ∼ 2.2 in the ZFOURGE-CDFS field using NIRCam imaging from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey. The ultradeep, high-resolution data give us maps of the resolved emission-line regions of HAEs with stellar mass ranging from 108M⊙ to 1010M⊙. An [O iii] emission-line map of each HAE is created from the flux excess in the F150W filter, leading to the discovery of a population of kiloparsec-scale compact emission-line regions (“Green Seeds”) with high equivalent widths (EW). We obtain a sample of 128 Green Seeds from 68 HAEs with rest-frame EW[O III] > 200 Å. Moreover, 17 of them have extremely large EW[O III] > 1000 Å, suggesting the possible Lyman continuum leakage from these emission-line regions. Embedded within the host galaxy, many Green Seeds correspond to UV star-forming clumps and H ii regions, indicating elevated starburst activity in them, with specific star formation rates several times higher than that of the host galaxy. Based on theoretical frameworks, Green Seeds are expected to be formed through gravitational disk instability and/or galaxy mergers. Considering the stellar masses of Green Seeds, we speculate that high-mass Green Seeds may migrate toward the galactic center to build the central bulge, while low-mass Green Seeds are easily disrupted and short lived. Besides, we propose that some Green Seeds could be the progenitors of globular clusters or ultracompact dwarf galaxies observed in the local Universe.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
New observations obtained with JWST of the protostellar HH 270 jet and the “deflected” HH 110 system show that HH 110 has a morphology of a series of distorted working surfaces. These working surfaces appear to be “deflected versions” of the heads of the incident HH 270 jet. We compute a series of 3D numerical simulations, in which we explore the possible parameters of a shearing environment that could give rise to the deflection of HH 270 into the HH 110 flow. We find that we need quite a high sideways velocity for the streaming environment (∼30 km s−1) in order to produce the complex structure observed in HH 110. This high velocity would be possible in an environment that has been strongly perturbed by the passage of other outflows.

<title>Hidden in Plain Sight: Searching for Dark Companions to Bright Stars with the Large Binocular Telescope and SHARK-VIS</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adad6e</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report the results from a pilot study to search for black holes and other dark companions in binary systems using direct imaging with SHARK-VIS and the iLocater pathfinder “Lili” on the Large Binocular Telescope. Starting from known single-lined spectroscopic binaries, we select systems with high mass functions that could host dark companions and whose spectroscopic orbits indicate a projected orbital separation ≥30 mas. For this first exploration, we selected four systems (HD 137909, HD 104438, HD 117044, and HD 176695). In each case, we identify a luminous companion and measure the flux ratio and angular separation. However, two of the systems (HD 104438 and HD 176695) are not consistent with simple binary systems and are most likely hierarchical triples. The observed companions rule out a massive compact object for HD 137909, HD 117044, and HD 176695. HD 104438 requires further study because the identified star cannot be responsible for the RV orbit and is likely a dwarf tertiary companion. The SHARK-VIS observation was taken near pericenter, and a second image near apocenter is needed to discriminate between a closely separated luminous secondary and a compact object. When a luminous companion is found, the combination of the RVs and the single SHARK-VIS observation strongly constrains the orbital inclination and the companion mass. Since a single SHARK-VIS observation has a typical on-source observing time of only ∼10 minutes, this a promising method to efficiently identify non-interacting compact object candidates.

We use the GALPROP cosmic ray (CR) framework to model the Galactic CR distributions and associated nonthermal diffuse emissions up to PeV energies. We consider ensembles of discrete, finite lifetime CR sources, e.g., supernova remnants, for a range of creation rates and lifetimes. We find that the global properties of the CR sources are likely not directly recoverable from the current “snapshot” of the historic injection and propagation of CRs within the Galaxy that are provided by the data. We show that models for the diffuse γ rays based on the discrete/time-dependent scenarios we consider are able to explain the LHAASO very-/ultra-high-energy (VHE/UHE) γ-ray data with up to 50% contribution by unresolved leptonic sources at the highest energies. Over the models that we consider, variations in the diffuse VHE emissions can be ∼25%, which is comparable to those for the steady-state models that we investigated in an earlier work. Such variations due to the discrete/finite nature of the CR sources are an important factor that are necessary to construct accurate physical models of the diffuse emissions from the Galaxy at VHE/UHEs.

The timeline of cosmic reionization remains uncertain despite sustained efforts to study how the ionizing output of early galaxies shaped the intergalactic medium (IGM). Using the seminumerical code LIMFAST, we investigate the prospects for timing the reionization process by cross-correlating the 21 cm signal with the cosmic near-infrared background (NIRB) contributed by galaxies at z > 5. Tracing opposite phases of the IGM on large scales during reionization, the two signals together serve as a powerful probe for the reionization history. However, because long-wavelength, line-of-sight Fourier modes—the only modes probed by NIRB fluctuations—are contaminated by 21 cm foregrounds and thus inevitably lost to foreground cleaning or avoidance, a direct cross correlation of the two signals vanishes. We show that this problem can be circumvented by squaring the foreground-filtered 21 cm signal and cross-correlating the squared field with the NIRB. This statistic is related to the 21 cm–21 cm–NIRB cross bispectrum and encodes valuable information regarding the reionization timeline. Particularly, the 21 cm2 and NIRB signals are positively correlated during the early phases of reionization and negatively correlated at later stages. We demonstrate that this behavior is generic across several different reionization models and compare our simulated results with perturbative calculations. We show that this cross correlation can be detected at high significance by forthcoming 21 cm and NIRB surveys such as the Square Kilometre Array and SPHEREx. Our methodology is more broadly applicable to cross correlations between line intensity mapping data and 2D tracers of the large-scale structure, including photometric galaxy surveys and cosmic microwave background lensing mass maps, among others.

<title>A Central TDE Candidate Detected through Spectroscopic Continuum Emission Properties in an SDSS Blue Quasar</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adaf9c</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this paper, properties of spectroscopic continuum emissions are considered to detect potential tidal disruption event (TDE) candidates among Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasars. After considering the simple blackbody photosphere model applied to describe quasar continuum emissions with parameters of blackbody temperature TBB and blackbody radius RBB, SDSS quasars and reported optical TDEs occupy distinct regions in the space of TBB and RBB. Then, through the dependence of RBB on TBB for SDSS quasars, 402 outliers in the SDSS Stripe 82 region can be collected. Among the 402 outliers, SDSS J2308 at z = 1.16 is mainly considered, due to its SDSS spectrum observed around the peak brightness of the light curves. With the 7.2 yr long light curves described by the theoretical TDE model, the determined TBB and RBB through its spectroscopic continuum emissions are consistent with the values determined by the TDE model, to support the central TDE. Moreover, considering simulated results on continuum emissions of SDSS quasars around z ∼ 1.16, it can be confirmed at a confidence level higher than 4σ that the continuum emissions of SDSS J2308 are not related to normal quasars. Furthermore, through the simulated results by the accepted continuous autoregressive process to trace intrinsic active galactic nucleus variability, the confidence level higher than 3σ can be confirmed that the long-term light curves of SDSS J2308 are related to a central TDE. The jointed probabilities through both spectroscopic and photometric simulations, the confidence level higher than 5σ can be confirmed to support the central TDE in SDSS J2308.

<title>Tidal Formation of Dark Matter Deficit Diffuse Galaxy NGC 1052-DF2 by SIDM</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adaf9d</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Observations have revealed a significant dark matter deficit in the ultradiffuse galaxy NGC 1052-DF2 (DF2). It is widely accepted that the formation of this unique galaxy can be attributed to the tidal stripping of its host galaxy, NGC 1052. In this study, we simulate the evolution of a satellite system containing globular clusters (GCs) within an accreting host halo in the framework of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). Our simulation results suggest that the heightened tidal stripping resulting from dark matter (DM) self-interactions can give rise to the transformation of a conventional dwarf galaxy into a dark matter deficit galaxy resembling DF2. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a DF2 analog can also be produced on an orbit with a greater pericenter distance by increasing the strength of DM self-interactions. This suggests that the issue of extreme orbital parameters can be mitigated by implementing the SIDM model. The distributions of the GC population derived in our SIDM simulation are consistent with the observed characteristics of DF2. The potential for reproducing DF2 and its GC population in the cold dark matter scenario is also discussed.

<title>Discovery of Weak CN Stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud and Comparison to Stellar Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The recent discovery that red supergiants in M31 and M33 contain a weak CN spectral absorption feature at ∼8000 Å prompted us to analyze a large CTIO 4 m Hydra spectral database of stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We find 751 confirmed weak CN stars in the LMC, present an overview of their spectral and photometric properties, and compare them with the weak CN stars in M31 and M33. We use a method for automatically identifying weak CN stars based on a spectral template and find that weak CN stars are almost exclusively short-lived massive stars in the core He-burning evolutionary phase. We derive a mean main-sequence age of 40 Myr for these stars through a Bayesian approach to isochrone fitting that is consistent across all three galaxies. We then examine possible evolutionary processes and atmospheric conditions that could lead to weak CN stars using a suite of low-resolution model spectra. We find a preferred range of values for Teff and log g in O-rich stars that would result in the CN absorption and also speculate that this feature could arise due to the N enhancement expected in fast-rotating stars, though more targeted modeling is required.

<title>Cataloging Stream Interaction Regions at MAVEN: A Cross-comparative Study with STEREO-A</title>

Stream interaction regions (SIRs) are long-lasting solar wind structures that result from stable fast solar wind interacting with preceding slow solar wind. These structures have been examined in depth throughout the heliosphere, particularly at 1 au; however, due to sparse observations, SIRs have not been characterized thoroughly at 1.5 au. Thanks to the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) mission, we have a chance to fill this observational gap. We implement in situ solar wind data collected by MAVEN to identify SIRs between 2014 November and 2023 September. We observe 185 SIRs with average durations of 2.2 days that occur primarily during periods of low solar activity. We detect 19 forward shocks, seven reverse shocks, and one shock pair within these 185 SIRs. We predict a total SIR-associated shock detection rate of ∼56% at 1.5 au and compare this rate to previous findings spanning 0.1–5 au. We examine Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) A data at 1 au to cross-compare with our results at 1.5 au. We determine the magnetic compression ratios (H) associated with SIRs at MAVEN and STEREO-A and find that H is ∼18% higher at 1.5 au than 1 au. We find that for a given SIR observed at both 1 and 1.5 au, H is ∼32% higher at 1.5 au. We also do not see a stark difference in the change in H for SIRs observed at both STEREO-A and MAVEN with respect to the angular separation of the spacecraft.

<title>Investigating the Effects of Atmospheric Stratification on Coronal Active Region Field Modeling</title>

Understanding the evolution of the complex magnetic fields found in solar active regions is an active area of research. There exist many different models for such fields, which range in their complexity due to the number of physical effects included in them—one common factor being that they all extrapolate the field up from the photosphere. In this study, we focus on the fact that above the photosphere and below the corona lies the relatively cool and dense chromosphere—which is often neglected in coronal models, due to it being comparatively thin and difficult to model. We isolate and examine the effect including this boundary layer has on a 2.5D class of driven MHD models of an active region eruption. We find that it can result in significant changes to the dynamics of an erupting field far higher in the atmosphere than the chromosphere itself, generally delaying eruptions and increasing the magnetic energy released in each eruption. We also test whether these effects can be approximated using a variation of the more computationally efficient magnetofrictional model, finding a number of simple adaptations of the standard magnetofrictional model, which capture the effect of the chromospheric stratification well.

<title>Spectra of He Isotopes and the 3He/4He Ratio</title>

Since its launch, the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer-02 (AMS-02) has delivered outstanding quality measurements of the spectra of cosmic-ray (CR) species, e±, , and nuclei (H–Si, S, Fe), which have resulted in a number of breakthroughs. Besides elemental spectra, AMS-02 also measures the spectra of light isotopes albeit within a smaller rigidity range. In this paper, we use the precise measurements of He isotopes and the 3He/4He ratio by AMS-02, together with Voyager 1 data, and investigate their origin. We show that there is an excess in 3He at higher energies compared to standard calculations assuming its fully secondary origin, which may indicate a source of primary 3He, or signify a change in the propagation parameters over the Galactic volume probed by the 3He/4He ratio. We provide updated local interstellar spectra (LIS) of 3He and 4He in the rigidity range from 2 to 40 GV. Our calculations employ the self-consistent GalProp–HelMod framework that has proved to be a reliable tool in deriving the LIS of CR e−, , and nuclei Z ≤ 28.

<title>Neutrinos from Carbon-burning Red Supergiants and Their Detectability</title>

Stars emit megaelectronvolt neutrinos during their evolution via nuclear syntheses and thermal processes, and detecting them could provide insights into stellar structure beyond what is accessible through electromagnetic wave observations. So far, megaelectronvolt neutrinos have been observed from the Sun and SN 1987A. It has been suggested that pre-supernova stars in the oxygen- and silicon-burning stages would emit enough megaelectronvolt neutrinos to be detectable on Earth, provided they are in the local Universe. In this study, we investigate the prospect of detecting neutrinos from red supergiants (RSGs) in the carbon-burning phase. In our Galaxy, around a thousand RSGs have been cataloged, and several are expected to be in the carbon-burning phase. We first calculate the luminosity and energy spectrum of the neutrinos emitted during the post-main-sequence evolution of massive stars. For a nearby carbon-burning RSG located ∼200 pc away, we estimate the neutrino flux reaching Earth to be as large as ∼105 cm−2 s−1, with a spectrum peaking at ∼0.6 MeV. We then assess the feasibility of detecting these neutrinos in underground facilities, particularly in hybrid detectors equipped with a water-based liquid scintillator and ultrafast photodetectors. In detectors with a volume comparable to Super-Kamiokande, for the above flux, we anticipate up to ∼50 neutrino events per year with directional information. Although this is a fair number, the number of events from radioactive backgrounds would be much larger. Our results indicate that studying neutrinos from carbon-burning RSGs and predicting supernovae well in advance before their explosion would be challenging with currently available detector technologies.

<title>Probing 3D Magnetic Fields Using Starlight Polarization and Grain Alignment Theory</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb423</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Polarization of starlight induced by dust grains aligned with the magnetic field (hereafter B-field) is widely used to measure the 2D B-fields projected onto the plane-of-sky. Here, we introduce a new method to infer 3D B-fields using starlight polarization. We show that the inclination angle or line-of-sight component of B-fields can be constrained by the starlight polarization efficiency from observations, the alignment degree provided by the magnetically enhanced radiative torque (MRAT) alignment theory, and the effect of B-field tangling. We first perform synthetic observations of starlight polarization of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of a filamentary cloud with our updated POLARIS code incorporating the modern MRAT theory. We test the new technique with synthetic observations and find that the B-field inclination angles can be accurately determined by the synthetic starlight polarization efficiency once the effects of grain alignment, dust properties, and B-field fluctuations are well characterized. The technique can provide an accurate constraint on B-field inclination angles using optical polarization in low-density regions AV < 3 with efficient MRAT alignment, whereas the technique can infer further to high-density regions with significant alignment loss at AV ∼ 8–30 by using near-infrared polarization. Our new technique unlocks the full potential of tracing 3D B-fields and constraining dust properties and grain alignment physics on multiple scales of the diffuse interstellar medium and star-forming regions using multiwavelength starlight polarization observations.

<title>Parallel Electric Fields and Electron Heating Observed in the Young Solar Wind</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb582</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The largest electric fields between 18 and 30 solar radii are in narrowband waves simultaneously observed at a few Hz (somewhat above the local proton gyrofrequency) and a few hundred Hz (far below the lower hybrid frequency), with the higher-frequency wave triggered at specific phases of the lower-frequency wave. This wave pair, called “triggered ion-acoustic waves” (TIAWs), has been shown to both be physical and to occur at times of electron heating. A theory of electron heating and acceleration by the low-frequency wave has been presented. While this theory and the TIAW results strongly suggest the presence of low-frequency electric fields that are parallel to the local magnetic field, such fields have not been directly observed. In this paper, such parallel electric field observations are reported, and TIAWs are further described to conclude that they occur during about 75% of the Parker Solar Probe passes through 18–30 solar radii, and when present, they are the dominant wave signal, lasting for hours. In the presence of these parallel electric fields, electrons are heated while, in their absence, there is no electron heating. That there is no heating between 18 and 30 solar radii in the absence of TIAWs is a most significant result because it invalidates other proposed mechanisms that predict heating in this radial range all of the time.

<title>One-dimensional Linear Analysis and Numerical Simulations of Alfvén Waves in a Force-free Magnetosphere around a Kerr Black Hole</title>

We perform 1D linear analysis and numerical simulations of the propagation of Alfvén waves in a force-free magnetosphere along magnetic field lines around a spinning black hole. We use the results to investigate the dynamic process of wave propagation and energy transport for Alfvén waves. As in a previous study using the Banados–Teitelboim–Zanelli spacetime, the Alfvén wave induces a fast magnetosonic wave in the case of a spinning black hole. Energy conservation is confirmed when this additional induced magnetosonic wave is considered. We also observe the reflection of the inwardly propagating Alfvén wave around the static limit, which is prohibited in theory when using the eikonal approximation.

<title>The Circumgalactic Medium Traced by Mg ii Absorption with DESI: Dependence on Galaxy Stellar Mass, Star Formation Rate, and Azimuthal Angle</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada942</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada942</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Understanding the circumgalactic medium (CGM) distribution of galaxies is the key to revealing the dynamical exchange of materials between galaxies and their surroundings. In this work, we use the DESI Early Data Release data set to investigate the cool CGM of galaxies (0.3 < z < 1.7) by stacking the spectra of background quasi-stellar objects to obtain the Mg ii absorption of foreground galaxies. The equivalent width of Mg ii absorption strongly correlates with stellar mass, with EW(Mg ii) for star-forming galaxies with , but is independent of mass for galaxies above this mass. At a given stellar mass, EW(Mg ii) is larger for galaxies of higher star formation rate with an impact parameter less than 50 kpc, while showing little dependence on galaxy size. By studying the dependence on azimuthal angle, we find EW(Mg ii) is strongest at the direction near the minor axis for star-forming galaxies with , while no dependence on azimuthal angle is seen for luminous red galaxies. This indicates that the outflow associated with star formation enhances the Mg ii absorption. However, for galaxies with , the EW(Mg ii) at the minor axis is largely suppressed with respect to low-mass galaxies. This suggests that the competing processes, such as stellar feedback and gravity, play a key role in shaping the distribution of outflowing gas.

<title>The Formation Histories of Massive and Quiescent Galaxies in the 3 < z < 4.5 Universe</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the formation histories of 19 massive (≳3 × 1010M⊙) quiescent (specific star formation rate, sSFR < 0.15 Gyr−1) galaxy candidates at z ~ 3.0–4.5 observed using JWST/NIRSpec. This completes the spectroscopic confirmation of the 24 K-selected quiescent galaxy sample from the ZFOURGE and 3DHST surveys. Utilizing Prism 1–5 μm spectroscopy, we confirm that all 12 sources that eluded confirmation by ground-based spectroscopy lie at z > 3, resulting in a spectroscopically confirmed number density of ~1.4 × 10−5 Mpc−3 between z ~ 3 and 4. Rest-frame U − V versus V − J color selections show high effectiveness in identifying quiescent galaxies, with a purity of ~90%. Our analysis shows that parametric star formation histories (SFHs) from FAST++ and binned SFHs from Prospector on average yield consistent results, revealing diverse formation and quenching times. The oldest galaxy formed ~6 × 1010M⊙ by z ~ 10 and has been quiescent for over 1 Gyr at z ~ 3.2. We detect two galaxies with ongoing star formation and six with active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We demonstrate that the choice of stellar population models, stellar libraries, and nebular or AGN contributions does not significantly affect the derived average SFHs of the galaxies. We demonstrate that extending spectral fitting beyond the rest-frame optical regime reduces the inferred average star formation rates (SFRs) in the earliest time bins of the SFH reconstruction. The assumed SFH prior influences the SFR at early times, where spectral diagnostic power is limited. Simulated z ~ 3 quiescent galaxies from IllustrisTNG, SHARK, and Magneticum broadly match the average SFHs of the observed sample but struggle to capture the full diversity, particularly at early stages. Our results emphasize the need for mechanisms that rapidly build stellar mass and quench star formation within the first billion years of the Universe.

<title>Empirical Constraints on Tidal Dissipation in Exoplanet Host Stars</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The orbits of short-period exoplanets are sculpted by tidal dissipation. However, the mechanisms and associated efficiencies of these tidal interactions are poorly constrained. We present robust constraints on the tidal quality factors of short-period exoplanetary host stars through the usage of a novel empirical technique. The method is based on analyzing structures in the population-level distribution of tidal decay times, defined as the time remaining before a planet spirals into its host star due to stellar tides. Using simple synthetic planet population simulations and analytic theory, we show that there exists a steady-state portion of the decay time distribution with an approximately power-law form. This steady-state feature is clearly evident in the decay time distribution of the observed short-period planet population. We use this to constrain both the magnitude and frequency dependence of the stellar tidal quality factor and show that it must decrease sharply with planetary orbital period. Specifically, with , we find 105.5 ≲ Q0 ≲ 107 and −4.33 ≲ α ≲ −2. Our results are most consistent with predictions from tidal resonance locking, in which the planets are locked into resonance with a tidally excited gravity mode in their host stars.

<title>Simulating the Arrival of Multiple Coronal Mass Ejections That Triggered the Gannon Superstorm on 2024 May 10</title>

The 2024 May 10 space weather event stands out as the most powerful storm recorded during the current solar cycle. This study employs a numerical framework utilizing a semiempirical coronal model, along with heliospheric upwind extrapolation with time dependence and cone coronal mass ejection (CME) models for the inner heliosphere, to forecast solar wind velocity and the arrival of CMEs associated with this event. The simulations were also carried out using the Space Weather Adaptive Simulation framework and a drag-based model (DBM) for this complex event of multiple CMEs. Predicted arrival times and velocities from these models are compared with actual observations at the Sun–Earth L1 point. These simulations reveal that three CMEs reached Earth nearly simultaneously, resulting in the extreme space weather event, followed by the arrival of a few more eruptions. The simulations accurately predicted arrival times with a discrepancy of approximately 5 hr or less for these CMEs. Further, the ensemble study of the DBM shows the sensitivity of the CME arrival time to the background solar wind speed and drag parameters. All three models have done fairly well in reproducing the arrival time closely to the actual observation of the CMEs responsible for the extreme geomagnetic storm of 2024 May 10. These rare solar storms offered a unique opportunity to thoroughly evaluate and validate our advanced models for predicting their arrival at Earth.

<title>Dynamic Photometric Variability in Three Young Brown Dwarfs in Taurus: Detection of Optical Flares with TESS Data</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present I-band time-series photometric variability studies of three known nearby (∼140 pc) and young (∼1 Myr) brown dwarfs (BD) in the Taurus star-forming region in the Perseus molecular cloud. From 10 nights of observations over a time span of 10 yr, with a typical run of 3–6 hr each night, we estimated that the BDs show unstable short-scale periodicity from 1.5 to 4.8 hr. Using the long-term photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), we have conducted a time-resolved variability analysis of CFHT-BD-Tau 3 and CFHT-BD-Tau 4, revealing orbital periods of ∼0.96 days and ∼3 days respectively, consistent with earlier studies. We also found two superflares in TESS sector 43 data for CFHT-BD-Tau 4 and estimated the flare energies as 7.09 × 1035 erg and 3.75 × 1036 erg. A magnetic field of ∼3.39 kG is required to generate such flare energies on this BD. We performed spot modeling analysis on CFHT-BD-Tau 3 and CFHT-BD-Tau 4 to address the variability detected in the data using the package BASSMAN. Spectral energy distribution and infrared colors of the sources suggest that they have a sufficient amount of circumstellar material around them.

<title>Unveiling the Interior Structure and Thermal Evolution of Super-Earth GJ 486b</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Recent ground- and space-based surveys have shown that planets between Earth and Neptune in size, known as “super-Earths,” are among the most frequently found planets in the Galaxy. Although the JWST era has provided high-quality atmospheric data on many such super-Earths, modeling tools are crucial for understanding their unobservable interiors. Consequently, interior studies represent the next essential step in gaining a comprehensive understanding of this class of exoplanets. This study investigates the interior structure, thermal evolution, and atmospheric dynamics of the super-Earth GJ 486b using SERPINT, a 1D self-consistent coupled interior structure and evolution model, aiming to understand the planet’s thermal evolution based on an Earth-like structure. Our results indicate that GJ 486b’s core is approximately 1.34 times larger than Earth’s, with a core pressure of about 1171 GPa. The thermal evolution model predicts that the planet’s mantle cools and solidifies over approximately 0.93 Myr. As the magma ocean cools, water is released from the melt, forming a water-rich atmosphere during early solidification. Photolysis of water vapor and subsequent hydrogen escape lead to oxygen accumulation, forming a water- and oxygen-rich secondary atmosphere. Future high-sensitivity JWST observations, with improved wavelength coverage and the detection of additional trace gases, will enable a detailed analysis of the planet’s atmospheric composition, providing crucial insights into the interior, surface, and subsurface properties of GJ 486b.

We present an extensive temporal and spectral study of the Seyfert 1 AGN Mrk 50 using 15 yr (2007–2022) of multiwavelength observations from XMM-Newton, Swift, and NuSTAR for the first time. From the timing analysis, we found that the source exhibited variability of ∼20% during the 2007 observation, which reduced to below 10% in the subsequent observations and became nonvariable in the observations from 2010 onward. From the spectral study, we found that the spectra are nearly featureless. Nondetection of absorption in the low-energy domain during the 15 yr of observation infers the absence of obscuration around the central engine, rendering the nucleus a “bare” type. A prominent soft X-ray excess below 2 keV was detected in the source spectrum during the observations between 2007 and 2010, which vanished during the later observations. To describe the nature of the soft excess, we use two physical models, such as warm Comptonization and blurred reflection from the ionized accretion disk. Both of the physical models explain the nature and origin of the soft excess in this source. Our analysis found that Mrk 50 accretes at a sub-Eddington accretion rate (λEdd = 0.13–0.02) during all of the observations used in this work.

<title>Theoretical Calculations on the Effect of Adsorbed Atom Coverage on the Sodium Exospheres of Airless Bodies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Our ability to understand the formation of the exospheres of airless bodies such as the Moon and Mercury has been hindered by uncertainties in how surface processes influence exospheric sources. Ejection processes important for exosphere formation rely on the notion that an emitted atom must first overcome an attractive energy with the surface to be ejected into the exosphere (the surface binding energy, SBE). Recent studies have shown that atoms from minerals are more tightly bound than commonly assumed, making it difficult to reconcile how such high volatile concentrations are being observed in the exospheres of airless bodies. Here, we used molecular dynamics modeling to explain the physics underlying the interaction of low-energy returning atoms, initially ejected below the escape energy of the body, with mineral surfaces. Global exosphere models make ill-informed assumptions for these interactions due to a lack of SBEs for adsorbed atoms. Results provide first-of-their-kind SBE distributions for adsorbed atoms and can be used by global models to better understand exosphere formation on airless bodies. We highlight the importance of adsorbate coverage and the atomic arrangement of a surface on the SBE. At low absorbate coverage sodium forms ionic bonds with oxygen, leading to tightly bound adsorbates (SBE ∼6 eV). At 1 ML of coverage the free O is terminated and Na is unable to form strong ionic bonds, leading to loosely bound adsorbates (SBE 1–3 eV). Emission processes from covered surfaces will be far more efficient than those without adsorbates. These improvements will allow for better interpretation of mission data such as from MESSENGER, BepiColombo, LADEE, Europa Clipper, and Artemis.

<title>Supersensitive Seismic Magnetometry of White Dwarfs</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adaf9e</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The origin of the magnetic fields in white dwarfs (WDs) remains mysterious. Magnetic WDs are traditionally associated with field strengths ≳1 MG, set by the sensitivity of typical spectroscopic magnetic field measurements. Informed by recent developments in red giant magnetoasteroseismology, we revisit the use of WD pulsations as a seismic magnetometer. WD pulsations primarily probe near-surface magnetic fields, whose effect on oscillation mode frequencies is to asymmetrize rotational multiplets and, if strong enough, suppress gravity-mode propagation altogether. The sensitivity of seismology to magnetic fields increases strongly with mode period and decreases quickly with the depth of the partial ionization-driven surface convective zone. We place upper limits for the magnetic fields in 24 pulsating WDs: 20 hydrogen-atmosphere (DAV) and three helium-atmosphere (DBV) carbon–oxygen WDs, and one extremely low-mass (helium-core) pulsator. These bounds are typically ∼1–10 kG, although they can reach down to ∼10–100 G for DAVs and helium-core WDs in which lower-frequency modes are excited. Seismic magnetometry may enable new insights into the formation and evolution of WD magnetism.

<title>The Assembly of Supermassive Black Holes at z < 1 in Early-type Galaxies from Scaling Relations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The assembly of supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass (M•) and stellar mass (M*) in galaxies can be studied via the redshift evolution of the M•–M* relation, but the ways in which selection bias and physical assembly channels affect this evolution are uncertain. To address this, we compare the M•–M* relation for local massive (M* > 1010.5 M⊙) quiescent early-type galaxies (ETGs) to that for massive ETGs hosting active galactic nuclei (AGN) at z ∼ 0.8. The restrictions on stellar mass and galaxy type limit the assembly channels that may connect the two relations. For the local sample we find , in line with prior work. For the z ∼ 0.8 sample we find a bias-corrected relation: . We show, however, that this relation depends on the stellar and SMBH mass functions used to compute the selection bias, the virial relation, the virial factor, and the active fraction, which together introduce uncertainty of up to ∼0.6 dex in the z ∼ 0.8 relation. Adopting reasonable choices of these parameters then our z ∼ 0.8 relation lies above that for z ∼ 0 AGN by ∼0.5 dex, but below our z ∼ 0 ETG relation by 0.4–1 dex in SMBH mass. We discuss possible sources of this offset, including further bias corrections, “downsizing” in SMBH mass assembly, and preferential SMBH growth. Our results highlight the need to reduce uncertainties from selection and measurement bias in SMBH and stellar masses at all redshifts.

<title>MAMMOTH-Subaru. IV. Large Scale Structure and Clustering Analysis of Lyα Emitters and Lyα Blobs at z = 2.2–2.3</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report the large scale structure and clustering analysis of Lyα emitters (LAEs) and Lyα blobs (LABs) at z = 2.2–2.3. Using 3341 LAEs, 117 LABs, and 58 bright (Lyα luminosity LLyα > 1043.4 erg s−1) LABs at z = 2.2–2.3 selected with Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam, we calculate the LAE overdensity to investigate the large scale structure at z = 2. We show that 79% of LABs and 83% of bright LABs are located in overdense regions, which is consistent with the trend found by previous studies that LABs are generally located in overdense regions. We find that one of our eight fields, dubbed J1349, contains 39/117 ≈ 33% of our LABs and 22/58 ≈ 38% of our bright LABs. A unique and overdense (40 × 20 comoving Mpc2) region (J1347 protocluster) has 12 LABs (eight bright LABs). By comparing to SSA22, which is one of the most overdense LAB regions found by previous studies, we show that the J1347 protocluster region has a higher bright LAB density than the SSA22 protocluster region with a 1σ significance. We calculate the angular correlation functions (ACFs) of LAEs and LABs in the unique J1349 field and fit the ACFs with a power-law function to measure the slopes. The bright LABs show a 5σ larger slope, suggesting that bright LABs are more clustered than faint LAEs. Our LABs have a large galaxy bias of ∼5–7, which suggests that LABs generally reside in more massive dark matter halos (halo masses M ≳ 1013M⊙) than faint LAEs.

<title>Pseudo-Newtonian Simulation of a Thin Accretion Disk Around a Reissner–Nordström Naked Singularity</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb421</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb421</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the first numerical simulations of a thin accretion disk around a Reissner–Nordström (RN) naked singularity (NkS; a charged point mass). The gravity of the RN NkS is modeled with a pseudo-Newtonian potential that reproduces exactly the radial dependence of the RN Keplerian orbital frequency; in particular, orbital angular velocity vanishes at the zero gravity radius and has a maximum at 4/3 of that radius. Angular momentum is transported outward by viscous stresses only outside the location of this maximum. Nonetheless, even at that radius, accretion proceeds at higher latitudes, the disk having thickened there owing to excess pressure. The accretion stops at a certain distance away from the singularity, with the material accumulating in a toroidal structure close to the zero-gravity sphere. The shape of the structure obtained in our simulations is reminiscent of fluid figures of equilibrium analytically derived in full general relativity for the RN singularity. The presence of a rotating ring, such as the one found in our simulations, could be an observational signature of an NkS. For charge-to-mass ratios close to but larger than unity, the inner edge of the quasi-toroidal inner accretion structure would be located well within the Schwarzschild marginally stable orbit (ISCO), and the maximum orbital frequency in thin accretion disks would be much higher than the Schwarzschild ISCO frequency.

<title>Recovering Injected Astrophysics from the LISA Double White Dwarf Binaries</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada9e2</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the successful recovery of common-envelope ejection efficiency assumed in a simulated population of double white dwarf (DWD) binaries like those which may be observed by the future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission. We simulate the formation of DWD binaries by using the COSMIC population synthesis code to sample binary formation conditions such as initial mass function, metallicity of star formation, initial orbital period, and initial eccentricity. These binaries are placed in the m12i synthetic Milky Way–like galaxy, and their signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the LISA instrument is estimated, considering a Galactic gravitational-wave foreground informed by the population. Through the use of Fisher estimates, we construct a likelihood function for the measurement error of the LISA-bright DWD binaries (≥20 SNR, fGW ≥ 5 mHz), in their gravitational-wave frequency (fGW) and chirp mass. By repeating this process for different assumptions of the common-envelope ejection efficiency, we apply Bayesian hierarchical inference to find the best match to an injected astrophysical assumption for a fiducial population model. We conclude that the impact of common-envelope ejection efficiency on the mass-transfer processes involved in DWD formation may be statistically relevant in the future observed LISA population, and that constraints on binary formation may be found by comparing simulated populations to a future observed population.

<title>Quantifying Advantages of a Moving Mesh in Nuclear Hydrodynamics</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Many astrophysical explosions, such as type Ia supernovae, classical novae, and X-ray bursts, are dominated by thermonuclear runaway. To model these processes accurately, one must evolve nuclear reactions concurrently with hydrodynamics. We present an application of the moving mesh technique to this field of computation with the aim of explicitly testing the advantages of the method against the fixed mesh case. By way of traditional Strang splitting, our work couples a 13 isotope nuclear reaction network to a 1D moving mesh, Cartesian geometry hydrodynamics code. We explore three reacting problems: an acoustic pulse, a burning shock, and an advecting deflagration. Additionally, using the shock jump conditions, we semianalytically solve the burning shock problem under the assumption of quick, complete burning with the hope of establishing a useful and easy-to-set-up test problem. Strong moving mesh advantages are found in advecting, deflagrating flame fronts, where the technique dramatically reduces numerical diffusion that would otherwise lead to very fast artificial deflagration.

<title>The Radiowave Hunt for Young Stellar Object Emission and Demographics (RADIOHEAD): A Radio Luminosity–Spectral Type Dependence in Taurus–Auriga YSOs</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9f37</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9f37</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We measure the radio continuum fluxes at the locations of all Gaia-confirmed members of Taurus–Auriga using Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array Sky Survey data (VLASS; 2–4 GHz, σVLASS ~ 110–140 μJy, 2 5 resolution) spanning three VLASS epochs (2019, 2021, and 2023). We present 35 detections coincident with young Taurus–Auriga stars (29 in individual VLASS images, 6 via stacking). We find a strong dependence on spectral type, wherein the fractional detection rate of radio emission coincident with early-type young stellar objects (YSOs) is systematically higher than late-type YSOs, ranging from 25% ± 13% for B–F YSOs, 21% ± 11% for G YSOs, 18.4% ± 6.3% for K0–K4 YSOs, 15.5% ± 5.4% for K5–K9 YSOs, 7.0% ± 2.7% for M0–M2 YSOs, 2.3% ± 0.9% for M3–M6 YSOs, and 1.9% ± 1.9% for YSOs with SpTs later than M7. We present cumulative density distributions of radio luminosity densities that demonstrate a significant luminosity enhancement for early- versus late-type YSOs. We find 25% of the detected sources to be significantly variable. We discuss possible interpretations of this dependence, which may reflect stellar magnetic activity, binary interactions, or stellar flaring. We find that the mid-infrared YSO class is a strong indicator of radio detectability consistent with higher frequency Taurus–Auriga VLA surveys, with class III stars detected at a rate of 8.8% ± 1.6%, class IIs at 2.0% ± 1.2%, and combined class 0s, Is and Fs at 8.0% ± 5.4%.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Accurately and swiftly predicting the parameters of brown dwarf atmospheres from observational spectra is crucial for understanding their atmospheric composition and guiding future follow-up observations. Here, we utilized convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as a high-performance deep learning algorithm, training them with synthetic spectra generated from Sonora–Bobcat cloudless and equilibrium model grids to infer effective temperatures (Teff), surface gravities ( ), carbon-to-oxygen ratios (C/O), and metallicities ([M/H]). The performance metric, or R2 value (the coefficient of determination), of the trained CNNs in predicting Teff, , C/O, and [M/H] is 1.0, 1.0, 0.99, and 0.93 on both the training and test sets, respectively. We apply our trained CNN model on the three well-known T dwarf benchmarks, HD 3651B, GJ 570D, and Ross 458C. For HD 3651B and GJ 570D, we find that our predicted Teff and are in good agreement with some of the previous modeling studies from forward and retrieval approaches, but the [M/H] is underestimated up to ≈0.3 dex. For Ross 458C, our CNN model predicts the accurately but tends to overestimate Teff by ≈150 K and [M/H] by ≈1.0 dex compared to the previous modelings, which likely happens because our model grids lack disequilibrium chemistry and clouds. We also find that the C/O ratio tends to be higher than solar if not kept fixed. Concurrently, all modules and functions used to train, develop, and deploy the CNNs and process the spectra are consolidated into a Python PyPI package named TelescopeML, which is publicly available along with a thoroughly documented tutorial covering installation, deployment, and core concepts.

<title>Sporadic E-like Topside Layer Driven by Wind Shear in the Martian Ionosphere</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adaaeb</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adaaeb</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Ionospheric plasma density disturbances significantly affect radio wave propagation, impacting communication and planetary exploration. At Earth, sporadic E layers (Es) are commonly observed. They are characterized by thin, high-density plasma structures in the E-region ionosphere, primarily formed by electromagnetic forces induced by horizontal wind shears. Similar sharp vertical electron density changes have also been observed in the topside of the Martian ionosphere by missions like Mars Global Surveyor, Mars Express, and Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN. Recent studies suggest that such structures observed on Mars can be attributed to a sporadic E-like mechanism induced by magnetic shear, which can be referred to as Es-like structures. While wind shear theoretically contributes to such events, no observational evidence currently reports wind shear as an explanation for these density gradients on Mars. In this study, we report a novel observation of an Es-like topside layer in the Martian ionosphere, characterized by both density layer and rift (an abrupt depletion in density), where wind and magnetic shear are simultaneously observed. Statistical analysis of 305 orbits with wind speed observations revealed wind shear is observed in nine Es-like events, primarily occurring in strong crustal magnetic field regions. Simulations suggest that the observed rift and layer can be explained either by “wind shear” or by “wind and magnetic shear” under strong crustal magnetic field. This study provides new observations of Es-like events on Mars and serves as a credible candidate for the contribution of wind shear to the formation of an Es-like topside layer.

<title>Rotational Spectrum and Search for Lactonitrile toward Sgr B2(N)</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Laboratory experiments on interstellar ice analogs have demonstrated that ice mixtures containing acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) and hydrogen cyanide (HCN) in the presence of ammonia (NH3), water (H2O), or an NH3/H2O mixture allow the formation of the chiral molecule lactonitrile (2-hydroxypropionitrile; CH3CH(OH)CN). These findings place lactonitrile among possible interstellar molecules, especially when its methyl-shortened derivative glycolonitrile and the precursors are known interstellar species. To support the search for lactonitrile in interstellar space, we present measurements under supersonic expansion conditions in the 6–16 GHz frequency range, along with a detailed analysis of its room-temperature rotational spectrum from 75 to 325 GHz. Improved and extended sets of molecular parameters, determined from the newly measured data and selected literature measurements, are obtained for two conformers of lactonitrile, with accuracies conducive to reliable interstellar searches. We report the nondetection of lactonitrile toward the main hot core Sgr B2(N1S), with a column density upper limit 1 order of magnitude higher than the upper limit derived for the related molecule glycolonitrile.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Primordial black holes (PBHs) from the early Universe that can contribute to dark matter (DM) abundance have been linked to gravitational-wave observations. Supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies are expected to modify the distribution of DM in their vicinity and can result in highly concentrated DM spikes. We revisit PBH merger rates in the presence of DM spikes, tracking their history. We find novel peaked structure in the redshift evolution of PBH merger rates at low redshifts around z ∼ 5. These effects are generic and are present for distinct PBH mass functions and spike profiles, and also can be linked to peaked structure in the redshift evolution of the star formation rate. Redshift evolution characteristics of PBH merger rates can be distinguished from astrophysical black hole contributions and observable with gravitational waves, enabling them to serve as probes of DM in galactic centers.

<title>Predicting High-magnification Events in Microlensed Quasars in the Era of LSST Using Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adaebb</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adaebb</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Upcoming wide-field surveys, such as the Rubin Observatory’s Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), will monitor thousands of strongly lensed quasars over a 10 yr period. Many of these monitored quasars will undergo high-magnification events (HMEs) through microlensing, as the accretion disk crosses a caustic—places of infinite magnification. Microlensing allows us to map the inner regions of the accretion disk as it crosses a caustic, even at large cosmological distances. The observational cadences of LSST are not ideal for probing the inner regions of the accretion disk, so there is a need to predict HMEs as early as possible, to trigger high-cadence multiband or spectroscopic follow-up observations. Here, we simulate a diverse and realistic sample of 10 yr quasar microlensing light curves to train a recurrent neural network to predict HMEs before they occur, by classifying the locations of the peaks at each time step. This is the first deep-learning approach for predicting HMEs. We give estimates of how well we expect to predict HME peaks during LSST and benchmark how our metrics change with different cadence strategies. With LSST-like observations, we can predict approximately 55% of HME peaks, corresponding to tens to hundreds per year and a false-positive rate of around 20% compared to the total number of HMEs. Our network can be continuously applied throughout the LSST survey, providing crucial alerts for optimizing follow-up resources.

Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations have shown that candidate “post-starburst” galaxies (PSBs) at z ∼ 0.6 can retain significant molecular gas reservoirs. These results would imply that—unlike many model predictions—galaxies can shut down their star formation before their cold gas reservoirs are depleted. However, these studies inferred star formation rates (SFRs) either from [O ii] line fluxes or from spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling and could have missed large dust-obscured contributions to the SFRs. In this study, we present Keck/NIRES observations of 13 massive (M* ≳ 1011M⊙) PSBs, which allow us to estimate Hα SFRs in these gas-rich PSBs. We confirm the previously inferred low SFRs for the majority of the sample: 11/13 targets show clear Hα absorption, with minimal infilling indicating dust-corrected SFRs of <4.1 M⊙ yr−1. These SFRs are notably low given the large H2 reservoirs (∼(1–5) × 1010M⊙) present in 5/13 of these galaxies, placing them significantly offset from star-forming galaxies on the Kennicutt–Schmidt relation for star-forming galaxies. The [N ii]/Hα ratios of all 13 PSBs imply contributions from non-star-forming ionization mechanisms (e.g., active galactic nuclei, shocks, or hot evolved stars) to their Hα emission, suggesting that even these low ongoing SFRs may be overestimated. These low Hα SFRs, dust corrected using Av estimates from SED fitting, confirm that these galaxies are very likely quiescent and, thus, that galaxies can quench before their cold gas reservoirs are fully depleted.

<title>The Polarization Signatures of the Inverse Cascade in Magnetic Turbulence</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The inverse cascade of magnetic energy from smaller to larger scales is a key physical process for the formation of coherent magnetic fields in many astronomical turbulent systems. Synchrotron radiation polarization, an observable measurement closely related to the magnetic field topology and particle distribution function, is an important and promising tool for diagnosing this highly dynamic process. Here, for the first time, we use the first-principle particle-in-cell simulations to systematically investigate the polarization signatures during the inverse cascade of the magnetic field. We find that the polarization degree (PD) increases rapidly with the increase in the coherent scale of the magnetic field during the inverse transfer and its growth rate is positively correlated with the rate of inverse transfer and could be described by a logarithmic growth formula, and we also identify that the scale with the largest PD variation is coincident with this coherent scale by applying the spatial filter method. In addition, we show that the polarization signature is significantly dependent on the radiated photon energy and the line of sight, with high-energy radiation more sensitive to the increase in the coherent scale of the turbulent magnetic field than low-energy radiation, and the polarization characteristics present significant pitch-angle anisotropy due to the acceleration of particles in the presence of a strong background magnetic field. Our results provide a promising method to explore the astrophysical inverse cascade process and infer the coherent scale of turbulence, which could be validated by astronomical observations in the future.

<title>Probing Three-dimensional Magnetic Fields. IV. Synchrotron Polarization Derivative and Vision Transformer</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Measuring the 3D spatial distribution of magnetic fields in the interstellar medium and the intracluster medium is crucial yet challenging. The probing of the 3D magnetic field’s 3D distribution, including the field plane-of-sky orientation (ψ), the magnetic field’s inclination angle (γ) relative to the line of sight, and the magnetization (∼the inverse Alfvén Mach number ), at different distances from the observer makes the task even more formidable. However, the anisotropy and Faraday decorrelation effect in polarized synchrotron emission offer a unique solution. We show that due to the Faraday decorrelation, only regions up to a certain effective path length along the line of sight contribute to the statistical correlation of the measured polarization. The 3D spatial information can be consequently derived from synchrotron polarization derivatives (SPDs), which are calculated from the difference in synchrotron polarization across two wavelengths. We find that the 3D magnetic field can be estimated from the anisotropy observed in SPDs: the elongation direction of the SPD structures probes ψ, and the degree of SPD anisotropy, along with its morphological curvature, provides insights into and γ. To extract these anisotropic features and their correlation with the 3D magnetic field, we propose utilizing a machine learning approach, specifically the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, which was exemplified by the success of ChatGPT. We train the ViT using synthetic synchrotron observations generated from magnetohydrodynamic turbulence simulations in sub-Alfvénic and super-Alfvénic conditions. We show that ViT’s application to multiwavelength SPDs can successfully reconstruct the 3D magnetic fields’ 3D spatial distribution.

<title>New Perspective on the Multiple-population Phenomenon in Galactic Globular Clusters from a Wide-field Photometric Survey</title>

Wide-field photometry of Galactic globular clusters (GCs) has been investigated to overcome limitations from the small field of view of the Hubble Space Telescope in the study of multiple populations. In particular, “chromosome maps” (ChMs) built with ground-based photometry were constructed to identify the first- and second-generation (1G and 2G) stars over the wide field of view. The ChMs allow us to derive the fraction of distinct populations in an analyzed field of view. We present here the radial distribution of the 2G fraction in 29 GCs. The distributions show that all the GCs have either a flat distribution or more centrally concentrated 2G stars. Notably, we find that the fraction of 1G stars outside the half-light radius is clearly bifurcated across all mass range. It implies that a group of GCs with lower 1G fractions (hereafter Group II) have efficiently lost their 1G stars in the outermost cluster regions. In fact, in connection with the trends of the radial distribution, most GCs of Group II have spatially mixed populations, while only less massive GCs in Group I (a group with higher 1G fraction) show that feature. Lastly, we investigate links between these two groups and host cluster parameters. We find that most GCs of Group II are distributed along a broader range of galactocentric distances with smaller perigalactic distances < 3.5 kpc. Besides, by using the Gaia data, it is observed that Group II GCs have higher energy on the integrals of motion diagrams than Group I GCs.

<title>Green Peas in the Southern Sky: Broadband Color Selection and Spectroscopic Follow-up</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a systematic search for 1696 green pea (GP) galaxy candidates in the southern hemisphere selected from the Dark Energy Survey Data Release 2 and provide preliminary results from spectroscopic follow-up observations of 26 targets chosen among them. Our selection criteria include the colors in the gri bands and compact morphology in the color-composite images. The multiwavelength spectral energy distribution fitting shows that the selected GP candidates exhibit star formation rates up to several tens of M⊙ yr−1. With the mean stellar mass of , GP candidates are located at roughly 1 dex above the main sequence of star-forming galaxies at z ∼ 0.3. Spectroscopic follow-up observations of the GP candidates with Gemini/Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph are underway. All 26 targets are spectroscopically confirmed to be at z = 0.3–0.41 and have an [O iii] equivalent width larger than 85 Å, classified to be starbursts with low-to-moderate dust attenuation. These confirmed GPs show a lower metallicity offset from the mass–metallicity relation of local star-forming galaxies, indicating that GPs are less chemically evolved systems at their early stage of evolution.

<title>Origin of α-poor Very Metal-poor Stars</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb0c5</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Among very metal-poor (VMP) stars, α-poor VMP (α-PVMP) stars that have subsolar values of [X/Fe] for Mg and other α elements are rare and are thought to have been formed from gas polluted by Type 1a supernova (SN 1a). However, recent analyses indicate that pure core-collapse supernova (CCSN) ejecta can also be a likely source. We perform a detailed analysis of 17 α-PVMP stars by considering six different scenarios relevant to the early Galaxy. We consider a single pair-instability supernova (PISN) and a single CCSN. Additionally, we consider the combination of ejecta from a CCSN with ejecta from another CCSN, a PISN, a near-Chandrasekhar mass (near-MCh) SN 1a, and a sub-Chandrasekhar mass (sub-MCh) SN 1a. A clear signature can only be established for sub-MCh SN 1a with a near-smoking-gun signature in SDSS J0018-0939 and a reasonably clear signature in ET0381. The majority (82%) of α-PVMP stars can be explained by pure CCSN ejecta and do not require any SN 1a contribution. However, the combination of CCSN and sub-MCh SN 1a ejecta can also explain most (76%) of α-PVMP stars. In contrast, the combination of ejecta from CCSN with near-MCh SN 1a and PISN can fit 41% and 29% of the stars, respectively. The single PISN scenario is strongly ruled out for all stars. Our results indicate that α-PVMP stars are equally compatible with pure CCSN ejecta and a combination of CCSN and SN 1a ejecta, with sub-MCh SN 1a being roughly twice as frequent as near-MCh SN 1a.

<title>The White Dwarf Pareto: Tracing Mass Loss in Binary Systems</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb156</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb156</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The white dwarf mass distribution has been studied primarily at two extremes: objects that presumably evolved as single stars, and members of close binaries that likely underwent substantial interaction. This work considers the intermediate separation regime of ∼1 au and demonstrates how binary interaction affects white dwarf masses. The binary mass ratio distribution is utilized for this purpose. Modeled as a truncated Pareto profile, this distribution provides insights into the populations’ properties and evolutionary history. When applied to homogeneous samples of binaries with giant primaries of similar age, the distribution’s shape constrains the fraction of white dwarf companions, the white dwarf mass distribution, and the properties of their progenitors. As a test case, this method is applied to a small spectroscopic sample of binaries in open clusters with red giant primaries and orbital periods between 0.5 and 20 yr. The analysis reveals that white dwarfs in these systems are ∼20% less massive than their isolated counterparts, with a typical mass of ∼0.55 M⊙. Their progenitors likely lost 80%−85% of their mass, with binary interactions enhancing mass loss by an additional ∼0.2 M⊙. These findings highlight the utility of this approach for studying binary evolution and improving population models, particularly with future data sets from Gaia and other large-scale surveys.

<title>Magnetohydrodynamic Simulation of a Coronal Mass Ejection Observed during the Near-radial Alignment of Solar Orbiter and Earth</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) are the primary sources of geomagnetic storms at Earth. The negative out-of-ecliptic component (Bz) of magnetic field in the ICME or its associated sheath region is necessary for it to be geoeffective. For this reason, magnetohydrodynamic simulations of CMEs containing data-constrained flux ropes are more suitable for forecasting their geoeffectiveness as compared to hydrodynamic models of the CME. ICMEs observed in situ by radially aligned spacecraft can provide an important setup to validate the physics-based heliospheric modeling of CMEs. In this work, we use the constant-turn flux rope (CTFR) model to study an ICME that was observed in situ by Solar Orbiter (SolO) and at Earth, when they were in a near-radial alignment. This was a stealth CME that erupted on 2020 April 14 and reached Earth on 2020 April 20 with a weak shock and a smoothly rotating magnetic field signature. We found that the CTFR model was able to reproduce the rotating magnetic field signature at both SolO and Earth with very good accuracy. The simulated ICME arrived 5 hr late at SolO and 5 hr ahead at Earth, when compared to the observed ICME. We compare the propagation of the CME front through the inner heliosphere using synthetic J-maps and those observed in the heliospheric imager data and discuss the role of incorrect ambient solar wind background on kinematics of the simulated CME. This study supports the choice of the CTFR model for reproducing the magnetic field of ICMEs.

<title>Weak-lensing Mass Reconstruction of Galaxy Clusters with a Convolutional Neural Network. II. Application to Next-generation Wide-field Surveys</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb1b7</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Traditional weak-lensing mass reconstruction techniques suffer from various artifacts, including noise amplification and the mass-sheet degeneracy. In S. E. Hong et al., we demonstrated that many of these pitfalls of traditional mass reconstruction can be mitigated using a deep learning approach based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). In this paper, we present our improvements and report on the detailed performance of our CNN algorithm applied to next-generation wide-field (WF) observations. Assuming the field of view ( ) and depth (27 mag at 5σ) of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, we generated training data sets of mock shear catalogs with a source density of 33 arcmin−2 from cosmological simulation ray-tracing data. We find that the current CNN method provides high-fidelity reconstructions consistent with the true convergence field, restoring both small- and large-scale structures. In addition, the cluster detection utilizing our CNN reconstruction achieves ∼75% completeness down to ∼1014M⊙. We anticipate that this CNN-based mass reconstruction will be a powerful tool in the Rubin era, enabling fast and robust WF mass reconstructions on a routine basis.

We report the Australian Telescope Compact Array and Nobeyama 45 m telescope detection of a remarkably bright (S1.1mm = 44 mJy) submillimeter galaxy MM J154506.4−344318 in emission lines at 48.5 and 97.0 GHz, respectively. We also identify part of an emission line at ≈218.3 GHz using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Together with photometric redshift estimates and the ratio between the line and infrared luminosities, we conclude that the emission lines are most likely to be the J = 2–1, 4–3, and 9–8 transitions of 12CO at redshift z = 3.753 ± 0.001. ALMA 1.3 mm continuum imaging reveals an arc and a spot separated by an angular distance of , indicative of a strongly lensed dusty star-forming galaxy with respective molecular and dust masses of and after being corrected for ≈6.6× gravitational magnification. The inferred dust-to-gas mass ratio is found to be high (≈0.0083) among coeval dusty star-forming galaxies, implying the presence of a massive, chemically enriched reservoir of cool interstellar medium at z ≈ 4, or 1.6 Gyr after the Big Bang.

<title>Fifteen Years of M31* X-Ray Variability and Flares</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We append an additional 15 yr (2009–2024) to the Chandra X-ray light curve of M31*, the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the center of M31, the Andromeda galaxy. Extending and expanding on the work in Z. Li et al., we show that M31* has remained in an elevated X-ray state from 2006 through at least 2016 (when regular Chandra monitoring ceased) and likely through 2024, with the most recent observations still showing an elevated X-ray flux. We identify one moderate flare in 2013 where the other nuclear X-ray sources are in low-flux states, making that flare a valuable target for follow-up with multiwavelength and multimessenger archival data. We extract a mostly uncontaminated spectrum for M31* from this observation, showing that its X-ray properties are similar to those observed at Sgr A* in its quiescent state by Baganoff et al. Furthermore, we find no substantial change in the source’s hardness ratio in the 2006 and 2013 flares compared to the post-2006 elevated state, suggesting the these flares are increases in the regular X-ray emission mechanisms instead of entirely new emission modes. Our extended light curve for M31* provides valuable context for multimessenger or multiwavelength observations of nearby SMBHs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Since the early reports of events beyond the Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin (GZK) cutoff, the investigation of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays has emerged as a fundamental method for testing Lorentz invariance violation (LV) effects. Recent advances in observational capabilities have resulted in more stringent constraints on LV parameters. This study delves into the potentially anomalous phenomena arising from subluminal and superluminal LV effects, encompassing aspects such as proton decay and atypical threshold behavior of photo-pion production from protons within the GZK region. High-energy proton observations via cosmic rays have imposed stringent constraints on superluminal proton LV effects, while the confirmation of the GZK cutoff has established a robust boundary for the anomalous phenomena associated with subluminal proton LV effects. The research provides rigorously bilateral constraints on proton LV effects from both subluminal and superluminal standpoints.

<title>On a Critical Acceleration Scale of Dark Matter in ΛCDM and Dynamical Dark Energy</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adaeb3</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adaeb3</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Universal acceleration a0 emerges in various empirical laws, yet its fundamental nature remains unclear. Using Illustris and Virgo N-body simulations, we focus on the velocity and acceleration fluctuations in collisionless dark matter involving long-range gravity. For comparison, in the kinetic theory of gases, molecules undergo random elastic collisions involving short-range interactions, where only velocity fluctuations are relevant. Hierarchical structure formation proceeds through the merging of smaller halos to form larger halos, which facilitates a continuous energy cascade from small to large halos at a constant rate εu ≈ −10−7 m2 s−3. Velocity fluctuations involve a critical velocity uc ∝ (1 + z)−3/4. Acceleration fluctuations involve a critical acceleration ac ∝ (1 + z)3/4. Two critical quantities are related by the rate of energy cascade εu ≈ −acuc/[2(3π)2], where factor 3π is from the angle of incidence during merging. With critical velocity uc on the order of 300 km s−1 at z = 0, the critical acceleration is determined to be ac0 ≡ ac(z = 0) ≈ 10−10 m s−2, suggesting ac might explain the universal acceleration a0 ≈ 10−10 m s−2 in the empirical Tully–Fisher relation or modified Newtonian dynamics. The redshift evolution ac ∝ (1 + z)3/4 is in good agreement with Magneticum and EAGLE simulations and in reasonable agreement with limited observations. This suggests a larger a0 at a higher redshift such that galaxies of fixed mass rotate faster at a higher redshift. Note that for dark energy (DE) density J m−3, we postulate an entropic origin of the DE from acceleration fluctuations of dark matter, analogous to the gas pressure from velocity fluctuations. This leads to a dynamical DE coupled to the structure evolution involving a relatively constant DE density followed by a slow weakening phase, suggesting possible deviations from the standard ΛCDM paradigm.

<title>Magnetic Interactions in White Dwarf Binaries as Mechanism for Long-period Radio Transients</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb1b5</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A growing population of long-period radio transients has been discovered, and their physical origin is still up for debate. Recently, a new such source named ILT J1101+5521 was discovered, which is in a white dwarf (WD)–red dwarf (RD) binary system, with the observed 125.5 minutes period in radio emission being identified as the orbital period and the radio emission occurs at the inferior conjunction of the WD. We suggest that the radio emission properties of the system can be well explained within the framework of the unipolar inductor magnetic interaction model between the magnetized WD and the RD with low magnetization, with a relativistic version of electron cyclotron maser emission being the most likely radiation mechanism. We suggest that this mechanism can interpret at least some long-period radio transients, especially the ultra-long-period subpopulation. Within this model, high energy emission in X-rays via relativistically boosted cyclotron radiation and γ-rays via inverse Compton scattering off stellar light are expected, but the predicted luminosities are relatively low. This model likely applies to the ultra-long-period population of LPRTs. The short-period population of LPRTs is likely powered by other engines, such as slow magnetars.

<title>The Radio Counterpart to the Fast X-Ray Transient EP240414a</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Despite being operational for only a short time, the Einstein Probe mission, with its large field of view and rapid localization capabilities, has already significantly advanced the study of rapid variability in the soft X-ray sky. We report the discovery of luminous and variable radio emission from the Einstein Probe fast X-ray transient EP240414a, the second such source with a radio counterpart. The radio emission at 3 GHz peaks at ∼30 days postexplosion and with a spectral luminosity ∼2 × 1030 erg s−1 Hz−1, similar to what is seen from long gamma-ray bursts, and distinct from other extragalactic transients including supernovae and tidal disruption events, although we cannot completely rule out emission from engine driven stellar explosions, e.g., the fast blue optical transients. An equipartition analysis of our radio data reveals that an outflow with at least a moderate bulk Lorentz factor (Γ ≳ 1.6) with a minimum energy of ∼1048 erg is required to explain our observations. The apparent lack of a reported gamma-ray counterpart to EP240414a could suggest that an off-axis or choked jet could be responsible for the radio emission, although a low-luminosity gamma-ray burst may have gone undetected. Our observations are consistent with the hypothesis that a significant fraction of extragalactic fast X-ray transients are associated with the deaths of massive stars.

<title>Chicago–Carnegie Hubble Program: A Multiwavelength Search for the Effects of Metallicity on the Cepheid Distance Scale. II. Theoretical Models and Synthetic Spectra</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada3d5</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This is the second of two papers exploring the effects of metallicity on the multiwavelength properties of Cepheids in terms of their multiwavelength period–luminosity (PL) relations, impacting their use as extragalactic distance indicators and underpinning one of the most popular paths to estimating the expansion rate of the Universe, H0. In Paper I, we presented five tests for the influence of metallicity on galactic and extragalactic Cepheid PL relations, spanning nearly 2 dex in metallicity and inspecting PL relations from the optical (BVI), through the near-infrared (JHK), and into the mid-infrared (at 3.4 and 4.5 μm). And in no case were any statistically significant results forthcoming. Here we interrogate published spectral energy distributions constructed from theoretical (static) stellar atmospheres, covering the surface gravity and temperature ranges attributed to classical (supergiant, F and K spectral type) Cepheid variables, and explore the differential effects of changing the atmospheric metallicity, down by 2 dex from solar (a factor of 100 below the average Milky Way value) and then up from solar by 0.5 dex (i.e., a factor of 3× above the Milky Way value). The theoretical models clearly show that metallicity systematically impacts each of the bandpasses differentially: the level of this effect is largest in the ultraviolet (where line blanketing is most intense), reversing sign in the optical (due to flux redistribution from the UV), and then asymptotically falling back to zero from the red to the far-infrared. The discovered effects of metallicity are systematic, but they are small, and as such, they do not contradict the findings of Paper I, but they do explain why the problem has been so hard to resolve given the low level of precision of the photometry for all but the very nearest and apparently brightest Cepheids. The most interesting (and useful) result of this investigation is that from a close examination of the models, we have discovered infrared regions in Cepheid spectral energy distributions that allow for the simultaneous correction for extinction and metallicity differences by the judicious combination of only two filters: one in the near-infrared and one in the mid-infrared, the former centered at 1.2 μm and the other centered at 3.6 μm. Even more exciting and promising is the fact that both of these bands can be simultaneously observed in single exposures using the dual-channel imager, NIRCam on JWST.

We report the results of molecular line observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) toward two peculiar icy objects, which were discovered serendipitously by infrared spectroscopic survey of the Galactic plane with the AKARI satellite. Previous infrared observations have reported that both objects show deep ice and dust absorption features that are often seen in embedded young stellar objects (YSOs) or background stars sitting behind dense clouds; however, they are located neither in known star-forming regions nor in known dense clouds. Their infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) show peaks around 5 μm, which are incompatible with existing SED models of typical embedded YSOs. The present ALMA observations have detected compact emission of CO(3–2) and SiO(8–7) at the positions of the icy objects. The observed large column ratios of gas-phase SiO/CO (∼10−3) in both objects, as well as their broad line widths (8–14 km s−1), imply that they are associated with shocked gas. Although a large dust extinction (AV ∼ 100 mag) is expected from their deep dust/ice absorption, no dust continuum emission is detected, which would suggest a large beam dilution effect due to their compact source sizes. Their systemic velocities are clearly separated from the surrounding CO clouds, suggesting that they are isolated. The characteristics of their SEDs, the presence of deep ice/dust absorption features, compact source size, and SiO-dominated broad molecular line emission cannot easily be accounted for by any of known interstellar ice-absorption sources. They may represent a previously unknown type of isolated icy objects.

<title>Spatial Variations of Stellar Elemental Abundances in FIRE Simulations of Milky Way-mass Galaxies: Patterns Today Mostly Reflect Those at Formation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Spatial patterns of stellar elemental abundances encode rich information about a galaxy’s formation history. We analyze the radial, vertical, and azimuthal variations of metals in stars, both today and at formation, in the FIRE-2 cosmological simulations of Milky Way (MW)-mass galaxies, and we compare them with the MW. The radial gradient today is steeper (more negative) for younger stars, which agrees with the MW, although radial gradients are shallower in FIRE-2. Importantly, this age dependence was present already at birth: radial gradients today are only modestly (≲0.01 dex kpc−1) shallower than at birth. Disk vertical settling gives rise to negative vertical gradients across all stars, but vertical gradients of mono-age stellar populations are weak. Similar to the MW, vertical gradients in FIRE-2 are shallower at larger radii, but they are overall shallower in FIRE-2. This vertical dependence was present already at birth: vertical gradients today are only modestly (≲0.1 dex kpc−1) shallower than at birth. Azimuthal scatter is nearly constant with radius, and it is nearly constant with age ≲8 Gyr ago but increases for older stars. Azimuthal scatter is slightly larger (≲0.04 dex) today than at formation. Galaxies with larger azimuthal scatter have a stronger radial gradient, implying that azimuthal scatter today arises primarily from the radial redistribution of gas and stars. Overall, spatial variations of stellar metallicities show only modest differences between formation and today; spatial variations today primarily reflect the conditions of stars at birth, with spatial redistribution of stars after birth contributing secondarily.

<title>The Structure of the Molecular Envelope of the Ring Nebula (NGC 6720)</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adace1</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the first interferometric imaging of molecular line emission from the Ring Nebula, NGC 6720, in the form of Submillimeter Array (SMA) observations of CO J = 2 → 1 emission. The SMA 12CO(2–1) mapping data, with ∼3″ spatial resolution and 2 km s−1 velocity resolution, provide an unprecedentedly detailed, 3D view of the Ring’s clumpy molecular envelope. The emission morphology displayed in the velocity-integrated SMA 12CO(2–1) image closely resembles the morphologies of near-IR H2 and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission as revealed in recent JWST/NIRCam imaging of NGC 6720. The SMA 12CO(2–1) data demonstrate that the molecular gas is found within a geometrically thin layer that immediately surrounds the ionized gas imaged by Hubble Space Telescope and JWST. A simple, geometric model of the 12CO(2–1) emission data shows that the intrinsic structure of NGC 6720’s molecular envelope closely resembles a truncated, triaxial ellipsoid that is viewed close to pole-on, and that the dynamical age of the molecular envelope is ∼6000 yr. The SMA 12CO(2–1) mapping data furthermore reveal that some of the faint, filamentary features seen projected in the Ring’s interior in JWST imaging are in fact fast-moving polar knots or bullets with radial velocities of ±45–50 km s−1 relative to the systemic velocity, and that the hot progenitor star remnant is positioned at the precise geometric center of the clumpy, ellipsoidal molecular shell. We assert that the Ring’s molecular envelope represents the “fossil” remnant of a relatively sudden mass ejection ∼6000 yr ago that terminated the progenitor star’s asymptotic giant branch (AGB) evolution, and that this ellipsoidal envelope of AGB ejecta was then punctured by fast, collimated polar outflows or jets resulting from interactions between the progenitor and one or more companion stars. Such an evolutionary scenario may describe most if not all molecule-rich, “Ring-like” planetary nebulae.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The observation of electrostatic double layers in Martian magnetosheath plasma is reported, based on medium-frequency (100 Hz–32 kHz) electric field data recorded by the Langmuir Probe and Waves on board the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution spacecraft on 2021 January 1. A total of six burst mode events were scrutinized, revealing the occurrence of double layer structures. Overall, 79 double layers were identified, with their absolute amplitudes and widths found to be in the ranges of 0.4–3.3 mV m−1 and 0.6–6.4 ms, respectively. The dominant frequency associated with the observed excitations lies well above the ion plasma frequency (fpi). The identified structures were observed at 2600–4400 km altitude in the dusk sector (17–19 LT). Extensive analysis based on a nonlinear multifluid plasma model shows that the observed structures are electron-acoustic double layers. A comparison of theory and observations indicates that these double layers have spatial scales in the range of 0.4–10 km. This is the first detailed study to give conclusive evidence of the occurrence of double layers in the Martian plasma environment.

<title>The Puzzling Superorbital Period Variation of the Low-mass X-Ray Binary 4U 1820–30</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adaded</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adaded</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Because of the previously observed stability of the 171 days period, the superorbital modulation of the low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1820–30 was considered a consequence of a third star orbiting around the binary. This study aims to further verify this triple model by testing the stability of the superorbital period using the light curves collected by X-ray sky-monitoring/scanning telescopes from 1987 to 2023. Both power spectral and phase analysis results indicate a significant change in the superorbital period, from 171 to 167 days, over this 36 yr span. The evolution of the superorbital phase suggests that the superorbital period may have experienced an abrupt change between early 2001 and mid 2003 or changed gradually with a period derivative of day day−1. We conclude that the superorbital period of 4U 1820–30 was not as stable as anticipated by the triple model, which strongly challenges this hypothesis. Instead, we propose an irradiation-induced mass-transfer instability scenario to explain the superorbital modulation of 4U 1820–30.

<title>Effects of Martian Dust Storms on Ionospheric Peak Altitudes</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adae01</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The effects of Martian dust storms on the atmosphere and ionosphere is one of the hot topics in Mars research. This paper reports on the effects of a local dust storm on the ionospheric peak altitude based on electron density profile observations from the Mars Global Surveyor Radio Science experiment during a dust storm event in late 2004. By employing a profile fitting technique, we determined the peak altitudes of both the M1 and M2 layers. A statistical analysis of different dust storm phases was conducted in conjunction with changes in atmospheric dust opacity. The results indicate that during the phase of rapid increase in global opacity, the peak altitudes of the two layers are elevated differently. After the opacity reaches saturation, the peak altitudes start to decrease slowly, with distinct decreasing trends for each layer. This suggests that dust storms exert different effects across various altitudes within the Martian ionosphere and atmosphere, which require the introduction of new physical processes for explanation. The discussion of the relationship between opacity and peak altitude contributes to a deeper understanding of the dynamics by which dust storms influence the Martian atmosphere and ionosphere, offering new insights for dust storm observation and future forecasting efforts.

<title>Considerations on the Origin of IRAS 19312+1950 Based on Long-term Maser Observations</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adae09</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
IRAS source 19312+1950 (hereafter I19312) is an infrared point source with maser emissions of SiO, H2O, and OH molecules. Although initial observations suggested that I19312 might be an evolved star, its characteristics are not fully consistent with this classification. This study aims to further investigate the nature of I19312 by conducting long-term monitoring of its maser emissions and comparing the results with other known astrophysical objects. We conducted long-term monitoring of SiO, H2O, and OH maser emissions using single-dish radio telescopes. The results were then compared with historical maser data and the characteristics of similar objects to infer the possible origin of I19312. The SiO maser emissions from I19312 were detected over a wide velocity range and exhibited significant time variability. The OH maser lines suggest characteristics of an evolved star, while the H2O maser lines indicate molecular outflows. These features suggest that I19312 could be a candidate for a water fountain star, though there are inconsistencies, such as the large molecular gas mass, that challenge this hypothesis. The possibility of I19312 being a red nova remnant (RNR) is also considered, but this remains speculative due to the lack of direct evidence. The evolutionary stage of I19312 remains unclear, but it shares multiple characteristics with both evolved stars with peculiar properties and RNRs. Further long-term monitoring and high-resolution interferometric observations are required to better constrain the nature of this object.

<title>A Very Long Baseline Interferometry Calibrator Grid at 600 MHz for Fast Radio Transient Localizations with CHIME/FRB Outriggers</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB) Project has a new very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) Outrigger at the Green Bank Observatory (GBO), which forms a 3300 km baseline with CHIME operating at 400–800 MHz. Using 100 ms long full-array baseband “snapshots” collected commensally during FRB and pulsar triggers, we perform a shallow, wide-area VLBI survey covering a significant fraction of the northern sky targeted at the positions of compact sources from the Radio Fundamental Catalog. In addition, our survey contains calibrators detected from two 1 s long trial baseband snapshots for a deeper survey with CHIME and GBO. In this paper, we present the largest catalogue of compact calibrators suitable for 30 mas scale VLBI observations at subgigahertz frequencies to date. Our catalogue consists of 200 total calibrators in the Northern Hemisphere that are compact on 30 mas scales with fluxes above 100 mJy. This calibrator grid will enable the precise localization of hundreds of FRBs a year with CHIME/FRB Outriggers.

<title>GECKO Follow-up Observations of the Binary Neutron Star–Black Hole Merger Candidate S230518h</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The gravitational-wave (GW) event S230518h is a potential binary neutron star–black hole merger (NSBH) event that was detected during engineering run 15, which served as the commissioning period before the LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA O4a observing run. Despite its low probability of producing detectable electromagnetic emissions, we performed extensive follow-up observations of this event using the Gravitational-wave Electromagnetic Counterpart Korean Observatories (GECKO) telescopes in the Southern Hemisphere. Our observations covered 61.7% of the 90% credible region, a 284 deg2 area accessible from the Southern Hemisphere, reaching a median limiting magnitude of R = 21.6 mag. In these images, we conducted a systematic search for an optical counterpart of this event by combining a convolutional-neural-network-based classifier and human verification. We identified 128 transient candidates, but no significant optical counterpart was found that could have caused the GW signal. Furthermore, we provide feasible kilonova properties that are consistent with the upper limits of the observations. Although no optical counterpart was found, our result demonstrates both GECKO’s efficient wide-field follow-up capabilities and usefulness for constraining properties of kilonovae from NSBH mergers at distances of ∼200 Mpc.

<title>Prediction of Halo Coronal Mass Ejections Using SDO/HMI Vector Magnetic Data Products and a Transformer Model</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adafa0</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adafa0</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a transformer model, named DeepHalo, to predict the occurrence of halo coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Our model takes as input an active region (AR) and a profile, where the profile contains a time series of data samples in the AR that are collected 24 hr before the beginning of a day, and predicts whether the AR would produce a halo CME during that day. Each data sample contains physical parameters, or features, derived from photospheric vector magnetic field data taken by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory. We survey and match CME events in the Space Weather Database Of Notification, Knowledge, Information and the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph CME Catalog, and we compile a list of CMEs, including halo CMEs and nonhalo CMEs, associated with ARs in the period between 2010 November and 2023 August. We use the information gathered above to build the labels (positive vs. negative) of the data samples and profiles at hand, where the labels are needed for machine learning. Experimental results show that DeepHalo with a true skill statistic (TSS) score of 0.907 outperforms a closely related long short-term memory network with a TSS score of 0.821. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the transformer model has been used for halo CME prediction.

<title>Inverse Raman Scattering and the Diffuse Interstellar Bands: An Exploration of the Systemic Interconnections between Spontaneous and Inverse Raman Scattering and Extended Red Emission, Red Rectangle Bands, and Diffuse Interstellar Bands</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
First identified in 1964, inverse Raman scattering (IRS) is a nonlinear stimulated phenomenon that induces Raman-scattered absorptions where Raman emissions would be expected. This paper highlights the significance of IRS in analyzing the spectra of stars located in the distant background of H I interstellar clouds. Specifically, ultraviolet emission lines Raman scattered by atomic hydrogen, typically observed in emission at wide scattering angles in the optical spectra of symbiotic stars and nebulae, should appear as IRS absorptions in the optical spectra of the background stars. I show that all known interstellar Raman-scattered emission lines in the Hα wavelength region are detected in absorption as diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) in the spectra of reddened stars, and conclude that IRS by atomic hydrogen resolves the long-standing DIB puzzle. This sheds new light on the perplexing relationship between DIBs and the Red Rectangle nebula emission bands (RRBs). The conditions under which either DIBs or RRBs are detected emphasize the importance of considering the physical relationship between the observer, the H I medium, and the direction of the illuminating radiation field (i.e., the geometry of the observation) in observations of H I interstellar matter. Observing in the direction of the radiation field or on its side determines whether IRS, yielding DIBs and the 2200 Å bump, or spontaneous Raman scattering at wide scattering angles, resulting in extended red emission, Raman-scattered emission lines (including RRBs), and unidentified infrared bands, will be observed.

<title>Helium Pickup Ion Velocity Distributions Observed in Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejection Structures</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The velocity distribution functions (VDFs) of He+ pickup ions (PUIs) through two interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) events associated with two interplanetary shocks are examined. Their specific properties in pitch-angle space were used as tracers of the local physical processes. These VDFs were studied using observations from the PLasma And SupraThermal Ion Composition instrument on board the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory with 10 minutes cadence and full energy and angular resolutions. The analysis focuses on pitch angle distributions and their average/deviation to evaluate heating/cooling, acceleration/deceleration, and pitch angle diffusion. For an ICME accompanied by the quasi-perpendicular shock, (a) reflected and energized particles were found in the upstream, and pitch angle scattering and suprathermal particle production were conspicuous in the downstream; (b) strong heating was observed in the sheath region; (c) suprathermal particles were found in the sheath region and attributed to the velocity fluctuation within the solar wind; and (d) universal pitch angle scattering was found throughout the ICME. For an ICME accompanied by a quasi-parallel shock, (a) localized heating and acceleration were found around the shock location; (b) power-law suprathermal tail distributions were found near the shock, suggesting diffusive shock acceleration processes; (c) weak or no sheath heating was observed; and (d) pitch angle scattering was correlated with magnetic field power spectral density. In the magnetic cloud for this event, pitch angle diffusion consistent with the scattering by counterpropagating Alfvén waves was found. This type of analysis can be applied to study shock injection processes and PUI transport/diffusion processes under active conditions.

<title>The GeV γ-Ray Emission from the Composite Supernova Remnant CTB 87</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb282</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb282</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report the GeV γ-ray emission around the composite supernova remnant (SNR) CTB 87 with more than 16 yr of PASS 8 data recorded by the Fermi Large Area Telescope. Two separate point sources with different GeV spectra are identified in this region: one has a soft γ-ray spectrum, likely due to interactions between the SNR shock and molecular clouds, and another source with a hard GeV γ-ray spectrum aligns with the TeV spectrum of VER J2016+371, suggesting it as the GeV counterpart. Considering the observations of CTB 87 in the radio and X-ray bands, VER J2016+371 is proposed to originate from the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) associated with PSR J2016+3711. A leptonic model with a broken power-law electron distribution could explain the multiwavelength data of VER J2016+371, with fitted parameters matching typical γ-ray PWNe. Deeper searching for the SNR shock of CTB 87 in other bands and the future TeV observations by LHAASO and Cherenkov Telescope Array are crucial to reveal the nature of CTB 87.

<title>The Protostars in Orion: Characterizing the Properties of Their Magnetized Envelopes</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9ea4</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a study connecting the physical properties of protostellar envelopes to the morphology of the envelope-scale magnetic field. We used the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) polarization observations of 61 young protostars at 0.87 mm on ~400–3000 au scales from the B-field Orion Protostellar Survey to infer the envelope-scale magnetic field, and we used the dust emission to measure the envelope properties on comparable scales. We find that protostars showing standard hourglass magnetic field morphology tend to have larger masses, and the nonthermal velocity dispersion is positively correlated with the bolometric luminosity and dust temperature of the envelope. Combining with the disk properties taken from the Orion VLA/ALMA Nascent Disk and Multiplicity survey, we connect envelope properties to fragmentation. Our results show a positive correlation between the fragmentation level and the angle dispersion of the magnetic field, suggesting that the envelope fragmentation tends to be suppressed by the magnetic field. We also find that protostars exhibiting standard hourglass magnetic field structure tend to have a smaller disk and smaller angle dispersion of the magnetic field than other field configurations, especially the rotated hourglass, but also the spiral and others, suggesting a more effective magnetic braking in the standard hourglass morphology of magnetic fields. Nevertheless, significant misalignment between the magnetic field and outflow axes tends to reduce magnetic braking, leading to the formation of larger disks.

<title>Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV MaStar: Quantification and Abatement of Interstellar Absorption in the Largest Empirical Stellar Spectral Library</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8eb6</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We assess the impact of Ca iiλλ3934, 3969 and Na iλλ5891, 5897 absorption arising in the interstellar medium (ISM) on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-IV MaNGA Stellar Library (MaStar) and produce corrected spectroscopy for 80% of the 24,162-star catalog. We model the absorption strength of these transitions as a function of the stellar distance, Galactic latitude, and dust reddening based on high-spectral resolution studies. With this model, we identify 6342 MaStar stars that have negligible ISM absorption (WISM(Ca ii K) < 0.07 Å and WISM(Na i 5891) < 0.05 Å). For 12,110 of the remaining stars, we replace their Na i D profile (and their Ca ii profile for effective temperatures Teff > 9000 K) with a coadded spectrum of low-ISM stars with similar Teff, surface gravity, and metallicity. For 738 additional stars with Teff > 9000 K, we replace these spectral regions with a matching ATLAS9-based BOSZ model. This results in a mean reduction in W(Ca ii K) (W(Na i D)) of 0.4–0.7 Å (0.6–1.1 Å) for hot stars (Teff > 7610 K), and a mean reduction in W(Na i D) of 0.1–0.2 Å for cooler stars. We show that interstellar absorption in the simple stellar population (SSP) model spectra constructed from the original library artificially enhances W(Ca ii K) by ≳20% at young ages (<400 Myr); dramatically enhances the strength of stellar Na i D in starbursting systems (by ≳50%); and enhances stellar Na i D in older stellar populations (≳10 Gyr) by ≳10%. We provide SSP spectra constructed from the cleaned library and discuss the implications of these effects for stellar population synthesis analyses constraining the stellar age, [Na/Fe] abundance, and initial mass function.

<title>Tidal Disruptions of Stars by Supermassive and Intermediate-mass Black Hole Binaries: The Effects of the First-order Post-Newtonian Cross Terms</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb1bb</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb1bb</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In the vicinity of galactic nuclei, stars orbiting supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries can undergo tidal disruption events (TDEs) due to the Lidov–Kozai mechanism and three-body interactions. While numerical simulations have incorporated post-Newtonian (PN) corrections up to 2.5PN order, they have not accounted for the 1PN cross-term effects among the three bodies. In this study, we employ N-body simulations to investigate the impact of the 1PN cross terms on the orbits of stars around an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) perturbed by an outer SMBH. Our findings indicate that while the 1PN cross terms do not substantially affect the fractions of stellar outcomes, they can cause considerable variations in the orbits of stars around IMBH–SMBH binaries. Specifically, we find that the inclusion of the 1PN cross terms can lead to more concentrated distributions of semimajor axes. Furthermore, we observe heavy tails in the distributions of temporal shifts in TDEs when these cross terms are included, with the maximum change reaching about 106 yr, approaching the maximum integration time of this study. This investigation underscores the critical importance of incorporating the 1PN cross terms to ensure accuracy in comprehensive simulations of multibody systems in galactic nuclei. Notably, for stars partially disrupted by an SMBH binary, omitting these cross terms could result in erroneous predictions.

<title>Modeling the UV to Radio Spectral Energy Distribution of NGC 6946: Star Formation Rates and Dust Attenuation Properties</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada957</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this paper, we perform an ultraviolet (UV) to radio spectral energy distribution fitting analysis of star-forming regions in the nearby galaxy NGC 6946 by means of the Graphite and Silicates (GRASIL) population synthesis and radiative transfer model to which the first version of the thoroughly updated Padova and Trieste Stellar Evolutionary Code (PARSEC v1.2s) database of evolutionary nonrotating tracks of massive stars is incorporated. The tracks span a wide range of initial chemical compositions (Z = 0.0001–0.04) and stellar initial mass function (IMF) upper mass limits (Mup = 40 M⊙–350 M⊙). We obtain from our best-fit models consistent and robust estimates of star formation rate calibrations at wavelengths ranging from UV to radio and as a function of IMF upper mass limit. We investigate the properties of dust attenuation curves that also result from the best-fit models by exploiting the realistic treatment of dust performed by GRASIL. This resulted in new relations between optical emission fluxes that are subject to attenuation and fluxes that are not prone to attenuation. These relations, which we show to be almost independent of IMF upper mass limits, can be extremely useful in estimating attenuations in young high redshift galaxies.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Massive-star formation involves significant ionization in the innermost regions near the central object, such as gravitationally trapped H ii regions, jets, ionized disks, or winds. Resolved observations of the associated continuum and recombination line emission are crucial for guiding theory. The next-generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) will enable unprecedented observations of thermal emission with 1 mas resolution, providing a new perspective on massive-star formation at scales down to a few astronomical units at kiloparsec distances. This work presents synthetic interferometric ngVLA observations of the free–free continuum (93 GHz band), H41α, and H38α recombination lines from ionized jets and disks around massive protostars. Using the sf3dmodels Python package, we generate gas distributions based on analytical models, which are then processed through the RADMC-3D radiative transfer code. Our results indicate that the ngVLA can easily resolve, both spatially and spectrally, the ionized jet from a 15 M⊙ protostar at 700 pc, distinguishing between collimated jets and wide-angle winds, and resolving their launching radii, widths, and any substructure down to a few astronomical units. Detailed studies of radio jets launched by massive protostars will be feasible up to distances of ∼2 kpc. Furthermore, ngVLA will be able to study in detail the ionized disks around massive (>10 M⊙) protostars up to distances from 4 to 12 kpc, resolving their kinematics and enabling the measurement of their central masses across the Galaxy. These observations can be conducted with on-source integrations of only a few hours.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Observations by the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA (LVK) detectors have provided new insights into the demographics of stellar-origin black hole binaries (sBHBs). A few years before gravitational-wave signals from sBHB mergers are recorded in the LVK detectors, their early coalescence will leave a unique signature in the ESA/NASA mission Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Multiband observations of sBHB sources between the LISA and LVK detectors opens an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the astrophysical environment and multimessenger early alerts. In this study, we report the sBHB sources that are expected to be present in the LISA data derived directly from the hydrodynamic cosmological simulation Illustris. By surveying snapshots across cosmological volume, metallicity, and lookback time, we calculate the expected sBHBs present in the LISA data for various combinations of mission lifetimes and stellar population models. For stellar population estimates consistent with the LVK rates, we find that only 10 sBHBs across the Illustris snapshots would be detected with significant confidence for a 10 yr LISA mission, while a 4 yr LISA mission would detect only ∼1 sBHB. Our work paves the way for creating LISA mock data and benchmarking LISA detection pipelines directly using cosmological simulations.

As the nearest supernova (SN) observed since Kepler’s SN of 1604, SN 1987A provides an unprecedented opportunity to study in detail the early evolution of supernova remnants. Despite extensive studies through both observations and simulations, there is still an urgent need for a more effective approach to integrate the results from two sides. In this study, we conducted a detailed differential emission measure (DEM) analysis on the XMM-Newton observations taken in 2007 to 2021 to characterize the continuous temperature structure of SN 1987A, which can be better compared with simulations. The X-ray plasma exhibits a temperature distribution with a major peak at ∼0.5–1 keV and a high-temperature tail extending to ≳5 keV. The emission measure (EM) of the major peak started to decline around 2014, while the EM of the tail continued increasing and appears to have formed a secondary peak at ∼3–5 keV in recent years. Our DEM results are consistent with simulations, which help to further identify the major peak as originating from the equatorial ring and the secondary peak as arising from the newly shocked ejecta. Together with the simulations, our DEM analysis reveals recent fading of the ring and brightening of the ejecta in X-rays from SN 1987A. Additionally, we observed a recent decrease in the centroid energy of the Fe K line, providing further evidence of newly shocked ejecta.

<title>Active Galactic Nucleus Feedback in Quiescent Galaxies at Cosmic Noon Traced by Ionized Gas Emission</title>

We analyze ionized gas emission lines in deep rest-frame optical spectra of 14 massive ( M⊙) quiescent galaxies at redshifts 1.7 < z < 3.5 observed with JWST/NIRSpec by the Blue Jay survey. Robust detection of emission lines in 71% of the sample indicates the presence of ongoing ionizing sources in this passive population. The Hα line luminosities confirm that the population is quiescent, with star formation rates that are at least 10 times lower than the main sequence of star formation at z ∼ 2. The quiescent sample is clearly separate from the star-forming population in line diagnostic diagrams, and occupies a region usually populated by active galactic nuclei (AGN). Analysis of the observed line ratios, equivalent widths, and velocity dispersions leads us to conclude that in most cases the gas is ionized by AGN activity, despite the lack of X-ray detections. We measure generally low values of the bolometric luminosity Lbol ∼ 1044 erg s−1 and Eddington ratio λ ∼ 10−2–10−3 for the central engines, typical of low-luminosity AGN. A subset of the sample also hosts ionized and neutral outflows, with ionized outflow velocities of the order of ∼1000 km s−1. Our results show, for the first time using a representative sample, that low-luminosity AGN are extremely common among quiescent galaxies at high redshift. These low-luminosity AGN may play a key role in quenching star formation and in maintaining massive galaxies quiescent from Cosmic Noon to z ∼ 0.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are radio signals that last milliseconds. They originate from cosmological distances and have relatively high dispersion measures (DMs), making them excellent distance indicators. However, the origins of the FRB remain to be resolved. With its wide field of view and excellent sensitivity, CHIME/FRB has discovered more than half of all known FRBs. As more and more FRBs are located within or connected with their host galaxies, the study of FRB progenitors is becoming more important. In this work, we collect the currently available information related to the host galaxies of FRBs, and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis about limited localized samples reveals no significant difference in the median of DMhost between repeaters and nonrepeaters. After examining and selecting CHIME/FRB samples, we estimate the local volumetric rate density of repeaters and nonrepeaters, accounting for different DMhost contributions, and compare with rates of predicted origin models and transient events. Our results indicate that DMhost significantly affects volumetric rates and offer insights into the origin mechanisms of FRB populations.

<title>Stochastic Acceleration in Weakly Turbulent Astrophysical Environments</title>

Turbulent magnetic fields are to some extent a universal feature in astrophysical phenomena. Charged particles that encounter this turbulence are typically accelerated according to the so-called second-order Fermi process. However, in most astrophysical environments there are additional competing processes, such as different kinds of first-order energy changes and particle escape, that affect the resulting momentum distribution of the particles. In this work we provide to our knowledge the first semianalytical solution of the isotropic steady-state momentum diffusion equation including continuous and catastrophic momentum changes that can be applied to any astrophysical system of interest that is under the influence of weak magnetic turbulence. Here, we adopt that the assigned magnetic turbulence is constrained to a finite range and the particle flux vanishes beyond these boundaries. Consequently, we show that the so-called pile-up bump—which has long been established for some special cases—is a universal feature of stochastic acceleration that emerges around the momentum χeq where acceleration and continuous loss are in equilibrium if the particle’s residence time in the system is sufficient at χeq. In general, the impact of continuous and catastrophic momentum changes plays a crucial role in the shape of the steady-state momentum distribution of the accelerated particles, where simplified unbroken power-law approximations are often not adequate.

The H0 and S8 tensions highlight critical discrepancies in modern cosmology, challenging the standard Lambda cold dark matter model. The H0 tension arises from conflicting measurements between local probes and early-Universe predictions. Similarly, the S8 tension, related to the amplitude of matter clustering, exposes inconsistencies between cosmic microwave background data and weak gravitational lensing surveys. The primary goal of this work is to address these tensions by modifying the underlying geometric framework. Specifically, we test two f(T) gravity models using cosmic chronometers, baryonic acoustic oscillations, gamma-ray bursts, and Pantheon+SH0ES data sets and compare the results with gravitational-wave data for validation. Both teleparallel models demonstrate promising performance in simultaneously alleviating the H0 and S8 tensions.

<title>Tracing Coherent Gas Structures in the Central Region of the Starburst Galaxy NGC 253. II. Gas Excitation and Star Formation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Molecular gas in the central region of the starburst galaxy NGC 253 is complicated because of the combination of different gas kinematics, including stellar feedback, noncircular motions, and magnetic activity. In paper I, we used the latest multitransition, multi-isotope CO-line data sets obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array to classify the molecular gas within the central 850 pc in radius into 28 coherent structures, and we proposed a three-dimensional geometric structure for the gas in the central region of this galaxy. In this paper, we utilize intensity ratios between 12CO (J = 3–2), 12CO (J = 1–0), HCN (J = 4–3), and SiO (J = 2–1) to investigate the physical properties of each coherent structure, comparing the distributions with (proto-)star clusters, known as superbubble candidates, and stars. We found that the excitation state of the gas tends to increase toward the galactic center, and we identified high-excitation states in the gas with noncircular motions. From analyses of HCN (J = 4–3) and SiO (J = 2–1), we found that the dense, star-forming clumps that drive the starburst reside either at the points connecting any two streams or in the central region where two oppositely directed, accretion flows terminate. Based on analyses of the intensity ratios and the proposed geometric structure, we suggest that some superbubbles may instead be the overlap of the coherent structures rather than an expanding shell. From all these results, we propose a scenario in which the starburst was triggered by cloud–cloud collisions caused by interactions of streams and/or by magnetic flotation and/or efficient accretion along a stellar bar.

<title>Dynamical and Atmospheric Characterization of the Substellar Companion HD 33632 Ab from Direct Imaging, Astrometry, and Radial-velocity Data*</title>

We present follow-up SCExAO/CHARIS H- and K-band (R ∼ 70) high-contrast integral field spectroscopy and Keck/NIRC2 photometry of directly imaged brown dwarf companion HD 33632 Ab and new radial-velocity data for the system from the SOPHIE spectrograph, complemented by Hipparcos and Gaia astrometry. These data enable more robust spectral characterization compared to lower-resolution spectra from the discovery paper and more than double the available astrometric and radial-velocity baseline. HD 33632 Ab’s spectrum is well reproduced by a field L8.5–L9.5 dwarf. Using the Exo-REM atmosphere models, we derive a best-fit temperature, surface gravity, and radius of Teff = 1250 K, log(g) = 5, and R = 0.97 RJ, respectively, as well as a solar C/O ratio. Adding the SOPHIE radial-velocity data enables far tighter constraints on the companion’s orbital properties (e.g., i = o) and dynamical mass ( MJ) than derived from imaging data and Gaia eDR3 astrometry data alone. HD 33632 Ab should be a prime target for multiband imaging and spectroscopy with the James Webb Space Telescope and the Roman Space Telescope’s Coronagraphic Instrument, shedding detailed light on HD 33632 Ab’s clouds and chemistry and providing a key reference point for understanding young exoplanet atmospheres.

JWST is revealing a remarkable new population of high-redshift (z ≳ 4), low-luminosity active galactic nuclei in deep surveys and detecting the host galaxy's stellar light in the most luminous and massive quasars at z ∼ 6 for the first time. Recent findings claim that supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in these systems are significantly more massive than predicted by the local black hole (BH) mass–stellar mass ( ) relation and that this is not due to sample selection effects. Through detailed statistical modeling, we demonstrate that the coupled effects of selection biases (i.e., finite detection limit and requirements for detecting broad lines) and measurement uncertainties can largely explain the reported offset and flattening in the observed relation toward the upper envelope of the local relation, even for those at . We further investigate the possible evolution of the relation at z ≳ 4 with careful treatment of observational biases and consideration of the degeneracy between intrinsic evolution and dispersion in this relation. The bias-corrected intrinsic relation in the low-mass regime ( ) suggests a large population of low-mass BHs ( ), possibly originating from lighter seeds, may remain undetected or unidentified. These results underscore the importance of forward modeling observational biases to better understand BH seeding and SMBH–galaxy coevolution mechanisms in the early universe, even with the deepest JWST surveys.

<title>Boltzmann–Poisson Theory of Nonthermal Self-gravitating Gases, Cold Dark Matter, and Solar Atmosphere</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Space and astrophysical plasmas or gases can reach various states of thermal or nonthermal quasi-equilibrium, depending on the collisional age of the observed system. Widely observed in space plasmas, the Kappa (or —power-law) velocity distribution (KVD) is eloquent evidence of nonthermal states. M. P. Leubner has developed KVD models for luminous gases and cold dark matter (DM) with empirical density profiles described by > 0 and < 0, respectively. The predicted temperature profiles, however, are not in qualitative agreement with the nonmonotonic features expected in some gas and DM models. This study adopts the more consistent regularized Kappa distribution (RKD) to derive the equilibrium profiles of self-gravitating gas and DM halos within a Boltzmann–Poisson theoretical approach. The new RKD models can replicate better than the KVD models the Navarro–Frenk–White density profile of the DM near the basic halos and can also produce nonmonotonic temperature profiles. The same RKD formalism is also applied to non-self-gravitating astrophysical systems, which shows that for highly nonthermal cases ( < 3/2), the temperature of the surrounding gases decreases initially in a narrow region. The temperature then increases sharply and reaches a high saturated value, resembling the overheated solar atmosphere, while the density profile near the surface may depart from the observations. Compared to the KVD models, the new RKD models can provide improved descriptions of gravitational equilibrium systems, especially for highly nonthermal cases and temperature profiles.

<title>A New Algorithm for Detecting X-Ray Shots in Cyg X-1</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada774</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The short-term X-ray variability of Cyg X-1 can be interpreted as a random occurrence of mini-flares known as the shots, whose physical nature is still unclear. We propose a new algorithm for shot identification in the X-ray light curve, based on baseline detection and template fitting. Compared with previous techniques, our algorithm allows us to detect shots with lower amplitudes and shorter time separations. With NICER observations, we find that, after correction for detection sensitivity, both the shot amplitude and recurrence rate are positively scaled with the mean count rate, while the recurrence rate has a much higher dependence on the count rate. These suggest that a higher mass accretion rate will drive more and slightly larger shots. We also find that the abrupt hardening near the shot peak found in previous studies is attributed to different shot profiles in different energy bands; there is no need to involve a rapid physical process to suddenly harden the emitting spectrum.

<title>Mapping the Outcomes of Stellar Evolution in the Disks of Active Galactic Nuclei</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The disks of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are expected to be populated by numerous stars, either formed in the outer regions of the disk via gravitational instability or captured from the nearby nuclear star cluster. Regardless of their formation mechanism, these stars experience altered evolutionary paths, mostly shaped by the accretion of dense disk material. In this study, through the comparison of different timescales, we chart the evolutionary outcomes of these AGN stars as a function of disk radius and across a range of supermassive black hole masses, spanning from 106 to 109M⊙, for two popular AGN disk models. We find that in the outer regions of the disk, stars evolve similarly to those in the interstellar medium, but in the inner and denser regions, accretion quickly turns low-mass stars into massive stars, and their fate depends on just how quickly they accrete. If accretion occurs at a faster rate than nuclear burning, they can reach a quasi-steady “immortal” state. If stars accrete faster than they can thermally adjust, runaway accretion occurs, potentially preventing a quasi-steady state and altering the disk structure. During the AGN lifetime, in the regions of the disk that produce massive stars, supernovae (SNe) and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) may occur within the disk over a wide range of optical depths and ambient densities. Subsequently, in the final phase of the AGN, as the disk becomes depleted, formerly immortal stars will be unable to replenish their fuel, leading to additional SNe and GRBs.

<title>A Measurement of Atmospheric Circular Polarization with POLARBEAR</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada89b</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
At millimeter wavelengths, the atmospheric emission is circularly polarized owing to the Zeeman splitting of molecular oxygen by the Earth's magnetic field. We report a measurement of the signal in the 150 GHz band using 3 yr of observational data with the Polarbear project. Nonidealities of a continuously rotating half-wave plate (HWP) partially convert circularly polarized light to linearly polarized light. While Polarbear detectors are sensitive to linear polarization, this effect makes them sensitive to circular polarization. Although this was not the intended use, we utilized this conversion to measure circular polarization. We reconstruct the azimuthal gradient of the circular polarization signal and measure its dependency from the scanning direction and the detector bandpass. We compare the signal with a simulation based on atmospheric emission theory, the detector bandpass, and the HWP leakage spectrum model. We find the ratio of the observed azimuthal slope to the simulated slope is 0.92 ± 0.01(stat) ± 0.07(sys). This ratio corresponds to a brightness temperature of 3.8 mK at the effective band center of 121.8 GHz and bandwidth of 3.5 GHz estimated from representative detector bandpass and the spectrum of Zeeman emission. This result validates our understanding of the instrument and reinforces the feasibility of measuring the circular polarization using the imperfection of continuously rotating HWP. Continuously rotating HWP is popular in ongoing and future cosmic microwave background experiments to modulate the polarized signal. This work shows a method for signal extraction and leakage subtraction that can help measure circular polarization in such experiments.

Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are one of the most energetic phenomena in the cosmos, whose study can probe physics extremes beyond the reach of laboratories on Earth. Our quest to unravel the origin of these events and understand their underlying physics is far from complete. Central to this pursuit is the rapid classification of GRBs to guide follow-up observations and analysis across the electromagnetic spectrum and beyond. Here, we introduce a compelling approach that can set a milestone toward a new and robust GRB prompt classification method. Leveraging self-supervised deep learning, we pioneer a previously unexplored data product to approach this task: GRB waterfalls.

<title>Early Grain Growth in the Young Protostellar Disk HH 212 Supported by Dust Self-scattering Modeling</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Grain growth in disks around young stars plays a crucial role in the formation of planets. Early grain growth has been suggested in the HH 212 protostellar disk by previous polarization observations. To confirm it and to determine the grain size, we analyze high-resolution multiband observations of the disk obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in bands 9 (0.4 mm), 7 (0.9 mm), 6 (1.3 mm), and 3 (3 mm), as well as with the Very Large Array (VLA) in band Ka (9 mm), and we present new VLA data in bands Q (7 mm), K (1.3 cm), and X (3 cm). We adopt a parameterized flared disk model to fit the continuum maps of the disk in these bands and derive the opacities, albedos, and opacity spectral index β of the dust in the disk, taking into account the dust scattering ignored in the previous work modeling the multiband data of this source. For the VLA bands, we only include the band Q data in our modeling to avoid free–free emission contamination. The obtained opacities, albedos, and opacity spectral index β (with a value of ∼1.2) suggest that the upper limit of maximum grain size in the disk should be ∼130 μm, consistent with that implied in the previous polarization observations in band 7, supporting the grain growth in this disk. The values of the absorption opacities further highlight the need for a new dust composition model for Class 0/I disks.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Significant improvements in our understanding of nuclear γ-ray line production and instrument performance allow us to better characterize the continuum emission from electrons at energies ≳300 keV during solar flares. We represent this emission by the sum of a power-law (PL) extension of hard X-rays and a power law times an exponential function (PLexp). We fit the γ-ray spectra in 25 large flares observed over 40 yr with this continuum and the calculated spectra of all known nuclear components. The PLexp is separated spectroscopically from the other components, and its presence is required with >99% confidence in 18 of the flares. Its distinct origin is suggested by significant differences between its time histories and those of the PL and nuclear components in 18 of the flares. RHESSI imaging/spectroscopy of the 2005 January 20 flare reveals that the PL and nuclear components come from the footpoints, while the PLexp component comes from the corona. While the index and flux of the anisotropic PL component are dependent on the flare’s heliocentric angle, the PLexp parameters do not show comparable dependences with 99.5% confidence. The PLexp spectrum is flat at low energies and rolls over at a few megaelectronvolts (MeV). Such a shape can be produced by thin-target bremsstrahlung from electrons with a spectrum that peaks between 3 and 5 MeV and by inverse Compton scattering of soft X-rays by 10–20 MeV electrons, or by a combination of the two. These electrons can produce radiation detectable at other wavelengths.

The quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in the X-ray variability of both black hole (BH) and neutron star (NS) systems provide a tool for probing strong gravity and dense matter equations of state. Nevertheless, the mechanism of QPO modulation in NS systems, where the amplitudes of QPOs with frequencies approaching the kHz range are very high in comparison to BH high-frequency QPOs, remains an unsolved puzzle. Relativistic ray tracing of photons emitted from the immediate vicinity of compact objects has, to date, been used to investigate various mechanisms that explain the observed weak BH QPOs. However, it has not been applied to model the NS QPO signal, which requires incorporating the NS surface and a bright boundary layer (BL) on it. Here, we explore the QPO modulation mechanisms based on the BL obscuration. Using simplified models of axisymmetric oscillations of thick accretion disks (tori), we demonstrate that the disk oscillations drive the high NS QPO amplitudes through BL obscuration, which is relevant, especially for vertical oscillations. We also demonstrate that obscuration effects enable the observability of the Keplerian frequency in the case of disks that decay due to instabilities.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Recent baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration, combined with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and type Ia supernovae observations, suggest a preference for dynamical dark energy (DDE) with w0 > −1 and wa < 0. Given the cosmological origin of fast radio bursts (FRBs), the combination of their dispersion measures (DMs) and host galaxy redshifts makes localized FRBs a valuable tool for probing cosmology. Using an updated sample of 92 localized FRBs, along with DESI BAO, PlantheonPlus, and CMB data, we constrain the dark energy (DE) equation of state (EoS) under the Chevallier–Polarski–Linder parameterization. We find that even without incorporating CMB data, DDE remains preferred with and at a confidence level of ∼2.5σ. A joint analysis constrains these to be and , showing a discrepancy with ΛCDM at a ∼3.1σ level. Furthermore, using localized FRBs alone, we estimate the Hubble constant H0 to be and , assuming the Galactic electron density models to be NE2001 and YMW16, respectively. Thus, accurate accounting of the Galactic DM is crucial for resolving the Hubble tension with FRBs. Future BAO measurements, next-generation CMB experiments, and more localized FRBs will further constrain the DE EoS and the cosmological parameters.

<title>Radial Dependence of Ion Fluences in the 2023 July 17 Solar Energetic Particle Event from Parker Solar Probe to STEREO and ACE</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In the latter moments of 2023 July 17, the solar active region (AR) 13363, near the southwestern face of the Sun, was undergoing considerable evolution, which resulted in a significant solar energetic particle (SEP) event measured by Parker Solar Probe’s Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun (IS⊙IS) and near-Earth spacecraft. Remote observations from GOES and CHASE captured two M5.0+ solar flares that peaked at 23:34 and 00:06 UT from the source region. In tandem, STEREO COR2 first recorded a small, narrow coronal mass ejection (CME) emerging at 22:54 UT and then saw a major halo CME emerge at 23:43 UT with a bright, rapidly expanding core and CME-driven magnetic shock with an estimated speed of ∼1400 km s−1. Parker Solar Probe was positioned at 0.65 au, near-perfectly on the nominal Parker spiral magnetic field line, which connected Earth and the AR for a 537 km s−1 ambient solar wind speed at L1. This fortuitous alignment provided the opportunity to examine how the SEP velocity dispersion, energy spectra, elemental composition, and fluence varied from 0.65 to 1 au along a shared magnetic connection to the Sun. We find a strong radial gradient, which is best characterized for H and He as r−4.0, and most surprisingly, is stronger for O and Fe, which is better described by r−5.7.

The pulsar wind nebula CTB 87 (G74.9+1.2) is one of the sources emitting γ-rays with energies higher than 10 TeV, as measured by the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System telescope. In this study, we undertake a reanalysis of the GeV emission from the CTB 87 region, utilizing ∼16 yr of high-energy γ-ray data collected with the Fermi Large Area Telescope. In the energy range of 0.03–1 TeV, the spectrum can be adequately described by a power-law model with an index of 1.34 ± 0.18, and the integral energy flux is calculated to be (7.25 ± 1.36) × 10−13 erg cm−2 s−1. Based on the multiband data, we have employed a time-dependent model to investigate the nonthermal emission properties of CTB 87. In the model, it is assumed that particles with broken power-law energy distributions are continuously injected into the nebula. This results in multiband nonthermal emission being produced by relativistic leptons via synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton processes. Furthermore, the model suggests an energy of approximately 2.4 PeV for the most energetic particle in the nebula.

<title>Torsional Alfvén Shock Waves in Stratified Coronal Loops</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adaeab</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The evolution of weakly nonlinear Alfvén waves in coronal loops in the density structuring both across and along the field while experiencing dissipation is highlighted. Energy transfer due to shock formation in coronal loops provides the basis for the context of the present study. Coronal loops are modeled analytically using the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) theory in cylindrical geometry, incorporating stratification and viscosity. The effects of the external medium, along with equilibrium conditions, are considered, with the background magnetic field aligned parallel to the loop axis. The second-order thin flux tube approximation is employed to derive a Cohen–Kulsrud–Burgers type of evolutionary equation that highlights the influences of nonlinear, dissipative, and stratification terms, alongside the effect of the external medium. The Alfvén wave speed in coronal loops reaches its maximum when shocks are experienced. If not due to low amplitudes, the maximum is observed at the other footpoint. The location of shock formation is determined by the ratio of the Alfvén wave amplitude and the background Alfvén wave speed. The existence of energy transfer mechanisms due to MHD shocks at various locations of coronal loops, especially loop footpoints, brings to mind that observed energy transfers in the case of coronal loops or a set of loops not only provide coronal heating but also provide transition region heating subject to conditions. For high plasma-β values at lower altitudes, shock formation is less dependent on the external medium and depends strongly on the loop’s internal dynamics. This is contrary to open magnetic structures.

<title>Automatic Machine Learning Framework to Study Morphological Parameters of AGN Host Galaxies within z < 1.4 in the Hyper Supreme-Cam Wide Survey</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adaec0</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adaec0</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a composite machine learning framework to estimate posterior probability distributions of bulge-to-total light ratio, half-light radius, and flux for active galactic nucleus (AGN) host galaxies within z < 1.4 and m < 23 in the Hyper Supreme-Cam (HSC) Wide survey. We divide the data into five redshift bins: low (0 < z < 0.25), mid (0.25 < z < 0.5), high (0.5 < z < 0.9), extra (0.9 < z < 1.1), and extreme (1.1 < z < 1.4), and train our models independently in each bin. We use PSFGAN to decompose the AGN point-source light from its host galaxy, and invoke the Galaxy Morphology Posterior Estimation Network (GaMPEN) to estimate morphological parameters of the recovered host galaxy. We first trained our models on simulated data, and then fine-tuned our algorithm via transfer learning using labeled real data. To create training labels for transfer learning, we used GALFIT to fit ∼20,000 real HSC galaxies in each redshift bin. We comprehensively examined that the predicted values from our final models agree well with the GALFIT values for the vast majority of cases. Our PSFGAN + GaMPEN framework runs at least three orders of magnitude faster than traditional light-profile fitting methods, and can be easily retrained for other morphological parameters or on other data sets with diverse ranges of resolutions, seeing conditions, and signal-to-noise ratios, making it an ideal tool for analyzing AGN host galaxies from large surveys coming soon from the Rubin-LSST, Euclid, and Roman telescopes.

<title>The Influence of Chromospheric Activity on Line Formation</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb0c6</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb0c6</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
One of the primary sources of stellar spectral variability is magnetic activity. While our current understanding of chromospheric activity is largely derived from specific lines sensitive to chromospheric heating, such as the Ca ii H and K doublet, previous observational studies have shown that other spectral lines are also affected. To investigate the influence of activity on line formation in greater detail, we constructed a set of stellar models for hypothetical G2 dwarf stars with varying levels of activity and calculated their synthetic spectra. A comparison of these spectra revealed two spectral regions most significantly impacted by activity: approximately 3300–4400 Å and 5250–5500 Å. By calculating the total contribution function of the lines, we determined that the emergence of a secondary chromospheric contribution to line formation is the primary mechanism driving these changes. Based on our calculations and analysis, we compiled a list of transition lines and their corresponding changes due to chromospheric activity. This list could serve as a valuable tool for selecting spectral lines applicable to a wide range of astrophysical studies.

<title>Climate Transition to Temperate Nightside at High Atmosphere Mass</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb0cb</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb0cb</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Our recent work shows how M-Earth climates and transmission spectra depend on the amount of ice-free ocean on the planet’s dayside and the mass of N2 in its atmosphere. M-Earths with more ice-free ocean and thicker atmospheres are hotter and more humid and have larger water vapor features in their transmission spectra. In this paper, we describe a climate transition in high-pN2 simulations from the traditional “eyeball” M-Earth climate, in which only the substellar region is temperate, to a “temperate nightside” regime, in which both the dayside and the nightside are entirely ice-free. Between these two states, there is a “transition” regime with partial nightside ice cover. We use 3D climate simulations to describe the climate transition from frozen to deglaciated nightsides. We attribute this transition to increased advection and heat transport by water vapor in thicker atmospheres. We find that the nightside transitions smoothly back and forth between frozen and ice-free when the instellation or pCO2 is perturbed, with no hysteresis. We also find an analogous transition in colder planets: those with thin atmospheres can have a dayside hot spot when the instellation is low, whereas those with more massive atmospheres are more likely to be in the “snowball” regime, featuring a completely frozen dayside, due to the increased advection of heat away from the substellar point. We show how both of these climate transitions are sensitive to instellation, land cover, and atmosphere mass. We generate synthetic transmission spectra and phase curves for the range of climates in our simulations.

<title>High Significance Detection of the Dark Substructure in Gravitational Lens SDSS J0946+1006 by Image Pixel Supersampling</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb1b6</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb1b6</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Recent studies have shown that the dark substructure reported in the gravitational lens SDSS J0946+1006 has a high central density, which is in apparent tension with the flat cold dark matter (ΛCDM) paradigm. However, its detection significance has been found in D. J. Ballard et al. to be sensitive to prior assumptions about the smoothness of the source galaxy. Here we show that the detection significance of the substructure is higher than previously reported (log-Bayes factor , equivalent to a ∼17σ detection) by approximating the integration of light over each pixel via ray tracing and averaging over many subpixels—a technique known as supersampling—and this result is insensitive to the assumed prior on the source galaxy smoothness. Assuming a dark matter subhalo, the combination of supersampling and modeling both sets of lensed arcs also tightens the subhalo constraints: we find the subhalo’s projected mass within 1 kpc lies in the range (2.2–3.4) × 109M⊙ at 95% confidence in our highest evidence model, while the log-slope of the subhalo’s projected density at 1 kpc is steeper than −1.75 at the 95% confidence level, further establishing it as an outlier compared to expectations from CDM. We also identify a systematic that has biased the slope of the primary lensing galaxy’s density profile in prior studies, which we speculate might be due to the presence of dust or an imperfect foreground subtraction. Our analysis places the existence of the substructure on firmer ground, and should motivate deeper follow-up observations to better constrain its properties and clarify its apparent tension with ΛCDM.

<title>Coupling of Dynamical Tide and Orbital Motion</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb1e5</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The dynamical tide consists of various waves that can resonate with orbital motion. We test this coupling of the dynamical tide and orbital motion using a simple 2D shallow water model, which can be applied to a rocky planet covered with a thin ocean or atmosphere. Then we take the Earth–Moon system as a fiducial model to calculate the tidal resonances and orbital evolution. We find that tidal dissipation can even increase with increasing orbital separation because of the coupling of the dynamical tide and orbital motion. We draw the conclusion that the coupling is not negligible to study the orbital evolution on a secular timescale.

<title>Asymmetric Temperature Variations In Protoplanetary Disks. I. Linear Theory, Corotating Spirals, and Ring Formation</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adae0d</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adae0d</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Protoplanetary disks can exhibit asymmetric temperature variations due to phenomena such as shadows cast by the inner disk or localized heating by young planets. We investigate the disk features induced by these asymmetric temperature variations. We find that spirals are initially excited, and then break into two and reconnect to form rings. By carrying out linear analyses, we first study the spiral launching mechanism and find that the effects of azimuthal temperature variations share similarities with effects of external potentials. Specifically, rotating temperature variations launch steady spiral structures at Lindblad resonances, which corotate with the temperature patterns. When the cooling time exceeds the orbital period, these spiral structures are significantly weakened, and a checkerboard pattern may appear. A temperature variation of about 10% can induce spirals with order unity density perturbations, comparable to those generated by a thermal mass planet. We then study ring formation and find it is related to the coupling between azimuthal temperature variations and spirals outside the resonances. Such coupling leads to a radially varying angular momentum flux, which produces anomalous wave-driven accretion and forms dense rings separated by the wavelength of the waves. Finally, we speculate that spirals induced by temperature variations may contribute to disk accretion through nonlinear wave steepening and dissipation. Overall, considering that irradiation determines the temperature structure of protoplanetary disks, the change of irradiation both spatially or/and temporarily may produce observable effects in protoplanetary disks, especially spirals and rings in outer disks beyond tens of au.

<title>ALMA 0.1 pc View of Molecular Clouds Associated with High-mass Protostellar Systems in the Small Magellanic Cloud: Are Low-metallicity Clouds Filamentary or Not?</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada5f8</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada5f8</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Filamentary molecular clouds are an essential intermediate stage in the star formation process. To test whether these structures are universal throughout cosmic star formation history, it is crucial to study low-metallicity environments within the Local Group. We present an analysis of Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) archival data at the spatial resolution of ~0.1 pc for 17 massive young stellar objects (YSOs) in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC; Z ~ 0.2 Z⊙). This sample represents approximately 30% of the YSOs confirmed by Spitzer spectroscopy. Early ALMA studies of the SMC have shown that the CO emission line traces an H2 number density of ≳104 cm−3, an order of magnitude higher than in typical Galactic environments. Using the CO(J = 3–2) data, we investigate the spatial and velocity distribution of molecular clouds. Our analysis shows that about 60% of the clouds have steep radial profiles from the spine of the elongated structures, while the remaining clouds have a smooth distribution and are characterized by lower brightness temperatures. We categorize the former as filaments and the latter as nonfilaments. Some of the filamentary clouds are associated with YSOs with outflows and exhibit higher temperatures, likely reflecting their formation conditions, suggesting that these clouds are younger than the nonfilamentary ones. This indicates that even if filaments form during star formation, their steep structures may become less prominent and transition to a lower-temperature state. Such transitions in structure and temperature have not been reported in metal-rich regions, highlighting a key behavior for characterizing the evolution of the interstellar medium and star formation in low-metallicity environments.

<title>LEIA Discovery of the Longest-lasting and Most Energetic Stellar X-Ray Flare Ever Detected</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada698</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada698</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The Lobster Eye Imager for Astronomy (LEIA) detected a new X-ray transient on 2022 November 7, identified as a superflare event occurring on a nearby K-type giant star HD 251108. The flux increase was also detected in follow-up observations at X-ray, UV, and optical wavelengths. The flare lasted for about 40 days in soft X-ray observations, reaching a peak luminosity of ∼1.1 × 1034 erg s−1 in 0.5–4.0 keV, which is roughly 60 times the quiescent luminosity. Optical brightening was observed for only one night. The X-ray light curve is well described by a double fast rise and exponential decay model, attributed to the cooling process of a loop arcade structure formed subsequent to the initial large loop with a half-length of ∼1.9 × 1012 cm. Time-resolved X-ray spectra were fitted by a four-temperature apec model (with three components being the quiescent background), showing significant evolution of plasma temperature and emission measure over time. The estimated energy released in the LEIA band is ∼3 × 1039 erg, suggesting that this is likely the most energetic X-ray stellar flare with the longest duration detected to date.

<title>Comparison of Global H i and Hα Line Profiles in MaNGA Galaxy Pairs with FAST</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada935</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada935</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present case studies comparing the global H i and Hα emission line profiles of six galaxy pairs. The six pairs are selected to have different nuclear activities, with two hosting an active galactic nucleus, and in different merging stages—two of each from the premerging, merging, and postmerging stages. We observe their global H i spectra with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope, achieving a noise level of ~0.5 mJy. Five out of the six pair systems have secure detections of H i emissions (signal-to-noise ratio > 10). The H i fraction and star formation efficiency of the six pairs do not deviate from isolated galaxies. For the H i line profiles, common unique asymmetry is observed, indicating disturbances of the atomic gas from the galaxy interaction. The global Hα spectra of the merger systems are constructed from the optical integral field spectroscopic observations by integrating the flux in corresponding line-of-sight velocity bins. The Hα spectra tend to show multiple components in the premerger phase and single-component line profiles in the postmerger systems, while all H i spectra show single-component line profiles regardless of merger stages. The H i and Hα spectra show offsets in the central velocities, which appear to decrease from >100 km s−1 in the premerger pair to <10 km s−1 in the postmergers. This trend is consistent with the scenario that, despite the significantly different distributions and kinematics of the atomic and ionized gases, the merging process may contribute to the mixing and eventually align various gas contents.

<title>Fractality of Magnetic Helicity Distribution in the Solar Corona</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adaaed</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We find a universal power-law scaling of magnetic helicity distribution in the solar corona. Magnetic helicity is a dynamical invariant for ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and characterizes complex magnetic field structure by measuring the degree of knottiness of its field lines. We treat turbulent solar magnetic field as a superposition of random waves and develop a statistical topology method regarding the randomly tangled field lines. Based on the statistical behavior of the field lines, we consider their topology-specified structure and theoretically derive power laws for the distribution of magnetic flux and helicity. We find a power law of −7/4 to the magnetic helicity distribution when the field line topology is equivalent to handle and −5/4 when the field line topology is local open curve. We verify the universality of this new magnetic helicity fractality by observation to a number of 185 sunspots in newly emerging active regions during the 23rd and 24th solar cycle. This new distribution law reveals the fractal structure of the solar magnetic field.

<title>High Lithium Abundance Connection with the Chromospheric Helium in Red Giants: Spectroscopic and Asteroseismic Analyses</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adab78</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a study of correlations between high Li abundances and strong chromospheric He iλ10830 absorption-line strengths in Kepler field giant stars. Our sample includes 84 giants with detectable solar-like oscillations in their light curves, and their Li abundances come from the literature or are measured here using LAMOST medium-resolution spectra. Evolutionary phases are determined through asteroseismic analysis, with mixed-mode period spacing (ΔP) used to infer the time evolution of red clump (RC) giants. Near-IR observations of the He iλ10830 line were obtained with the high-resolution Habitable-zone Planet Finder spectrograph on the Hobby–Eberly Telescope. We find high Li abundances and strong He i lines exclusively among RC giants, with their absence in red giant branch stars suggesting a shared origin linked to the He flash. Additionally, a steady decline in He i strength with decreasing Li abundance among RC giants indicates a correlation between these properties. Older, Li-normal RC giants are He weak, while most younger, super-Li-rich giants are He strong, suggesting temporal evolution of both phenomena. We hypothesize that the core He flash and subsequent subflashes may enhance Li abundances in RC giant photospheres and trigger heightened chromospheric activity, leading to stronger He iλ10830 lines in younger RCs. Over time, following He flash, chromospheric activity diminishes, resulting in weaker He i lines in older, Li-normal RCs.

<title>MUSEQuBES: The Kinematics of O vi-bearing Gas in and around Low-redshift Galaxies</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adabbd</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adabbd</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a detailed study of the kinematics of O vi-bearing gas around 60 low-mass (median = 8.9) galaxies at low redshift (0.1 < z < 0.7) using background quasars (median impact parameter ≈115 kpc) as part of the MUSE Quasar-fields Blind Emitters Survey (MUSEQuBES). We find that the majority of the O vi absorbers detected within the virial radius have line-of-sight velocities smaller than the escape velocities and are thus consistent with being gravitationally bound, irrespective of the halo mass. However, the fraction of such absorbers declines at larger impact parameters. The Doppler b parameter and the velocity width (Δv90) of the O vi absorbers exhibit large scatter inside the virial radius of the host galaxies, but the scatter declines sharply at impact parameter D ≳ 2Rvir. For high-mass galaxies ( > 9), O vi absorption displays a larger kinematic spread, quantified by the pixel-velocity two-point correlation function (TPCF). However, the difference becomes marginal when the pixel velocities are scaled by the galaxies’ circular velocities. We do not find any significant difference between the TPCF of isolated and group galaxies when the stellar mass is controlled for. A significant fraction of groups (4/6) with four or more member galaxies do not show any detectable O vi absorption, likely due to the passive nature of the nearest galaxies.

<title>Evidence for Jet/Outflow Shocks Heating the Environment around the Class I Protostellar Source Elias 29: FAUST XXI</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adabe7</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adabe7</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We have observed the late Class I protostellar source Elias 29 at a spatial resolution of 70 au with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array as part of the FAUST Large Program. We focus on the line emission of SO, while that of 34SO, C18O, CS, SiO, H13CO+, and DCO+ are used supplementarily. The spatial distribution of the SO rotational temperature (Trot(SO)) is evaluated by using the intensity ratio of its two rotational excitation lines. Besides in the vicinity of the protostar, two hot spots are found at a distance of 500 au from the protostar; Trot(SO) locally rises to 53 K at the interaction point of the outflow and the southern ridge, and 72 K within the southeastern outflow probably due to a jet-driven bow shock. However, the SiO emission is not detected at these hot spots. It is likely that active gas accretion through the disk-like structure and onto the protostar still continues even at this evolved protostellar stage, at least sporadically, considering the outflow/jet activities and the possible infall motion previously reported. Interestingly, Trot(SO) is as high as 20–30 K even within the quiescent part of the southern ridge apart from the protostar by 500–1000 au without clear kinematic indication of current outflow/jet interactions. Such a warm condition is also supported by the low deuterium fractionation ratio of HCO+ estimated by using the H13CO+ and DCO+ lines. The B-type star HD147889 ∼0.5 pc away from Elias 29, previously suggested as a heating source for this region, is likely responsible for the warm condition of Elias 29.

<title>Multifrequency Models of Black Hole Photon Rings from Low-luminosity Accretion Disks</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Images of black holes encode both astrophysical and gravitational properties. Detecting highly lensed features in images can differentiate between these two effects. We present an accretion disk emission model coupled to the Adaptive Analytical Ray Tracing (AART) code that allows a fast parameter space exploration of black hole photon ring images produced from synchrotron emission from 10 to 670 GHz. As an application, we systematically study several disk models and compute their total flux density, average radii, and optical depth. The model parameters are chosen around fiducial values calibrated to general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations and observations of M87*. For the parameter space studied, we characterize the transition between optically thin and thick regimes and the frequency at which the first photon ring is observable. Our results highlight the need for careful definitions of photon ring radius in the image domain, as in certain models the highly lensed photon ring is dimmer than the direct emission at certain angles. We find that at low frequencies the ring radii are set by the electron temperature, while at higher frequencies the magnetic field strength plays a more significant role, demonstrating how multifrequency analysis can also be used to infer plasma parameters. Lastly, we show how our implementation can qualitatively reproduce multifrequency black hole images from GRMHD simulations when adding time variability to our disk model through Gaussian random fields. This approach provides a new method for simulating observations from the Event Horizon Telescope and the proposed Black Hole Explorer space mission.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Solar activities significantly influence space weather and the Earth’s environment, necessitating accurate and efficient sunspot detection. This study explores deep learning methods to automate sunspot identification in solar satellite images, keeping personal bias to a minimum. Utilizing observations of the Solar Dynamics Observatory, we leverage active-region data from the Helioseismic Magnetic Imager active-region patches to locate sunspot groups detected between 2011 and 2023. The Morphological Active Contour Without Edges technique is applied to produce pseudo-labels, which are utilized to train the U-Net deep learning architecture, combining their strengths for robust segmentation. Evaluation metrics—including precision, recall, F1-score, intersection over union, and Dice coefficient—demonstrate the superior performance of U-Net. Our approach achieves a high Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.97 when compared with the sunspot area estimation of the Space Weather Prediction Center and 0.96 in comparison with the Debrecen Photoheliographic Data. This hybrid methodology provides a powerful tool for sunspot identification, offering the improved accuracy and efficiency crucial for space-weather prediction.

HR 5907 (HD 142184) stands out among magnetic OB stars for its rapid rotation, exceptionally hard X-ray emission, and strong magnetic field. High-frequency (>5 GHz) radio emission from the star exhibits an approximately flat spectrum that can be attributed to gyrosynchrotron emission from a dense centrifugal magnetosphere. In a survey of radio emission from massive stars at sub-GHz frequencies, we noticed remarkable low-frequency radio emission from this star, characterized by high circular polarization and brightness temperature, which is inconsistent with the gyrosynchrotron model. We present a follow-up low-frequency radio study of this star with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope in search of emission mechanisms that can go undiagnosed at higher frequencies. We detect variable radio emission characterized by varying degrees of circular polarization (15%–45%) throughout the rotation cycle. The broadband spectral fitting also suggests additional emission components at lower frequencies. We show that the observed emission is likely auroral emission via electron cyclotron maser emission (ECME) and identify this star as a main-sequence radio pulse emitter (MRP). For MRPs, ECME is usually observed as short polarized enhancements near the magnetic nulls of the star. The detection of a high degree of circular polarization (>15%) at all times makes HR 5907 unique among MRPs. This is only the second MRP after ρ Oph C (detected polarization fraction: 0%–60%) that exhibits persistent coherent radio emission attributed to the nearly aligned stellar magnetic and rotational axes.

<title>Fast and Efficient Bayesian Method to Search for Strongly Lensed Gravitational Waves</title>

A small fraction of the gravitational-wave (GW) signals from binary black holes observable by ground-based detectors will be strongly lensed by intervening objects such as galaxies and clusters. Strong lensing will produce nearly identical copies of the GW signals separated in time. These lensed signals must be identified against a background of unlensed pairs GW events, some of which may appear similar by accident. This is usually done using fast, but approximate methods that, for example, check for the overlap between the posterior distributions of a subset of binary parameters, or using slow, but accurate joint Bayesian parameter estimation. In this work, we present a modified version of the posterior overlap method dubbed “PO2.0” that is mathematically equivalent to joint parameter estimation while still remaining fast. We achieve a significant gain in efficiency by incorporating informative priors about the binary and lensing populations, selection effects, and all the inferred parameters of the binary. For binary black hole signals lensed by galaxies, our improved method can detect 65% lensed events at a pairwise false alarm probability of ∼2 × 10−6. Consequently, we have a 13% probability of detecting a strongly lensed event above 2.25σ significance during 18 months of observation by the LIGO-Virgo detectors at their current sensitivity. We also show how we can compute the joint posteriors of the lens and source parameters from a pair of lensed events by reweighting the posteriors of individual events in a computationally inexpensive way.

<title>Extracting the X-Ray Reverberation Response Functions from the Active Galactic Nucleus Light Curves Using an Autoencoder</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We study the X-ray reverberation in active galactic nuclei (AGN) using the variational autoencoder (VAE), which is a machine learning algorithm widely used for signal processing and feature reconstruction. While the X-ray reverberation signatures that contain the information of the accretion disk and the X-ray-emitting corona are commonly analyzed in the Fourier domain, this work aims to extract the reverberation response functions directly from the AGN light curves. The VAE is trained using the simulated light curves that contain the primary X-rays from the lamppost corona, varying its height and the corresponding reflection X-rays from the disk. We use progressively more realistic light-curve models, such as those that include the effects of disk-propagating fluctuations and random noises, to assess the ability of the VAE to reconstruct the response profiles. Interestingly, the VAE can recognize the reverberation patterns on the light curves; hence, the coronal height can be predicted. We then deploy the VAE model on the XMM-Newton data of IRAS 13224–3809 and directly estimate, for the first time, the response functions of this source in various observations. The result reveals the corona changing its height between 3rg and 20rg, which is correlated with the source luminosity and in line with previous literature. Finally, we discuss the advantages and limitations of this method.

<title>Studying the Radiation of a White Dwarf Star Falling onto a Black Hole</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We investigate electromagnetic and gravitational radiation generated during the process of the tidal stripping of a white dwarf star circulating a black hole. We go beyond Chandrasekhar’s ideas and not only consider the white dwarf itself as a quantum object, but also describe the dynamics of the produced accretion disk in a quantum way. We model the white dwarf star as a Bose–Fermi droplet and use the quantum hydrodynamic equations to simulate the evolution of the black hole–white dwarf binary system. While going through periastron, the white dwarf loses a small fraction of its mass. The mass falling onto a black hole is a source of powerful electromagnetic and gravitational radiation. Bursts of ultraluminous radiation are flared at each periastron passage. This resembles the recurrent flaring of X-ray sources discovered recently by Irwin et al. Gravitational energy bursts occur mainly through emission at very low frequencies. The accretion disk, formed due to stripping of the white dwarf, starts at some point to contribute continuously to radiation of both electromagnetic and gravitational types.

<title>Could the Neutrino Emission of TXS 0506+056 Come from the Accretion Flow of the Supermassive Black Hole?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
High-energy neutrinos from the blazar TXS 0506+056 are usually thought to arise from the relativistic jet pointing to us. However, the composition of jets of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), whether they are baryon dominated or Poynting flux dominated, is largely unknown. In the latter case, no comic rays and neutrinos would be expected from the AGN jets. In this work, we study whether the neutrino emission from TXS 0506+056 could be powered by the accretion flow of the supermassive black hole. Protons could be accelerated by magnetic reconnection or turbulence in the inner accretion flow. To explain the neutrino flare of TXS 0506+056 in the years 2014–2015, a super-Eddington accretion is needed. During the steady state, a sub-Eddington accretion flow could power a steady neutrino emission that may explain the long-term neutrino flux from TXS 0506+056. We consider the neutrino production in both magnetically arrested accretion (MAD) flow and the standard and normal evolution (SANE) regime of accretion. In the MAD scenario, due to a high magnetic field, a large dissipation radius is required to avoid the cooling of protons and secondary pions.

<title>Study on the Responses in the Transition Region of Coronal Extreme-ultraviolet Waves</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Coronal extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) waves are globally propagating disturbances in the solar atmosphere. The existence of coronal EUV waves was predicted by chromospheric Moreton–Ramsey waves. It is widely accepted that Moreton–Ramsey waves represent the chromospheric imprints of coronal EUV waves that compress downward during their lateral propagations. Hence, coronal EUV waves should inevitably compress the interlayer between the corona and the chromosphere, the transition region (TR), before reaching the chromosphere. However, the responses in the TR of coronal EUV waves lack enough attention. Here, we focus on the wave signatures in He ii 304 Å for a sample of 640 coronal EUV waves from 2010 to 2021, aiming to establish a “bridge” connecting coronal EUV waves and chromospheric Moreton–Ramsey waves. It is found that ∼14.4% of all coronal EUV waves have TR responses, and ∼34.5% of “disk events” with TR responses have chromospheric imprints. We specifically analyze the wave front characteristics of disk events with TR responses (58). Statistical analysis shows that TR responses for coronal EUV waves have an average speed of 495.58 ± 27.62 km s−1, an average duration of 488.4 ± 12 s, an average angular width of 71 22, and an average intensity enhancement ratio (IER) of 30.39%. Moreover, all TR responses with chromospheric imprints display a greater inclination angle (>50°) and a larger IER (>30%). All the results suggest that TR responses can be indicators of missing Moreton–Ramsey waves and clarify the resolution of the mystery of the rarity of Moreton–Ramsey waves.

<title>Geometry of the Comptonization Region of MAXI J1348−630 through Type-C Quasiperiodic Oscillations with NICER</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We use the rms and lag spectra of the type-C quasiperiodic oscillation (QPO) to study the properties of the Comptonization region (aka corona) during the low/hard and hard-intermediate states of the main outburst and reflare of MAXI J1348−630. We simultaneously fit the time-averaged energy spectrum of the source and the fractional rms and phase-lag spectra of the QPO with the time-dependent Comptonization model VKOMPTH. The data can be explained by two physically connected coronae interacting with the accretion disk via a feedback loop of X-ray photons. The best-fitting model consists of a corona of ∼103 km located at the inner edge of the disk and a second corona of ∼104 km horizontally extended and covering the inner parts of the accretion disk. The properties of both coronae during the reflare are similar to those during the low/hard state of the main outburst, reinforcing the idea that both the outburst and the reflare are driven by the same physical mechanisms. We combine our results for the type-C QPO with those from previous work focused on the study of type-A and type-B QPOs with the same model to study the evolution of the geometry of the corona through the whole outburst, including the reflare of MAXI J1348−630. Finally, we show that the sudden increase in the phase-lag frequency spectrum and the sharp drop in the coherence function previously observed in MAXI J1348−630 are due to the type-C QPO during the decay of the outburst and can be explained in terms of the geometry of the coronae.

<title>Stream Members Only: Data-driven Characterization of Stellar Streams with Mixture Density Networks</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Stellar streams are sensitive probes of the Milky Way’s gravitational potential. The mean track of a stream constrains global properties of the potential, while its fine-grained surface density constrains galactic substructure. A precise characterization of streams from potentially noisy data marks a crucial step in inferring galactic structure, including the dark matter, across orders of magnitude in mass scales. Here we present a new method for constructing a smooth probability density model of stellar streams using all of the available astrometric and photometric data. To characterize a stream’s morphology and kinematics, we utilize mixture density networks to represent its on-sky track, width, stellar number density, and kinematic distribution. We model the photometry for each stream as a single-stellar population, with a distance track that is simultaneously estimated from the stream’s inferred distance modulus (using photometry) and parallax distribution (using astrometry). We use normalizing flows to characterize the distribution of background stars. We apply the method to the stream GD-1, and the tidal tails of Palomar 5. For both streams we obtain a catalog of stellar membership probabilities that are made publicly available. Importantly, our model is capable of handling data with incomplete phase-space observations, making our method applicable to the growing census of Milky Way stellar streams.

<title>Turbulence and Magnetic Field Alignment in Small Molecular Clouds: The Role of Cloud Size, Mass, and Density</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada562</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this study, we investigate the relationship between turbulence (ΔV) and different physical parameters in 22 isolated small molecular clouds and their cores, extending the analysis to a hierarchical scenario from core to cloud. Using 12CO line width as a tracer of turbulence, we find that ΔV correlates with both cloud size and mass, following and . Further, the surface density of the clouds (Σcl) influences the ΔV–Lcl relation, with . This indicates that gravitational energy drives turbulence in clouds, indicating possible virial equilibrium. We observe that Lcl correlates with Mcl and volume gas density of the cloud (ρcl), implying nearly constant Σcl across the clouds. In cloud cores, C18O line-width data show complex behavior, with no direct correlation between ΔV and core size (Lco). However, a positive correlation emerges when the surface density of the core is included in Lco. Notably, the relation between volume gas density (ρco) and core size (Lco) deviates from constant core surface density. Our analysis reveals that turbulent pressure increases with gravitational pressure to maintain global equilibrium. Finally, on the core-to-cloud scale, physical relationships remain continuous, reflecting the interconnected nature of clouds and cores. Extending our previous work, where we demonstrated a nonlinear dependence of turbulence on the alignment of the local magnetic field in molecular clouds with the Galactic plane, we now compare observations with a theoretical model based on kinetic theory. Our result confirms that higher turbulence causes greater magnetic misalignment consistent with the derived second-order polynomial relationship.

<title>Effect of Lyα Radiative Transfer on Intensity Mapping Power Spectra</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Clustering of Lyα-emitting galaxies (LAEs) and Lyα line intensity mapping (LIM) are useful probes of cosmology. However, Lyα radiative transfer (RT) effects, such as absorption, line shift, and line broadening, and their dependence on the large-scale density and velocity fields can modify the measured LAE clustering and LIM statistics. We explore the effects of RT on the Lyα LIM power spectrum in two ways: using an analytic description based on linear approximations, and using lognormal mocks. The qualitative effects of intergalactic Lyα absorption on the LIM auto- and cross-power spectrum include a scale-dependent, reduced effective bias, reduced mean intensity, and modified redshift-space distortions. The linear absorption model does not describe the results of the lognormal simulations well. The random line shift suppresses the redshift-space power spectrum similar to the Fingers-of-God effect. In cross-correlation of LAEs or Lyα intensity with a non-Lyα tracer, the Lyα line shift leads to a phase shift of the complex power spectrum, i.e., a cosine damping of the real part. We study the impact of Lyα RT effects on the Hobby–Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX) LAE and LIM power spectra using lognormal mocks. We find that even small amounts of IGM absorption will significantly change the measured LAE auto-power spectrum. The LAE-intensity cross-power spectrum stays within the measurement uncertainty. Therefore, HETDEX will be able to constrain Lyα RT effects.

<title>Can Dark Stars Account for the Star Formation Efficiency Excess at Very High Redshifts?</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada93b</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has recently conducted observations of massive galaxies at high redshifts, revealing a notable anomaly in their star formation efficiency (SFE). Motivated by the recent identification of three ~106M⊙ dark star candidates, we investigate whether dark stars can be the origin of the SFE excess. It turns out that the excess can be reproduced by a group of dark stars with M ≳ 103M⊙, because of their domination in generating primary UV radiation in high-redshift galaxies. The genesis of these dark stars is attributed to the capture of weakly interacting massive particles within a mass range of tens of gigaelectronvolts to a few teraelectronvolts. However, if the top-heavy initial mass function of dark stars holds up to ~105M⊙, the relic black holes stemming from their collapse would be too abundant to be consistent with the current observations of massive compact halo objects. We thus suggest that just a small fraction of SFE excess may be contributed by the very massive dark stars, with the majority likely originating from other sources, such as the Population III stars, in view of their rather similar UV radiation efficiencies.

<title>Chemical Evolution of Isotopically Labeled Carbon Dioxide (13CO2) Ice Exposed to Ionizing Radiation and Implications for Trans-Neptunian Objects</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present results on the radiation chemistry of isotopically labeled carbon dioxide (13CO2) ices induced by energetic electrons at 40 and 10 K to simulate the chemical evolution of carbon dioxide on trans-Neptunian objects exposed to galactic cosmic-ray particles. By collecting infrared spectra during the irradiation of 13CO2 ices, we have identified several radiolysis products, including carbon monoxide (13CO), ozone (O3), carbon trioxide (13CO3) with cyclic (C2v) and acyclic (D3h) isomers, carbon tetraoxide (13CO4), carbon pentaoxide (13CO5), and carbon hexaoxide (13CO6). The temporal profiles reveal that all products exhibit a rapid increase followed by a gradual decrease during prolonged irradiation, with the reduction at 40 K occurring faster than at 10 K. Furthermore, the ratio of 13CO to 13CO2 rises to constants of 0.20 at 40 K and 0.27 at 10 K as radiation accumulates within ices, which has potential implications for understanding the specific conditions of trans-Neptunian objects, such as galactic cosmic-ray exposure history, or other astrophysical scenarios characterized by abundant carbon dioxide.

<title>Exploring the Neutrino Mass Hierarchy from Isotopic Ratios of Supernova Nucleosynthesis Products in Presolar Grains</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We study the nucleosynthesis in a core-collapse supernova (CCSN) model including newly calculated neutrino-induced reaction rates with both collective and Mikheyev–Smirnov–Wolfenstein neutrino flavor oscillations considered. We show that the measurement of a pair of 11B/10B and 138La/139La or 6Li/7Li and 138La/139La in presolar grains that are inferred to have originated from CCSNs could constrain the neutrino mass hierarchy. The new shell model and the model of quasiparticle random phase approximation in the estimate of three important neutrino-induced reactions, ν + 16O, ν + 20Ne, and ν + 138Ba, are applied in our reaction network. The new rates decrease the calculated 7Li/6Li ratio by a factor of 5 compared with the previous study. More interestingly, these new rates result in a clear separation of the isotopic ratio of 11B/10B between normal and inverted mass hierarchies in the O/Ne, O/C, and C/He layers, where 138La abundance depends strongly on the mass hierarchy. In these layers, the sensitivity of the calculated abundances of 10,11B and 6,7Li to the nuclear reaction uncertainties is also tiny. Therefore, we propose that the 11B/10B versus 138La/139La and 6Li/7Li versus 138La/139La in type X silicon carbide grains sampled material from C/He layer can be used as a new probe to constrain the neutrino mass hierarchy.

<title>Planetary Rhythms: Synchronous Circulation on Variably Irradiated Asynchronous Planets</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Tidal locking of planets to their host stars results in an atmospheric circulation with a hotspot fixed to the frame of reference of the planet. On the other hand, asynchronously rotating planets feature moving hotspots either lagging or leading the corresponding substellar point as it translates along the surface. We show that a planet falling in the latter category could mimic the circulation of tidally synchronous planets under the influence of time-varying instellation, possibly provided by pulsating or multiple star systems. This happens when the planet’s diurnal period is in resonance with the period of instellation variation, leading to a planet-frame-fixed hotspot. Slight differences in the above periods lead to east–west or west–east creeping hotspots with a period significantly longer than both. The rate of hotspot motion is given by the difference between the diurnal and instellation variation rates, similar to the lower envelope frequency of beat patterns formed by two superposed waves in linear wave theory. We call this phenomenon “beating.” A combination of the radiative, rotational, wave propagation, and drag timescales establishes dynamical constraints on beating. Based on this, we classify a set of Kepler and TESS circumbinary planets with two candidates exhibiting climatic departures from the no-variation scenario. In general, hotter and faster-spinning planets are more susceptible to climatic departures. Beating, if it occurs, may additionally create optimistic extensions of habitable zones for corresponding systems.

<title>Measuring the Intracluster Light Fraction with Machine Learning</title>

The intracluster light (ICL) is an important tracer of a galaxy cluster’s history and past interactions. However, only small samples have been studied to date due to its very low surface brightness and the heavy manual involvement required for the majority of measurement algorithms. Upcoming large imaging surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory’s Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) are expected to vastly expand available samples of deep cluster images. However, to process this increased amount of data, we need faster, fully automated methods to streamline the measurement process. This paper presents a machine learning model designed to automatically measure the ICL fraction in large samples of images, with no manual preprocessing required. We train the fully supervised model on a training data set of 50,000 images with injected artificial ICL profiles. We then transfer its learning onto real data by fine-tuning with a sample of 101 real clusters with their ICL fraction measured manually using the surface brightness threshold method. With this process, the model is able to effectively learn the task and then adapt its learning to real cluster images. Our model can be directly applied to Hyper Suprime-Cam images, processing up to 500 images in a matter of seconds on a single GPU, or fine-tuned for other imaging surveys such as LSST, with the fine-tuning process taking just 3 minutes. The model could also be retrained to match other ICL measurement methods. Our model and the code for training it are made available on GitHub.

From the Λ cold dark matter paradigm, it is expected that galaxies merge and grow in their environments. These processes form various tidal features depending on the merger mass ratio, orbital parameters, and gas richness. We inspected 170 -band Abell cluster observations from the 2.1 m Fraunhofer-Teleskop Wendelstein and identify 111 of such features from which we select nine streams and five tails. A fast and innovative technique was developed for determining their photometric properties. The model is a Gaussian, including higher-order moments to describe the light profile in slices perpendicular to the elongation direction. From these models, FWHM apertures are generated. The method was developed, tested, and applied on the selected features and corresponding g- and r-band data from the Legacy Survey DR10. Regarding the novel modeling approach, we can measure surface and total brightnesses with precisions of 4% and 7%, respectively. Mean stream width precision, which also translates to the mean Re along the feature is on average within 3% uncertainty. The measured streams have on average a surface brightness of mag arcsec−2 and are dimmer than the tails in our sample ( mag arcsec−2). We infer that the progenitors of our streams can come from dwarfs, early-type galaxies or disks, based on the streams structural parameters. Furthermore, brightnesses and colors of the streams and tails are consistent with those of galaxies that populate the red sequence in the Coma cluster within 2σ.

In order to apply the Z2 statistic to the estimation of the navigation pulsar period and time delay, and thus further improve the accuracy of X-ray pulsar navigation, this paper proposes a method for estimating the pulsar period and time delay with complex profiles based on the improved -test. Based on the prior information of the amount of photon data in the observation task, this method adaptively determines the optimal harmonic truncation order under different data qualities. In order to solve the problem of the change rate of complex profile signals being too fast, the binned data is rephased according to the principle of equal photon intensity segmentation within the bin, and the optimal number of bins suitable for the PSR B0531+21 pulsar is selected. Through simulation, a quantitative analysis was conducted on factors that affect the performance of the estimation algorithm, such as observation time, detector area, noise interference, etc. Simulation results show that the proposed estimation method has greater advantages when the observation time is short, the detector area is small, and the interference noise is large. In addition, the observation data of the PSR B0531+21 pulsar is processed and analyzed. The period estimation accuracy of the method proposed is 3.6532 ns, which is 39.57% higher than that of the χ2-test method. The method we proposed has the advantages of being suitable for navigation pulsars, strong environmental adaptability, high estimation accuracy, and strong estimation stability, which can further improve the performance of X-ray pulsar navigation.

We present results on the emission-line properties of z = 1.4–7.5 star-forming galaxies in the Assembly of Ultradeep Rest-optical Observations Revealing Astrophysics (AURORA) Cycle 1 JWST/NIRSpec program. Based on its depth, continuous wavelength coverage from 1 to 5 μm, and medium spectral resolution (R ∼ 1000), AURORA includes detections of a large suite of nebular emission lines spanning a broad range in rest-frame wavelength. We investigate the locations of AURORA galaxies in multiple different emission-line diagrams, including traditional BPT diagrams of [O iii]λ5007/Hβ versus [N ii]λ6583/Hα, [S ii]λλ6717, 6731/Hα, and [O i]λ6300/Hα, and the ionization–metallicity diagram of [O iii]λ5007/[O ii]λ3727 (O32) versus ([O iii]λ5007+[O ii]λ3727)/Hβ (R23). We also consider a bluer rest-frame ionization–metallicity diagram introduced recently to characterize z > 10 galaxies, [Ne iii]λ3869/[O ii]λ3727 versus ([Ne iii]λ3869+[O ii]λ3727)/Hδ, as well as longer-wavelength diagnostic diagrams extending into the rest-frame near-IR: [O iii]λ5007/Hβ versus [S iii]λλ9069, 9532/[S ii]λλ6717, 6731 (S32), and He iλ1.083 μm/Paγ and [S iii]λ9532/Paγ versus [Fe ii]λ1.257μm/Paβ. With a significant boost in signal-to-noise ratio and large, representative samples of individual galaxy detections, the AURORA emission-line diagrams presented here definitively confirm a physical picture in which chemically young, α-enhanced, massive stars photoionize the interstellar medium (ISM) in distant galaxies with a harder ionizing spectrum at fixed nebular metallicity than in their z ∼ 0 counterparts. We also uncover previously unseen evolution prior to z ∼ 2 in the [O iii]λ5007/Hβ versus [N ii]λ6583/Hα diagram, which motivates deep NIRSpec observations at even higher redshift. Finally, we present the first statistical sample of rest-frame near-IR emission-line diagnostics in star-forming galaxies at high redshift. In order to truly interpret rest-frame near-IR line ratios including [Fe ii]λ1.257 μm, we must obtain better constraints on dust depletion in the high-redshift ISM.

<title>GRB 221009A and the Apparently Most Energetic Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adadef</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are often referred to as the most luminous explosions in the Universe, due to their short and highly luminous prompt emission. This apparent luminosity, however, does not reflect the true energy budget of the prompt emission, which is strongly beamed. Accurate estimations of the energy radiated during the prompt phase require taking the geometry of GRB jets into account, which remains poorly known. Nevertheless, one may establish the distribution of well-measured quantities, like Eiso, the GRB isotropic equivalent energy, which encrypts crucial information about GRB jets, with the aim of providing constraints on the jet's radiated energy. In this work, we study the bright end of the GRB isotropic equivalent energy distribution (hereafter called “apparent energy”), using an updated sample of 185 apparently energetic GRBs with Eiso ≥ 1053 erg. This new sample includes GRB 221009A, allowing us to discuss this apparently superenergetic GRB in the context of the general Eiso distribution of long GRBs. We describe the construction of the sample and compare three fits of the Eiso distribution with a simple power law, a cutoff power law, and a broken power law. Our study confirms the existence of a cutoff around Eiso = 4 × 1054 erg, even when GRB 221009A is included in the sample. Based on this finding, we discuss the possible reasons behind the rapid decrease in the number of apparently energetic gamma-ray bursts beyond Eiso = 4 × 1054 erg and the interpretation of GRB 221009A, the most apparently energetic GRB detected to date, in this context.

<title>Understanding Streaming Instabilities in the Limit of High Cosmic-Ray Current Density</title>

A critical component of particle acceleration in astrophysical shocks is the nonresonant (Bell) instability, where the streaming of cosmic rays (CRs) leads to the amplification of magnetic fields necessary to scatter particles. In this work we use kinetic particle-in-cell simulations to investigate the high-CR-current regime, where the typical assumptions underlying the Bell instability break down. Despite being more strongly driven, significantly less magnetic field amplification is observed than in low-current cases, an effect due to the anisotropic heating that occurs in this regime. We also find that electron-scale modes, despite being the fastest growing, mostly lead to moderate electron heating and do not affect the late evolution or saturation of the instability.

<title>Radio Polarization from Runaway Star Bowshocks. I. The General Case</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adae0a</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
High velocity stars move through the interstellar medium with V > 30 km s−1. When the star has powerful winds, under the appropriate conditions, the interaction of the wind with the interstellar material produces a system of shocks. The outer shock, called the bowshock, perturbs the ambient medium, heating and compressing the gas. The dust in the compressed bowshock cools, producing infrared radiation. This emission appears as extended coma-shape structures. The discovery of radio nonthermal emission from two stellar bowshock nebulae indicates that these sources might be accelerating electrons up to relativistic energies. The produced nonthermal radio emission is most probably synchrotron, which has a high degree of polarization. In this work we model the synchrotron emission of runaway massive star bowshocks aiming to produce synthetic radio emission and polarization maps for two frequencies: 1.40 and 4.86 GHz. We model the interacting plasmas in a steady-state regime by means of magnetohydrodynamics simulations and we compute the injection and transport of the relativistic electrons in the diffusion approximation. We include in the model the most important depolarization effects. Our main conclusions are (i) the effects of Faraday rotation within the source are important at the lowest frequency considered, (ii) inferring the local magnetic field direction from polarization measurements only can be misleading, (iii) thermal radio emission produced by ionized plasma within the bowshock structure and surroundings can surpass the polarized one for the considered frequencies, and (iv) the contribution from the background electrons is minor.

<title>Primordial Black Holes in the Solar System</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adae84</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adae84</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
If primordial black holes (PBHs) of asteroidal mass make up the entire dark matter, they could be detectable through their gravitational influence in the solar system. In this work, we study the perturbations that PBHs induce on the orbits of planets. Detailed numerical simulations of the solar system, embedded in a halo of PBHs, are performed. We find that the gravitational effect of the PBHs is dominated by the closest encounter. Using the Earth–Mars distance as an observational probe, we show that the perturbations are smaller than the current measurement uncertainties and thus PBHs are not directly constrained by solar system ephemerides. We estimate that an improvement in the ranging accuracy by an order of magnitude or the extraction of signals well below the noise level is required to detect the gravitational influence of PBHs in the solar system in the foreseeable future.

<title>Estimating the Black Hole Spin for the X-Ray Binary MAXI J1727-203 Based on Insight-HXMT</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adae8b</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We constrain the spin of the black hole candidate MAXI J1727-203 using Insight-HXMT data. Due to limited Insight-HXMT observations covering only part of the outburst, NICER data were used to analyze the full outburst’s state transitions; we identified two of three HXMT observations in the high soft state and applied the continuum-fitting method to measure the spin. Based on previous estimates and continuum spectral fittings, we explored the parameter space and found that the best-fitting values were (D, i, M) ≈ (6 kpc, 30°, 12 M⊙). We also tested the variation of these parameters using Monte Carlo simulations, sampling over 3000 sets within the parameter ranges 5.9 kpc < D < 7 kpc, 24° < i < 35°, and 10 M⊙ < M < 14 M⊙, yielding a spin measurement of (1σ). In addition, we analyzed NuSTAR data in the low hard state and found a good fit with the tbabs∗(diskbb+powerlaw) model, with no significant iron line features observed in the residuals; therefore, the previous reflection model results suggesting an extremely high spin overestimates the black hole spin.

<title>Influence of Modeling Assumptions on the Inferred Dynamical State of Resonant Systems: A Case Study of the HD 45364 System</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Planetary systems exhibiting mean motion resonances (MMRs) offer unique opportunities to study the imprint of disk-induced migration on the orbital architectures of planetary systems. The HD 45364 system, discovered via the radial velocity (RV) method to host two giant planets in a 3:2 MMR, has been the subject of several studies attempting to reconstruct the system’s orbital migration history based on its present-day resonant configuration. Recently, Z. Li et al. called into question the system’s residence in the 3:2 MMR based on a revised orbital solution derived from an expanded set of RV observations that extend the time baseline of the original discovery data by over a decade. However, we show that inferences about the planets’ dynamical state with respect to the 3:2 MMR are sensitive to the particular prior assumptions adopted in the orbital modeling. Using N-body dynamical models, we show that orbital solutions constrained to reside deep in the 3:2 MMR fit the RV data with a similar quality to unconstrained orbital solutions. We conclude that the RV observations of HD 45364 are consistent with orbital configurations produced by smooth migration and resonance capture. We further show that past convergent orbital migration can reproduce the system’s present-day orbital configuration provided that the ratio of migration to eccentricity damping timescales, K, was in the range 11 ≲ K ≲ 144. We also find that dynamical interactions in the system can break the usual mass–inclination degeneracy inherent to Keplerian models of RV observations and constrain the planets’ absolute masses to within a factor of ∼1.5.

<title>Comparing Methods for Calculating Solar Energetic Particle Intensities: Rebinning versus Spectral Binning</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adaea9</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Solar energetic particle (SEP) events have been observed for decades in the interplanetary medium by spacecraft measuring the intensity of energetic ions and electrons. These intensities provide valuable information about particle acceleration, the effects of bulk plasma dynamics on particle transport, and the anisotropy of particle distributions. Since measured intensities are typically reported in narrow energy bins, it is common to rebin intensities over a wider energy range to improve counting statistics. We investigate two methods for calculating intensities across multiple energy bins: (a) rebinned intensity ( ), which is calculated by integrating the intensity over energy space and corresponds to the intensity at an effective energy that depends on the time-varying spectral index, and (b) spectral binned intensity ( ), calculated by integrating the log intensity in log–energy space, yielding the intensity at the log-centered energy that is independent of the spectral index and remains constant over time. We compare these methods using Parker Solar Probe (PSP) IS⊙IS measurements of energetic protons, and we prescribe criteria for selecting the appropriate method for different scenarios. Our results show that the rebinned intensity is consistently larger (up to a factor of 5) than the spectral binned intensity for two SEP events observed by PSP, although the time series of the two methods are strongly correlated. Overall, both measures are important for SEP spectral analysis, and the selection of the appropriate measure depends on whether a physical (spectral binned intensity) or a statistical (rebinned intensity) representation is needed for a given analysis.

<title>Simultaneous NICER and NuSTAR Observations of the Neutron Star Low-mass X-Ray Binary Serpens X-1</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the first contemporaneous NICER and NuSTAR analysis of the low-mass X-ray binary Serpens X-1 obtained in 2023 June, performing broadband X-ray spectral analysis modeling of the reprocessed emission with relxillNS from 0.4 to 30 keV. We test various continuum and background estimation models to ensure that our results do not hinge on the choice of model used, and found that the detection of reflection features is independent of the choice of both continuum and background model. The position of the inner accretion disk is consistent with the last stable circular orbit (Rin ≤ 1.2 RISCO) and a low inclination of i ≤ 8.3°. Additionally, we investigate the presence of the low-energy (∼1 keV) Fe L complex in the data from NICER and the Reflection Grating Spectrometer on XMM-Newton that was previously reported in the literature. We find that the line is at most a 2% feature relative to the reprocessed continuum, and are unable to claim a definitive detection for the current data set. However, we discuss plausible conditions and systems that would increase the likelihood of detecting this feature in the future.

<title>Testing Galaxy Formation Models with the Stellar Mass–Halo Mass Relations for Star-forming and Quiescent Galaxies</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adaf1a</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The tight relationship between the stellar mass and halo mass of galaxies is one of the most fundamental scaling relations in galaxy formation and evolution. It has become a critical constraint for galaxy formation models. Over the past decade, growing evidence has convincingly shown that the stellar mass–halo mass relations (SHMRs) for star-forming and quiescent central galaxies differ significantly: at a given stellar mass, the average host halo mass of quiescent centrals is more massive than that of star-forming centrals. Despite the importance of this feature, its scientific implications have not yet been fully recognized or thoroughly explored in the field. In this work, we demonstrate that the semi-analytical model L-GALAXIES successfully reproduces these observational results, whereas three state-of-the-art hydrodynamic galaxy formation simulations (TNG, Illustris, and EAGLE) do not. Consequently, in L-GALAXIES, star-forming central galaxies are more efficient at converting baryons into stars than quiescent central galaxies at a given halo mass, while the other models predict similar efficiencies for both populations. Further analysis reveals that these fundamental discrepancies stem from distinct evolutionary paths on the stellar mass–halo mass plane. We show that the observed SHMRs for star-forming and quiescent galaxies support galaxy formation models in which quenching only weakly correlates with halo assembly histories and the stellar mass of star-forming galaxies can increase significantly after cosmic noon. In contrast, models in which quenching strongly preferentially happens in early-formed halos are not very favored. Additionally, we find that galaxy downsizing is present in L-GALAXIES and TNG but absent in Illustris and EAGLE.

<title>Precession for the Mode Change in a Gamma-Ray Pulsar</title>

PSR J2021+4026 is a gamma-ray pulsar having variations in its spin-down rate and gamma-ray flux. Its variations in timing and emission are correlated, e.g., a larger spin-down rate for a low gamma-ray flux. We show that the mode change in PSR J2021+4026 can be understood in the precession scenario. In the precession model, the inclination angle is modulated due to precession. At the same time, the wobble angle may decay with time. This results in damping of the precession. Combined with the magnetospheric torque model and the outer gap model, the damped precession can explain that (1) when the inclination angle is larger, the spin-down rate will be larger, accompanied by a lower gamma-ray flux. (2) The variation in amplitude of the gamma-ray flux and spin-down rate is smaller than previous results due to the damping of the precession. The modulation period is becoming shorter due to a smaller wobble angle. In the end, we propose that there are two kinds of modulations in pulsars. Long-term modulations in pulsars may be due to precession. Short-term modulations may be of magnetospheric origin.

<title>Study of Hybrid Stars with Nonstrange Quark Matter Cores</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this work, under the hypothesis that quark matter may not be strange, we adopt a modification of the coupling constant of the four-quark scalar interaction in the two-flavor Nambu–Jona–Lasinio (NJL) model to study nonstrange hybrid stars, where G1 and G2 are two parameters constrained by using the lattice quantum chromodynamics simulation results at the critical temperature and zero chemical potential. The Maxwell construction is used to describe the first-order confinement–deconfinement phase transition in hybrid stars. With recent measurements on neutron star mass, radius, and tidal deformability, the hybrid equations of state are constrained. It is found that pure nonstrange quark matter cores can exist in hybrid stars, possessing 0.026–0.04 M⊙. The maximum hybrid star mass in the framework of the modified NJL model is about 0.1 M⊙ lighter than that in the conventional two-flavor NJL model. It is argued that the binary neutron stars in GW170817 should be hadron stars.

<title>Three Brown Dwarfs Masquerading as High-redshift Galaxies in JWST Observations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report the spectroscopic identification of three brown dwarf candidates—o005_s41280, o006_s00089, and o006_s35616—discovered in RUBIES using James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Near-Infrared Spectrograph PRISM/CLEAR spectroscopy. We fit these sources with multiple substellar atmosphere models and present the atmospheric parameters, including effective temperature (Teff), surface gravity, and other derived properties. The results suggest that o005_s41280 and o006_s35616, with Teff in the ranges of 2100–2300 K and 1800–2000 K, respectively, are likely L dwarfs, while o006_s00089, with Teff < 1000 K, is consistent with a late T dwarf classification. The best-fit model spectra provide a reasonable match to the observed spectra. However, distinct residuals exist in the Y, J, and H bands for the two L dwarf candidates, particularly for o006_s35616. Incorporating the extinction parameter into the fitting process can significantly reduce these residuals. The distance estimates indicate that these candidates are about 2 kpc away. The analysis of the color–color diagram using multiple JWST NIRcam photometry suggests that cooler T dwarfs, such as o006_s00089, overlap with little red dots, while hotter L dwarfs, like o005_s41280 and o006_s35616, tend to contaminate the high-redshift galaxy cluster. These findings suggest a brown dwarf contamination rate of approximately 0.1% in extragalactic deep field surveys, with L dwarfs being more frequently detected than cooler T and Y dwarfs.

The Guitar nebula surrounding PSR B2224+65 boasts a pulsar X-ray filament likely aligned with the local magnetic field. We present new RoboPol stellar polarization data distributed along the line of sight to the pulsar. The polarizing effect of intervening magnetized dust allows us to extract a model for the dust-weighted magnetic field. We detect a magnetic field angle consistent with the filament if the pulsar is located in the more distant zone of its parallax-estimated distance range.

<title>Improving the Temporal Resolution of SOHO/MDI Magnetograms of Solar Active Regions Using a Deep Generative Model</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb032</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a novel deep generative model, named GenMDI, to improve the temporal resolution of line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms of solar active regions (ARs) collected by the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory. Unlike previous studies that focus primarily on spatial super-resolution of MDI magnetograms, our approach can perform temporal super-resolution, which generates and inserts synthetic data between observed MDI magnetograms, thus providing finer temporal structure and enhanced details in the LOS data. The GenMDI model employs a conditional diffusion process, which synthesizes images by considering both preceding and subsequent magnetograms, ensuring that the generated images are not only of high quality but also temporally coherent with the surrounding data. Experimental results show that the GenMDI model performs better than the traditional linear interpolation method, especially in ARs with dynamic evolution in magnetic fields.

The wide survey of the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) will observe a large field of 17,500 deg2. The GU, GV, and GI grism observations of CSST will cover the wavelength range from 2550 to 10000 Å at a resolution of R ∼ 200 and a depth of about 22 AB magnitude for the continuum. In this paper, we present a pipeline to identify quasars and measure their physical properties with the CSST mock data. We simulate the raw images and extract the one-dimensional grism spectra for quasars, galaxies, and stars with r-band magnitudes of 18 < mr < 22 using the CSST Cycle 6 simulation code (https://csst-tb.bao.ac.cn/code/csst_sim/csst-simulation). Using a convolution neural network, we separate quasars from stars and galaxies. We measure the redshifts by identifying strong emission lines of quasars. We also fit the 1D slitless spectra with QSOFITMORE to estimate black hole masses and Eddington ratios. Our results show that CSST slitless spectroscopy can effectively separate quasars with redshifts z = 0−5 from other types of objects with an accuracy of 99%. Among those successfully classified quasars, 90% of them could have precise redshift measurements with σNMAD = 0.002. The scatters of black hole masses and Eddington ratios from the spectral fittings are 0.13 and 0.15 dex, respectively. The metallicity diagnosis line ratios have a scatter of 0.1–0.2 dex. Our results show that the CSST slitless spectroscopy survey has the potential to discover about 0.9 million new quasars and provide important contributions to the science of active galactic nuclei and cosmology.

<title>Periodic Variability of the Central Stars of Planetary Nebulae Surveyed through the Zwicky Transient Facility</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A consensus has been reached in recent years that binarity plays an important role in the formation and evolution of a significant fraction of planetary nebulae (PNe). Utilizing the archived photometric data from the Zwicky Transient Facility survey, we conducted a comprehensive data mining in search of brightness variations in a large sample of Galactic PNe. This effort led to identification of 39 PNe, whose central stars exhibit periodic variation in light curves. Among these objects, 20 are known binary central stars of PNe, while the remaining 19 are new discoveries. Additionally, we identified 14 PNe with central stars displaying anomalous variation in light curves, as well as eight variables based on the high-cadence photometric data. Among the new discoveries of periodicity, we found compelling evidence of binary systems at the centers of two archetypal quadrupolar PNe. We also report on very peculiar brightness variation observed in the central core of the compact PN NGC 6833. Several PNe in our sample deserve follow-up observations, both high-dispersion spectroscopy and high-precision photometry, to reveal the true nature of their central binarity or even multiplicity.

<title>Geometric Correction for Wind Accretion in Binary Systems</title>

The Bondi–Hoyle–Lyttleton (BHL) accretion model is widely used to describe how a compact object accretes material from a companion's stellar wind in binary systems. However, its standard implementation becomes inaccurate when the wind velocity (vw) is comparable to or less than the orbital velocity (vo), predicting nonphysical accretion efficiencies above unity. This limits its applicability to systems with low wind-to-orbital velocity ratios (w = vw/vo ≤ 1), such as symbiotic systems. We revisit the implementation of the BHL model and introduce a geometric correction factor that accounts for the varying orientation of the accretion cylinder relative to the wind direction. This correction ensures physically plausible accretion efficiencies (η ≤ 1) for all w in circular orbits. Our new implementation naturally predicts the flattening of the accretion efficiency observed in numerical simulations for w < 1, without the need for ad hoc adjustments. We also peer into the implications of our prescription for the less-explored case of eccentric orbits, highlighting the key role of the geometric correction factor in shaping the accretion process. We compare our predictions with numerical simulations, finding good agreement for a wide range of parameters. Applications to the symbiotic star R Aqr and the X-ray binary LS 5039 are presented. This improved implementation offers a more accurate description of wind accretion in binary systems, with implications for stellar evolution, population synthesis, and observational data interpretation.

<title>Deep Rest-UV JWST/NIRSpec Spectroscopy of Early Galaxies: The Demographics of C iv and N-emitters in the Reionization Era</title>

JWST has recently discovered a subset of reionization era galaxies with ionized gas that is metal-poor in oxygen and carbon but heavily enriched in nitrogen. This abundance pattern is almost never seen in lower-redshift galaxies but is commonly observed in globular cluster stars. We have recently demonstrated that this peculiar abundance pattern appears in a compact (≃20 pc) metal-poor galaxy undergoing a strong burst of star formation. This galaxy was originally selected based on strong C iv emission, indicating a hard radiation field rarely seen locally. In this paper, we present JWST/NIRSpec observations of another reionization-era galaxy known to power strong C iv emission, the z = 7.04 gravitationally lensed galaxy A1703-zd6. The emission-line spectrum reveals this is a metal-poor galaxy ( ) dominated by a young stellar population ( Myr) that powers a very hard ionizing spectrum (C iv equivalent width, EW = 19.4 Å, He ii EW = 2.2 Å). The interstellar medium is highly enriched in nitrogen ( ) with very high electron densities (8–19 × 104 cm−3) and extreme ionization conditions rarely seen at lower redshift. We also find intense CIV emission (EW ≳ 20 Å) in two new z ≳ 6 metal-poor galaxies. To put these results in context, we search for UV line emission in a sample of 737 z ≳ 4 galaxies with NIRSpec spectra, establishing that 40%(30%) of systems with [O iii]+Hβ EW > 2000 Å have N iv] (C iv) detections with EW > 5 Å(> 10 Å). These results suggest high N/O ratios, and hard ionizing sources appear in a brief phase following a burst of star formation in compact high-density stellar complexes.

<title>Exploring Mass Transfer Mechanisms in Symbiotic Systems</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We define two regimes of the parameter space of symbiotic systems based on the dominant mass transfer mechanism. A wide range of white dwarf (WD) mass, donor mass, and donor radius combinations are explored to determine the separation for each parameter combination, below which wind Roche-lobe (RL) overflow will be the dominant mass transfer mechanism. The underlying concept is the premise that the wind accelerates. If it reaches the RL before attaining sufficient velocity to escape, it will be trapped and gravitationally focused through the inner Lagrangian point toward the accreting WD. However, if the wind succeeds in attaining the required velocity to escape from the donor’s RL, it will disperse isotropically, and the dominant mass transfer mechanism will be the Bondi–Hoyle–Lyttleton prescription, in which only a fraction of the wind will be accreted onto the WD. We present these two regimes of the 4D parameter space, covering 375 different parameter combinations.

<title>Alfvén Wave Conversion to Low Frequency Fast Magnetosonic Waves in Magnetar Magnetospheres</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Rapid shear motion of magnetar crust can launch Alfvén waves into the magnetosphere. The dissipation of the Alfvén waves has been theorized to power the X-ray bursts characteristic of magnetars. However, the process by which Alfvén waves convert their energy to X-rays is unclear. Recent work has suggested that energetic fast magnetosonic (fast) waves can be produced as a byproduct of Alfvén waves propagating on curved magnetic field lines; their subsequent dissipation may power X-ray bursts. In this work, we investigate the production of fast waves by performing axisymmetric force-free simulations of Alfvén waves propagating in a dipolar magnetosphere. For Alfvén wave trains that do not completely fill the flux tube confining them, we find a fast wave dominated by a low frequency component with a wavelength defined by the bouncing time of the Alfvén waves. In contrast, when the wave train is long enough to completely fill the flux tube, and the Alfvén waves overlap significantly, the energy is quickly converted into a fast wave with a higher frequency that corresponds to twice the Alfvén wave frequency. We investigate how the energy, duration, and wavelength of the initial Alfvén wave train affect the conversion efficiency to fast waves. For modestly energetic star quakes, we see that the fast waves that are produced will become nonlinear well within the magnetosphere, and we comment on the X-ray emission that one may expect from such events.

<title>Impacts of UV Radiation from an AGN on Planetary Atmospheres and Consequences for Galactic Habitability</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a study of the effects of ultraviolet (UV) emission from active galactic nuclei (AGN) on the atmospheric composition of planets and potential impact on life. It is expected that all supermassive black holes, which reside at galactic centers, have gone through periods of high AGN activity in order to reach their current masses. We examine potential damaging effects on lifeforms on planets with different atmosphere types and receiving different levels of AGN flux, using data on the sensitivity of various species’ cells to UV radiation to determine when radiation becomes “dangerous.” We also consider potential chemical changes to planetary atmospheres as a result of UV radiation from AGN, using the Platform for Atmosphere, Land, Earth, and Ocean photochemical model. We find that the presence of sufficient initial oxygen (surface mixing ratio ≥10−3 mol mol−1) in the planet’s atmosphere allows a thicker ozone layer to form in response to AGN radiation, which reduces the level of dangerous UV radiation incident on the planetary surface from what it was in absence of an AGN. We estimate the fraction of solar systems in galaxies that would be affected by substantial AGN UV radiation, and find that the impact is most pronounced in compact galaxies such as “red nugget relics,” as compared to typical present-day ellipticals and spirals (using M87 and the Milky Way as examples).

<title>Constraining the Nuclear Equation of State of a Neutron Star via High-frequency Quasi-periodic Oscillation in Short Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adaceb</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The determination of the equation of state (EOS) of a neutron star (NS) and its maximum mass is very important for understanding the formation and properties of NSs under extreme conditions, but they remain open questions. Short-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are believed to originate from the merger of binary NSs or giant flares (GFs) of soft gamma repeaters (SGRs). Recently, the high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) have been claimed to be identified from two short GRBs (GRB 931101B and GRB 910711). In this paper, we propose that the observed high-frequency QPOs in these two short GRBs result from torsional oscillations in the GFs of SGRs associated with cold NSs, or from radial oscillations of hypermassive NSs as the hot remnants of binary NS mergers, and then to constrain the EOS of NSs. For torsional oscillations, the six selected EOSs (TM1, NL3, APR, SLy4, DDME2, and GM1) of NSs suitable for the zero-temperature condition exhibit significant overlap in mass ranges, suggesting that we cannot constrain the EOS of NSs. For radial oscillations, the six selected EOSs (IUF, TM1, TMA, FSG, BHBLp, and NL3) of NSs suitable for the high-temperature condition cannot be ruled out when redshift is considered. However, it is found that the EOS can only be constrained if the redshift and temperature of the remnant can be measured.

<title>The Bolometric Light-curve Modeling of 98 Type I Superluminous Supernovae Using the Magnetar- and the Circumstellar Interaction Models Reveals Surprisingly High Ejecta Masses</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adae04</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adae04</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the bolometric light-curve modeling of 98 hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I) using three types of power inputs: the magnetar model and two kinds of circumstellar interaction models, applying the constant density and the steady wind scenario. The quasi-bolometric luminosities of the objects were calculated from the Zwicky Transient Facility g- and r-band data using the methodology of Chen et al., and then they were modeled with the Minim code. It was found that the light curves of 45 SLSNe-I can be fitted equally well with both the magnetar and the circumstellar material (CSM) models, 14 objects prefer the magnetar model, and 39 SLSNe-I favor the CSM model. The magnetar modeling yielded a mean spin period of P = 4.1 ± 0.20 ms and a magnetic field of B = 5.65 ± 0.43 · 1014 G, consistent with the literature. However, the ejected mass was estimated to be significantly larger compared to previous studies presenting either multicolor light-curve modeling with MOSFiT or bolometric light-curve modeling: we obtained a mean value and standard error of 34.26 and 4.67 M⊙, respectively. The circumstellar interaction models resulted in even larger ejecta masses with a mean and standard error of 116.82 and 5.97 M⊙ for the constant density model, and 105.99 and 4.50 M⊙ for the steady wind model. Although the ejected mass depends strongly on the electron scattering opacity (assumed to be κ = 0.2 in this work) and the ejecta velocity, which were estimated to be globally larger compared to earlier studies, our results suggest that SLSNe-I are indeed explosions of the most-massive stars.

<title>Dependence of Multiband Absolute Magnitudes and Color Indexes of the Tip of the Red Giant Branch Stars on Metallicity in Galactic Globular Clusters</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) stars have attracted intensive attention in recent years because their I-band absolute magnitudes, MI, are often used for distance calibration in the Hubble constant measurements because of its almost independence on metallicity ([Fe/H]). However, a discrepancy exists between various studies, and the theoretical stellar model predicts the dependence of their luminosity on [Fe/H]. Here, we present a careful study of the dependence of absolute magnitudes and color indexes on metallicity in optical and near-infrared bands. With the TRGB stars identified in 33 Galactic globular clusters by the reddest color in the GBP − GRP versus GRP diagram, it is confirmed that MI is almost constant of −4.017 ± 0.036 ± 0.027 mag when [Fe/H] < −1.2, which would give H0 = 70.86 ± 1.2 ± 0.9 km s−1 Mpc−1 with this updated luminosity calibration for Type Ia supernovae. However, for [Fe/H] > −1.2, MI is found to become fainter with lower metallicity, which would lead to a larger Hubble constant. In the optical GBP, GRP, and V bands, the absolute magnitude of TRGB stars tends to increase with metallicity, while in the infrared J, H, and Ks bands, the variation with metallicity shows an inverse tendency. In addition, the analytical relations of the color indexes with metallicity are presented, which have smaller dispersion than those derived for the corresponding absolute magnitudes.

<title>Asteroseismology with TESS: Emergence of Dipole Mode Suppression from Subgiants?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Dipole mode suppression is an observed behavior of solar-like oscillations in evolved stars. This study aims to search for depressed dipole modes in giant stars using data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and investigate when the suppression starts to emerge. We study a sample of 8651 evolved stars from TESS and find 179 stars with significant dipole mode depression by comparing the oscillation amplitudes of radial and dipole modes. Notably, 11 of them are located near the base of the red giant branch, indicating that mode suppression appears earlier than the point inferred in previous studies with Kepler data. These findings provide new evidence for dipole mode suppression in giant stars, particularly in subgiants.

<title>Measuring Star Formation Rates in the Milky Way from Hi-GAL 70 μm Observations</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adaeb2</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Three methods for computing the total star formation rate (SFR) of the Milky Way agree well with a reference value of 1.65 ± 0.19 M⊙ yr−1. They are then used to determine the radial dependence of the SFR and face-on map for the Milky Way. First, the method based on a model of star formation in Hi-GAL-defined dense clumps, adjusted for an increase in the gas-to-dust ratio with Galactocentric radius, predicts 1.65 ± 0.61 M⊙ yr−1. Second, the method using the 70 μm emission, commonly used in other galaxies, with a technique to assign distances to the extended emission, predicts M⊙ yr−1. Finally, a method based on theoretical predictions of star formation efficiency as a function of virial parameter, with masses corrected for metallicity dependence, applied to a catalog of molecular clouds also predicts a value in agreement at 1.47 M⊙ yr−1. The three methods predict the radial variation of the SFR, with remarkably good agreement from the Central Molecular Zone out to about 20 kpc. More differences were seen in face-on maps with a resolution of 0.5 kpc made with the three approaches and in comparisons to the local (within 3 kpc) SFR, indicating limitations of the methods when applied to smaller scales. The 70 μm SFR follows very closely the surface density of molecular gas, corrected for a metallicity-dependent CO conversion factor. A molecular gas depletion time of 1 Gyr is consistent with the data, as is a molecular Kennicutt–Schmidt relation with a power-law slope of 1.10 ± 0.06.

<title>The Morphology of Dwarf Galaxies Hosting Variable Active Galactic Nuclei</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We analyze Hubble Space Telescope optical imaging of eight low-mass galaxies hosting active galactic nuclei (AGN) identified via their photometric variability in V. F. Baldassare et al. We use GALFIT to model the 2D galaxy light profiles, and find a diversity of morphologies. The galaxies with regular morphologies are best fit with pseudobulges and disks, rather than classical bulges. We estimate black hole masses using scaling relations and find black hole masses of 103.7−6.6M⊙. We compare this sample to dwarf galaxies with AGN selected via optical spectroscopy. On average, the variable host galaxies have lower-mass black holes. We analyze the brightest point source in each galaxy and find their properties are not entirely consistent with star clusters, indicating that they are likely AGN. These point sources are found to have lower luminosities than spectroscopically selected dwarf AGN, but brighter than the point sources in dwarf galaxies not identified as AGN. Our detailed imaging analysis shows that variability selection has the potential to find lower-mass black holes and lower-luminosity AGN than optical spectroscopy. These active dwarfs may have been missed by spectroscopic searches due to star formation dilution or low gas content.

<title>Extragalactic Magnetar Giant Flares: Population Implications, Rates, and Prospects for Gamma-Rays, Gravitational Waves, and Neutrinos</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Magnetar giant flares (MGFs) are the most energetic non-catastrophic transients known to originate from stellar objects. The first discovered events were nearby. In recent years, several extragalactic events have been identified, implying an extremely high volumetric rate. We show that future instruments with a sensitivity ≲5 × 10−9 erg cm−2 at ∼1 MeV will be dominated by extragalactic MGFs over short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs). Clear discrimination of MGFs requires intrinsic GRB localization capability to identify host galaxies. As MGFs involve a release of a sizable fraction of the neutron star's magnetic free energy reservoir in a single event, they provide us with invaluable tools for better understanding magnetar birth properties and the evolution of their magnetic fields. A major obstacle is to identify a (currently) small subpopulation of MGFs in a larger sample of more energetic and distant sGRBs. We develop the tools to analyze the properties of detected events and their occurrence rate relative to sGRBs. Even with the current (limited) number of events, we can constrain the initial internal magnetic field of a typical magnetar at formation to be B0 ≈ 4 × 1014–2 × 1015 G. Larger samples will constrain the distribution of birth fields. We also estimate the contribution of MGFs to the gravitational-wave (GW) stochastic background. Depending on the acceleration time of baryon-loaded ejecta involved in MGFs, their GW emission may reach beyond 10 kHz and, if so, will likely dominate over other conventional astrophysical sources in that frequency range.

In this paper, we show the estimation of the emission altitude of pulsars PSRs B0329+54, B0450-18, B2045-16, J1909+0007, and J0337+1715 for both core and conal components at multiple radio bands by implementing a relativistic phase-shift method, which is constrained based on the plethora of standard radio emission geometry. Using the information of pulse longitudes for each component, coupled with a dipolar field geometry, we obtain a rough estimation of the height and transverse location of the emitting cones for these pulsars, i.e., footpoint location of the pulse edge, normalized with the last open magnetic field line constant. We also analyzed the profile of a well-known millisecond pulsar J0337+1715 at 1250 MHz, which has an asymmetric core-cone structure for both the main pulse and interpulse. This is the first time such a case has been analyzed to probe emission height by implementing the relativistic phase-shift method. We discuss the implications of our findings in the context of the pulsar's emission geometry to reach a consensus on the existing emission mechanism of pulsars.

<title>Hunting for Candidates of Changing-look Blazars Using Mclust Clustering Analysis</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Changing-look blazars (CLBs) are blazars whose optical spectral lines at different epochs show significant changes and present a clear transition between standard FSRQ and BL Lacertae (BL Lac). Changing-look phenomena in blazars are highly significant for enhancing our understanding of certain physical problems of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), such as the potential mechanism of state transition in the accretion process of supermassive black holes in the central engine of AGNs, the possible intrinsic variation of the jet, and the connection between the accretion disk and the jet. Currently, the CLBs reported in the literature are still rare astronomical objects. In our previous work, we found that there are eight physical property parameters of CLBs located between those of FSRQs and BL Lacs. In order to search for more CLB candidates (CLBCs), we employed the mclust Gaussian mixture modeling clustering algorithm to perform clustering analysis for 255 subsets of the eight physical property parameters with 2250 blazars from 4FGL data release 3. We find that there are 29 subsets with three groups (corresponding to bl lacs, fsrqs, and CLBCs), in which there are four subsets with an adjusted Rand index greater than 0.610. The combined clustering results from the four subsets report that there are 111 CLBCs, which include 44 CLBs reported in previous literature and 67 new CLBCs, of which 11 are labeled as BL Lacs and 56 are labeled as FSRQs in the 4FGL catalog.

<title>Bridging the Gap: GRB 230812B—A 3 s Supernova-associated Burst Detected by the GRID Mission</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
GRB 230812B, detected by the Gamma-Ray Integrated Detectors constellation mission, is an exceptionally bright gamma-ray burst (GRB) with a duration of only 3 s. Sitting near the traditional boundary (∼2 s) between long and short GRBs, GRB 230812B is notably associated with a supernova, indicating a massive star progenitor. This makes it a rare example of a short-duration GRB resulting from stellar collapse. Our analysis, using a time-evolving synchrotron model, suggests that the burst has an emission radius of approximately 1014.5 cm. We propose that the short duration of GRB 230812B is due to the combined effects of the central engine's activity time and the time required for the jet to break through the stellar envelope. Our findings provide another case that challenges the conventional view that short-duration GRBs originate exclusively from compact object mergers, demonstrating that a broader range of durations exists for GRBs arising from the collapse of massive stars.

<title>Self-consistent Solutions of Evolving Nuclear Star Clusters with Two-dimensional Monte Carlo Dynamical Simulations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We recently developed a Monte Carlo method (GNC) that can simulate the dynamical evolution of a nuclear star cluster (NSC) with a massive black hole (MBH), where the two-body relaxations can be solved by the Fokker–Planck equations in energy and angular momentum space. Here we make a major update of GNC by integrating stellar potential and adiabatic invariant theory, so that we can study the self-consistent dynamics of NSCs with increasing mass of the MBH. We perform tests of the self-adaptation of cluster density due to MBH mass growth and Plummer core collapse, both finding consistent results with previous studies, the latter having a core collapse time of ∼17trh by GNC, where trh is the time of half-mass relaxation. We use GNC to study the cosmological evolution of the properties of NSCs and the mass of MBHs assuming that the mass growth of the MBH is due to loss-cone accretion of stars (e.g., tidal disruption of stars) and stellar black holes, and we compare the simulation results with the observations of NSCs in the Milky Way or nearby galaxies. It is possible for such a scenario to produce MBHs with mass 105–107M⊙ for NSCs with stellar mass of 106–109M⊙. In the Milky Way's NSC, to grow an MBH up to 4 × 106M⊙, its size needs to be ∼1.7 times more compact in early Universe than the current value. MBHs with current masses >6 × 107M⊙ seem difficult to explain by loss-cone accretion alone, and thus they may require other additional accretion channels, such as gas accretion.

The occurrence frequency distributions of fluxes (F) and fluences or energies (E) observed in the majority (in 18 out of 23 cases) of astrophysical phenomena are found to be consistent with the predictions of the fractal-diffusive self-organized criticality (FD-SOC) model, which predicts power-law slopes with universal constants of αF = (9/5) = 1.80 for the flux and αE = (5/3) ≈ 1.67 for the fluence. The theoretical FD-SOC model is based on the fractal dimension, the flux-volume proportionality, and classical diffusion. The universal scaling laws predict the size distributions of numerous astrophysical phenomena, such as solar flares, stellar flares, coronal mass ejections, auroras, blazars, active galactic nuclei, black hole systems, galactic fast radio bursts, gamma-ray bursts, and soft gamma-ray repeaters. In contrast, we identify five outliers of astrophysical phenomena, i.e., coherent solar radio bursts, random solar radio bursts, solar energetic particles, cosmic rays, and pulsar glitches, which are not consistent with the standard FD-SOC model, and thus require different physical mechanisms.

The extended ultra-high-energy (UHE) gamma-ray source HAWC J1844–034 is closely associated with two other sources, HAWC J1843–032 and HWC J1846–025. Moreover, other gamma-ray observatories like HESS, LHAASO, and Tibet ASγ have detected UHE gamma-ray sources whose spatial positions coincide with the position of HAWC J1844–034. The UHE gamma-ray data from several observatories aid analysis of the spectral features of this source in detail at teraelectronvolt energies. Of the four pulsars near HAWC J1844–034, PSR J1844–0346 is closest to it and possibly supplies the cosmic-ray leptons to power this source. We have analyzed the Fermi–Large Area Telescope (LAT) data to explore this source’s morphology and identify its spectral features in the Fermi-LAT energy band. After removing the contribution of the pulsar to the gamma-ray spectral energy distribution (SED) by pulsar-phased analysis, we obtained upper limits on the photon flux and identified the gigaelectronvolt counterpart PS J1844.2–0342 in the Fermi-LAT energy band with more than 5σ significance, which may be a pulsar wind nebula (PWN). Finally, the multiwavelength SED is modeled, assuming HAWC J1844–034 is a PWN.

<title>Swift-BAT GUANO Follow-up of Gravitational-wave Triggers in the Third LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA Observing Run</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present results from a search for X-ray/gamma-ray counterparts of gravitational-wave (GW) candidates from the third observing run (O3) of the LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA network using the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (Swift-BAT). The search includes 636 GW candidates received with low latency, 86 of which have been confirmed by the offline analysis and included in the third cumulative Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalogs (GWTC-3). Targeted searches were carried out on the entire GW sample using the maximum-likelihood Non-imaging Transient Reconstruction and Temporal Search pipeline on the BAT data made available via the GUANO infrastructure. We do not detect any significant electromagnetic emission that is temporally and spatially coincident with any of the GW candidates. We report flux upper limits in the 15–350 keV band as a function of sky position for all the catalog candidates. For GW candidates where the Swift-BAT false alarm rate is less than 10−3 Hz, we compute the GW–BAT joint false alarm rate. Finally, the derived Swift-BAT upper limits are used to infer constraints on the putative electromagnetic emission associated with binary black hole mergers.

<title>Relative Alpha in the Magnetohydrodynamics with Open Magnetic Field Boundary and Its Application to the Solar Eruption</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An instability criterion in the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) with the open boundary of a magnetic field is proposed in this paper. We use a series of linear force-free extrapolation fields, in which the normal part of the magnetic field is fixed, to obtain the linear fitting coefficient called relative alpha by using the cojoined value of magnetic free energy and magnetic flux at the open boundary (EfΦ2) and the square of relative magnetic helicity ( ). We calculate this coefficient of the magnetic field above active regions NOAA 8210 and NOAA 11429 obtained by the photospheric-data-driven MHD model. It is found that the fitting coefficient is a good proxy of the criterion to indicate the occurrence of instability after which the magnetic reconnection happens and causes the fast release of magnetic energy. We also applied this method to the continuous evolution of the three-dimensional magnetic field of NOAA 11158 based on the measurement of the photospheric vector magnetic field of Solar Dynamics Observatory/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager by the nonlinear force-free extrapolation method. The calculated coefficient when the major flare happened based on the extrapolation data is very close to the expected ones, which perfectly reflects the occurrence of instability, and the difference is even less than 7%. This relative alpha is very helpful to evaluate how far it is from the instability in the MHD and quantitatively estimate the occurrence of solar eruption in the space weather forecast.

<title>A Novel Survey for Young Substellar Objects with the W-band Filter. VII. Water-bearing Objects in the Core of the ρ Ophiuchi Cloud Complex</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a study of very low mass stars and brown dwarfs in the rich star-forming core of the ρ Ophiuchi cloud complex. The selection of the sample relies on detecting the inherent water absorption characteristic in young substellar objects. Of the 22 water-bearing candidates selected, 15 have a spectral type of M6 or later. Brown dwarf candidates too faint for membership determination by Gaia have their proper motions derived by deep-infrared images spanning 6 yr. Astrometric analysis confirms 21/22 sources as members, with one identified as a contaminant. Infrared colors and the spectral energy distribution of each water-bearing candidate are used to diagnose the mass, age, and possible existence of circumstellar dust. A total of 15 sources exhibit evidence of disks in their spectral energy distributions, as late as in M8-type objects. Spectroscopy for bright candidates has confirmed one as an M8 member and verified two sources (with disks) exhibiting signatures of magnetospheric accretion.

<title>COSMOS-Web: The Role of Galaxy Interactions and Disk Instabilities in Producing Starbursts at z < 4</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada566</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We study of the role of galaxy–galaxy interactions and disk instabilities in producing starburst activity in galaxies out to z = 4. For this, we use a sample of 387 galaxies with robust total star formation rate measurements from Herschel, gas masses from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, stellar masses and redshifts from multiband photometry, and JWST/NIRCam rest-frame optical imaging. Using mass-controlled samples, we find an increased fraction of interacting galaxies in the starburst regime at all redshifts out to z = 4. This increase correlates with star formation efficiency (SFE) but not with gas fraction. However, the correlation is weak (and only significant out to z = 2), which could be explained by the short duration of SFE increase during interaction. In addition, we find that isolated disk galaxies make up a significant fraction of the starburst population. The fraction of such galaxies with star-forming clumps (“clumpy disks”) is significantly increased compared to the main-sequence disk population. Furthermore, this fraction directly correlates with SFE. This is direct observational evidence for a long-term increase of SFE maintained due to disk instabilities, contributing to the majority of starburst galaxies in our sample and hence to substantial mass growth in these systems. This result could also be of importance for explaining the growth of the most massive galaxies at z > 6.

<title>Energy Extraction from a Black Hole by a Strongly Magnetized Thin Accretion Disk</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The presence of a strong, large-scale magnetic field in an accretion flow leads to the extraction of the rotational energy of the black hole (BH) through the Blandford–Znajek (BZ) process, believed to power relativistic jets in various astrophysical sources. We study rotational energy extraction from a BH surrounded by a highly magnetized thin disk by performing a set of 3D global GRMHD simulations. We find that the saturated flux threading the BH has a weaker dependence on BH spin, compared to highly magnetized hot (geometrically thick) accretion flows. Also, we find that only a fraction (10%–70%) of the extracted BZ power is channeled into the jet, depending on the spin parameter. The remaining energy is potentially used to launch winds or contribute to the radiative output of the disk or corona. Our simulations reveal that the presence of a strong magnetic field enhances the radiative efficiency of the disk, making it more luminous than its weakly magnetized counterpart or the standard disk model. We attribute this excess luminosity primarily to the enhanced magnetic dissipation in the intra-ISCO region. Our findings have implications for understanding X-ray corona formation and BH spin measurements, and interpreting BH transient phenomena.

<title>Anomalous Neutral Hydrogen Column Densities in Local Interstellar Medium Clouds*</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Analysis of high-resolution spectra of the hydrogen and deuterium Lyα lines provides measurements of interstellar neutral hydrogen column densities N(H i) to 113 stars within 50 pc of the Sun. Plots of N(H i) versus distance through the LIC, G, Mic, and other clouds in the local interstellar medium (LISM) show very interesting properties. For the LIC and G clouds, nearly all of the observed neutral hydrogen occurs within 3 or 4 pc of the Sun with no significant additional neutral hydrogen at larger distances out to 50 pc, except for several sight lines with anomalously high N(H i). Scatter about the mean hydrogen column density in the LIC is several times larger than the measurement errors. We evaluate several possible sources of the high N(H i) sight lines. Seven sight lines with anomalously high N(H i) are aligned perpendicular to the line connecting the centers of the LIC and G clouds where the two clouds merge creating a mixed cloud region. The high N(H i) in these seven sight lines can be explained by their paths through an irregularly shaped mixed cloud region where the neutral hydrogen number density is the sum for both clouds. However, the most recent nearby supernova explosion created a shell that is seen in nearly the same direction perpendicular to the LIC/G axis and may also explain these seven high N(H i) sight lines. Other possible explanations for the high N(H i) sight lines include interstellar shocks, wakes produced by stars moving rapidly through the LISM, and regions where other clouds may overlap.

<title>Three-dimensional Transport of Solids in a Protoplanetary Disk Containing a Growing Giant Planet</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the results of combined hydrodynamic and particle tracking post-processing modeling to study the transport of small dust in a protoplanetary disk containing an embedded embryo in three dimensions. We use a suite of FARGO3D hydrodynamic simulations of disks containing a planetary embryo varying in mass up to 300 M⊕ on a fixed orbit in both high- and low-viscosity disks. We then simulate solid particles through the disk as a post-processing step using a Monte Carlo integration, allowing us to track the trajectories of individual particles as they travel throughout the disk. We find that gas advection onto the planet can carry small, well-coupled solids across the gap opened in the disk by the embedded planet for planetary masses above the pebble isolation mass. This mixing between the inner and outer disk can occur in both directions, with solids in the inner disk mixing to the outer disk as well. Additionally, in low-viscosity disks, multiple dust pile-ups in the outer disk may preserve isotopic heterogeneities, possibly providing an outermost tertiary isotopic reservoir. Throughout Jupiter's growth, the extent of mixing between isotopic reservoirs varied depending on dust size, gas turbulence, and the Jovian embryo mass.

<title>Adiabatic Index in Fluid Models of Collisionless Black Hole Accretion</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adaea3</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Models of highly sub-Eddington accretion onto black holes commonly use a single-fluid model for the collisionless, near-horizon plasma. These models must specify an equation of state. It is common to use an ideal gas with p = (γ − 1)u and γ = 4/3, 13/9, or 5/3, but these produce significantly different outcomes. We discuss the origins of this discrepancy and the assumptions underlying the single-fluid model. The main result of this investigation is that under conditions relevant to low-luminosity black hole accretion the best choice of single-fluid adiabatic index is close to but slightly less than 5/3. Along the way we provide a simple equilibrium model for the relation between the ion-to-electron dissipation ratio and the ion-to-electron temperature ratio, and explore the implications for electron temperature fluctuations in Event Horizon Telescope sources.

<title>UNCOVERing the Faint End of the z ∼ 7 [O iii] Luminosity Function with JWST’s F410M Medium Bandpass Filter</title>

Strong emission from doubly ionized oxygen is a beacon for some of the most intensely star-forming galaxies. JWST enables the search for this beacon in the early Universe with unprecedented sensitivity. Using UNCOVER DR1 JWST/NIRCam and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging data of A2744, we identify strong (rest-frame EW > 500Å) [O iii]5008 emitters at z ∼ 7 based on excess F410M flux. We find N = 68 z ∼ 7 [O iii] candidates, including N = 33 with deep HST coverage required to rule out lower-redshift interlopers (13.68 arcmin2 with F814W 5σ depth >28 AB). Such strong emission lines can produce very red colors often misinterpreted as evidence for old, massive stellar populations, but are shown to be emission lines where we have spectra. Using this deep HST sample, we derive a new [O iii] luminosity function (LF) spanning , an order of magnitude deeper than previous z ∼ 6 studies. This LF is fit by a power law with a faint-end slope of . Our results are consistent with the z ∼ 7 FRESCO [O iii] LF across the overlapping 0.5 dex range, . Combining both data sets, we construct an LF spanning 2 dex in luminosity, with a best-fit Schechter function: , , and erg s . There is little evolution between this LF and published [O iii] LFs at 3 < z < 8, and no evidence of a turnover at faint luminosities. The sizes of these extreme [O iii] emitters are similar to their low redshift counterparts, the Green Peas. The z ∼ 7 [O iii] LF aligns with the Lyα LF at the bright end, suggesting many of these galaxies are also Lyα emitters.

<title>Resolving an Asteroseismic Catastrophe: Structural Diagnostics from p-mode Phase Functions off the Main Sequence</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada949</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
On the main sequence, the asteroseismic small frequency separation δν02 between radial and quadrupole p-modes is customarily interpreted to be a direct diagnostic of internal structure. Such an interpretation is based on a well-known integral estimator relating δν02 to a radially averaged sound-speed gradient. However, this estimator fails, catastrophically, when evaluated on structural models of red giants: their small separations must therefore be interpreted differently. We derive a single expression that both reduces to the classical estimator when applied to main-sequence stellar models and reproduces the qualitative features of the small separation for stellar models of very evolved red giants. This expression indicates that the small separations of red giants scale primarily with their global seismic properties as , rather than being in any way sensitive to their internal structure. Departures from this asymptotic behavior, during the transition from the main-sequence to red giant regimes, have been recently reported in open-cluster Christensen–Dalsgaard (C-D) diagrams from K2 mission data. Investigating them in detail, we demonstrate that they occur when the convective envelope boundary passes a specific acoustic distance—roughly one-third of a wavelength at —from the center of the star, at which point radial modes become maximally sensitive to the position of the boundary. The shape of the corresponding features on ϵp and C-D (or r02) diagrams may be useful in constraining the nature of convective boundary mixing in the context of undershooting beneath a convective envelope.

<title>The Impact of Extended CO2 Cross Sections on Temperate Anoxic Planet Atmospheres</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adaaf0</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Our interpretation of terrestrial exoplanet atmospheric spectra will always be limited by the accuracy of the data we use as input in our forward and retrieval models. Ultraviolet molecular absorption cross sections are one category of these essential model inputs; however, they are often poorly characterized at the longest wavelengths relevant to photodissociation. Photolysis reactions dominate the chemical kinetics of temperate terrestrial planet atmospheres. One molecule of particular importance is CO2, which is likely present in all terrestrial planet atmospheres. The photolysis of CO2 can introduce CO and O, as well as shield tropospheric water vapor from undergoing photolysis. This is important because H2O photolysis produces OH, which serves as a major reactive sink to many atmospheric trace gases. Here, we construct CO2 cross-section prescriptions at 195 K and 300 K extrapolated beyond 200 nm from measured cross sections. We compare results from the implementation of these new cross sections to the most commonly used CO2 prescriptions for temperate terrestrial planets with Archean-like atmospheres. We generally find that the observational consequences of CO2 dissociation beyond 200 nm are minimal so long as our least conservative (highest opacity) prescription can be ruled out. Moreover, implementing our recommended extended CO2 cross sections does not substantially alter previous results that show the consequential photochemical impact of extended H2O cross sections.

<title>The Fallibility of Equipartition Magnetic Field Strengths from Synchrotron Emission Using Synthetically Observed Galaxies</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adab72</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Understanding the role that magnetic fields play on the stage of galaxy formation requires accurate methods for inferring the properties of extragalactic magnetic fields. Radio synchrotron emission has been the most promising avenue to infer magnetic field strengths across galaxies, with the application of a central assumption: that galactic cosmic rays are in energy equipartition with the magnetic field. In this work, we leverage flexible synthetic observations of a high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a Milky Way–like galaxy to review whether true equipartition is capable of reproducing radio observations of galaxies, and investigate its impact on the inference of magnetic field strengths when varying the properties and density distribution of the cosmic rays. We find that imposing equipartition (regardless of scale length) results in cosmic ray electron densities that are unable to generate either the amplitude or the shape of the radio intensity profiles typically observed in spiral galaxies. Instead, observationally motivated smooth distributions of cosmic ray electrons across the galaxy provide a remarkable match to observations. We further demonstrate that assuming equipartition with those mock observations can lead to significant overestimation of the magnetic field strength. This misestimation varies with cosmic ray electron densities, cosmic ray spectrum power-law index, and galactic environment, aggravated in inter-arm regions and attenuated in star-forming regions. Our results promote caution when assuming equipartition in observations, and suggest that additional theoretical and numerical work is required to leverage the upcoming generation of radio observations poised to revolutionize our understanding of astrophysical magnetic fields.

<title>Magnetic Activities of AD Leonis: Flares in TESS Data and Optical Spectra</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We studied the flaring activities of M4.5 dwarf AD Leo to understand its stellar atmospheres and magnetic activities. We present new observational results on this highly active star, using nonsimultaneous measurement of Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) data, time-series optical spectra, and Giant Meter Radio Telescope 325 MHz radio data. We revisited the rotation period of 2.23 ± 0.04 days from TESS, which matches well with previously measured literature values. We estimated an extremely rare high-energy superflare of 4.9 × 1035 erg and ∼400 minute duration with a high magnetic field strength of 1.2 kG. Interestingly, we correlated the duration of a flare event with its energy, τ ∝ , and noticed a discrepancy between stellar and solar flares suggesting a difference in coronal magnetic field strength. From time-series spectra, we observed Hα spectral flares in the range of 1030–1031 erg. A 12 minute delay in a spectral flare event was observed between the emission of the Hα and Ca ii H and K lines, possibly due to their origination at different spatial locations in the chromosphere. We noticed the deviation in flare rate distribution and orbital phases indicates the presence of highly active regions. Furthermore, an occasional radio detection with a flux density of 9.46 ± 1.63 mJy at a frequency of 325 MHz might be coherent emission in the presence of the magnetic field, giving a hint of star–planet interaction.

<title>The Oxidation–Deuteration Processes of Large, Astronomically Relevant Cationic Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adabdf</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In interstellar environments, gas-phase polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) predominantly involves (photo)fragmentation, hydrogenation, and oxidation chemical routes, which lead to the formation of complex organic species. Here the gas-phase reactions between tribenzo-naphtho-pero-pyrene (TNPP, C40H18) cations and ultraviolet, 18/16O or D atoms are investigated. The oxidized TNPP cations ([C40H18/17/16On]+, n = [1, 6]) are newly formed; the collision-induced deoxidation of oxidized TNPP cations is followed by the loss of HCO/CO units. With laser irradiation, the photo-deoxidation of oxidized TNPP cations is identified. Smaller PAH cations, [C40−nH18−n]+, with n = [1, 5], i.e., PAHs containing odd carbon numbers (e.g., 39, 37 C atoms), are produced. Furthermore, the oxidized–deuterated TNPP cations ([C40HmDnOx]+) are well formed upon simultaneous reaction with O and D atoms. The structure of the oxidized–deuterated TNPP cations and the bonding energy for these reaction pathways were investigated with theoretical calculations. Four oxidation bonding types are identified together with their evolution pathways. The reaction energy is relatively high, and the addition of O/D atoms to the carbon skeleton is a relatively random and independent event, i.e., with no restrictions or requirements for the carbon sites of PAH species. Consequently, the oxidized–deuterated states and forms of PAH compounds are intricate and complex. Furthermore, the calculations confirm that the loss of CO or H+CO is energetically preferable. Importantly, the formation of the carbonyl unit is confirmed. We infer that the collision/photo-induced deoxidation (loss of (H)CO units) of oxidized PAH species is involved in the top-down evolution routes of large PAHs and effectively catalyzes the potential formation of small oxygen-containing species (e.g., OH/HCO/CO) in the interstellar medium.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
With a systematic timing investigation of the persistent X-ray binary pulsar Her X-1 based on a large number of Insight-HXMT observations between 2017 and 2019, we confirm the presence of X-ray millihertz quasiperiodic oscillations (mHz QPOs) at ∼0.01 Hz. By applying wavelet analysis in our data analysis procedures, we first identify ∼0.005–0.009 Hz QPOs coexisting with the ∼0.01 Hz QPOs. Wavelet analysis suggests that these QPO features show transient behaviors, that the frequencies of mHz QPOs evolve in short timescales. There exists a positive relation between QPO centroid frequency (from ∼0.005 to 0.009 Hz) and X-ray luminosity, while the 10 mHz QPO frequencies remain nearly constant for different luminosities, which suggests different physical mechanisms for the two types of mHz QPOs. The 10 mHz QPOs in both X-ray and UV bands would have the same origin related to the beat frequency where the Alfvén radius is close to the corotation radius, and the 5 mHz QPOs may originate from magnetic disk precession.

The Sun is depleted in refractory elements compared to nearby solar twins, which may be linked to the formation of giant or terrestrial planets. Here we present high-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectroscopic data for 17 solar-like stars hosting planets, obtained with Magellan II/MIKE, to investigate whether this depletion is related to planet formation. We derive stellar parameters, including stellar atmosphere, age, radius, mass, and chemical abundances for 22 elements from carbon to europium through line-by-line differential analysis. Our uncertainties range from 0.01 dex for Fe and Si to 0.08 dex for Sr, Y, and Eu. By comparing the solar abundances to those of the 17 stars, we investigate the differential abundance ([X/Fe]solar–[X/Fe]star) versus condensation temperature (Tc) trend. In particular, we apply Galactic chemical evolution corrections to five solar twins within the full sample. Our results conform to previous studies that the Sun is relatively depleted in refractory compared to volatile elements. For both five solar twins and the rest of the solar-like stars, we find that all stars hosting known gas giant planets exhibit negative Tc trend slopes, suggesting that the Sun is relatively depleted in refractory elements compared to similar giant planet-hosting stars. Additionally, we find no correlation between Tc trend slopes and the total mass of detected terrestrial planets in each system, suggesting that terrestrial planet formation may not be the cause of refractory element depletion in the Sun.

Large magnification factors near gravitational lensing caustics of galaxy-cluster lenses allow the study of individual stars or compact stellar associations at cosmological distances. We study how the presence of sub-galactic subhalos, an inevitable consequence of cold dark matter, can alter the property of caustics and hence change the interpretation of highly magnified sources that lie atop them. First, we consider a galaxy-cluster halo populated with subhalos sampled from a realistic subhalo mass function calibrated to N-body simulations. Then, we compare a semianalytical approximation and an adaptive ray-shooting method that we employ to quantify the property of the caustics. As a case study, we investigate Earendel, a z = 6.2 candidate of magnified single- or multiple-star system with a lone lensed image atop the critical curve in the Sunrise Arc. We find that the source size constraint (≲0.3 pc) previously derived from macrolens models should be relaxed by a factor of a few to 10 when subhalos are accounted for, therefore allowing the possibility of a compact star cluster. The subhalos could introduce an astrometric perturbation that is ≲0 5, which does not contradict observation. These conclusions are largely robust to changes in the subhalo population. Subhalos therefore should be seriously accounted for when interpreting the astrophysical nature of similar highly magnified sources uncovered in recent high-z observations.

Whether the X-ray emissions of strong jet sources originate from disk+coronas or jets is still controversial. In this work, we constructed a strong jet sample containing 50 flat-spectrum radio quasars, 51 low-synchrotron-peaked BL Lac objects, and 18 intermediate-synchrotron-peaked BL Lac objects to explore the origin of X-ray emissions. Generally, blazars are the typical radio-loud active galactic nucleus with a powerful jet toward the observer, causing their broadband emissions to be boosted. By considering the Doppler boosting effect, we obtain the intrinsic radio–X-ray correlation and the fundamental plane (FP) of black hole activity for the strong jet sources: the intrinsic radio–X-ray correlation is , which favor the jet-dominated mode; the intrinsic FP is , which can be interpreted by the hybrid mode of jet+standard disk. Our results suggest that the X-ray emissions of strong jet sources are dominated by the jets, but there may also be a small contribution from the disk. In addition, the radio–X-ray correlation and FP of strong jet sources do not have a significant dependence on the Eddington-ratio.

<title>Starburst Galaxies in Their Last Billion Years: An Hδ Absorption Line Selected Sample</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this paper, we focus on the study of starburst galaxies in their final billion years. Our galaxy selection is based solely on the presence of the Hδ absorption line, which permits the later evolution of starburst galaxies to be traced, coinciding with the emergence of A-type stars in these galaxies. We propose a novel method that utilizes star formation rate and UVJ colors to classify galaxies in the sample, and use the spectral features to mark their stages of evolution. Our in-depth analysis of the Mg ii line indicates the substantial increase in the number of F- and G-type stars when a galaxy evolves from star-forming to quiescent phase. Furthermore, we identify active galactic nuclei in this sample to explore their roles in the later stage of the star formation history of galaxies.

<title>Equatorial Enhancement in the Dustiest OH/IR Stars in the Galactic Bulge</title>

We have detected the 10 μm silicate feature and the 11.3 μm crystalline forsterite feature in absorption in 21 oxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch stars in the Galactic bulge. The depths of the 10 μm feature indicate highly obscured circumstellar environments. The additional crystalline features may suggest either an extended envelope or dust formation in a high-density environment. We have also modeled the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the sample using radiative transfer models, and compared the results to wind speeds measured using 1612 MHz circumstellar OH masers, as well as previous estimates of circumstellar properties. The 16 sources with measured pulsation periods appear on sequence D of the mid-IR period–luminosity relation, associated with the long secondary period. We suspect that all of these sources are in fact fundamental-mode pulsators. At least two sources appear on the fundamental-mode sequence when accounting for the dust content. For the remainder, these sources are also likely fundamental-mode pulsators with extended envelopes. Taken as a whole, the high optical depths, crystalline features, discrepancies between observed and modeled wind speeds, pulsation periods longer than other fundamental-mode pulsators, and SED and pulsation properties similar to those with known equatorially enhanced circumstellar envelopes (e.g., OH 26.5+0.6 and OH 30.1–0.7) lead us to believe that these sources are likely to be equatorially enhanced.

<title>Modeling the Impact of Moderate External UV Irradiation on Disk Chemistry</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The chemistry within a protoplanetary disk is greatly affected by external radiation from the local stellar environment. Previous work has focused on extreme radiation fields, representative of the center of something like the Orion Nebula Cluster. However, even in such environments, many disks exist at the edges of a cluster where the lower stellar density leads to radiation fields weaker by orders of magnitude compared to the center. We present new chemical models of a T Tauri disk in the presence of a moderately increased interstellar radiation field (ISRF). Such an environment has a background UV strength 10–100 times higher than the galactic average ISRF. Moderate radiation fields are among the most prevalent disk-harboring environments and have interesting implications for the chemistry of the outer disk radii. We find that the external UV radiation creates an outer ionization front that impacts the cold disk chemistry to varying degrees, depending on outer disk structure. Certain molecules like C+, N2H+, C, and CS are more strongly impacted by the ISRF in their abundance, column density, and observable emission. Other abundant species like HCO+ and CO are less affected by the external UV flux in the outer disk under such moderate UV conditions. Further, we demonstrate that the chemistry occurring in the inner tens of au is relatively unchanged, which suggests that even in moderately externally irradiated disks the inner disk chemistry may be more similar to isolated disks like those in, e.g., the Taurus and Lupus star-forming regions.

<title>Constraints on Cosmic-Ray Acceleration in Bright Gamma-Ray Bursts with Observations of Fermi</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are widely suggested as potential sources of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays. The kinetic energy of the jets dissipates, leading to the production of an enormous amount of gamma-ray photons and possibly also the acceleration of protons. The accelerated protons will interact with the radiation of the GRB via the photomeson and Bethe–Heitler processes, which can initiate electromagnetic cascades. This process can give rise to broadband radiation up to the GeV–TeV gamma-ray regime. The expected gamma-ray flux from cascades depends on the properties of the GRB jet, such as the dissipation radius Rdiss, the bulk Lorentz factor Γ, and the baryon loading factor ηp. Therefore, observations of Fermi-LAT can impose constraints on these important parameters. In this study, we select 12 GRBs of high keV–MeV fluence and constrain the baryon loading factor, under different combinations of the bulk Lorentz factor and the dissipation radius based on Fermi-LAT's measurements. Our findings indicate a strong constraint of ηp < 10 for most selected GRBs over a large parameter space except for large dissipation radii (≳1015 cm) and high bulk Lorentz factors (≳600). The constraint is comparable to, and in some GRBs even stronger than, that from high-energy neutrinos for stacked GRBs. Our results suggest that for a typical bulk Lorentz factor of several hundred, the dissipation radii of GRBs need to be large to avoid overshooting the GeV gamma-ray flux during the prompt emission phase of GRBs, which can be used to constrain GRBs.

<title>A Study of Cosmological Models Based on the Long Gamma-Ray Burst Duration Histogram</title>

The duration of more than one thousand gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) was measured by using the Swift satellite. Besides the redshift distribution of GRBs, the burst duration is another significant property of GRBs that can be analyzed. In this paper, we first find the detection rate of Swift/Burst Alert Telescope for a cosmological model with the ωCDM model. Then, by performing a Monte Carlo simulation, we find the "long" GRB duration histogram to compare the cosmological model with the ωCDM model and the ΛCDM model. The χ2 minimization method is employed to determine the optimal value of α in the dark energy equation of state, P = cω(z)ρ, with ω(z) = −1 + α z. We show that for the ωCDM model, all values of α within α = [0, 0.16] range are considered acceptable within two standard deviations.

<title>Insights into Galaxy Evolution from Interpretable Sparse Feature Networks</title>

Galaxy appearances reveal the physics of how they formed and evolved. Machine learning (ML) models can now exploit galaxies’ information-rich morphologies to predict physical properties directly from image cutouts. Learning the relationship between pixel-level features and galaxy properties is essential for building a physical understanding of galaxy evolution, but we are still unable to explicate the details of how deep neural networks represent image features. To address this lack of interpretability, we present a novel neural network architecture called a Sparse Feature Network (SFNet). SFNets produce interpretable features that can be linearly combined in order to estimate galaxy properties like optical emission line ratios or gas-phase metallicity. We find that SFNets do not sacrifice accuracy in order to gain interpretability, and that they perform comparably well to cutting-edge models on astronomical ML tasks. Our novel approach is valuable for finding physical patterns in large data sets and helping astronomers interpret ML results.

<title>The Impact of Particle Drifts on the Flux of High-energy Solar Protons and He Ions Arriving at Earth from Compact Solar Sources</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adadf8</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a numerical model to investigate the role of the ion mass-charge ratio (m/q) in determining the flux of MeV–GeV solar energetic particles (SEPs), released impulsively from a compact source near the Sun at 1 au. The equations of motion are numerically integrated for 0.1–1 GeV n−1 H+, 3He2+, and 4He2+ test ions as they move in the Parker spiral interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) carried by the solar wind. Pitch-angle scattering is included by using an ad hoc scattering operator, resulting in a parallel mean free path corresponding to “weak” scattering (λ = 1 au). Our modeled field also includes a flat heliospheric current sheet (HCS) at the ecliptic plane. We consider both A– and A+ IMF polarities and determine the time-flux profile at 1 au, at multiple observation locations, for each ion species and energy. We find that the proximity of the observer to the HCS, magnetic connectivity, and the drifts that depend on kinetic energy, m/q, and IMF polarity strongly impact the resulting flux–time profile. We find significant differences between the onset time, decay time, peak flux, and initial flux of the three ion species at 1 au. This contrast in the decay phase of the three species is evident in the four edges of the magnetically well-connected areas at 1 au. For magnetically poorly connected observers to the source, the onset of the proton flux with respect to that of 3He2+, and 4He2+ can be delayed for several hours depending on the observer’s relative heliographic latitude and the SEPs' energy.

<title>Flat U-Net: An Efficient Ultralightweight Model for Solar Filament Segmentation in Full-disk Hα Images</title>

Solar filaments are one of the most prominent features observed on the Sun, and their evolutions are closely related to various solar activities, such as flares and coronal mass ejections. Real-time automated identification of solar filaments is the most effective approach to managing large volumes of data. Existing models of filament identification are characterized by large parameter sizes and high computational costs, which limit their future applications in highly integrated and intelligent ground-based and space-borne observation devices. Consequently, the design of more lightweight models will facilitate the advancement of intelligent observation equipment. In this study, we introduce Flat U-Net, a novel and highly efficient ultralightweight model that incorporates simplified channel attention (SCA) and channel self-attention (CSA) convolutional blocks for the segmentation of solar filaments in full-disk Hα images. Feature information from each network layer is fully extracted to reconstruct interchannel feature representations. Each block effectively optimizes the channel features from the previous layer, significantly reducing parameters. The network architecture presents an elegant flattening, improving its efficiency, and simplifying the overall design. Experimental validation demonstrates that a model composed of pure SCAs achieves a precision of approximately 0.93, with dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and recall rates of 0.76 and 0.64, respectively, significantly outperforming the classical U-Net. Introducing a certain number of CSA blocks improves the DSC and recall rates to 0.82 and 0.74, respectively, which demonstrates a pronounced advantage, particularly concerning model weight size and detection effectiveness. The data set, models, and code are available as open-source resources.

<title>Flux-rope-mediated Turbulent Magnetic Reconnection</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a new model of magnetic reconnection in the presence of turbulence. The new model differs from the Lazarian–Vishniac turbulent reconnection theory by emphasizing the role of locally coherent magnetic structures, whose existence is shown to be permitted by the properties of magnetic field line separation in turbulent plasma. Local coherence allows storage of magnetic helicity inside the reconnection layer in the form of locally coherent twisted flux ropes. We then introduce the “Alfvén horizon” to explain why the global reconnection rate can be governed by locally coherent magnetic field structure instead of by field line wandering, formally extending to 3D the principle that reconnection can be made fast by fragmentation of the global current layer. Coherence is shown to dominate over field line dispersion if the anisotropy of the turbulence at the perpendicular scale matching the thickness of a marginally stable current layer exceeds the aspect ratio of the current layer. Finally, we conjecture that turbulence generated within the reconnection layer may produce a critically balanced state that maintains the system in the flux-rope-mediated regime. The new model successfully accounts for the major features of 3D numerical simulations of self-generated turbulent reconnection, including reconnection rates of 0.01 in resistive MHD and 0.1 with collisionless physics.

<title>Exploring the Key Features of Repeating Fast Radio Bursts with Machine Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are enigmatic high-energy events with unknown origins, which are observationally divided into two categories, i.e., repeaters and nonrepeaters. However, there are potentially a number of nonrepeaters that may be misclassified, as repeating bursts are missed due to the limited sensitivity and observation periods, thus misleading the investigation of their physical properties. In this work, we propose a repeater identification method based on the t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding algorithm and apply the classification to the first Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB) catalog. We find that the spectral morphology parameters, specifically spectral running (r), represent the key features for identifying repeaters from the nonrepeaters. Also, the results suggest that repeaters are more biased toward narrowband emission, whereas nonrepeaters are inclined toward broadband emission. We provide a list of 163 repeater candidates, five of which are confirmed with an updated repeater catalog from CHIME/FRB. Our findings improve our understanding of the various properties underlying repeaters and nonrepeaters, as well as guidelines for future FRB detection and categorization.

<title>Spin Evolution and Mass Distribution of Galactic Binary Neutron Stars</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad90e2</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Binary neutron stars (BNSs) detected in the Milky Way have total masses distributing narrowly around ∼2.6–2.7M⊙, while the BNS merger GW190425 detected via a gravitational wave has a significantly larger mass (∼3.4M⊙). This difference is not well understood, yet. In this paper, we investigate the BNS spin evolution via an improved binary star evolution model and its effects on the BNS observability, with the implementation of various relevant astrophysical processes. We find that the first-born neutron star component in low-mass BNSs can be spun up to millisecond pulsars by the accretion of Roche-lobe overflow from its companion and its radio lifetime can be comparable to the Hubble time. However, most high-mass BNSs have substantially shorter radio lifetimes than low-mass BNSs, and thus a smaller probability of being detected via radio emission. Adopting the star formation and metal enrichment history of the Milky Way given by observations, we obtain the survived Galactic BNSs with pulsar components from our population synthesis model and find that their distributions on the diagrams of the spin period versus the spin period time derivative ( ) and the orbital period versus the eccentricity (Porb–e) can well match those of the observed Galactic BNSs. The total mass distribution of the observed Galactic BNSs can also be matched by the model. A significant fraction (∼19%–22%) of merging BNSs at redshift z ∼ 0 have masses ≳3M⊙, which seems compatible with the GW observations. Future radio observations may detect many more Galactic BNSs, which will put strong constraints on the spin evolution of BNSs during their formation processes.

<title>Chemically Self-consistent Modeling of the Globular Cluster NGC 2808 and its Effects on the Inferred Helium Abundance of Multiple Stellar Populations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The helium abundances in the multiple populations that are now known to comprise all closely studied Milky Way globular clusters (GCs) are often inferred by fitting isochrones generated from stellar evolutionary models to GC photometry. It is therefore important to build stellar models that are chemically self-consistent in terms of their structure, atmosphere, and opacity. In this work we present the first chemically self-consistent stellar models of the Milky Way GC NGC 2808 using MARCS model atmospheres, OPLIB high-temperature radiative opacities, and AESOPUS low-temperature radiative opacities. These stellar models were fit to the NGC 2808 photometry using Fidanka, a new software tool that was developed to optimally fit cluster photometry to isochrones and for population synthesis. Fidanka can determine, in a relatively unbiased way, the ideal number of distinct populations that exist within a data set and then fit isochrones to each population. We achieve this outcome through a combination of Bayesian Gaussian mixture modeling and a novel number density estimation algorithm. Using Fidanka and F275W – F814W photometry from the Hubble UV Globular Cluster Survey, we find that the helium abundance of the second generation of stars in NGC 2808 is higher than the first generation by 15% ± 3%. This is in agreement with previous studies of NGC 2808. This work, along with previous work by A. Dotter et al. focused on NGC 6752, demonstrates that chemically self-consistent models of GCs do not significantly alter inferred helium abundances and are therefore unlikely to be worth the significant additional time investment.

<title>Estimating the Mass Escaping Rates of Radius-valley-spanning Planets in the TOI-431 System via X-Ray and Ultraviolet Evaporation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The TOI-431 system has three close-in exoplanets, which gives an ideal lab to study gas escape. In this study, we measure the X-ray and ultraviolet luminosity for TOI-431 with XMM-Newton’s European Photon Imaging Camera-pn and Optical/UV Monitor Telescope data, then calculate the fluxes for the planets in the system. We find TOI-431 b’s is 75 times TOI-431 d’s . Adopting the energy limit method and hydrodynamic code ATES with a set of He/H ratios, we obtain mass-loss rates of g s−1 for TOI-431 b and and 109.84∼9.94 g s−1 for TOI-431 d. We predict 2.93% ∼ 7.91% H i Lyα and 0.19% ∼ 10.65% He i triplet absorption depths for TOI-431 d; thus, its gas escaping is detectable in principle. For both TOI-431 b and d, we select similar planets from the New Generation Planetary Population Synthesis data. They show that, considering the mass-loss rates, TOI-431 b should be a naked solid planet, and TOI-431 d will likely maintain its gas envelope until the host star dies. According to the formation and evolution tracks, we find that TOI-431 b’s potential birthplace (0.1–2 au) should be further in than TOI-431 d’s (2–12 au). Our results are consistent with the interpretation of the radius valley being caused by atmospheric escape. The intrinsic reason may be their birthplace, which will determine how close they can migrate to the host star, then lose mass and result in the Fulton gap.

<title>Toward Early-type Eclipsing Binaries as Extragalactic Milestones. IV. Physical Properties of Three Detached O/B-type Systems in the LMC</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a complete set of physical parameters for three early-type eclipsing binary systems in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC): OGLE LMC-ECL-17660, OGLE LMC-ECL-18794, and HV 2274, together with the orbital solutions. The first and third systems comprise B-type stars, while the second has O-type components and exhibits a total eclipse. We performed a complex analysis that included modeling light and radial velocity curves, O − C analysis, and additional non-LTE spectroscopic analysis for the O-type system. We found that OGLE LMC-ECL-17660 is at least a triple, and tentatively, a quadruple. A significant nonlinear period decrease was determined for HV 2274. Its origin is unclear, possibly due to a faint, low-mass companion on a wide orbit. The analyzed components have masses ranging from 11.7 M⊙ to 22.1 M⊙, radii from 7.0 R⊙ to 14.2 R⊙, and temperatures between 22,500 and 36,000 K. For HV 2274, the precision of our masses and radii is about six times higher than in previous studies. The position of the components of all six systems analyzed in this series on the mass–luminosity and mass–radius diagrams indicates they are evolutionarily advanced on the main sequence. Our sample contributes significantly to the knowledge of physical parameters of early-type stars in the mass range of 11 M⊙–23 M⊙. A new mass–luminosity relation for O- and B-type stars in the LMC is provided. Additionally, we used the measured apsidal motion of the systems to compare the observational and theoretical internal structure constant.

<title>Prediction of Star Formation Rates Using an Artificial Neural Network</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this study we develop an artificial neural network to estimate the infrared (IR) luminosity and star formation rates (SFR) of galaxies. Our network is trained using “true” IR luminosity values derived from modeling the IR spectral energy distributions of FIR-detected galaxies. We explore five different sets of input features, each incorporating optical, mid-infrared, near-infrared, ultraviolet, and emission line data, along with spectroscopic redshifts and uncertainties. All feature sets yield similar IR luminosity predictions, but including all photometric data leads to slightly improved performance. This suggests that comprehensive photometric information enhances the accuracy of our predictions. Our network is applied to a sample of SDSS galaxies defined as unseen data, and the results are compared with three published catalogs of SFRs. Overall, our network demonstrates excellent performance for star-forming galaxies, while we observe discrepancies in composite and AGN samples. These inconsistencies may stem from uncertainties inherent in the compared catalogs or potential limitations in the performance of our network.

<title>Solar Variability in the Mg ii h and k Lines</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Solar irradiance and its variations in the ultraviolet (UV) control the photochemistry in Earth's atmosphere and influence Earth's climate. The variability in the Mg ii h and k core-to-wing ratio, also known as the Mg ii index, is highly correlated with the solar UV irradiance variability. Because of this, the Mg ii index is routinely used as a proxy for solar UV irradiance variability, which can help to get insights into the influence of solar UV irradiance variability on Earth's climate. Measurements of the Mg ii index, however, have only been carried out since 1978 and do not cover climate-relevant timescales longer than a few decades. Here we present a model to calculate the Mg ii index and its variability based on the well-established Spectral And Total Irradiance REconstruction (SATIRE) model. We demonstrate that our model calculations yield an excellent agreement with the observed Mg ii index variations, both on the solar activity cycle and on the solar rotation timescales. Using this model, we synthesize the Mg ii index time series on climate-relevant timescales of decades and longer. Here we present the time series of the Mg ii index spanning nearly three centuries.

<title>MUSEQuBES: Connecting H i Absorption with Lyα Emitters at z ≈ 3.3</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada7e9</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a comprehensive analysis of H i absorption around 96 Lyα emitters (LAEs) at z ≈ 3.3 (median Lyα luminosity ≈1042 erg s−1). These LAEs were identified within eight MUSE fields, each on the sky and centered on a bright background quasar, as part of the MUSEQuBES survey. Using Voigt profile fitting for all H i absorbers detected within ±500 km s−1 of these LAEs, we compiled a catalog of 800 H i absorption components. Our analysis shows that H i absorption is enhanced near the LAEs compared to the intergalactic medium. However, no trend is found between the column densities of H i absorbers and their impact parameters from the LAEs (spanning ≈54–260 pkpc). Additionally, all galaxies associated with Lyman-limit systems have impact parameters >50 pkpc from the quasar sightlines, suggesting that true absorber hosts may be too faint to detect. The LAEs show an overall H i covering fraction (fc(H i)) of ≈88% for a threshold (H i) = 15. Notably, at the same threshold, the LAEs in pairs/groups exhibit a 100% H i covering fraction out to ≈250 pkpc. In contrast, isolated LAEs consistently show a lower fc(H i) of ≈80%. This environmental influence on fc(H i) is also evident up to ≈300 km s−1 in differential bins of line-of-sight velocity. We find an anticorrelation between fc(H i) and the equivalent width of rest-frame Lyα emission (EW0). Based on the Lyα shell model, this could imply that gas-rich galaxies tend to reside in gas-rich environments or that the LAEs with higher EW0 are more efficient at ionizing their surrounding medium.

<title>Comprehensive Parameter Determination of Exoplanets through Asteroseismic Host Star Constraints</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study develops a robust framework for exoplanet characterization by leveraging asteroseismic constraints on host stars. Using precise photometric data from missions such as Kepler and TESS, we derive stellar parameters, including mass, radius, and age, with high accuracy through asteroseismic analysis. These stellar parameters are incorporated as priors in a Bayesian framework to refine planetary properties such as the mass, radius, and orbital parameters. By applying Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, we extract posterior distributions of planetary parameters, achieving significant improvements in precision and reliability. This approach is particularly effective for systems with evolved host stars, where precise stellar properties are essential for resolving uncertainties in planetary characterization. The results demonstrate the importance of asteroseismology in bridging stellar astrophysics and exoplanet science, enabling detailed studies of planetary system architectures and their dependence on host star properties. Our methodology underscores the synergy between stellar and planetary studies, paving the way for future research on exoplanet populations. This work provides a foundation for utilizing data from upcoming missions like PLATO, ensuring continued advancements in the precision and scope of exoplanet characterization.

<title>LensWatch. II. Improved Photometry and Time-delay Constraints on the Strongly Lensed Type Ia Supernova 2022qmx (“SN Zwicky”) with Hubble Space Telescope Template Observations</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada776</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Strongly lensed supernovae (SNe) are a rare class of transient that can offer tight cosmological constraints that are complementary to methods from other astronomical events. We present a follow-up study of one recently discovered strongly lensed SN, the quadruply imaged type Ia SN 2022qmx (aka “SN Zwicky”), at z = 0.3544. We measure updated, template-subtracted photometry for SN Zwicky and derive improved time delays and magnifications. This is possible because SNe are transient, fading away after reaching their peak brightness. Specifically, we measure point-spread-function photometry for all four images of SN Zwicky in three Hubble Space Telescope WFC3/UVIS passbands (F475W, F625W, and F814W) and one WFC3/IR passband (F160W), with template images taken ∼11 months after the epoch in which the SN images appear. We find consistency to within 2σ between lens-model-predicted time delays (≲1 day) and measured time delays with HST colors (≲2 days), including the uncertainty from chromatic microlensing that may arise from stars in the lensing galaxy. The standardizable nature of SNe Ia allows us to estimate absolute magnifications for the four images, with images A and C being elevated in magnification compared to lens model predictions by about 6σ and 3σ, respectively, confirming previous work. We show that millilensing or differential dust extinction is unable to explain these discrepancies, and we find evidence for the existence of microlensing in images A, C, and potentially D that may contribute to the anomalous magnification.

<title>Hubble Space Telescope Observations within the Sphere of Influence of the Powerful Supermassive Black Hole in PKS 0745-191</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada7ed</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph observations from the Hubble Space Telescope of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the center of PKS 0745-191, a brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) undergoing powerful radio-mode active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback (Pcav ~ 5 × 1045 erg s−1). These high-resolution data offer the first spatially resolved map of gas dynamics within an SMBH's sphere of influence under such powerful feedback. Our results reveal the presence of highly chaotic, nondrotational ionized gas flows on subkiloparsec scales, in contrast to the more coherent flows observed on larger scales. While radio-mode feedback effectively thermalizes hot gas in galaxy clusters on kiloparsec scales, within the core, the hot gas flow may decouple, leading to a reduction in angular momentum and supplying ionized gas through cooling, which could enhance accretion onto the SMBH. This process could, in turn, lead to a self-regulating feedback loop. Compared to other BCGs with weaker radio-mode feedback, where rotation is more stable, intense feedback may lead to more chaotic flows, indicating a stronger coupling between jet activity and gas dynamics. Additionally, we observe a sharp increase in velocity dispersion near the nucleus, consistent with a very massive MBH ~ 1.5 × 1010M⊙ SMBH. The density profile of the ionized gas is also notably flat, paralleling the profiles observed in X-ray gas around galaxies where the Bondi radius is resolved. These results provide valuable insights into the complex mechanisms driving galaxy evolution, highlighting the intricate relationship between SMBH fueling and AGN feedback within the host galaxy.

<title>Nonthermal Signatures of Radiative Supernova Remnants. II. The Impact of Cosmic Rays and Magnetic Fields</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada93d</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Near the ends of their lives, supernova remnants (SNRs) enter a “radiative phase,” when efficient cooling of the postshock gas slows expansion. Understanding SNR evolution at this stage is crucial for estimating feedback in galaxies, as SNRs are expected to release energy and momentum into the interstellar medium near the ends of their lives. A standard prediction of SNR evolutionary models is that the onset of the radiative stage precipitates the formation of a dense shell behind the forward shock. In Paper I, we showed that such shell formation yields detectable nonthermal radiation from radio to γ-rays, most notably emission brightening by nearly 2 orders of magnitude. However, there remains no observational evidence for such brightening, suggesting that this standard prediction needs to be investigated. In this paper, we perform magnetohydrodynamic simulations of SNR evolution through the radiative stage, including cosmic rays (CRs) and magnetic fields to assess their dynamical roles. We find that both sources of nonthermal pressure impede shell formation, reducing shell densities by a factor of a few to more than an order of magnitude. We also use a self-consistent model of particle acceleration to estimate the nonthermal emission from these modified SNRs and demonstrate that, for reasonable CR acceleration efficiencies and magnetic field strengths, the nonthermal signatures of shell formation can all but disappear. We therefore conclude that the absence of observational signatures of shell formation represents strong evidence that nonthermal pressures from CRs and magnetic fields play a critical dynamical role in late-stage SNR evolution.

<title>Magnetized Protoplanetary Disks around Young Stars in the Presence of Realistic Cooling</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this paper, we study the effects of magnetic fields and ohmic resistivity on the structure of protoplanetary disks (PPDs) in the presence of realistic radiative cooling. We use the self-similar method to solve the magnetohydrodynamic equations in spherical coordinates (r, θ, ϕ). Our solutions indicate that a strong magnetic field reduces the outflow region while increasing the mass accretion rate, which in turn leads to a thicker disk. Our model applied to the FU Orionis PPD indicates that in the inner regions of the disk (r = 10 au), is the order of and the mass outflow rate is , which is consistent with the observed range of accretion rates. Additionally, we calculated the cooling timescale in our model to assess one possible fragmentation condition necessary for planet formation. Our results indicate that, although the gravitational instability condition exists in the midplane of the disk, the cooling timescale is not short enough (τcool ≈ 1000Ω−1), and one possible mechanism for planet formation is not met.

<title>The Secondary Component of the Extremely Low Mass Ratio Massive Binary HD 165246 Revealed by GHOST</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In the pursuit of understanding the multiplicity of massive stars, the OWN Survey has undertaken spectroscopic monitoring of hundreds of targets over the past 20 yr. This effort has led to the discovery of new single-lined spectroscopic binaries. Characterizing the unseen companions of these systems is crucial to deriving precise stellar parameters, including the mass of each component, and constraining formation models for massive binary systems. In this paper, we aim to physically and evolutionarily characterize the stellar components of the massive binary HD 165246. We analyzed spectra obtained by the OWN Survey and used Kepler's second mission (K2) photometry, from which we determined the physical parameters of the system. Thanks to the high-resolution capabilities of the new echelle spectrograph Gemini/GHOST, we could directly detect spectral features of the secondary component for the first time. A very low mass ratio for the system is confirmed (q ~ 0.16), making this binary one of the few extremely low mass ratio systems known. The primary star has a mass of Ma = 22 ± 1 M⊙ and a radius of Ra = 7.0 ± 0.1 R⊙, while the secondary star has a mass of Mb = 3.4 ± 0.1 M⊙ and a radius of Rb = 2.22 ± 0.02 R⊙. Stellar evolution models indicate that the system has undergone approximately two million years of evolution since its formation. Moreover, the secondary star is identified as a pre-main-sequence object, progressing toward the zero-age main sequence. This paper illustrates the power of high-resolution spectrographs such as GHOST in finding much lower mass, previously unseen stellar components of binary star systems.

<title>Improved SED-fitting Assumptions Result in Inside-out Quenching at z ~ 0.5 and Quenching at All Radii Simultaneously at z ~ 1</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada8a2</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada8a2</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Many studies conclude that galaxies quench from the inside-out by examining profiles of specific star formation rate (sSFR). These are usually measured by fitting spectral energy distributions (SEDs) assuming a fixed dust law and uniform priors on all parameters. Here, we examine the effects of more physically motivated priors: a flexible dust law, an exponential prior on the dust attenuation AV, and Gaussian priors that favor extended star formation histories. This results in model colors that better trace observations. We then perform radial SED fits to multiband flux profiles measured from Hubble Space Telescope images for 1440 galaxies at 0.4 < z < 1.5 of stellar masses 1010–1011.5M⊙ using both the traditional and the more physically motivated assumptions. The latter results in star formation rate and AV profiles that agree with measurements from spectroscopy and AV profiles that behave correctly as a function of inclination. Since green valley galaxies at z ∼ 1.3 are expected to evolve into quiescent galaxies at z ∼ 0.9, we compare their sSFR profiles using the more physically motivated assumptions. Their slopes are similar at all masses (0.06–0.08 dex kpc−1), and the normalizations for the quiescent galaxies are lower. Therefore, the sSFR profiles decline with time as quenching occurs at all radii simultaneously. We compare profiles of green valley galaxies at z ∼ 0.9 and quiescent galaxies at z ∼ 0.5. The former are shallower at all masses by ~0.1 dex kpc−1. The sSFR profiles steepen with time as galaxies quench from the inside-out. In summary, galaxies at z ∼ 1 quench at all radii simultaneously while galaxies at z ∼ 0.7 quench from the inside-out.

<title>Search for Neutrino Signals Correlated with LHAASO Diffuse Galactic Emission</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The diffuse Galactic γ-ray emission originates from the interactions between cosmic rays and the interstellar medium or radiation fields within our Galaxy, where the production of neutrinos is also anticipated. Recently, the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) reported measurements of diffuse γ-rays from the Galactic plane with energies ranging from sub-TeV to 1 PeV. Using 7 yr of publicly available IceCube track data with the full detector, we conduct a template search using the γ-ray flux map observed by LHAASO-KM2A as the neutrino emission template and perform a scan search of the Galactic plane. In the template search, a mild excess of neutrinos is observed in the Galactic plane with a pretrial (posttrial) significance of 1.9σ (1.1σ). The measured muon neutrino intensity at 25 TeV is , consistent with the expected neutrino flux assuming that all the diffuse Galactic γ-rays originate from hadronic interactions. In the Galactic plane scan search, the most significant location is found at l = 63 57 and b = 0 93 with a pretrial (posttrial) significance of 4.6σ (1.8σ).

<title>Toward High-order Solar Corona Simulations: A High-order Hyperbolized Poisson Approach for Magnetic Field Initialization</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adace5</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Proper initialization of the solar corona magnetic field is important for easing the iterative process of realistic and efficient global magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations. This study introduces a high-order flux reconstruction (FR) framework for solving the Poisson equation, a necessary step for computing a potential-field source-surface (PFSS) to initialize the magnetic field for global solar corona simulations with MHD. By hyperbolizing the elliptic Poisson equation into a set of hyperbolic equations, we develop an efficient and robust high-order PFSS solver. Our contributions include developing a Q2 (i.e., quadratic) geometrical representation using prismatic elements for the computational domain, which enables high-order mesh generation. Such a hyperbolized Poisson solver effectively relaxes magnetic fields extrapolated from solar magnetograms, producing scalar potential fields that align well with theoretical expectations. Extensive verification was conducted on the high-order FR solver for polynomial orders up to P3, achieving fourth-order spatial accuracy. The hyperbolized solver demonstrates comparable accuracy to reference solutions (both analytical and numerical) while offering efficient performance, particularly on coarser meshes, making it competitive with state-of-the-art low-order finite volume solvers, which are mostly used for solar MHD simulations. The described developments are a milestone for enabling high-order global solar corona simulations on 3D unstructured grids.

<title>ASKAP Observations of the Radio Shell in the Composite Supernova Remnant G310.6-1.6</title>

We report the observations of the radio shell of the supernova remnant (SNR) G310.6–1.6 at 943 MHz from the Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) and the Polarization Sky Survey of the Universe’s Magnetism (POSSUM) surveys by using the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP). We detect polarized emission from the central pulsar wind nebula (PWN) with rotation measures varying from –696 rad m−2 to –601 rad m−2. We measure the integrated flux density of the shell to be 36.4 ± 2.2 mJy at 943 MHz and derive a spectral index of αpwn = −0.4 ± 0.1 for the PWN and αshell = −0.7 ± 0.3 for the SNR shell. From the combined radio and X-ray observations, the object can be identified as a supernova explosion of about 2500 yr ago with an energy of about 1.3 × 1050 erg, suggesting an ejected mass of about 10 M⊙. The circular radio shell outside the circular hard X-ray shell is unique among Galactic SNRs. We discuss several possible scenarios, including blast wave, reverse shock, and pulsar-fed emission, but find that none of them can fully explain the observed characteristics of the shell. This poses a challenge for understanding the evolution of SNRs. The results of this paper demonstrate the potential of the ASKAP EMU and POSSUM surveys to discover more objects of small angular size and low surface brightness.

We report an analysis of Insight-HXMT observations of the newly discovered accreting millisecond pulsar SRGA J144459.2–604207. During the outburst, detected in 2024 February by SRG/ART-XC, the broadband persistent spectrum was well fitted by an absorbed Comptonization model. We detected 60 type I X-ray bursts in the Insight-HXMT medium energy (ME) data, and 37 were also detected with the low-energy (LE) telescope. By superimposing the Insight-HXMT/LE/ME/HE light curves of 37 bursts with similar profiles and intensities, we measured a deficit of X-rays in the 40–70 keV energy band. By analyzing the time-resolved X-ray burst spectra, we determine the mean ratio of persistent to burst flux ofα = 71 ± 7. We estimate the average hydrogen mass fraction in the fuel at ignition, as , and constrain the burst fuel composition as X0 ≲ 0.4. We found that 14 out of 60 X-ray bursts exhibited photospheric expansion, and thus we estimated the distance to the source as 10.03 ± 0.71 kpc. Combined with IXPE observations, the burst recurrence time increased from 1.55 to 8 hr as the local mass accretion rate decreased, which can be described as .

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
1LHAASO J0249+6022 is an extended very-high-energy γ-ray source discovered by the Large High-Altitude Air Shower Observatory. Based on nearly 16.1 yr of data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope, we report the probable γ-ray emission from 1LHAASO J0249+6022 in the 0.03–1 TeV energy range. The results show that its γ-ray spectrum can be well fitted by a single power law with an index of 1.54 ± 0.17, and integral photon flux is (4.28 ± 1.03) × 10−11 photons cm−2 s−1. We also considered theoretically whether the nonthermal emission could originate from a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) scenario. Assuming that the particles injected into the nebula have a power-law distribution, the resulting spectrum from the inverse Compton scattering is consistent with the detected GeV and TeV γ-ray fluxes. Our study shows that the PWN scenario is reasonable for 1LHAASO J0249+6022.

<title>The Detection Rate of Associated Mg ii Absorption Lines in Quasars Depends on Their Radio Emission</title>

In active galactic nuclei, jet-driven feedback plays a significant role in influencing the properties of gas within their host galaxy and the circumgalactic medium. By combining observations from the Very Large Array Sky Survey, the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-cm, the LOFAR Two Meter Sky Survey, and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we assembled a sample of 3141 radio-loud quasars, among which 418 exhibit Mg ii-associated absorption lines in their SDSS spectra. We classify these quasars into evolutionary stages based on their radio spectral shapes. Our analysis reveals that evolved quasars exhibit a significantly higher incidence of Mg ii-associated absorption lines compared to younger sources, particularly among quasars with “nonpeaked” radio spectra, which show an incidence of Mg ii-associated absorbers approximately 1.7 times greater than that of gigahertz-peaked spectrum sources. This observation can be explained effectively by jet-driven feedback. As quasars age, their jets expand and expel substantial amounts of gas from smaller scales to larger scales, ultimately reaching the circumgalactic medium. The gas expelled from the inner regions and distributed over larger scales results in a greater coverage fraction of absorbing gas. Consequently, evolved quasars exhibit a higher incidence of Mg ii absorption lines.

<title>X-Ray/Radio Quasiperiodic Pulsations Associated with Plasmoids in Solar Flare Current Sheets</title>

Plasmoids (or magnetic islands) are believed to play an important role in the onset of fast magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration during solar flares and eruptions. Direct imaging of flare current sheets and the formation/ejection of multiple plasmoids in extreme-ultraviolet images, along with simultaneous X-ray and radio observations, offers significant insights into the mechanisms driving particle acceleration in solar flares. Here, we present direct imaging of the formation and ejection of multiple plasmoids in flare plasma/current sheets and the associated quasiperiodic pulsations (QPPs) observed at X-ray and radio wavelengths, using observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly, RHESSI, and the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor. These plasmoids propagate bidirectionally upward and downward along the flare current sheet beneath the erupting flux rope during two successive flares associated with confined/failed eruptions. The flux rope exhibits evidence of helical kink instability, with the formation and ejection of multiple plasmoids in the flare current sheet, as predicted in an MHD simulation of a kink-unstable flux rope. RHESSI X-ray images show double coronal sources (“looptop” and higher coronal sources) located at both ends of the flare current/plasma sheet. Moreover, we detect an additional transient faint X-ray source (6–12 keV) located between the double coronal sources, which is cospatial with multiple plasmoids in the flare current sheet. X-ray (soft and hard) and radio (decimetric) observations unveil QPPs (periods ≈ 10 s and 100 s) associated with the ejection and coalescence of plasmoids. These observations suggest that energetic electrons are accelerated during the ejection and coalescence of multiple plasmoids in the flare current sheet.

<title>Magnetorotational Instability in Collisional Weakly Ionized Plasma with Distinct Species Velocities</title>

In a differential rotating system, we use the incompressible multifluid model to investigate the dynamics of a weakly ionized plasma placed in a vertical background magnetic field with radial shearing. The equilibrium current is taken into account. The differences in velocities between charged species and neutrals are supposed to be related to the collisions. The analytical expression of the general local dispersion relation is derived and the effect of the shearing magnetic field is demonstrated in three different limiting cases. Momentum transfer to neutrals is neglected in the first case, and the instability criteria are provided with the involvement of magnetic field shearing. In the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) case, the previous results are reproduced when setting the equilibrium current density to zero, and the magnetic field structure is depicted to restrain/reinforce the instability in the Keplerian system with decaying/increasing shearing. In the last case, the finite collisions with weak ionization and ion Hall effects generate another unstable vertical mode compared with the MHD case and also alleviate the unstable waves propagated between the horizontal and vertical directions.

<title>WALLABY Pilot Survey: Star Formation Enhancement and Suppression in Gas-rich Galaxy Pairs</title>

Galaxy interactions can significantly affect the star formation in galaxies, but it remains a challenge to achieve a consensus on the star formation rate (SFR) enhancement in galaxy pairs. Here, we investigate the SFR enhancement of gas-rich galaxy pairs detected by the Widefield ASKAP L-band Legacy All-sky Blind surveY. We construct a sample of 278 paired galaxies spanning a stellar mass (M*) range from 107.6 to 1011.2M⊙. We obtain individual masses of atomic hydrogen (H i) for these paired galaxies using a novel deblending algorithm for H i data cubes. Quantifying the interaction stages and strengths with parameters motivated by first-principles analysis, we find that, at fixed stellar and H i mass, the alteration in the SFR of galaxy pairs starts when their dark matter halos are encountered. For galaxies with a stellar mass lower than 109M⊙, their SFRs show tentative suppression of 1.4σ after the halo encounter, and then become enhanced when their H i disks overlap, regardless of mass ratios. In contrast, the SFRs of galaxies with M* > 109M⊙ increase monotonically toward smaller projected distances and radial velocity offsets. When a close companion is present, a pronounced SFR enhancement is found for the most H i-poor high-mass galaxies in our sample. Collecting the observational evidence, we provide a coherent picture of the evolution of galaxy pairs and discuss how the tidal effects and hydrodynamic processes shape the SFR enhancement. Our results provide a coherent picture of gas-rich galaxy interactions and impose constraints on the underlying physical processes.

<title>Blowin’ in the Nonisothermal Wind: Core-powered Mass Loss with Hydrodynamic Radiative Transfer</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada777</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The mass loss rates of planets undergoing core-powered escape are usually modeled using an isothermal Parker-type wind at the equilibrium temperature, Teq. However, the upper atmospheres of sub-Neptunes may not be isothermal if there are significant differences between the opacity to incident visible and outgoing infrared radiation. We model bolometrically driven escape using AIOLOS, a hydrodynamic radiative-transfer code that incorporates double-gray opacities, to investigate the process’s dependence on the visible-to-infrared opacity ratio, γ. For a value of γ ≈ 1, we find that the resulting mass loss rates are well approximated by a Parker-type wind with an isothermal temperature T = Teq/21/4. However, we show that over a range of physically plausible values of γ, the mass loss rates can vary by orders of magnitude, ranging from 10−5× the isothermal rate for low γ to 105× the isothermal rate for high γ. The differences in mass loss rates are largest for small planet radii, while for large planet radii, mass loss rates become nearly independent of γ and approach the isothermal approximation. We incorporate these opacity-dependent mass loss rates into a self-consistent planetary mass and energy evolution model and show that lower/higher γ values lead to more/less hydrogen being retained after core-powered mass loss. In some cases, the choice of opacities determines whether or not a planet can retain a significant primordial hydrogen atmosphere. The dependence of escape rate on the opacity ratio may allow atmospheric escape observations to directly constrain a planet's opacities and therefore its atmospheric composition.

<title>Spin-down of Solar-mass Protostars in Magnetospheric Accretion Paradigm</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada364</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Stellar spin is one of the fundamental quantities that characterize a star itself and its planetary system. Nevertheless, stellar spin-down mechanisms in protostellar and pre-main-sequence stellar phases have been a long-standing problem in star formation theory. To realize the spin-down, previous axisymmetric models based on the conventional magnetospheric paradigm have had to assume massive stellar winds or produce highly time-variable magnetospheric ejections. However, this picture has been challenged by both numerical simulations and observations. With a particular focus on the propeller regime for solar-mass stars, we propose a new picture of stellar spin-down based on our recent 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulation and stellar evolution calculation. We show that failed magnetospheric winds, unique to 3D models, significantly reduce the spin-up accretion torque, which make it easier for the star to spin-down. Additionally, the amplitude of time variability associated with magnetospheric ejections is reduced by 3D effects. Our simulation demonstrates that the star spins down by generating a conical disk wind, driven by a rotating stellar magnetosphere. Our theoretical estimates, inspired by the numerical model, suggest that the conical disk wind is likely to play a crucial role in extracting stellar angular momentum during the protostellar phase. As magnetospheric accretion is expected to occur in other accreting objects such as protogiant planets, this study will also contribute to the understanding of the angular momentum of such objects.

<title>The Unique Helium Nova V445 Puppis Ejected ≫0.001 M ⊙ in the Year 2000 and Will Not Become a Type Ia Supernova</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
V445 Puppis (Nova Puppis 2000) is the only known example of a helium nova, where a layer of helium-rich gas accretes onto the surface of a white dwarf (WD) in a cataclysmic variable, with runaway helium burning making for the nova event. Speculatively, a helium nova can provide one path to produce a Type Ia supernova (SNIa), within the larger framework of single-degenerate models. Relatively little has been known about V445 Pup, with this work reporting the discovery of the orbital period near 1.87 days. The companion star is 2.65 ± 0.35 R⊙ in radius as an evolved giant star stripped of its outer hydrogen envelope. The orbital period immediately before the 2000 eruption was = 1.871843 ± 0.000014 days, with a steady period change of (−0.17 ± 0.06) × 10−8 from 1896 to 1995. The period immediately after the nova eruption was Ppost = 1.873593 ± 0.000034 days, with a of (−4.7 ± 0.5) × 10−8. The fractional orbital period change (ΔP/P) is +935 ± 27 ppm. This restricts the mass of the gases ejected in the nova eruption to be ≫0.001 M⊙, and much greater than the mass accreted to trigger the nova. So the WD is losing mass over each eruption cycle, and will not become a SNIa. Further, for V445 Pup and helium novae in general, I collect observations from 136 normal SNIa for which any giant or subgiant companion star would have been detected, yet zero companions are found. This is an independent proof that V445 Pup and helium novae are not SNIa progenitors.

<title>Discovering Large-scale Structure at 2 < z < 5 in the C3VO Survey</title>

The Charting Cluster Construction with VUDS and ORELSE (C3VO) survey is an ongoing imaging and spectroscopic campaign aiming to map out the growth of structure up to z ∼ 5 and was born from the combination of the Visible Multi-Object Spectrograph Ultra Deep Survey and the Observations of Redshift Evolution in Large-Scale Environments (ORELSE) survey. As we previously accomplished with the ORELSE survey, we apply our technique known as Voronoi tessellation Monte Carlo (VMC) mapping to search for serendipitous galaxy overdensities at 2 < z < 5 in the three C3VO fields. We also apply the same technique to mock observations of simulated galaxies with properties derived from the GAlaxy Evolution and Assembly semianalytic model in order to judge the effectiveness of our search algorithm as a function of redshift, total mass, and fraction of spectroscopic redshifts. We find completeness and purity values of the order of 30%–50% for and 2 < z < 4, with a strong dependence on mass and redshift, with values as high as ∼80% and ∼70%, respectively, in the best-case scenario for . In the C3VO fields, we were able to recover many of the previously known structures in the literature as well as find hundreds of new overdensity candidates, once again demonstrating the powerful capabilities of VMC mapping when applied to wide-field optical and infrared galaxy evolution surveys at ever higher redshifts.

<title>Interstellar Pickup Ion Observations to 60 au</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Prior to the Solar Wind Around Pluto (SWAP) observations from New Horizons, the only significant interstellar pickup ion (PUI) observations were taken inside 5.4 au from the Ulysses and 1 au missions. Here, we analyze SWAP data to provide the first comprehensive radial profile of interstellar PUIs in the outer heliosphere from ∼22 to 60 au. This study is the first to combine the low time resolution (one day) data inside 49.5 au with the high time resolution (half hour) data outside of that. We show that these two data sets can be reliably analyzed together in what is now a nearly continuous set of PUI observations. We derive radial gradients for all of the PUI parameters, as well as ratios to their solar wind counterparts from these combined data and extrapolate them out to a nominal termination shock distance at ∼90 au. We find that the fraction of PUIs to all ions in the solar wind continues to grow, reaching ∼18% by 60 au and extrapolated to be ∼30% at 90 au. The PUI internal pressure is ∼11% of the solar wind dynamic pressure at 60 au and expected to be ∼21% by 90 au. Such large values further highlight the importance of PUIs as the dominant driver of the physics of the outer heliosphere, as well as at the termination shock.

<title>Multiwavelength Variability Analysis of the Blazar PKS 0727-11: An ~ 168 day Quasiperiodic Oscillation in the γ-Ray</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada775</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada775</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We performed variability analysis of the multiwavelength light curves (LCs) for the flat-spectrum radio quasar PKS 0727-11. Using the generalized Lomb–Scargle periodogram, we identified a possible quasiperiodic oscillation (QPO) of ~168.6 days (persisted for six cycles, with a significance of 3.8σ) in the γ-ray LC during the flare period (MJD 54687–55738). It is the first time that periodic variations have been detected in this source, and further supported by other methods: weighted wavelet z-transform, phase dispersion minimization, REDFIT, autoregressive integrated moving average model, and structure function analysis. Cross-correlation analysis shows that there is a strong correlation between multiband light variations, indicating that γ-ray and radio flares may originate from the same disturbance, and the distance between the emission regions of γ-ray and radio flares is calculated based on the time lag. We demonstrate that QPO arising from the non-ballistic helical jet motion driven by the orbital motion in a supermassive binary black hole is a plausible physical explanation. In this scenario, the estimated mass of the primary black hole is M ∼ 3.66 × 108–5.79 × 109 M⊙.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We study the dynamics of nuclear star clusters, the dense stellar environments surrounding massive black holes in the centers of galaxies. We consider angular momentum diffusion due to two-body scatterings among stellar objects and energy advection due to gravitational-wave emission upon interaction with the central massive black hole. Such dynamics are described by a 2D Fokker–Planck (FP) equation in energy–angular momentum space. Focusing on the transition between the diffusion-dominated region and the advection-dominated one, we utilize self-similarity to obtain a full solution for the steady-state FP equation. This solution provides the density and flux of the stellar objects in nuclear star clusters. This improves the rate estimates for extreme-mass ratio inspirals, and has interesting implications for a new class of galactic center transients called quasiperiodic eruptions.

<title>The Impact of Bar-induced Noncircular Motions on the Measurement of Galactic Rotation Curves</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adabe0</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adabe0</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We study the impact of bar-induced noncircular motions on the derivation of galactic rotation curves (RCs) using hydrodynamic simulations and observational data from the PHANGS-ALMA survey. We confirm that noncircular motions induced by a bar can significantly bias RCs derived from the conventional tilted-ring method, consistent with previous findings. The shape of the derived RC depends on the difference in position angle (Δϕ) between the major axes of the bar and the disk in the face-on plane. For , noncircular motions produce a bar-induced “dip” feature (rise–drop–rise pattern) in the derived RC, which shows higher velocities near the nuclear ring and lower velocities in the bar region compared to the true RC (RCtrue). We demonstrate convincingly that such dip features are very common in the PHANGS-ALMA sample of barred galaxies. Hydrodynamical simulations reveal that the “dip” feature is caused by the perpendicular orientation of the gas flows in the nuclear ring and the bar; at low streamlines in the nuclear ring tend to enhance Vlos, while those in the bar tend to suppress Vlos. We use a simple “misaligned ellipses” model to qualitatively explain the general trend of RCs from the tilted-ring method (RCtilted) and the discrepancy between RCtilted and RCtrue. Furthermore, we propose a straightforward method to implement a first-order correction to the RC derived from the tilted-ring method. Our study is the first to systematically discuss the bar-induced “dip” feature in the RCs of barred galaxies by combining both simulations and observations.

<title>What Drives the H i Content of Central Galaxies—A Comparison between Hydrodynamic Simulations and Observations Using Random Forest</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adace2</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adace2</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We investigate the driving mechanisms for the H i gas content in star-forming central galaxies at low redshift, by examining the H i-to-stellar mass ratio (MH i/M*) in both the state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations, IllustrisTNG (TNG) and EAGLE, and the xGASS sample. We quantify the correlations of MH i/M* with a variety of galaxy properties using the Random Forest regression technique, and we make comparisons between the two simulations, as well as between the simulations and xGASS. Gas-phase metallicity is found to be most important in both simulations, but is ranked mildly for xGASS, suggesting that metals and gas driven by feedback effects in real galaxies is not as tightly coupled as in the simulations. Beyond that, the accretion rate of supermassive black holes is the most important feature in TNG, while specific star formation rate is the top ranked in EAGLE. This result can be understood from the fact that the H i gas is regulated mainly by thermal-mode AGN feedback in TNG and by stellar feedback in EAGLE. Although neither simulation can fully reproduce the feature importance obtained for real galaxies in the xGASS, EAGLE performs better than TNG in the sense that the observationally top-ranked property, u − r, is also highly ranked in EAGLE. This result implies that stellar feedback plays a more dominant role than AGN feedback in driving the H i gas content of low-redshift galaxies.

<title>Continuous Gravitational Waves from Thermal Mountains on Accreting Neutron Stars: Effect of the Nuclear Pasta Phase</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
As density increases, the shape of nuclei transitions to nonspherical “nuclear pasta” structures. The physical properties of the nuclear pasta, such as thermal conductivity and elasticity, have implications for detecting continuous gravitational waves from a rapidly rotating neutron star. In this work, we investigate the effect of the nuclear pasta on the quadruple moment, and find out that, compared with previous work, the quadrupole moment contributing to continuous gravitational-wave radiation can be up to 2 orders of magnitude larger. We also discuss the relationship between the quadruple moment and the maximum shear strain. Considering the properties of nuclear pasta, we study the detectability of known accreting neutron stars and compare predicted results to the detectable amplitude limits. These sources are well above the sensitivity curves for Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope detectors. Our work advances the understanding of the properties of nuclear pasta and a possible mechanism for continuous gravitational waves.

<title>A Multiwavelength Light-curve Analysis of the Classical Nova KT Eri: Optical Contribution from a Large Irradiated Accretion Disk</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
KT Eri is a classical nova that went into outburst in 2009. Recent photometric analysis in quiescence indicates a relatively longer orbital period of 2.6 days, so that KT Eri could host a very bright accretion disk during the outburst like in the recurrent nova U Sco, the orbital period of which is 1.23 days. We reproduced the optical V light curve as well as the supersoft X-ray light curve of KT Eri in outburst, assuming a large irradiated disk during a nova wind phase of the outburst while a normal size disk after the nova winds stop. This result is consistent with the temporal variation of wide-band V brightness that varies almost with the intermediate-band Strömgren y brightness, because the V flux is dominated by continuum radiation, the origin of which is a photospheric emission from the very bright disk. We determined the white dwarf mass to be MWD = 1.3 ± 0.02 M⊙, the hydrogen-burning turnoff epoch to be ∼240 days after the outburst, the distance modulus in the V band to be (m − M)V = 13.4 ± 0.2, and the distance to KT Eri to be d = 4.2 ± 0.4 kpc for the reddening of E(B − V) = 0.08. The peak absolute V brightness is about and the corresponding recurrence time is ∼3000 yr from its ignition mass together with the mean mass-accretion rate of yr−1 in quiescence. Thus, we suggest that KT Eri is not a recurrent nova.

<title>Maximum-likelihood Regression with Systematic Errors for Astronomy and the Physical Sciences. I. Methodology and Goodness-of-fit Statistic of Poisson Data</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9b1e</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This paper presents a new statistical method that enables the use of systematic errors in the maximum-likelihood regression of integer-count Poisson data to a parametric model. The method is primarily aimed at the characterization of the goodness-of-fit statistic in the presence of the over-dispersion that is induced by sources of systematic error, and is based on a quasi-maximum-likelihood method that retains the Poisson distribution of the data. We show that the Poisson deviance, which is the usual goodness-of-fit statistic and that is commonly referred to in astronomy as the Cash statistics, can be easily generalized in the presence of systematic errors, under rather general conditions. The method and the associated statistics are first developed theoretically, and then they are tested with the aid of numerical simulations and further illustrated with real-life data from astronomical observations. The statistical methods presented in this paper are intended as a simple general-purpose framework to include additional sources of uncertainty for the analysis of integer-count data in a variety of practical data analysis situations.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A novel model of systematic errors for the regression of Poisson data is applied to hypothesis testing of nested model components with the introduction of a generalization of the ΔC statistic that applies in the presence of systematic errors. This paper shows that the null-hypothesis parent distribution of this ΔCsys statistic can be obtained either through a simple numerical procedure, or in a closed form by making certain simplifying assumptions. It is found that the effects of systematic errors on the test statistic can be significant, and therefore the inclusion of sources of systematic errors is crucial for the assessment of the significance of the nested model component in practical applications. The methods proposed in this paper provide a simple and accurate means of including systematic errors for hypothesis testing of nested model components in a variety of applications.

<title>Stability and Convergence of Nuclear Detonations in White Dwarf Collisions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We investigate the numerical stability of thermonuclear detonations in 1D accelerated reactive shocks and 2D binary collisions of equal-mass magnetized and unmagnetized white dwarf stars. To achieve high resolution at initiation sites, we devised geometric gridding and mesh velocity strategies specially adapted to the unique requirements of head-on collisional geometries, scenarios in which one expects maximum production of iron-group products. We study the effects of grid resolution and the limiting of temperature, energy generation, and reactants for different stellar masses, separations, magnetic fields, initial compositions, detonation mechanisms, and limiter parameters across a range of cell sizes from 1 to 100 km. Our results set bounds on the parameter space of limiter amplitudes for which both temperature- and energy-limiting procedures yield consistent and monotonically convergent solutions. Within these bounds, we find that grid resolutions of 5 km or better are necessary for uncertainties in total released energy and iron-group products to drop below 10%. Intermediate-mass products (e.g., calcium) exhibit similar convergence trends but with somewhat greater uncertainty. These conclusions apply equally to pure C/O white dwarfs, multispecies compositions (including helium shells), magnetized and unmagnetized cores, and either single or multiple detonation scenarios.

<title>MINDS. JWST-MIRI Observations of a Spatially Resolved Atomic Jet and Polychromatic Molecular Wind toward SY Cha</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The removal of angular momentum from protostellar systems drives accretion onto the central star and may drive the dispersal of the protoplanetary disk. Winds and jets can contribute to removing angular momentum from the disk, though the dominant process remains unclear. To date, observational studies of resolved disk winds have mostly targeted highly inclined disks. We report the detection of extended H2 and [Ne ii] emission toward the young stellar object SY Cha with the JWST Mid-InfraRed Instrument Medium-Resolution Spectrometer (MIRI-MRS). This is one of the first polychromatic detections of extended H2 toward a moderately inclined, i = 51 1, Class II source. We measure the semiopening angle of the H2 emission and build a rotation diagram to determine the H2 excitation temperature and abundance. We find a wide semiopening angle, high temperature, and low column density for the H2 emission, all of which are characteristic of a disk wind. We derive a molecular wind mass loss rate of 3 ± 2 × 10−9M⊙ yr−1, which is high compared to the previously derived stellar accretion rate of 6.6 × 10−10M⊙ yr−1. This suggests either that the stellar accretion and the disk wind are driven by different mechanisms or that accretion onto the star is highly variable. These observations demonstrate MIRI-MRS's utility in expanding studies of resolved disk winds beyond edge-on sources.

<title>Kinetic and Photochemical Disequilibrium in the Potentially Carbon-rich Atmosphere of the Warm Jupiter WASP-69 b</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
High-resolution transmission spectroscopy of the warm gas giant WASP-69 b has revealed the presence of H2O, CO, CH4, NH3, and C2H2 in its atmosphere. This study investigates the impact of vertical diffusion and photochemistry on its atmospheric composition, with a focus on the detected species plus HCN and CO2, to constrain the atmospheric C/O ratio. We utilize nonequilibrium gas-phase simulations to conduct a parameter study for vertical diffusion strength, local gas temperature, and C/O ratio. Our results indicate that a carbon-rich atmosphere enhances CH4 and C2H2 concentrations, while NH3 undergoes chemical conversion into HCN in carbon-rich, high-temperature environments. Consequently, HCN is abundantly produced in such atmospheres, though its strong spectral features remain undetected in WASP-69 b. Photochemical production of HCN and C2H2 is highly sensitive to vertical diffusion strength, with weaker diffusion resulting in higher concentrations. Cross-correlation of synthetic spectra with observed data shows that models with C/O = 2 best match observations, but models with C/O = 0.55 and 0.9 lead to statistically equivalent fits, leaving the C/O ratio unconstrained. We highlight the importance of accurately modeling NH3 quenching at pressures greater than 100 bars. Models for WASP-69 b capped at 100 bars bias cross-correlation fits toward carbon-rich values. We suggest that if the atmosphere of WASP-69 b is indeed carbon-rich with a solar metallicity, future observations should reveal the presence of HCN.

Black holes may accrete gas with angular momentum vectors misaligned with the black hole spin axis. The resulting accretion disks are subject to Lense–Thirring precession, and hence torque. Analytical calculations and simulations show that Lense–Thirring precession will warp, and, for large misalignments, fracture the disk. In GRMHD simulations, the warping or breaking occurs at ≲10 rs, where rs is the Schwarzschild radius. Considering that accretion disk spectra in the soft state of stellar-mass black holes are generally well modeled as multicolor blackbodies, the question arises as to how consistent warped and broken disks are with observations. Here, we analytically calculate thermal spectra of warped and broken disks with a warp or break radius at 10 rs for various disk inclinations. Due to self-irradiation and the projected area of the inclined disk regions, the spectra of inclined disks significantly deviate from multicolor blackbodies and do not follow the multicolor blackbody relation νLν ∝ νγ = ν4/3 at low frequencies ν. The power-law indices at low frequencies of the inclined disks vary with viewing angle; when viewed face-on, they vary between γ ≈ 0.91 and 1.26 for the warped disks and γ ≈ 1.37–1.54 for the broken disks depending on the inclination angle. The differences decrease when moving the location of the disk warp and break to larger radii; for inclined disks to emit as multicolor blackbodies, they must warp or break at radii ≥50 rs. Our results imply that accretion disks around black holes in the soft state warp or break at larger radii than suggested in GRHMD simulations.

<title>JWST, ALMA, and Keck Spectroscopic Constraints on the UV Luminosity Functions at z ∼ 7–14: Clumpiness and Compactness of the Brightest Galaxies in the Early Universe</title>

We present the number densities and physical properties of the bright galaxies spectroscopically confirmed at z ∼ 7–14. Our sample is composed of 60 galaxies at zspec ∼ 7–14, including recently confirmed galaxies at zspec = 12.34–14.18 with JWST, as well as new confirmations at zspec = 6.583–7.643 with −24 < MUV < −21 mag using ALMA and Keck. Our JWST/NIRSpec observations have also revealed that very bright galaxy candidates at z ∼ 10–13 identified from ground-based telescope images before JWST are passive galaxies at z ∼ 3–4, emphasizing the necessity of strict screening and spectroscopy in the selection of the brightest galaxies at z > 10. The UV luminosity functions derived from these spectroscopic results are consistent with a double power-law function, showing tensions with theoretical models at the bright end. To understand the origin of the overabundance of bright galaxies, we investigate their morphologies using JWST/NIRCam high-resolution images obtained in various surveys, including PRIMER and COSMOS-Web. We find that ∼70% of the bright galaxies at z ∼ 7 exhibit clumpy morphologies with multiple subcomponents, suggesting merger-induced starburst activity, which is consistent with SED fitting results showing bursty star formation histories. At z ≳ 10, bright galaxies are classified into two types of galaxies: extended ones with weak high-ionization emission lines, and compact ones with strong high-ionization lines including N iv]λ1486, indicating that at least two different processes (e.g., merger-induced starburst and compact star formation/AGN) are shaping the physical properties of the brightest galaxies at z ≳ 10 and are responsible for their overabundance.

<title>Propagation of Interplanetary Shocks in the Inner Heliosphere</title>

Interplanetary (IP) shocks are one of the crucial dynamic phenomena in the heliosphere. They can accelerate particles to high energies, generate plasma waves, and trigger geomagnetic storms in Earth’s magnetosphere, significantly impacting technological infrastructure. In this study, two IP shock events are selected to study the temporal variations of the shock parameters using magnetometer and ion plasma measurements from STEREO-A and B, the Wind, Cluster fleet, and the Advanced Composition Explorer spacecraft. The shock normal vectors are determined using minimum variance analysis and magnetic coplanarity methods. During the 2007 May 7 event, the shock parameters and the shock normal direction remain consistent across each spacecraft crossing of the shock. The shock surface appears to be tilted by almost the same degree as the Parker spiral, and the driver could be a corotating interaction region (CIR). During the 2007 April 23 event, the shock parameters do not change significantly except for the shock angle θBn; however, the shape of the IP shock appears to be twisted in the direction perpendicular to the Sun–Earth line as well. The driver of this rippled shock is a stream interaction region/CIR as well.

<title>Understanding the Broad-line Region of Active Galactic Nuclei with Photoionization. I. The Moderate-accretion Regime</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada386</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Over three decades of reverberation mapping (RM) studies on local broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs) have measured reliable black hole (BH) masses for >100 AGNs. These RM measurements reveal a significant correlation between the Balmer broad-line region (BLR) size and AGN optical luminosity (the R–L relation). Recent RM studies for AGN samples with more diverse BH parameters (e.g., mass and Eddington ratio) reveal a substantial intrinsic dispersion around the average R–L relation, suggesting that variations in the broadband spectrum, driven by accretion parameters and other factors such as the cloud distribution and inclination, significantly influence the measured R–L relation. Here we perform a detailed photoionization investigation of expected broad-line properties as functions of accretion parameters using AGN continuum models from qsosed. We compare theoretical predictions with observations of a sample of 67 z ≲ 0.5 reverberation-mapped AGNs with rest-frame optical and UV spectra in the moderate-accretion regime (Eddington ratio λEdd ≡ L/LEdd < 0.5). The UV/optical line strengths and their dependences on accretion parameters are reasonably well reproduced by the locally optimally emitting cloud photoionization models. We provide quantitative recipes using optical/UV line flux ratios to infer the unobservable ionizing continuum. Additionally, photoionization models with universal values of ionization parameter ( ) and hydrogen density ( ) can qualitatively reproduce the observed global R–L relation for the current RM AGN sample. However, such models fail to reproduce the observed decrease in BLR size with increasing L/LEdd at fixed optical luminosity, implying that gas density or BLR structure may systematically change with accretion rate.

<title>CH3OH Thermal Lines Traces 6.7 GHz CH3OH Maser Variation of High-mass Protostar G353.273+0.641</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study reports an analysis of the 6.7 GHz CH3OH maser in the high-mass protostar G353.273+0.641 (G353), utilizing data from the Tianma Radio Telescope. G353 is a possibly periodic variation in the flux density of the maser with a period of ∼330 days. Our analysis of Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array archival data identified 44 CH3OH transitions within the gas envelope surrounding the protostar. The CH3OH envelope exhibited non–local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) conditions during the increase phase of the flux density of the maser, then transitioning to LTE (T ∼ 380 K) during the decay phase of the maser. This phenomenon is likely attributed to the recurrent heating of the protostellar envelope through heat waves, which are generated by the periodic luminosity oscillations of the central high-mass protostar. The propagation velocity of the heat wave is gauged to be ∼0.02c. These results emphasize the significance of integrating the variations in 6.7 GHz CH3OH masers with their surrounding circumstellar environments to advance our comprehension of high-mass star formation mechanisms.

<title>ALMA FACTS. II. Large Scale Variations in the 12CO(J = 2 – 1) to 12CO(J = 1 – 0) Line Ratio in Nearby Galaxies</title>

We present 12CO(J = 1 – 0) mapping observations over ∼1/2 of the optical disk of 12 nearby galaxies from the Fundamental CO 1–0 Transition Survey of nearby galaxies (FACTS), using the ALMA Total Power array. Variations in the 12CO(J = 2 − 1)/12CO(J = 1 − 0) line ratio r21 are investigated. The luminosity-weighted r21 of the 11 sample galaxies ranges from 0.52 to 0.69 with an average of 0.61. We use position–velocity diagrams along the major axis and tilted ring models to separate the normal rotating galactic disk from kinematic outliers that deviate from pure circular rotation. We find that r21 is systematically higher in outliers compared to the disk. We compare r21 between SA, SAB, and SB galaxies, and find no significant difference in the average r21 depending on the presence of galactic bars. We find, however, that the radial gradient in r21 is bimodal, where a group containing all SA galaxies prefer constant or very shallow r21 gradients out to 40% of the optical radius, while another group containing all SB galaxies have a steep r21 gradient, decreasing by ∼20% before 40% of the optical radius, which also corresponds to the radius of the stellar bar. After this radius, these galaxies become consistent with a constant or shallow trend in r21. The large scale trend in r21 can have implications for how we interpret observations made solely in the 12CO(J = 2 − 1) line.

EUV brightenings are small-scale magnetic reconnection events that consistently appear before and after solar flares. However, it is not well understood how EUV precursors might foreshadow flares and what the physical connection is between the EUV signatures and flares. We studied flare-active and inactive periods in three separate studies using the Detection and EUV Flare Tracking (DEFT) tool. In Study 1, EUV signatures were identified in 200 no-flare days, in Study 2 EUV signatures before 360 flares were analyzed, and in Study 3 close to 36,000 EUV signatures were detected, and their pre- and postflare distribution and trends were studied. Our key questions were as follows: do EUV signatures occur consistently before flares, do EUV signatures occur without flares, are there flares without EUV precursors, and is it possible to forecast different magnitude flares based on preceding EUV signature trends? Study 1 showed that in no-flare periods EUV signatures were only detected 4% of the time. Study 2 showed that EUV precursors were present 92% of the time within 6 hr before ≥C-class flares. Study 3 showed that over 90% of the signatures were associated with flares (≥B class), and over 50% of all signatures were associated with ≥M-class flares. A superposed epoch analysis showed precursor frequency peaks at ∼70 and 100 minutes before M- and X-class flares, respectively, while B- and C-class flares had no notable precursor frequency peaks. These results demonstrate the close connection between EUV signatures and flares and the significant potential EUV signatures have in improving space weather forecasting.

<title>Baryon Pasting the Uchuu Light-cone Simulation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the Baryon Pasted (BP) X-ray and thermal Sunyaev–Zel’dovich (tSZ) maps derived from the half-sky Uchuu light-cone simulation. These BP-Uchuu maps are constructed using more than 75 million dark matter halos with masses M500c ≥ 1013 M⊙ within the redshift range 0 ≤ z ≤ 2. A distinctive feature of our BP-Uchuu light-cone maps is their capability to assess the influence of both extrinsic and intrinsic scatter caused by triaxial gaseous halos and internal gas characteristics, respectively, at the map level. We show that triaxial gas drives substantial scatter in X-ray luminosities of clusters and groups, accounting for nearly half of the total scatter in core-excised measurements. Additionally, scatter in the thermal pressure and gas density profiles of halos enhances the X-ray and SZ power spectra, leading to biases in cosmological parameter estimates. These findings are statistically robust due to the extensive sky coverage and large halo sample in the BP-Uchuu maps. The BP-Uchuu maps are publicly available online via Globus (https://app.globus.org/file-manager?origin_id=cf8dadb7-b6e9-4e2c-abc1-0813877efc13).

<title>Uncovering the Hidden Physical Structures and Protostellar Activities in the Low-metallicity S284-RE Region: Results from ALMA and JWST</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada388</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present an observational study of the S284-RE region, a low-metallicity area associated with the extended S284 H ii region. A thermally supercritical filament (mass ∼2402 M⊙ and length ∼8.5 pc) is investigated using the Herschel column density map. The Spitzer ratio 4.5 μm/3.6 μm map traces the H2 outflows in this filament, where previously reported young stellar objects (YSOs) are spatially distributed. Analysis of the YSO distribution has revealed three active star-forming clusters (YCl1, YCl2, and YCl3) within the filament. YCl3 seems to be the most evolved and YCl2 the youngest, while YCl1 displays signs of nonthermal fragmentation. The JWST (F470N+F444W)/F356W ratio map reveals at least seven bipolar H2 outflows, with four (olc1–olc4) in YCl1 and three (ol1–ol3) in YCl2. The driving sources of these outflows are identified based on outflow geometry, Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) continuum peaks, and YSO positions. Two ALMA continuum sources—#2 and #3—from the M–Reff plot are recognized as potential massive star formation candidates. ALMA continuum source #2 hosts at least three outflow-driving sources, whereas ALMA continuum source #3 contains two. The bipolar outflow olc1, driven by an embedded object within continuum source #2, is likely a massive protostar, as indicated by the Br-α and PAH emissions depicted in the JWST (F405N+F444W)/F356W ratio map. The presence of H2 knots in the outflows olc1 and ol1 suggests episodic accretion. Overall, the study investigates a massive protostar candidate, driving the ∼2.7 pc H2 outflow olc1 and undergoing episodic accretion.

<title>Discovery and Detailed Study of the M31 Classical Nova AT 2023tkw: Evidence for Internal Shocks</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a detailed analysis of an extragalactic slow classical nova in M31 exhibiting multiple peaks in its light curve. Spectroscopic and photometric observations were used to investigate the underlying physical processes. Shock-induced heating events resulting in the expansion and contraction of the photosphere are likely responsible for the observed multiple peaks. Deviation of the observed spectrum at the peak from the models also suggests the presence of shocks. The successive peaks occurring at increasing intervals could be due to the series of internal shocks generated near or within the photosphere. Spectral modeling suggests a low-mass white dwarf (WD) accreting slowly from a companion star. The ejecta mass, estimated from spectral analysis, is ~10−4 M⊙, which is typical for a slow nova. We estimate the binary, by comparing the archival Hubble Space Telescope data and eruption properties with stellar and nova models, to comprise a 0.65 M⊙ primary WD and a K iii cool evolved secondary star.

<title>Early Detection of Multiwavelength Blazar Variability</title>

Blazars are a subclass of active galactic nuclei with relativistic jets pointing toward the observer. They are notable for their flux variability at all observed wavelengths and timescales. Together with simultaneous measurements at lower energies, the very-high-energy (VHE) emission observed during blazar flares may be used to probe the population of accelerated particles. However, optimally triggering observations of blazar high states can be challenging. Notable examples include identifying a flaring episode in real time and predicting VHE flaring activity based on lower-energy observables. For this purpose, we have developed a novel deep learning analysis framework, based on data-driven anomaly detection techniques. It is capable of detecting various types of anomalies in real-world, multiwavelength light curves, ranging from clear high states to subtle correlations across bands. Based on unsupervised anomaly detection and clustering methods, we differentiate source variability from noisy background activity, without the need for a labeled training data set of flaring states. The framework incorporates measurement uncertainties and is robust given data quality challenges, such as varying cadences and observational gaps. We evaluate our approach using both historical data and simulations of blazar light curves in two energy bands, corresponding to sources observable with the Fermi Large Area Telescope and the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory. In a statistical analysis, we show that our framework can reliably detect known historical flares.

<title>Multimessenger Probes of Supermassive Black Hole Spin Evolution</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Using the semianalytic model Serotina, we investigate the cosmic spin evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) incorporating recent results from general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations of spin-down from relativistic jets. We compare several variations of our model with compiled black hole (BH) spin measurements derived from X-ray reflection spectroscopy, correcting for a bias arising from the spin-dependent radiative efficiency of accretion flows. We show that the observed spin distribution is in agreement with a model that includes jet-driven spin-down, a key mechanism that acts to modulate spins across cosmic time at both high and very low specific accretion rates. The data also clearly prefer models with coherent accretion over models in which accretion disks rapidly switch from prograde to retrograde. We further predict spin distributions accessible via spatially resolved event horizons by the next-generation Event Horizon Telescope and Black Hole Explorer, as well as gravitational waves by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), each of which offers unique and distinct windows into the population of spinning BHs. Jet-driven spin-down is most strongly imprinted on the abundance of very highly spinning objects in our model. In addition, we show that the spin distribution sampled by LISA events may contain a signature of the natal spin distribution of heavy seeds, but not of light seeds, offering additional discrimination between these seeding pathways. Spin distributions from these future observed samples can be used to constrain the detailed physical properties of the accretion flow on horizon scales around SMBHs.

<title>Hooks, Lines, and Sinkers: How Active Galactic Nucleus Feedback and Cosmic-Ray Transport Shape the Far-infrared–Radio Correlation of Galaxies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The far-infrared–radio correlation (FRC) is one of the most promising empirical constraints on the role of cosmic rays (CRs) and magnetic fields in galaxy formation and evolution. While many theories have been proposed in order to explain the emergence and maintenance of the FRC across a gamut of galaxy properties and redshift, the nonlinear physics at play remain unexplored in full complexity and within a cosmological context. We present the first reproduction of the z ∼ 0 FRC using detailed synthetic observations of state-of-the-art cosmological zoom-in simulations from the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE-3) suite with explicitly evolved CR proton and electron (CRe) spectra, for three models for CR transport and multichannel active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback. In doing so, we generally verify the predictions of “calorimeter” theories at high FIR luminosities (L60 μm ≳ 109.5L⊙) and at low FIR luminosities (L60 μm ≲ 109.5L⊙), the so-called “conspiracy” of increasing UV radiation escape in tandem with increasing CRe escape, and find that the global FRC is insensitive to orders-of-magnitude locally variable CR transport coefficients. Importantly, the indirect effect of AGN feedback on emergent observables highlights novel interpretations of outliers in the FRC. In particular, we find that in many cases “radio-excess” objects can be better understood as “IR-dim” objects with longer-lived radio contributions at low z from Type Ia supernovae and intermittent black hole accretion in quenching galaxies, though this is sensitive to the interplay of CR transport and AGN feedback physics. This creates characteristic evolutionary tracks leading to the z = 0 FRC, which shape the subsequent late-time behavior of each model.

<title>The Disk Wind Contribution to the Gamma-Ray Emission from the Nearby Seyfert Galaxy GRS 1734−292</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Radio-quiet Seyfert galaxies have been detected in GeV gamma rays by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT), but the origin of much of this emission is unclear. We consider the nearby example GRS 1734−292, which exhibits weak starburst and jet activities that are insufficient to explain the observed gamma-ray flux. With the first detailed multiwavelength study of this source, we demonstrate that an active galactic nucleus (AGN) disk wind can account for its gamma-ray emission. Using a lepto-hadronic emission model based on a shocked ambient medium and a shocked wind region created by an AGN accretion disk wind, we identify two viable scenarios that are consistent with the Fermi-LAT data and multiwavelength observations: a hadronic pp-dominated scenario and a leptonic external-Compton-dominated scenario. Both of these show that future observations with the Cherenkov Telescope Array and the Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory could detect TeV emission from a disk wind in GRS 1734−292. Such a detection would substantially improve our understanding of cosmic-ray acceleration efficiency in AGN disk wind systems and would establish radio-quiet Seyfert galaxies as cosmic-ray accelerators capable of reaching ultrahigh energies.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
To gain insight into the dynamical influence of a supermassive black hole binary on a circumbinary accretion disk, we investigate the binary and viscous torque densities throughout such a disk, with emphasis on the final density distribution, particularly the size and stability of the central gap between the binary and the inner edge of the disk. We limit ourselves to the simplified case of a massless viscous thin accretion disk under the influence of the gravitational potential from a binary system whose orbital plane is inclined relative to the disk. We employ two-dimensional Newtonian hydrodynamics simulations to examine the influence of two model parameters: the mass ratio of the binary and the inclination angle between the binary and the disk. We investigate their impact on the density and torque distribution. In our analytical approach, we consider the stability of epicycles induced by the perturbative effect of the asymmetric inclined binary gravitational potential on Keplerian circular orbits. Through our simulations, we observe that certain configurations never attain a quasi-steady state, where the density profile averaged over many orbits stabilizes. This instability occurs when the inclination is close to 45°. Furthermore, we identify configurations where there is never a persistent balance between the dynamical and viscous torque densities, as well as cases where the location of this balance oscillates or exhibits other time-dependent behavior over viscous timescales. These findings have implications for understanding both the expected gravitational-wave signal and electromagnetic counterparts from supermassive black hole binaries.

Solar energetic particle (SEP) events pose significant risks to both space and ground-level infrastructure, as well as to human health in space. Understanding and predicting these events are critical for mitigating their potential impacts. In this paper, we address the challenge of predicting SEP events using proton flux data. We leverage some of the most recent advances in time series data mining, such as shapelets and the matrix profile, to propose a simple and easily understandable prediction approach. Our objective is to mitigate the interpretability challenges inherent to most machine learning models and to show that other methods exist that can not only yield accurate forecasts but also facilitate exploration and insight generation within the data domain. For this purpose, we construct a multivariate time series data set consisting of proton flux data recorded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's geosynchronous orbit Earth-observing satellite. Then, we use our proposed approach to mine shapelets and make predictions using a random forest classifier. We demonstrate that our approach rivals state-of-the-art SEP prediction, offering superior interpretability and the ability to predict SEP events before their parent eruptive flares.

<title>Spectral Variations across Latitudes on Asteroid (3200) Phaethon</title>

3200 Phaethon is a near-Earth asteroid known to be actively emitting dust and gas when near its perihelion, and it is the target of the Japanese DESTINY+ mission. Several visible–near-IR spectra were obtained of Phaethon during 2003–2017, which have been collected together and analyzed with respect to its shape model. Using a thermal model, we examine the diurnal temperature variations across Phaethon’s surface (ΔT ∼ 600 K). We find different solar radiation heating between the north and south regions, with very high surface temperatures in the south region (max peak ∼ 1050 K), while a lower temperature is found in the north region (a mean value of 760 K). Our analysis of the photometrically corrected slope suggests a latitudinal trend in surface composition. We propose that the northern region of Phaethon may be linked to unusual chondrites and naturally heated Y-82162 samples (63–125 μm and/or chips), while the southern region shows similarities to Ivuna CI chondrites heated to 700°C (0–125 μm). The equatorial region appears to include a mixture of materials from both hemispheres.

<title>Tracing the Winds: A Uniform Interpretation of Helium Escape in Exoplanets from Archival Spectroscopic Observations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Over the past decade, observations of evaporating exoplanets have become increasingly common, driven by the discovery of the near-infrared helium-triplet line as a powerful probe of atmospheric escape. This process significantly influences the evolution of exoplanets, particularly those smaller than Jupiter. Both theoretical and observational studies have aimed to determine how efficiently exoplanets convert their host star's X-ray and ultraviolet (XUV) radiation into atmospheric mass loss. In this study, we employ the open-source atmospheric escape model p-winds to systematically analyze all publicly available helium triplet spectroscopic detections related to exoplanetary atmospheric escape. Our findings indicate that the retrieved outflows strongly depend on the ratio of XUV flux to planetary density (FXUV/ρp), supporting the theoretical framework of energy-limited mass loss. We constrain population-level photoevaporative efficiencies to 0.34 ± 0.13 and 0.75 ± 0.21 for hydrogen-helium fractions of 0.90 and 0.99, respectively. These results offer new insights into exoplanetary atmospheric evolution and will aid future studies on exoplanet population demographics.

<title>PSR J1947−1120: A New Huntsman Millisecond Pulsar Binary</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the discovery of PSR J1947–1120, a new huntsman millisecond pulsar with a red giant companion star in a 10.3 day orbit. This pulsar was found via optical, X-ray, and radio follow-up of the previously unassociated γ-ray source 4FGL J1947.6–1121. PSR J1947–1120 is the second confirmed pulsar in the huntsman class and establishes this as a bona fide subclass of millisecond pulsars. We use MESA models to show that huntsman pulsars can be naturally explained as neutron star binaries whose secondaries are currently in the “red bump” region of the red giant branch, temporarily underfilling their Roche lobes and hence halting mass transfer. Huntsman pulsars offer a new view of the formation of typical millisecond pulsars, allowing novel constraints on the efficiency of mass transfer and recycling at an intermediate stage in the process.

<title>No Galaxy-scale [C ii] Fast Outflow in the z = 6.72 Red Quasar HSC J1205–0000</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
HSC 120505.09-000027.9 (J1205–0000) is one of the highest redshift (z = 6.72) dust-reddened quasars (red quasars) known to date. We present an improved analysis of Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array data of the [C ii] 158 μm line and the underlying rest-frame far-infrared (FIR) continuum emission, previously reported in T. Izumi et al. (2021b), toward J1205–0000. Red quasars are thought to be a transitional phase from an obscured starburst to a luminous blue quasar, in some cases associated with massive outflows driven by the active galactic nucleus (AGN). J1205–0000 has a high FIR luminosity, LFIR = 2.5 × 1012 L⊙ and a total IR luminosity of LTIR = 3.5 × 1012 L⊙, corresponding to a star formation rate of ∼528 M⊙ yr−1. With the [C ii]-based dynamical mass of ∼1 × 1011 M⊙, we conclude that J1205–0000 is hosted by a starburst galaxy. In contradiction to T. Izumi et al., our improved analysis shows no hint of a broad component in the [C ii] line spectrum. Thus there is no evidence for a host galaxy-scale fast [C ii] outflow, despite the fact that J1205–0000 has fast nuclear ionized outflows seen in the rest-frame UV. We explore several scenarios for this discrepancy (e.g., the early phase of AGN feedback, reliability of the [C ii] line as a tracer of outflows), and we claim that it is still too early to conclude that there is no significant negative AGN feedback on star formation in this red quasar.

<title>Star Formation in the Lopsided Galaxy Arp 291</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We have investigated the star formation process taking place in the lopsided galaxy Arp 291, based on narrowband images in the Hα, [N ii]λ6583, and [O iii]λ5007 emission lines, obtained using the modern tunable photometer MaNGaL at the Caucasus Mountain Observatory. We have diagnosed 30 star-forming (SF) regions by means of the Baldwin–Phillips–Terlevich method. The oxygen abundance of the ionized gas in the SF regions varies in the range from 8.17 ± 0.04 to 8.47 ± 0.16 dex, which is typical for spiral and irregular galaxies, and shows an anticorrelation with the surface density of current star formation rates. Star formation in the lopsided galaxy Arp 291 occurs in separate clumps comparable in size to those observed in spiral and lenticular galaxies, at a rate typical for these types of galaxies. The clumps of current star formation are located irregularly in the distorted spiral arms of Arp 291. Possible causes of lopsidedness of the galaxy are discussed.

<title>Observing Supernova Neutrino Light Curves with Super-Kamiokande. V. Distance Estimation with Neutrinos</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Neutrinos are pivotal signals in multimessenger observations of supernovae (SNe). Recent advancements in the analysis method of supernova (SN) neutrinos, especially in quantitative analysis, have significantly broadened scientific possibilities. This study demonstrates the feasibility of estimating distances to SNe using neutrinos. This estimation utilizes the direct relationship between the radius of a neutron star (NS) and the distance to the supernova, which is analogous to main-sequence fitting. The radius of an NS is determined with an approximate uncertainty of 10% through observations such as X-rays and gravitational waves. By integrating this information, the distance to the supernova can be estimated with an uncertainty of within 15% at a 95% confidence level. It has been established that neutrinos can pinpoint the direction of supernovae, and when combined with distance estimates, three-dimensional localization becomes achievable. This capability is vital for follow-up observations using multimessenger approaches. Moreover, more precise distance determinations to SNe through follow-up observations, such as optical observations, allow for accurate measurements of neutron-star radii. This data, via the neutron-star mass–radius relationship, could provide various insights into nuclear physics.

<title>Solar Modulation of AMS-02 Daily Proton and Helium Fluxes with Modified Force-field Approximation Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
As galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) propagate through the turbulent plasma environment within the heliosphere, they undergo a process of diffusion, drift, and energy loss, leading to a notable reduction in their flux. This is the solar modulation impact. Recently, the cosmic-ray experiment AMS-02 published daily fluxes of proton and helium for the period from 2011 May 20 to 2019 October 29 in the rigidity interval from about 1 to 100 GV, exhibiting fine time structures that correlate with solar wind properties on a daily basis. In this work, we employ three different modified force field approximation models to fit the data. By fitting to the daily proton and helium fluxes, we get the time series of solar modulation potential. We find good agreement of data and model predictions for both proton and helium with the same parameters in two modified force field approximation models. The results in this study verify that the modified force-field approximation model is a valid parameterization of the GCR spectrum also at daily timescales.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Named for orbital kinship with Pluto, the Plutinos are a prominent group of Kuiper Belt objects whose orbital periods are in libration about a 3/2 ratio with Neptune’s. We investigate the long-term orbital dynamics of known Plutinos, with attention to the additional libration (or lack thereof) of their argument of perihelion, g, a well-known characteristic of Pluto’s orbit. We show that the g librators among the Plutinos cluster around an arc in the eccentricity–inclination parameter plane. This previously unreported dynamical structure is owed to a family of periodic orbits of the third kind in the restricted problem of three bodies, identified by Poincaré at the end of the 19th century. Approximately 16% of the currently known Plutinos exhibit g librations, a far greater fraction than the ratios of the associated libration frequencies. These results may offer new constraints for theoretical models of the dynamical history of the Plutinos and of the orbital migration history of the giant planets.

<title>Intrinsic Pulse Widths of FRB 20121102A and Calculation of Broadening from Propagation and Instrumental Effects</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adace3</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The pulse widths of fast radio bursts are always broadened due to the scattering of the plasma medium through which the electromagnetic wave passes. The recorded pulse width will be further affected by the radio telescopes since the sampling time and the bandwidth cannot be infinitely small. In this study, we focus on the pulse widths of at least 3287 bursts detected from FRB 20121102A as of 2023 October. Various effects such as the scattering broadening, the redshift-induced broadening, and the instrumental broadening are examined. At a redshift of 0.193, the pulse width is broadened by a factor of approximately 0.16 due to cosmological time dilation. It is found that the instrumental broadening only contributes a fraction of 10−3–10−1 to the observed pulse width. The scattering broadening is even smaller, which constitutes a tiny fraction of 10−5–10−2 in the observed pulse width. After correcting for these broadenings, the intrinsic pulse width is derived for each burst. The maximum and minimum pulse widths at different frequencies are highlighted. The intrinsic widths of most bursts are in a narrow range of 1–10 ms, which leads to a quasi-linear correlation between the fluence and the peak flux. Additionally, the mean value and the dispersion range of intrinsic pulse width are found to scale with the central frequency as ν−1.2±0.2 and ν−1.7±0.6, respectively.

<title>Testing the Flux Rope Paradigm for Coronal Mass Ejections Using a Three-spacecraft Encounter Event</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a 3D morphological and field reconstruction of a coronal mass ejection (CME) from 2023 November 28, which hits three spacecraft near 1 au: Wind at Earth’s L1 Lagrange point, STEREO-A with a longitudinal separation of 6 5 west of Earth, and Solar Orbiter (SolO) at 10 7 east of Earth. The reconstruction assumes a magnetic flux rope (MFR) structure for the CME. With this event, we test whether field tracings observed by a spacecraft passing near the central axis of a CME MFR (STEREO-A) can be used to successfully predict the field behavior seen by a spacecraft 17∘ away (SolO), which has a more grazing encounter with the CME. We find that the MFR model does have significant success in simultaneously reproducing the field signs and rotations seen at STEREO-A, Wind, and SolO. This provides support for the MFR paradigm for CME structure. However, the SolO measurements, which are farthest from the central axis of the MFR, show less defined MFR signatures, presumably due to a greater degree of erosion and degradation of the MFR structure far from its central axis.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
For the first time, we reveal the distribution of plasma density, electron temperature, thermal pressure, and total pressure around a reconnection X-line, by using the spiral CT scan technique, which is a novel technique analogous to that in the hospital. This X-line was detected by the Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft and has been widely believed to host a non-guide-field reconnection in previous studies. With the help of such an advanced technique, we find that (1) the plasma density is low on the magnetosphere side but high on the magnetosheath side; (2) the electron temperature is high on the magnetosphere side but low on the magnetosheath side; (3) the thermal pressure is high near the current sheet but low away from the current sheet; (4) the total pressure in the inflow region is higher than near the current sheet. Among these findings, the first three agree with classical theories, hence validating our novel scan technique; the last one implicates that antiparallel magnetic field lines were being pushed together and the reconnection process was ongoing.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A coronal mass ejection (CME) and post-CME blob phenomena in the solar atmosphere, associated with shear flow and convergent flow perturbations in the photosphere, are investigated using a resistive two-fluid (electron–ion) code. It is found that there are notable deviations between the two-fluid and previous magnetohydrodynamic simulations. In this two-fluid approach, the decoupling motions of ions and electrons leads to the emergence of an additional electric field. With expansion of a magnetic arcade associated with the footpoint shear flows, a thin current sheet is formed and a series of magnetic reconnections occurs in the lower region of the central magnetic arcade. The initial reconnection gives rise to a rising magnetic island, displaying typical CME characteristics. Subsequent reconnections produce smaller, more rapidly ascending blobs. These smaller blobs ultimately merge with the primary CME core, thereby accelerating its ascent.

<title>Shaping Outflows and Jets by Ambient Pressure: A Unified Framework</title>

Astrophysical outflows are ubiquitous across cosmic scales, from stellar to galactic systems. While diverse launching mechanisms have been proposed, we demonstrate that these outflows share a fundamental commonality: their morphology follows the physics of pressure-confined supersonic flows. By extending classical de Laval nozzle theory to account for ambient pressure gradients, we present a unified framework that successfully describes outflows from young stellar objects to active galactic nuclei. This simplified approach, compared to full magnetohydrodynamic treatments, captures the essential physics governing outflow shapes across different scales. Our model reveals a remarkable consistency of pressure profiles, characterized by a power-law exponent near “–2” across 6 orders of magnitude in spatial scale, independent of the internal characteristics of the outflow or the nature of the central engine. This discovery suggests a universal mechanism for outflow collimation and acceleration, bridging the gap between theoretical models and observational features across a wide range of astronomical scales.

<title>Study of Long-term Spectral Evolution and X-Ray and γ-Ray Correlation of Blazars Seen by HAWC</title>

The HAWC Observatory collected 6 yr of extensive data, providing an ideal platform for long-term monitoring of blazars in the very high energy (VHE) band, without bias toward specific flux states. HAWC continuously monitors blazar activity at TeV energies, focusing on sources with a redshift of z ≤ 0.3, based on the Third Fermi-LAT Catalog of High-Energy sources. We specifically focused our analysis on Mrk 421 and Mrk 501, as they are the brightest blazars observed by the HAWC Observatory. With a data set of 2143 days, this work significantly extends the monitoring previously published, which was based on 511 days of observation. By utilizing HAWC data for the VHE γ-ray emission in the 300 GeV–100 TeV energy range, in conjunction with Swift-XRT data for the 0.3–10 keV X-ray emission, we aim to explore potential correlations between these two bands. For Mrk 501, we found evidence of a long-term correlation. Additionally, we identified a period in the light curve where the flux was very low for more than 2 yr. On the other hand, our analysis of Mrk 421 measured a strong linear correlation for quasi-simultaneous observations collected by HAWC and Swift-XRT. This result is consistent with a linear dependence and a multiple-zone synchrotron self-Compton model to explain the X-ray and γ-ray emission. Finally, as suggested by previous findings, we confirm a harder-when-brighter behavior in the spectral evolution of the flux properties for Mrk 421. These findings contribute to the understanding of blazar emissions and their underlying mechanisms.

We extend the spherical tensorial formalism for polarization to the treatment of electric and magnetic multipole transitions of any order. We rely on the spherical-wave expansion to derive the tensor form of the operator describing the interaction of the atomic system with a polarized radiation field, which naturally leads to the introduction of spherical tensors describing the polarization properties of the interacting field. As a direct application, the formalism is used to model the radiation anisotropy affecting the scattering of radiation in an electric quadrupole transition and the associated Hanle effect in the presence of a magnetic field.

<title>Tackling the Problem of Distributional Shifts: Correcting Misspecified, High-dimensional Data-driven Priors for Inverse Problems</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9b92</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Bayesian inference for inverse problems hinges critically on the choice of priors. In the absence of specific prior information, population-level distributions can serve as effective priors for parameters of interest. With the advent of machine learning, the use of data-driven population-level distributions (encoded, e.g., in a trained deep neural network) as priors is emerging as an appealing alternative to simple parametric priors in a variety of inverse problems. However, in many astrophysical applications it is often difficult or even impossible to acquire independent and identically distributed samples from the underlying data-generating process of interest to train these models. In these cases, corrupted data or a surrogate, e.g., a simulator, is often used to produce training samples, meaning that there is a risk of obtaining misspecified priors. This, in turn, can bias the inferred posteriors in ways that are difficult to quantify, which limits the potential applicability of these models in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose addressing this issue by iteratively updating the population-level distributions by retraining the model with posterior samples from different sets of observations, and we showcase the potential of this method on the problem of background image reconstruction in strong gravitational lensing when score-based models are used as data-driven priors. We show that, starting from a misspecified prior distribution, the updated distribution becomes progressively closer to the underlying population-level distribution, and the resulting posterior samples exhibit reduced bias after several updates.

<title>Investigating the Efficacy of Topologically Derived Time Series for Flare Forecasting. I. Data Set Preparation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The accurate forecasting of solar flares is considered a key goal within the solar physics and space weather communities. There is significant potential for flare prediction to be improved by incorporating topological fluxes of magnetogram data sets, without the need to invoke three-dimensional magnetic field extrapolations. Topological quantities such as magnetic helicity and magnetic winding have shown significant potential toward this aim, and provide spatiotemporal information about the complexity of active region magnetic fields. This study develops time series that are derived from the spatial fluxes of helicity and winding that show significant potential for solar flare prediction. It is demonstrated that time-series signals, which correlate with flare onset times, also exhibit clear spatial correlations with eruptive activity, establishing a potential causal relationship. A significant database of helicity and winding fluxes and associated time series across 144 active regions is generated using Space-Weather HMI Active Region Patches data processed with the Active Region Topology (or ARTop) code that forms the basis of the time-series and spatial investigations conducted here. We find that a number of time series in this data set often exhibit extremal signals that occur 1–8 hr before a flare. This publicly available living data set will allow users to incorporate these data into their own flare prediction algorithms.

<title>Tracking Star-forming Cores as Mass Reservoirs in Clustered and Isolated Regions Using Numerical Passive Tracer Particles</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Understanding the physical properties of star-forming cores as mass reservoirs for protostars and the impact of turbulence is crucial in star formation studies. We implemented passive tracer particles in clump-scale numerical simulations with turbulence strengths of . Unlike core identification methods used in observational studies, we identified 260 star-forming cores using a new method based on tracer particles falling onto protostars. Our findings reveal that star-forming cores do not necessarily coincide with high-density regions when nearby stars are present, as gas selectively accretes onto protostars, leading to clumpy, fragmented structures. We calculated convex hull cores from star-forming cores and defined their filling factors. Regardless of turbulence strength, convex hull cores with lower filling factors tend to contain more protostars and have larger masses and sizes, indicating that cores in clustered regions are more massive and larger than those in isolated regions. Thus, the filling factor serves as a key indicator for distinguishing between isolated and clustered star-forming regions and may provide insights into the star formation processes within clustered regions. We also found that most convex hull cores are gravitationally bound. However, in the model, there are more low-mass, unbound convex hull cores compared to the model. In the model, 16% of the convex hull cores are unbound, which may be explained by the inertial-inflow model. These findings highlight the influence of turbulence strength on the mass and gravitational stability of cores.

<title>Fluctuations Driven by Multicomponent Pickup Ion Distributions in the Outer Heliosheath</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The stability of a realistic multicomponent pickup ion (PUI) velocity distribution derived from a global model of neutral atoms in the heliosphere, which treats hydrogen and helium atoms self-consistently and includes equations for electrons and helium ions, is investigated using linear instability analysis and hybrid simulations. Linear instability analysis shows that the excited oblique mirror waves and the parallel/quasi-parallel Alfvén-cyclotron (AC) waves have lower growth rates than those obtained previously by A. Mousavi et al. for the PUI velocity distributions given by J. Heerikhuisen et al. The PUI scattering by each of the two modes alone is studied. In contrast to the previous investigations, our current simulations using the updated realistic distributions indicate that mirror waves alone do not effectively scatter PUIs in pitch angle. Instead, they primarily contribute to reducing the thermal spread anisotropy of the PUIs originating from the neutral solar wind. The unstable AC waves exhibit lower growth rates but higher saturation levels than the mirror waves. Two-dimensional (2D) simulation results show that when all unstable waves are present, the predominant contributor to the fluctuating magnetic field energy is the AC mode. The AC waves quickly scatter the PUIs with pitch angles away from 90∘ toward isotropy, while the PUIs near 90∘ pitch angle maintain a degree of anisotropy within our simulation timeframe. Moreover, several 1D and 2D hybrid simulations with different numbers of particles per cell are performed to examine the impact of numerical noise on PUI scattering. Finally, the implications of these results for the Interstellar Boundary Explorer energetic neutral atom ribbon are discussed.

Methanol is one of the most abundant complex organic molecules in interstellar environments. Molecular lines of its rare isotopologues 12CH317OH and 12CH318OH therefore play a crucial role in examining the column density of 12CH316OH, which serves as a reference for organic molecular chemistry in interstellar clouds. In this study, we have recorded the spectroscopic emission spectrum of 12CH317OH in the frequency range between 216 and 264 GHz by making use of an emission-type millimeter and submillimeter spectrometer. We have specifically paid attention to the Q-branch transitions, which are the strongest line series in this frequency region. Among the stable oxygen isotopes, 16O, 17O, and 18O of methanol, only 12CH317OH obviously shows line profiles having double and/or triple peaks in low-J transitions, due to the nuclear quadrupole interaction. The newly obtained 12CH317OH data will play an important role in facilitating a deeper understanding of the organic chemistry related to star and planet formation. The 12CH317OH line data allow us to trace and constrain the isotopic ratio 17O/18O in methanol, which is efficient to investigate the galactic-scale evolution of elements. In addition, we also assigned some transitions of 13CH317OH in the recorded spectrum.

<title>Formation of Stripped Stars from Stellar Collisions in Galactic Nuclei</title>

Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are an important way to probe the properties of stellar populations surrounding supermassive black holes. The observed spectra of several TDEs, such as ASASSN-14li, show high nitrogen-to-carbon (N/C) abundance ratios, leading to questions about their progenitors. Disrupting an intermediate- or high-mass star that has undergone CNO processing, increasing the nitrogen in its core, could lead to an enhanced nitrogen TDE. Galactic nuclei present a conducive environment for high-velocity stellar collisions that can lead to high mass loss, stripping the carbon- and hydrogen-rich envelopes of the stars and leaving behind the enhanced nitrogen cores. TDEs of these stripped stars may therefore exhibit even more extreme nitrogen enhancement. Using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code StarSmasher, we provide a parameter space study of high-velocity stellar collisions involving intermediate-mass stars, analyzing the composition of the collision products. We conclude that high-velocity stellar collisions can form products that have abundance ratios similar to those observed in the motivating TDEs. Furthermore, we show that stars which have not experienced high CNO processing can yield low-mass collision products that retain even higher N/C abundance ratios. We analytically estimate the mass fallback for a typical TDE of several collision products to demonstrate consistency between our models and TDE observations. Lastly, we discuss how the extended collision products, with high central to average density ratios, can be related to repeated partial TDEs like ASASSN-14ko and G objects in the Galactic center.

<title>Synthetic Modeling of Polarized Dust Emission in Intermediate-mass YSOs. I. Constraining the Role of Iron Inclusions and Inelastic Relaxation on Grain Alignment with ALMA Polarization</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada3cf</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Iron inclusions embedded inside dust grains play a crucial role in both internal alignment (IA) via Barnett relaxation and external alignment via the MAgnetically Enhanced RAdiative Torque (MRAT) mechanism. Moreover, inelastic relaxation is predicted to dominate over Barnett relaxation in driving the IA of micron-sized grains and very large grains (VLGs) above 10 μm. Yet, a detailed modeling of polarized thermal dust emission from Class 0/I young stellar objects (YSOs) taking into account these effects and their observational constraints is still lacking. In this paper, we update the POLARIS code and use it to perform synthetic dust polarization modeling for MHD simulations of an intermediate-mass YSOs. Results will be post-processed with CASA to confront Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) polarimetric observations. We found that to reproduce the high polarization degree of p ∼ 5%–30% observed in protostellar envelopes by ALMA, micron-sized grains and VLGs must contain iron inclusions with Ncl ∼ 5–103 iron atoms per cluster, assuming 30% of iron abundance locked inside dust grains under the cluster form. Inside the inner ∼500 au region, inelastic relaxation must participate in driving the grain IA, and grains must contain larger iron inclusions of Ncl ∼ 102–104 and grow beyond ≥10 μm to reproduce ∼3%–10% of dust polarization observed by ALMA. But given such a combination, the IA and MRAT efficiency acting on VLGs still decreases toward the center, inducing the decrease of p(%) with increasing gas density, reaching p ∼ 1% inside the disk.

<title>Minor-merger-induced Star Formation Rejuvenation in an Elliptical Radio-loud Quasar Host, 3C 59</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada033</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada033</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report a rare case where an elliptical radio-loud quasar host, 3C 59, rejuvenates star formation activity through minor mergers with its nearby satellite galaxies. The inferred star formation history of 3C 59 has shown significant star formation rejuvenation within the past 500 Myr, before which it remained rather quiescent for most of the cosmic time. The three nearest satellite galaxies of 3C 59 exhibit significant morphological disturbances, and two of them present strong tidal tails pointing toward 3C 59. In addition, all the satellite galaxies within a projected distance of 200 kpc show low star formation activities. They also have systematically lower effective radius (Re) than local late-type galaxies, while 3C 59 has significantly larger Re than both early- and late-type galaxies. All these features suggest that ongoing minor mergers between 3C 59 and its nearby satellites could be causing gas to flow into 3C 59, which induces the star formation rejuvenation and possibly also triggers the quasar activity. The enormous power from the large-scale radio jet of 3C 59 may in turn help keep the halo hot, prevent gas cooling, and further reduce star formation in its satellite galaxies. These results provide important insights into the mass and size growth of central galaxies and star formation quenching of satellite galaxies in galaxy groups.

<title>Solar Modulation of Low-energy Cosmic-Ray Nitrogen and Its Comparison with Oxygen</title>

The heliospheric environment is very complex and filled with diverse high-energy particles from various origins, and among these particles, cosmic rays (CRs), including anomalous and Galactic components (ACRs and GCRs), are unique as they originate from beyond the solar system. Due to their stable and long-lasting presence in the heliosphere, the study of CRs is crucial for protecting humanity and other lifeforms against the hazards of high-energy radiation. In this work, we aim to study the prolonged changes in CR nitrogen, a fundamental element that constitutes amino acids, using the measurements from the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) spacecraft. The comparison of solar modulation on CR nitrogen and oxygen is also made using the yearly averaged ACE observations. The ACR nitrogen has a more even spectrum than ACR oxygen while the spectrum of GCR nitrogen is more abrupt than GCR oxygen. Further model results indicate that GCR nitrogen and oxygen undergo comparable modulation processes within the heliosphere and the slight difference between the observed power-law indices of nitrogen and oxygen spectrum is due to the distinct local interstellar spectrum of the two species. Besides, an analysis is made to explain the observed more flattened ACR spectrum of nitrogen than oxygen caused by the slightly different charge-to-mass ratio Z/A.

<title>Cluster Candidates with Massive Quiescent Galaxies at z ∼ 2</title>

Galaxy clusters are crucial to understanding the role of the environment in galaxy evolution. However, due to their rarity, only a limited number of clusters have been identified at z ≳ 2. In this paper, we report a discovery of seven cluster candidates with massive quiescent galaxies at z ∼ 2 in the 3.5 deg2 area of the XMM Large Scale Structure field, roughly doubling the known cluster sample at this frontier redshift if confirmed. We construct a photometric redshift catalog based on deep (i ∼ 26, Ks ∼ 24) multiwavelength photometry from the u* band to the K band gathered from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program and other collaborative/public surveys. We adopt a Gaussian kernel density estimate with two different spatial scales (10″ and 60″) to draw a density map of massive ( ) and quiescent ( ) galaxies at z ∼ 2. Then, we identify seven prominent overdensities. These candidates show clear red sequences in color–magnitude diagrams (z − H versus H). Moreover, one of them shows an extended X-ray emission with LX = (1.46 ± 0.35) × 1044 erg s−1, suggesting its virialized nature. There is no clear evidence of enhancement nor suppression of the star formation rate of the main-sequence galaxies in the clusters. We find that cluster galaxies have a higher fraction of transition population with (12%) than the field (2%), which implies the ongoing star formation quenching. The quiescent fraction in the cluster candidates also exceeds that in the field. We confirm that the excess of a quiescent fraction is larger for higher-mass galaxies. This is the first statistical evidence for the mass-dependent environmental quenching at work in clusters even at z ∼ 2.

<title>Assessing the Impact of Binary Systems on Microlensing Using SPISEA and PopSyCLE Population Simulations</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada5f9</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Gravitational microlensing provides a unique opportunity to probe the mass distribution of stars, black holes, and other objects in the Milky Way. Population simulations are necessary to interpret results from microlensing surveys. The contribution from binary objects is often neglected or minimized in analysis of observations and simulations despite the high percentage of binary systems and microlensing's ability to probe binaries. To simulate the population effects, we added multiple systems to Stellar Population Interface for Stellar Evolution and Atmospheres (SPISEA), which simulates stellar clusters. We then inject these multiples into Population Synthesis for Compact-object Lensing Events (PopSyCLE), which simulates Milky Way microlensing surveys. When making OGLE observational selection criteria, we find that 55% of observed microlensing events involve a binary system. Specifically, 14.5% of events have a multiple lens and a single source, 31.7% have a single lens and a multiple source, and 8.8% have a multiple lens and a multiple source. The majority of these events have photometric light curves that appear single and are fit well by a single-lens, single-source model. This suggests that binary source and binary lens−binary source models should be included more frequently in event analysis. The mean Einstein crossing time shifts from 19.1 days for single events only to 21.3 days for single and multiple events, after cutting binary events with multiple peaks. The Einstein crossing time distribution of single and single-peaked multiple events is better aligned with observed distributions from OGLE than singles alone, indicating that multiple systems are a significant missing piece between simulations and reality.

<title>Dust Dynamics in Radially Convective Regions of Protoplanetary Disks</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adabe6</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adabe6</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Hydrodynamic instabilities likely operate in protoplanetary disks. One candidate, convective overstability (COS), can be triggered in regions with a negative radial entropy gradient. The ensuing turbulence and flow structures are expected to affect dust dynamics directly. We revisit the interaction between dust and the COS with high-resolution spectral simulations in the unstratified, axisymmetric Boussinesq shearing box framework. We find zonal flows, or pressure bumps, formed by the COS trap dust, as expected, but dust densities increase at most by a factor of O(10) over its background value due to the zonal flows’ unsteady nature. Furthermore, dust feedback can impede the formation of zonal flows, even at small dust-to-gas ratios ϵ ∼ O(0.1). We interpret this phenomenon as a competition between the negative gas angular momentum flux associated with zonal flow formation and the positive dust angular momentum flux associated with its drift toward pressure maxima. Dust concentration significantly weakens when a large-scale radial pressure gradient induces a background dust drift. Ultimately, we find that dust concentration by COS-induced zonal flows is limited to ϵ ≲ 1. Whether this can be improved under more realistic geometries must be addressed with stratified and full 3D simulations at equivalent resolutions.

<title>Constraints on the Variation of the Fine-structure Constant at 3 < z < 10 with JWST Emission-line Galaxies</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adad5b</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adad5b</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present constraints on the spacetime variation of the fine-structure constant α at redshifts 2.5 ≤ z < 9.5 using JWST emission-line galaxies (ELGs). The galaxy sample consists of 621 high-quality spectra with strong and narrow [O iii] λλ4959,5007 doublet emission lines from 578 galaxies, including 232 spectra at z > 5. The [O iii] doublet lines are arguably the best emission lines to probe the variation in α. We divide our sample into six subsamples based on redshift and calculate the relative variation Δα/α for the individual subsamples. The calculated Δα/α values are consistent with zero within 1σ at all redshifts, suggesting no time variation in α above a level of (1–2) × 10−4 (1σ) in the past 13.2 billion yr. When the whole sample is combined, the constraint is improved to be Δα/α = (0.2 ± 0.7) × 10−4. We further test the spatial variation in α using four subsamples of galaxies in four different directions on the sky. The measured Δα/α values are consistent with zero at a 1σ level of ∼2 × 10−4. While the constraints in this work are not as stringent as those from lower-redshift quasar absorption lines in previous studies, this work uses an independent tracer and provides the first constraints on Δα/α at the highest redshifts. With the growing number of ELGs from JWST, we expect to achieve stronger constraints in the future.

Slitless (or wide-field) imaging spectroscopy provides simultaneous imaging and spectral information from a wide field of view, allowing for rapid spectroscopic data collection from extended sources. Depending on the size of the extended source, combined with the spatial resolution and spectral dispersion of the instrument, there may be locations in the focal plane where spectral lines from different spatial locations overlap on the detector. An unfolding method is successfully developed and demonstrated on the recent rocket flight of the Marshall Grazing Incidence X-ray Spectrometer, which observed several strong emission lines in the 8–30 Å wavelength range from two X-ray bright points and a portion of an active region. In this paper, we present a systematic investigation of the parameters that control and optimize the inversion method for unfolding slitless spectrograph data.

<title>The Timing and Spectral Properties of the 2022 Outburst of SGR J1935+2154 Observed with NICER</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada936</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada936</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The magnetar SGR J1935+2154 entered a new active episode on 2022 October 10, with X-ray bursts and enhanced persistent emission. At the tail of a high burst rate interval, lasting several hours, radio bursts were detected, revealing the connection between the X-ray activities and radio emissions. We analyzed observations of SGR J1935+2154 for nearly 3 months, using data from the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer. We report the timing and spectral results following the onset of this outburst. In general, the X-ray flux of the persistent emission decays exponentially. While a flare is evident on the light curve, a fast radio burst (FRB) was detected immediately following the peak of this flare. We found a phase jump in the pulse profile, with a deviation of a 0.16 ± 0.03 phase, which is related to the glitch. The spectra are well fit with the combination of a blackbody and a power-law (PL) model. The decay of the outburst is dominated by the drop in the nonthermal component, which also leads to an increase in thermal proportion. The photon index of the PL is inversely correlated with both the unabsorbed flux and the burst rate. We find that unlike the large variety of the persistent emission around FRB 221014, the X-ray properties are very stable when FRBs 221021 and 221201 happened. These results manifest the connection between the glitch, phase jump, X-ray burst, and radio burst, crucial for studying the mutation in twisted magnetic fields and constraining the trigger mechanism of radio bursts.

<title>Modeling the Saddle-like GeV–TeV Spectrum of HESS J1809–193: Gamma Rays Arising from Reverse-shocked Pulsar Wind Nebula?</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada93e</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada93e</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The evolution of pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) could be expected to leave imprints in gamma rays. We suggest that the intriguing GeV–TeV spectral energy distribution (SED) of HESS J1809–193 and Fermi-LAT source J1810.3–1925e is very likely to be the gamma-ray signature of PWN J1809–193 in light of the scenario that the PWN was struck by the reverse shock of the parent supernova remnant. Based on the evolutionary theory of PWNe, we consider that, when the PWN was disrupted during a collision by the reverse shock, some VHE electrons escaped impulsively. The remaining electrons stayed in the relic PWN, which was displaced from the pulsar. The VHE part of the remaining electrons was depleted by the strong magnetic field that was enhanced by the reverse shock compression in the reverberation stage, leaving the other part of them generating GeV emission. The particles injected from the pulsar after the disruption enter the relic PWN through the newly formed tunnel called the cocoon. The gamma-ray emission from the escaped electrons can account for the TeV spectrum of component A of HESS J1809–193 or the TeV halo, while the electrons remaining after disruption can account for the GeV spectrum of J1810.3–1925e. Thus, the combination of contributions from these two populations of electrons naturally reproduces the saddle-like SED of HESS 1809–193 and J1810.3–1925e from 5 GeV to 30 TeV, together with the spectral hardening around 100 GeV. We also show that the post-disruption injection of electrons can explain the spectrum of the relatively faint gamma-ray emission of component B of HESS J1809–193.

<title>First Detection of Radio Emission from the Intermediate-mass Black Hole in POX 52: Deep Multiband Observations with ATCA and VLA</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada946</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the first multiband centimeter detection of POX 52, a nearby dwarf galaxy believed to harbor a robust intermediate-mass black hole. We conducted the deep observations using the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), spanning frequencies from 4.5 to 10 GHz, as well as the sensitive observations from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) operating in its most extended A configuration at S band (2–4 GHz) and C band (4–8 GHz). In the ATCA observations, the source shows a compact morphology, with only one direction marginally resolved. The higher resolution of the VLA allowed us to slightly resolve the source, fitting it well with a two-dimensional Gaussian model. The detected radio emission confirms the presence of active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, indicating either a low-power jet or AGN-driven winds/outflows. Our dual-epoch observations with ATCA and VLA, together with previous nondetection flux density upper limits, reveal radio emission variability spanning two decades. In addition, we find that POX 52 aligns well with the low-mass extension of the fundamental plane for high-accretion, radio-quiet massive AGNs.

<title>Delay of Near-relativistic Electrons with Respect to Type III Radio Bursts throughout the Inner Heliosphere</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Energetic electrons accelerated by solar eruptive events are frequently observed to have inferred injection times that appear significantly delayed with respect to electromagnetic emission including type III radio bursts. This is noteworthy because type III radio emission is produced by streaming suprathermal electrons, and thus this observed delay implies either a delayed injection/release of higher-energy electrons, compared with the suprathermal population, and/or a delay of the electrons observed in situ in transit through the interplanetary medium. A number of studies have investigated these delays with spacecraft located at 1 au. In this study, we examine energetic electron onsets and type III radio bursts observed by the Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun (IS⊙IS) and the FIELDS Radio Frequency Spectrometer instrument on Parker Solar Probe at a variety of heliocentric distances. With these observations, we can uniquely decouple the effects of acceleration and transport and shed light on the source of these delays. We present a survey of electron events observed by IS⊙IS within the first ∼6 yr of the mission, including their delays with respect to type III emission between ∼0.1 and 0.8 au. These results suggest that energetic electron delays with respect to type III radio bursts are not purely produced by a delayed injection/release as has been suggested, implying that transport processes play a role.

<title>Constraints on Relativistic Jets from the Fast X-Ray Transient 210423 Using Prompt Radio Follow-up Observations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Fast X-ray transients (FXTs) are a new observational class of phenomena with no clear physical origin. This is at least partially a consequence of limited multiwavelength follow-up of this class of transients in real time. Here we present deep optical (g- and i-band) photometry with Keck, and prompt radio observations with the Very Large Array of FXT 210423 obtained at δt ≈ 14–36 days since the X-ray trigger. We use these multiband observations, combined with publicly available data sets, to constrain the presence and physical properties of on-axis and off-axis relativistic jets such as those that can be launched by neutron star mergers and tidal disruption events, which are among the proposed theoretical scenarios of FXTs. Considering a wide range of possible redshifts z ≤ 3.5, circumstellar medium density n = 10−6–10−1 cm−3, and isotropic-equivalent jet kinetic energy Ek,iso = 1048–1055 erg, we find that we can rule out wide jets with opening angle θj = 15° viewed within 10° off-axis. For more collimated jets (θj = 3°) we can only rule out on-axis (θobs = 0°) orientations. This study highlights the constraining power of prompt multiwavelength observations of FXTs discovered in real time by current (e.g., Einstein Probe) and future facilities.

<title>Galaxies Lighting Up: Discovery of Seventy New Turn-on Changing-look Active Galactic Nuclei</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
“Changing-look active galactic nuclei” (CL AGN) show dramatic, rapid changes in optical/UV continuum and broad-line emission. The majority of CL AGN have been found dimming as “turn-off” CL AGN because most selection methods start from samples of spectroscopically confirmed quasars. We present here a sample of 82 spectroscopically confirmed “turn-on” CL AGN, 70 of which are newly identified. The turn-on CL AGN are selected from spectroscopically classified galaxies with subsequent significant and dramatic variability in both the optical and mid-infrared bands, indicating a mechanism of changing accretion rate of the supermassive black holes (BHs) rather than variable obscuration. Based on their bright state Eddington ratios, turn-on CL AGN are associated with lower accretion rates compared to turn-off CL AGN or typical Sloan Digital Sky Survey quasars with similar redshift and magnitude distributions, even though turn-on CL AGN have lower BH masses. Most turn-on CL AGN reside in host galaxies that follow local relations between the central BH mass and host galaxy properties, such as stellar mass and velocity dispersion. However, their host galaxies have higher mass than normal inactive galaxies, with star formation rates more similar to hosts of Type 2 AGN than to the overall galaxy population.

<title>Metallicity and α-abundance for 48 Million Stars in Low-extinction Regions in the Milky Way</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We estimate ([M/H], [α/M]) for 48 million giants and dwarfs in low-dust extinction regions from the Gaia DR3 XP spectra by using tree-based machine learning models trained on APOGEE DR17 and a metal-poor star sample from Li et al. The root mean square error of our estimation is 0.0890 dex for [M/H] and 0.0436 dex for [α/M], when we evaluate our models on the test data that are not used in training the models. Because the training data is dominated by giants, our estimation is most reliable for giants. The high-[α/M] stars and low-[α/M] stars selected by our ([M/H], [α/M]) show different kinematical properties for giants and low-temperature dwarfs. We further investigate how our machine learning models extract information on ([M/H], [α/M]). Intriguingly, we find that our models seem to extract information on [α/M] from Na D lines (589 nm) and Mg i line (516 nm). This result is understandable given the observed correlation between Na and Mg abundances in the literature. The catalog of ([M/H], [α/M]) as well as their associated uncertainties is publicly available.

<title>Statistics of the Interplanetary Magnetic Field from 0.1 to 30 au. I. Distribution Character</title>

This study investigates the directional and intensity distributions of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) across a heliocentric distance range of approximately 0.1–30 au. Measurements from multiple spacecraft reveal that these distributions align closely with the Parker spiral configuration in general. Nevertheless, the deviation from the model is significant and regular. To analyze these deviations, we organized the IMF observations based on the orientation and intensity predicted by the Parker model. The average angular deviation from the Parker spiral increases between 0.1 and 1 au, stabilizing from 1 to 30 au. The magnetic field components perpendicular to the Parker spiral are more likely to lay in the latitudinal and longitudinal directions during the solar maximum and minimum, respectively. The normalized intensity distribution follows a log-normal distribution, with its broadening positively correlated with increasing heliocentric distance. These characteristics cannot be fully attributed to Alfvénic fluctuations or the nonradial component near the potential field source surface. Instead, interactions of flux tubes in the outer heliosphere play a significant role in shaping the IMF. Our results provide a comprehensive assessment of the frequency with which planets encounter non-Parker upstream conditions.

<title>Assessing the Dark Matter Content of Two Quasar Host Galaxies at z ∼ 6 through Gas Kinematics</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We conduct a study of the gas kinematics of two quasar host galaxies at z ≳ 6 traced by the [C ii] emission line using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. By combining deep observations at both low and high resolution, we recover the diffuse emission, resolve its structure, and measure the rotation curves from the inner region of the galaxy to its outskirts using DysmalPy and 3DBarolo. Assuming that both galaxies exhibit disk rotation driven by the gravitational potential of the galaxy, we find that the best-fit disk models have a Vrot/σ ≈ 2 and inferred circular velocities out to ∼6–8 kpc scales, well beyond the likely stellar distribution. We then determine the mass profiles of each component (stars, gas, dark matter) with priors on the baryon and dark matter properties. We find relatively large dark matter fractions within their effective radii (fDM(R < Re) = and , respectively), which are significantly larger than those extrapolated from lower redshift studies and remain robust under different input parameters verified by Monte Carlo simulations. The large fDM(R < Re) corresponds to halo masses of ∼1012.5−1012.8M⊙, thus representative of the most massive halos at these redshifts. Notably, while the masses of these supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are approximately 1 dex higher than the low-redshift relationship with stellar mass, the closer alignment of SMBH and halo masses with a local relationship may indicate that the early formation of these SMBHs is linked to their dark matter halos, providing insights into the coevolution of galaxies and black holes in the early Universe.

<title>Magnetic Fields in Massive Star-forming Regions (MagMaR): The Magnetic Field at the Onset of High-mass Star Formation</title>

A complete understanding of the initial conditions of high-mass star formation and what processes determine multiplicity requires the study of the magnetic field in young massive cores. Using Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) 250 GHz polarization observations (0 3 = 1000 au) and ALMA 220 GHz high-angular-resolution observations (0 05 = 160 au), we have performed a full energy analysis including the magnetic field at core scales and have assessed what influences the multiplicity inside a massive core previously believed to be in the prestellar phase. With a mass of 31 M⊙, the G11.92 MM2 core has a young CS molecular outflow with a dynamical timescale of a few thousand years. At high resolution, the MM2 core fragments into a binary system, with a projected separation of 505 au and a binary mass ratio of 1.14. Using the Davis–Chandrasekhar–Fermi method with an angle dispersion function analysis, we estimate in this core a magnetic field strength of 6.2 mG and a mass-to-magnetic-flux ratio of 18. The MM2 core is strongly subvirialized, with a virial parameter of 0.064, including the magnetic field. The high mass-to-magnetic-flux ratio and low virial parameter indicate that this massive core is very likely undergoing runaway collapse, which is in direct contradiction with the core accretion model. The MM2 core is embedded in a filament that has a velocity gradient consistent with infall. In line with clump-fed scenarios, the core can grow in mass at a rate of 1.9–5.6 × 10−4M⊙ yr−1. In spite of the magnetic field having only a minor contribution to the total energy budget at core scales (a few thousands of astronomical units), it likely plays a more important role at smaller scales (a few hundreds of astronomical units) by setting the binary properties. Considering energy ratios and a fragmentation criterion at the core scale, the binary system could have been formed by core fragmentation. The binary system properties (projected separation and mass ratio), however, are also consistent with radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations with super-Alfvenic or supersonic (or sonic) turbulence that form binaries by disk fragmentation.

<title>Insights into the Properties of Type Ibn/Icn Supernovae and Their Progenitor Channels through X-Ray Emission</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Type Ibn/Icn supernovae (SNe Ibn/Icn), which are characterized by narrow helium or carbon lines that originated in hydrogen-poor dense circumstellar medium (CSM), provide new insights into the final evolution of massive stars. While SNe Ibn/Icn are expected to emit strong X-rays through the strong supernova (SN)-CSM interaction, the X-ray emission modeling effort has been limited so far. In the present study, we provide broad-band X-ray light curve (LC) predictions for SNe Ibn/Icn. We find that the soft X-ray LC provides information about the CSM compositions, while the hard X-ray LC is a robust measure of the CSM density, the explosion energy, and the ejecta mass. In addition, considering the evolution of the ionization state in the unshocked CSM, a bright soft X-ray is expected in the first few days since the explosion, which encourages rapid X-ray follow-up observations as a tool to study the nature of SNe Ibn/Icn. Applying our model to the soft X-ray LCs of SNe Ibn 2006jc and 2022ablq, we derive that the CSM potentially contains a larger fraction of carbon and oxygen for SN 2006jc than 2022ablq, highlighting the power of the soft X-ray modeling to address the nature of the CSM. We also discuss detectability and observational strategy, with which the currently operating telescopes such as NuSTAR and Swift can offer an irreplaceable opportunity to explore the nature of these enigmatic rapid transients and their still-unclarified progenitor channel(s).

<title>Striking a Chord with Spectral Sirens: Multiple Features in the Compact Binary Population Correlate with H 0</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9de7</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Spectral siren measurements of the Hubble constant (H0) rely on correlations between observed detector-frame masses and luminosity distances. Features in the source-frame mass distribution can induce these correlations. It is crucial, then, to understand (i) which features in the source-frame mass distribution are robust against model (re)parameterization, (ii) which features carry the most information about H0, and (iii) whether distinct features independently correlate with cosmological parameters. We study these questions using real gravitational-wave observations from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaborations' third observing run. Although constraints on H0 are weak, we find that current data reveals several prominent features in the mass distribution, including peaks in the binary black hole source-frame mass distribution near ∼9M⊙ and ∼32M⊙ and a roll-off at masses above ∼46M⊙. For the first time using real data, we show that all of these features carry cosmological information and that the peak near ∼32M⊙ consistently correlates with H0 most strongly. Introducing model-independent summary statistics, we show that these statistics independently correlate with H0, exactly what is required to limit systematics within future spectral siren measurements from the (expected) astrophysical evolution of the mass distribution.

<title>Chasing the Beginning of Reionization in the JWST Era</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Recent JWST observations at z > 6 may imply galactic ionizing photon production above prior expectations. Under observationally motivated assumptions about escape fractions, these suggest a z ~ 8–9 end to reionization, in tension with the z < 6 end required by the Lyα forest. In this work, we use radiative transfer simulations to understand what different observations tell us about when reionization ended and when it started. We consider a model that ends too early (zend ≈ 8) alongside two more realistic scenarios with zend ≈ 5: one starting late (z ~ 9) and another early (z ~ 13). We find that the latter requires up to an order-of-magnitude evolution in galaxy ionizing properties at 6 < z < 12, perhaps in tension with measurements of ξion by JWST, which indicate little evolution. We study how these models compare to recent measurements of the Lyα forest opacity, mean free path, intergalactic medium thermal history, visibility of z > 8 Lyα emitters, and the patchy kSZ signal from the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We find that neither of the late-ending scenarios is strongly disfavored by any single data set. However, a majority of observables, spanning several distinct types of observations, prefer a late start. Not all probes agree with this conclusion, hinting at a possible lack of concordance arising from deficiencies in observations and/or theoretical modeling. Observations by multiple experiments (including JWST, Roman, and CMB-S4) in the coming years will establish a concordance picture of reionization's beginning or uncover such deficiencies.

<title>Late-time Optical and X-Ray Emission Evolution of the Oxygen-rich SN 1996cr</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada15b</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
When the ejecta of a supernova (SN) interact with the progenitor star's circumstellar environment, a strong shock is driven back into the ejecta, causing the material to become bright optically and in X-rays. Most notably, as the shock traverses the H-rich envelope, it begins to interact with metal-rich material. Thus, continued monitoring of bright and nearby SNe provides valuable clues about both the progenitor structure and its pre-SN evolution. Here we present late-time, multiepoch optical and Chandra X-ray spectra of the core-collapse SN, SN 1996cr. Magellan IMACS optical spectra taken in 2017 July and 2021 August show a very different spectrum from that seen in 2006 with broad, double-peaked optical emission lines of oxygen, argon, and sulfur with expansion velocities of ±4500 km s−1. Redshifted emission components are considerably fainter compared to the blueshifted components, presumably due to internal extinction from dust in the SN ejecta. Broad ±2400 km s−1 Hα is also seen, which we infer is shocked progenitor pre-SN, mass-loss, H-rich material. Chandra data indicate a slow but steady decline in the overall X-ray luminosity, suggesting that the forward shock has broken through any circumstellar shell or torus, which is inferred from prior deep Chandra ACIS-S/HETG observations. The X-ray properties are consistent with what is expected from a shock breaking out into a lower-density environment. Though originally identified as a Type IIn SN, based upon late-time optical emission-line spectra, we argue that the SN 1996cr progenitor was partially or highly stripped, suggesting a Type IIb/Ib SN.

<title>Fermi Unassociated Sources in the MeerKAT Absorption Line Survey</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Over 2000 γ-ray sources identified by the Large Area Telescope on NASA's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope are considered unassociated, meaning that they have no known counterparts in any other frequency regime. We have carried out an image-based search for steep spectrum radio sources, with in-band spectral index < −1.4, within the error regions of Fermi unassociated sources using 1–1.4 GHz radio data from the MeerKAT Absorption Line Survey (MALS) data release. The first MALS data release with a median rms noise of 22–25 μJy and 735,649 sources is a significant advance over past image-based searches with improvements in sensitivity, resolution, and bandwidth. Steep spectrum candidates were identified using a combination of in-band spectral indices from MALS and existing radio surveys. We developed an optical and infrared source classification scheme in order to distinguish between Galactic pulsars and radio galaxies. In total, we identify nine pulsar candidates toward six Fermi sources that are worthy of follow-up for pulsation searches. We also report 41 steep spectrum radio galaxy candidates that may be of interest in searches for high-redshift radio galaxies. We show that MALS, due to its excellent continuum sensitivity, can detect 80% of the known pulsar population. This exhibits the promise of identifying exotic pulsar candidates with future image-based surveys with the Square Kilometre Array and its precursors.

<title>Associations between Scattering Screens and Interstellar Medium Filaments</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Pulsar scintillation can be used to measure small-scale structure in the Galaxy, but little is known about the specific interstellar medium (ISM) features that cause scintillation. We searched for ISM counterparts to all scintillation screens for which absolute distances and scattering orientations have been measured—a sample of 12 pulsars and 22 screens. For one pulsar, PSR J0737–3039A, we reanalyze its scintillation screen and find evidence for a highly anisotropic screen. Comparisons with tracers of ionized media did not find any new associations. Instead, for seven of the pulsars analyzed, aligned H i filaments are seen for at least one of their screens, for a total of 12 out of 22 screens. This result seems unlikely to be due to chance: Comparing with random trials, we estimate a likelihood of finding 12 or more screens with aligned emission by chance of only 0.004%. Estimating the significance of the amount of aligned emission (in standard deviations over the mean), the probability of finding as much observed aligned emission by chance is larger, at 1.7%, but still indicative of a real correlation. Since H i filaments are preferentially associated with cold neutral gas, and thus unlikely to cause scintillation, this may indicate that both the filaments and the screens are aligned preferentially by the same mechanisms, such as magnetic fields or shocks.

<title>Neutrino-dominated Relativistic Viscous Accretion Flows around Rotating Black Holes with Shocks</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We investigate the relativistic, viscous, advective neutrino-dominated accretion flows (NDAFs) around rotating stellar-mass black holes, incorporating neutrino cooling. By adopting an effective potential to describe the spacetime geometry around the rotating black holes, we self-consistently solve the governing NDAF equations to obtain global transonic accretion solutions. Our findings indicate that, depending on the model parameters, namely, energy (ε), angular momentum (λ), accretion rate ( ), viscosity (α), and black hole spin (ak), NDAFs may harbor standing shocks where the Rankine–Hugoniot shock conditions are satisfied. Utilizing these shock-induced NDAF solutions, we compute the neutrino luminosity (Lν) and neutrino annihilation luminosity ( ) across a wide range of model parameters. We further calculate maximum neutrino luminosity ( ) and neutrino annihilation luminosity ( ), resulting in erg s−1 (1048−51 erg s−1) and erg s−1 (1042−49 erg s−1) for ak = 0.99 (0.0). These findings suggest that shocked NDAF solutions are potentially promising to explain the energy output of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We employ our NDAF model formalism to elucidate for five GRBs with known redshifts and estimate their accretion rate ( ) based on the spin (ak) of the central source of the GRBs studied here.

<title>Deciphering Gas Dynamics and Star Formation in a z = 1.1 Main-sequence Spiral Galaxy with ALMA and JWST</title>

We present a joint analysis of high-resolution CO(2–1) and Paschen-α (Paα) emission lines to trace gas dynamics and spatially resolved star formation in ASPECS-LP.3 mm.06, a z = 1.1 main-sequence galaxy. Utilizing data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and JWST NIRCam wide field slitless spectroscopy, we explore both ionized gas and molecular gas within this galaxy. With a substantial molecular gas fraction (fmol = 0.44 ± 0.02), ASPECS-LP.3 mm.06 remains on the star-forming main sequence and adheres to the Kennicutt–Schmidt relation, indicating typical gas-to-star conversion efficiency. Our analysis reveals extended structures across multiple wavelengths, suggesting regulated star formation within a stable disk. The spatially resolved star formation efficiency and kinematic analysis indicate that ASPECS-LP.3mm.06 features a smooth mass assembly process across the bulge and disk. Additionally, the galaxy exhibits modest dust extinction (AV = 0.8), potentially linked to self-regulation during bulge formation. These findings position ASPECS-LP.3mm.06 as a prototypical galaxy, offering valuable insights into the mechanisms governing normal disk galaxy growth at z ∼ 1.

<title>GD-1 Stellar Stream and Cocoon in the DESI Early Data Release</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada690</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present ∼115 new spectroscopically identified members of the GD-1 tidal stream observed with the 5000-fiber Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We confirm the existence of a “cocoon,” which is a broad (FWHM ∼ 2 932 ∼ 460 pc) and kinematically hot (velocity dispersion, σ ∼ 5–8 km s−1) component that surrounds a narrower (FWHM ∼ 0 353 ∼ 55 pc) and colder [(σ = 3.09 ± 0.76 km s−1)] thin stream component (based on a median per star velocity precision of 2.7 km s−1). The cocoon extends over at least a 30∘ segment of the stream observed by DESI. The thin and cocoon components have similar mean values of [Fe/H]: −2.54 ± 0.04 dex and −2.47 ± 0.06 dex, suggestive of a common origin. The data are consistent with the following scenarios for the origin of the cocoon. The progenitor of the GD-1 stream was an accreted globular cluster (GC) and: (a) the cocoon was produced by pre-accretion tidal stripping of the GC while it was still inside its parent dwarf galaxy; (b) the cocoon comprises debris from the parent dwarf galaxy; (c) an initially thin GC tidal stream was heated by impacts from dark subhalos in the Milky Way; (d) an initially thin GC stream was heated by a massive Sagittarius dwarf galaxy; or a combination of some of these. Future DESI spectroscopy and detailed modeling may enable us to distinguish between these possible origins.

<title>Differentiating the Acceleration Mechanisms in the Slow and Alfvénic Slow Solar Wind</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In the corona, plasma is accelerated to hundreds of kilometers per second and heated to temperatures hundreds of times hotter than the Sun's surface before it escapes to form the solar wind. Decades of space-based experiments have shown that the energization process does not stop after it escapes. Instead, the solar wind continues to accelerate, and it cools far more slowly than a freely expanding adiabatic gas. Recent work suggests that fast solar wind requires additional momentum beyond what can be provided by the observed thermal pressure gradients alone, whereas it is sufficient for the slowest wind. The additional acceleration for fast wind can be provided through an Alfvén wave pressure gradient. Beyond this fast/slow categorization, however, a subset of slow solar wind exhibits high Alfvénicity that suggests that Alfvén waves could play a larger role in its acceleration compared to conventional slow wind outflows. Through a well-timed conjunction between Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe (PSP), we trace the energetics of slow wind to compare with a neighboring Alfvénic slow solar wind stream. An analysis that integrates remote and heliospheric properties and modeling of the two distinct solar wind streams finds that Alfvénic slow solar wind behaves like fast wind, where a wave pressure gradient is required to reconcile its full acceleration, while non-Alfvénic slow wind can be driven by its nonadiabatic electron and proton thermal pressure gradients. Derived coronal conditions of the source region indicate good model compatibility, but extended coronal observations are required to effectively trace solar wind energetics below PSP's orbit.

<title>Determination of the Analytical Solutions of the Radio Emission Geometry and Polar Cap Structure of Pulsars Having Perturbed Dipole</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We model an analytical solution to generate the shape of the polar cap structure and discuss the geometrical distortion due to the presence of both longitudinal plasma current flow across the polar cap regime, i.e., polar cap current perturbation, and pulsar rotation, i.e., rotational perturbation. An analytical solution to the parameter space associated with the radio emission geometrical coordinate is produced by using the first- and second-order power series expansion method for the rotationally perturbed dipole case. In general, polar caps show a quasi-elliptical shape, but in the presence of higher-order plasma current our results show that they can be converted into an elliptical structure with a monotonically reduced dimension. Our results show that the rotational effect also leads to a contraction of the dimensions of the polar cap for a given range of the obliquity parameters. We have found that the last open field line constant, as a fraction of the light cylinder radius, decreases in the presence of nonzero plasma current discharge. We also demonstrate that under certain conditions introducing a higher-order plasma current (e.g., with a scale factor ζp = J/JGJ close to 1 in the closed field line region) can lead to a structure resembling a cosmic-combed magnetosphere.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Understanding the nonlinear properties in accreting systems, particularly for black holes, from observation is illuminating as they are expected to be general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic flows that are nonlinear. Two commonly used features associated with nonlinear systems are chaos, which is deterministic, and randomness, which is stochastic. The differentiation between chaotic and stochastic systems is often considered to quantify the nonlinear properties of an astrophysical system. Particular emphasis is given to the fact that data are often noise contaminated and finite. We examine the dual nature of the black hole X-ray binary IGR J17091–3624, whose behavior has been closely studied in parallel to GRS 1915+105. Certain similarities in the temporal classes of these two objects have been explored in the literature. However, this has not been the case with their nonlinear dynamics: GRS 1915+105 shows signs of both determinism and stochasticity, while IGR J17091–3624 was found to be predominantly stochastic. Here, we confront the inherent challenge of noise contamination faced by previous studies, particularly Poisson noise, which adversely impacts the reliability of nonlinear results. We employ several denoising techniques to mitigate noise effects, and employ methods like principal component analysis, singular value decomposition, and correlation integrals to isolate the deterministic signatures. We find signs of determinism in IGR J17091–3624, thus supporting the hypothesis of it being similar to GRS 1915+105, even as a dynamical system. Our findings not only shed light on the complex nature of IGR J17091–3624 but also pave the way for future research employing noise-reduction techniques to analyze nonlinearity in observed dynamical systems.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We investigate the measurement correlation between the effective spin and the effective tidal deformability in gravitational-wave signals from binary neutron star mergers. To efficiently measure the effective tidal deformability parameter, we exploit the fact that the tidal effects in a binary system are prominent when the components are closer, during the late inspiral. Thus, we indicate a computationally efficient strategy of extracting the tidal information compressed within the seconds before the merger. We report our observations for GW170817 and explore the suitability of our approach for the upcoming observation scenarios of the current and future ground-based observatories. Fast and accurate measurements of the tidal deformability parameters can be used to inform astronomers when prioritizing the electromagnetic follow-up efforts for such sources.

Nanoflares are believed to be key contributors to heating solar nonflaring active regions, though their individual detection remains challenging. This study uses a data-driven field-aligned hydrodynamic model to examine nanoflare properties throughout the lifecycle of active region (AR) 12758. We simulate coronal loop emissions, where each loop is heated by random nanoflares depending on the loop parameters derived from photospheric magnetograms observed by the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager. Simulated X-ray flux and temperature can reproduce the temporal variations observed by the Chandrayaan-2/Solar X-ray Monitor. Our findings show that high-frequency nanoflares contribute to cool emissions across the AR, while low- and intermediate-frequency primarily contribute to hot emissions. During the emerging phase, energy deposition is dominated by low-frequency events. Post-emergence, energy is deposited by both low- and intermediate-frequency nanoflares, while as the AR ages, the contribution from intermediate- and high-frequency nanoflares increases. The spatial distribution of heating frequencies across the AR reveals a clear pattern: the core of the active region spends most of its time in a low-frequency heating state, the periphery is dominated by high-frequency heating, and the region between the core and periphery experiences intermediate-frequency heating.

The UltraViolet Imaging of the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey Fields (UVCANDELS) survey is a Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Cycle-26 Treasury Program, allocated in total 164 orbits of primary Wide-Field Camera 3 Ultraviolet and VISible light F275W imaging with coordinated parallel Advanced Camera for Surveys F435W imaging, on four of the five premier extragalactic survey fields: GOODS-N, GOODS-S, EGS, and COSMOS. We introduce this survey by presenting a comprehensive analysis of the absolute escape fraction ( ) of Lyman continuum radiation through stacking the UV images of a population of star-forming galaxies with secure redshifts at 2.4 ≤ z ≤ 3.0. Our stacking benefits from the catalogs of high-quality spectroscopic redshifts compiled from archival ground-based data and HST slitless spectroscopy, carefully vetted by dedicated visual inspection efforts. We develop a robust stacking method to apply to 10 samples of in total 56 galaxies, and perform detailed Monte Carlo simulations of the intergalactic medium (IGM) attenuation, to take into account the sample variance of the mean IGM transmission when measuring . The full stack at z ≈ 2.44 from 28 galaxies places a stringent 1σ upper limit of , whereas the full stack at z ≈ 2.72 of an equal number of galaxies gives an upper limit of at 1σ confidence level. These new F275W and F435W imaging mosaics from UVCANDELS have been made publicly available on the Barbara A. Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes.

<title>Unraveling the Kinematic and Morphological Evolution of the Small Magellanic Cloud</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada55f</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada55f</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We model the kinematics of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) by analyzing the proper motions (PMs) from Gaia DR3 of nine different stellar populations, including young main-sequence (MS) stars (<2 Gyr), red giant branch stars, red clump stars, red giants with line-of-sight velocities, and three groups of star clusters. This analysis is carried out using a robust Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, to derive up to seven kinematic parameters. We trace the evolution from a nonrotating flattened elliptical system, as mapped by the old population, to a rotating highly stretched disk structure, as denoted by the young MS stars and clusters (<400 Myr). We estimate that the inclination i (∼58°–82°) decreases and the position angle Θ (∼180°–240°) increases with age. We estimate an asymptotic velocity of ∼49–89 km s−1 with a scale radius of ∼6–9 kpc for the young MS populations, with velocity dispersion of ∼11 km s−1, suggesting a rotation-supported disk structure. Our models estimate a line-of-sight extension of ∼30 kpc, in agreement with observations. We identify four regions of the SMC showing anomalies in the residual PM: the East Anomaly, the Southeast Anomaly (SEA), the South Anomaly, and the West Anomaly. The SEA appears like an infalling feature and is identified for the first time. The tidal imprints observed in the residual PM of the SMC suggest that its evolution is considerably shaped by the recent interaction with the Large Magellanic Cloud.

<title>The Effects of Active Galactic Nuclei Feedback on the Lyα Forest Flux Power Spectrum</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada5f7</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada5f7</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We study the effects of active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback on the Lyα forest 1D flux power spectrum (P1D). Using the Simba cosmological-hydrodynamic simulations, we examine the impact that adding different AGN feedback modes has on the predicted P1D. We find that, for Simba, the impact of AGN feedback is most dramatic at lower redshifts (z < 1) and that AGN jet feedback plays the most significant role in altering the P1D. The effects of AGN feedback can be seen across a large range of wavenumbers (1.5 × 10−3 < k < 10−1 s km−1) changing the ionization state of hydrogen in the IGM through heating. AGN feedback can also alter the thermal evolution of the IGM and thermally broaden individual Lyα absorbers. For the Simba model, these effects become observable at z ≲ 1.0. At higher redshifts (z > 2.0), AGN feedback has a 2% effect on the P1D for k < 5 × 10−2 s km−1 and an 8% effect for k > 5 × 10−2 s km−1. We show that the small-scale effect is reduced when normalizing the simulation to the observed mean flux. On large scales, the effect of AGN feedback appears via a change in the IGM temperature and is thus unlikely to bias cosmological parameters. The strong AGN jets in the Simba simulation can reproduce the z > 2 Lyα forest. We stress that analyses comparing different AGN feedback models to future higher precision data will be necessary to determine the full extent of this effect.

<title>MAGICS. II. Seed Black Holes Stripped of Their Surrounding Stars Do Not Sink</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada283</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada283</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Massive black hole (MBH) seed mergers are expected to be among the loudest sources of gravitational waves detected by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, providing a unique window into the birth and early growth of MBHs. We present the MAGICS-II simulation suite, which consists of six galaxy mergers that result in MBH seed mergers identified in the cosmological simulation ASTRID. With the enhanced resolution (mass resolution: 500 M⊙; softening length: 5 pc), improved subgrid models for the MBH dynamics and accretion, and the accurate regularized gravity integrator included in KETJU, we trace MBH seed dynamics down to 0.1 pc. After evolving all the systems for ≈1.2 Gyr in three stages (MAGICS-2000, MAGICS-500, and MAGICS-K), we find in four of the six systems that the MBHs stall at separations Δr ≳ 200 pc. Only in two systems, the MBHs manage to sink further, and only in one of them a bound binary forms. In the sinking systems, the MBH retains a population of bound stars. The final separation between the MBH is related to the surrounding unstripped stellar (and/or dark matter) mass: if more than 90% of the surrounding stellar system is stripped away, the MBHs stall. Besides the unstripped stars from the original host galaxy, we find that newly formed stars bound to the MBH significantly contribute to its sinking. Resolving the stellar system around MBH seeds, and its induced tidal interactions and dynamical friction is key for accurately capturing MBH dynamics. For this, high-resolution simulations are required. In a companion paper (MAGICS-III), we resimulate the central regions of these systems with an increased resolution to model directly the effects of actual star clusters around MBHs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Very Large Array (VLA) observations of 18 cm OH absorption lines were used to determine the strength of the line-of-sight magnetic field in the Galactic center region. This study is an extension of the VLA OH Zeeman observations of Killeen et al. with fourfold the on-source integration time and twice the sensitivity to the Zeeman effect. The new data fail to confirm the 7σ Zeeman detections of 2 mG fields reported in the earlier work. Also, we cannot reproduce these reported detections from our own analysis of archival data of the earlier work. We find no certain detections of the OH Zeeman effect in the Galactic center region. Our results suggest magnetic fields of no more than about a milligauss in the sampled regions.

<title>Mapping the Active Galactic Nucleus Effects on the Stellar and Gas Properties of NGC 5806</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
It is commonly accepted that active galactic nuclei (AGNs) have a strong impact upon the evolution of their host galaxies, but the processes by which they do so are not fully understood. We aim to further the understanding of AGN feeding and feedback by examining an active galaxy using spatially resolved spectroscopy. We analyze integral field spectroscopy of the active galaxy NGC 5806, obtained using the Very Large Telescope Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer. We map the dynamics of gas and stars, as well as gas optical emission line fluxes throughout the central 8 × 8 kpc2 of the galaxy. We use emission line ratios to map gas metallicity and identify regions of gas excitation dominated by AGN/shocks or star formation. We also determine the average stellar population age and metallicity, and model the rotation and dynamics of the galaxy. We find that NGC 5806 has a star-forming circumnuclear ring, with a projected radius of ~400 pc. The dynamics of this galaxy are driven by a large-scale bar, which transports gas from the spiral arm to the central ring and potentially fuels the AGN. We also observe AGN-dominated gas excitation up to 3.3 kpc away from the center of the galaxy, showing the extended AGN effect on the gas in the central regions of the galaxy.

<title>TransformerPayne: Enhancing Spectral Emulation Accuracy and Data Efficiency by Capturing Long-range Correlations</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9b99</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Stellar spectra emulators often rely on large grids and tend to reach a plateau in emulation accuracy, leading to significant systematic errors when inferring stellar properties. Our study explores the use of Transformer models to capture long-range information in spectra, comparing their performance to the Payne emulator (a fully connected multilayer perceptron), an expanded version of The Payne, and a convolutional-based emulator. We tested these models on synthetic spectral grids, evaluating their performance by analyzing emulation residuals and assessing the quality of spectral parameter inference. The newly introduced TransformerPayne emulator outperformed all other tested models, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of approximately 0.15% when trained on the full grid. The most significant improvements were observed in grids containing between 1000 and 10,000 spectra, with TransformerPayne showing 2–5 times better performance than the scaled-up version of The Payne. Additionally, TransformerPayne demonstrated superior fine-tuning capabilities, allowing for pretraining on one spectral model grid before transferring to another. This fine-tuning approach enabled up to a 10-fold reduction in training grid size compared to models trained from scratch. Analysis of TransformerPayne's attention maps revealed that they encode interpretable features common across many spectral lines of chosen elements. While scaling up The Payne to a larger network reduced its MAE from 1.2% to 0.3% when trained on the full data set, TransformerPayne consistently achieved the lowest MAE across all tests. The inductive biases of the TransformerPayne emulator enhance accuracy, data efficiency, and interpretability for spectral emulation compared to existing methods.

<title>Progenitor Diversity in the Accreted Stellar Halos of Milky Way–like Galaxies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Ongoing large stellar spectroscopic surveys of the Milky Way seek to reconstruct the major events in the assembly history of the Galaxy. Chemical and kinematic observations can be used to separate the contributions of different progenitor galaxies to the present-day stellar halo. Here, we compute the number of progenitors that contribute to the accreted stellar halos of simulated Milky Way–like galaxies as a function of radius (the radial diversity) in three suites of models: Bullock & Johnston, Aquarius, and Auriga. We show that there are significant differences between the predictions of these three models, beyond the halo-to-halo scatter expected in ΛCDM. Predictions of diversity from numerical simulations are sensitive to model-dependent assumptions regarding the efficiency of star formation in dwarf galaxies. We compare, at face value, to current constraints on the radial diversity of the Milky Way's accreted halo. These constraints imply that the halo of our Galaxy is dominated by ∼2 progenitors in the range 8–45 kpc, in contrast to averages of 7 progenitors in the Bullock & Johnston models, 3.5 in Aquarius, and 4.2 in Auriga over the same region. We additionally find that the models with radial diversity most similar to that of the Milky Way are predominantly those with ongoing merger events. The Milky Way therefore appears unusual in having an accreted stellar halo dominated by a small number of progenitors accreted at very early times.

<title>AEOS: Transport of Metals from Minihalos following Population III Stellar Feedback</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada3c1</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada3c1</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We investigate how stellar feedback from the first stars (Population III) distributes metals through the interstellar and intergalactic medium using the star-by-star cosmological hydrodynamics simulation, Aeos. We find that energy injected from the supernovae (SNe) of the first stars is enough to expel a majority of gas and injected metals beyond the virial radius of halos with mass Mdm ≲ 107M⊙, regardless of the number of SNe. This prevents self-enrichment and results in a nonmonotonic increase in metallicity at early times. Most minihalos (Mdm ≳ 105M⊙) do not retain significant fractions of the yields produced within their virial radii until they have grown to halo masses of Mdm ≳ 107M⊙. The loss of metals to regions well beyond the virial radius delays the onset of enriched star formation and extends the period that Population III star formation can persist. We also explore the contributions of different nucleosynthetic channels to 10 individual elements. On the timescale of the simulation (lowest redshift z = 14.3), enrichment is dominated by core-collapse supernovae for all elements, but with a significant contribution from asymptotic giant branch winds to the s-process elements, which are normally thought to only be important at late times. In this work, we establish important mechanisms for early chemical enrichment, which allows us to apply Aeos in later epochs to trace the evolution of enrichment during the complete transition from Population III to Population II stars.

<title>Quantifying Baryonic Feedback on the Warm–Hot Circumgalactic Medium in CAMELS Simulations</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada442</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The baryonic physics shaping galaxy formation and evolution are complex, spanning a vast range of scales and making them challenging to model. Cosmological simulations rely on subgrid models that produce significantly different predictions. Understanding how models of stellar and active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback affect baryon behavior across different halo masses and redshifts is essential. Using the SIMBA and IllustrisTNG suites from the Cosmology and Astrophysics with MachinE Learning Simulations (CAMELS) project, we explore the effect of parameters governing the subgrid implementation of stellar and AGN feedback. We find that while IllustrisTNG shows higher cumulative feedback energy across all halos, SIMBA demonstrates a greater spread of baryons, quantified by the closure radius and circumgalactic medium (CGM) gas fraction. This suggests that feedback in SIMBA couples more effectively to baryons and drives them more efficiently within the host halo. There is evidence that the different feedback modes are highly interrelated in these subgrid models. The parameters controlling the stellar feedback efficiency significantly impact AGN feedback, as seen in the suppression of black hole mass growth and delayed activation of AGN feedback to higher-mass halos with increasing stellar feedback efficiency in both simulations. Additionally, the AGN feedback efficiency parameters affect the CGM gas fraction at low halo masses in SIMBA, hinting at complex, nonlinear interactions between the AGN and supernova feedback modes. Overall, we demonstrate that stellar and AGN feedback are intimately interwoven, especially at low redshift, due to subgrid implementation, resulting in halo property effects that might initially seem counterintuitive.

<title>ALMA Observations of Solar Spicules in a Polar Coronal Hole</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada445</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report observations of solar spicules at millimeter wavelengths (mm-λ) using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). These are supplemented by observations in optical, ultraviolet (UV), and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wavelengths. The observations were made on 2018 December 25 of the northern polar coronal hole. ALMA obtained time-resolved imaging observations at wavelengths of 3 mm (100 GHz; 2 s cadence) and 1.25 mm (239 GHz; ≈2 minutes cadence) with an angular resolution of 2 2 × 1 3 and 1 5 × 0 7, respectively. Spicules observed at mm-λ are easily seen low in the chromosphere whereas spicules in UV bands are seen to extend higher. The spicules observed at mm-λ are seen in absorption against coronal EUV emission, allowing us to estimate the column depth of neutral hydrogen. Spicular emission at mm-λ, due to thermal free–free radiation, allows us to estimate the electron number density as a function of height. We find that spicule densities, inferred from the mm-λ data are uniquely insensitive to assumptions regarding the temperature of plasma in spicules. We suggest that the upward mass flux carried by spicules is unlikely to play a significant role in the mass budget of the solar corona and solar wind, and the transport of hot material into the corona by spicules may not play a significant role in coronal heating. However, the possibility that electric currents, fast kink and torsional waves, or other wave modes carried by spicules may play a role in transporting energy into the solar corona cannot be excluded.

<title>Black Hole Supernovae, Their Equation of State Dependence, and Ejecta Composition</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Recent literature on core-collapse supernovae suggests that a black hole (BH) can form within ∼1 s of shock revival, while still culminating in a successful supernova. We refer to these as BH supernovae, as they are distinct from other BH formation channels in both timescale and impact on the explosion. We simulate these events self-consistently from core collapse until 20–50 days after collapse using three axisymmetric models of a 60 M⊙ zero-age main-sequence progenitor star and investigate how the composition of the ejecta is impacted by the BH formation. We employ Skyrme-type equations of state (EOSs) and vary the uncertain nucleonic effective mass, which affects the pressure inside the proto–neutron star through the thermal part of the EOS. This results in different BH formation times and explosion energies at BH formation, yielding final explosion energies between 0.06 and 0.72 × 1051 erg with 21.8–23.3 M⊙ of ejecta, of which 0–0.018 M⊙ is 56Ni. Compared to expectations from 1D simulations, we find more nuanced EOS dependences of the explosion dynamics, the mass of the BH remnant, and the elemental composition of the ejecta. We investigate why the explosions survive despite the massive overburden and link the shape of the diagnostic energy curve and character of the ejecta evolution to the progenitor structure.

<title>Exploring Magnetic Fields in Molecular Clouds through Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Accurately measuring magnetic field strength in the interstellar medium, including giant molecular clouds, remains a significant challenge. We present a machine learning approach using denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) to estimate magnetic field strength from synthetic observables such as column density, orientation angles of the dust continuum polarization vector, and line-of-sight (LOS) nonthermal velocity dispersion. We trained three versions of the DDPM model: the 1-channel DDPM (using only column density), the 2-channel DDPM (incorporating both column density and polarization angles), and the 3-channel DDPM (which combines column density, polarization angles, and LOS nonthermal velocity dispersion). The code and trained model are available on GitHub at https://github.com/xuduo117/DDPM_Bmag. We assessed the models on both synthetic test samples and new simulation data that were outside the training set's distribution. The 3-channel DDPM consistently outperformed both the other DDPM variants and the power-law fitting approach based on column density alone, demonstrating its robustness in handling previously unseen data. Additionally, we compared the performance of the Davis–Chandrasekhar–Fermi (DCF) methods, both classical and modified, to the DDPM predictions. The classical DCF method overestimated the magnetic field strength by approximately an order of magnitude. Although the modified DCF method showed improvement over the classical version, it still fell short of the precision achieved by the 3-channel DDPM.

<title>Long-term Evolution of Sco X-1: Implications for the Current Spin Frequency and Ellipticity of the Neutron Star</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Sco X-1 is the brightest observed extrasolar X-ray source, which is a neutron star (NS) low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) and is thought to have a strong potential for continuous gravitational waves (CW) detection due to its high accretion rate and relative proximity. Here, we compute the long-term evolution of its parameters, particularly the NS spin frequency (ν) and the surface magnetic field (B), to probe its nature and its potential for CW detection. We find that Sco X-1 is an unusually young (∼7 × 106 yr) LMXB and constrain the current NS mass to ∼1.4–1.6 M⊙. Our computations reveal a rapid B decay, with the maximum current value of ∼1.8 × 108 G, which can be useful to constrain the decay models. Note that the maximum current ν value is ∼550 Hz, implying that, unlike what is generally believed, a CW emission is not required to explain the current source properties. However, ν will exceed an observed cutoff frequency of ∼730 Hz, and perhaps even the NS breakup frequency, in the future without a CW emission. The minimum NS mass quadrupole moment (Q) to avoid this is ∼(2–3) × 1037 g cm2, corresponding to a CW strain of ∼10−26. Our estimation of current ν values can improve the CW search sensitivity.

<title>A 22 Billion M ⊙ Black Hole in Holmberg 15A with Keck KCWI Spectroscopy and Triaxial Orbit Modeling</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Holmberg 15A (H15A), the brightest cluster galaxy of A85, has an exceptionally low central surface brightness even among local massive elliptical galaxies with distinct stellar cores, making it exceedingly challenging to obtain high-quality spectroscopy to detect a supermassive black hole (SMBH) at its center. Aided by the superb sensitivity and efficiency of KCWI at the Keck II Telescope, we have obtained spatially resolved stellar kinematics over a ∼100″ × 100″ contiguous field of H15A for this purpose. The velocity field exhibits a low-amplitude (∼20 km s−1) rotation along a kinematic axis that is prominently misaligned from the photometric major axis, a strong indicator that H15A is triaxially shaped with unequal lengths for the three principal axes. Using 2500 observed kinematic constraints, we perform extensive calculations of stellar orbits with the triaxial Schwarzschild code, TriOS, and search over ∼40,000 galaxy models to simultaneously determine the mass and intrinsic 3D shape parameters of H15A. We determine a ratio of p = 0.89 for the middle-to-long principal axes and q = 0.65 for the short-to-long principal axes. Our best estimate of the SMBH mass, , makes H15A—along with NGC 4889—the galaxy hosting the most massive SMBHs known in the local Universe. Both SMBHs lie significantly above the mean MBH–σ scaling relation. Repeating the orbit modeling with the axisymmetrized version of TriOS produces worse fits to the KCWI kinematics and increases MBH to (2.55 ± 0.20) × 1010M⊙, which is still significantly below the MBH = (4.0 ± 0.8) × 1010M⊙ reported in a prior axisymmetric study of H15A.

We explore the empirical power-law relationship between X-ray luminosity (LX) and total surface magnetic flux (Φ), established across solar magnetic elements, time- and disk-averaged emission from the Sun, older active stars, and pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars. Previous models of large PMS X-ray flares, lacking direct magnetic field measurements, showed discrepancies from this baseline law, which MHD simulations attribute to unusually strong magnetic fields during flares. To test this, we used nearly simultaneous Chandra X-ray and HET-HPF near-infrared observations of four young Orion stars, measuring surface magnetic fields during or just after powerful PMS X-ray flares. We also modeled these PMS X-ray flares, incorporating their measured magnetic field strengths. Our findings reveal magnetic field strengths at the stellar surface typical of nonflaring PMS stars, ruling out the need for abnormally strong fields during flares. Both PMS and solar flares deviate from the LX–Φ law, with PMS flares exhibiting a more pronounced deviation, primarily due to their much larger active regions on the surface and larger flaring loop volumes above the surface compared to their solar counterparts. These deviations likely stem from the fact that powerful flares are driven by magnetic reconnection, while baseline X-ray emission may involve less efficient mechanisms like Alfvén wave heating. Our results also indicate a preference for dipolar magnetic loops in PMS flares, consistent with Zeeman–Doppler imaging of fully convective stars. This requirement for giant dipolar loops aligns with MHD predictions of strong dipoles supported by polar magnetic surface active regions in fast-rotating, fully convective stars.

<title>Sporadic Dips from Extended Debris Transiting the Metal-rich White Dwarf SBSS 1232+563</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the discovery of deep but sporadic transits in the flux of SBSS 1232+563, a metal-rich white dwarf polluted by disrupted exoplanetary debris. Nearly 25 yr of photometry from multiple sky surveys reveal evidence of occasional dimming of the white dwarf, most notably evident in an 8 month long event in 2023 that caused a >40% drop in flux from the star. In-transit follow-up shows additional short-timescale (minutes- to hours-long) dimming events. Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite photometry suggests a coherent 14.842 hr signal that could represent the dominant orbital period of debris. Six low-resolution spectra collected at various transit depths over two decades show no evidence of significant changes in the observed elemental abundances. SBSS 1232+563 demonstrates that debris transits around white dwarfs can be sporadic, with many years of inactivity before large-amplitude dimming events.

<title>Relativistic Binary Precession: Impact on Eccentric Massive Binary Black Hole Accretion and Hydrodynamics</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Recent hydrodynamical simulations have shown that circumbinary gas disks drive the orbits of massive binary black holes (BHs) to become eccentric, even when general relativistic (GR) corrections to the orbit are significant. Here, we study the GR apsidal precession of eccentric equal-mass massive binary BHs in circumbinary disks via two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. We perform a suite of simulations comparing precessing and nonprecessing binaries across a range of eccentricities, semimajor axes, and precession rates. We find that the GR precession of the binary's semimajor axis can introduce a dominant modulation in the binary's accretion rate and the corresponding high-energy electromagnetic light curves. We discuss the conditions under which this occurs and its detailed characteristics and mechanism. Finally, we discuss the potential to observe these precession signatures in electromagnetic- and gravitational-wave observations, as well as the precession signal's unique importance as a potential tool to constrain the mass, eccentricity, and semimajor axis of binary merger events.

<title>Influence of Effective Nucleon Mass on Equation of State for Supernova Simulations and Neutron Stars</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We investigate the influence of the effective nucleon mass on the equation of state (EOS), which is constructed for simulations of core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron star mergers, within the relativistic mean-field (RMF) framework. The study introduces a new RMF parameter set, TM1m, which is a modification of the TM1e model with an adjusted effective mass, maintaining the saturation properties of nuclear matter. The TM1m model, with a larger effective mass ratio (M*/M ~ 0.8) compared to the TM1e model (M*/M ~ 0.63), is employed to construct a new EOS table, EOS5. This EOS table is designed to offer insights into the influence of the effective nucleon mass on the EOS within a relativistic framework, particularly above the saturation density. The results of EOS5 are compared with those obtained from other models, including both relativistic and nonrelativistic approaches. The properties of cold neutron stars, calculated using the TM1m model, are compatible with the existence of a 2 M⊙ pulsar and the latest constraints on the tidal deformability and radii of a canonical 1.4 M⊙ neutron star, derived from astrophysical observations.

<title>Observations of Microlensed Images with Dual-field Interferometry: On-sky Demonstration and Prospects</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Interferometric observations of gravitational microlensing events offer an opportunity for precise, efficient, and direct mass and distance measurements of lensing objects, especially those of isolated neutron stars and black holes. However, such observations have previously been possible for only a handful of extremely bright events. The recent development of a dual-field interferometer, GRAVITY Wide, has made it possible to reach out to significantly fainter objects and increase the pool of microlensing events amenable to interferometric observations by 2 orders of magnitude. Here, we present the first successful observation of a microlensing event with GRAVITY Wide and the resolution of microlensed images in the event OGLE-2023-BLG-0061/KMT-2023-BLG-0496. We measure the angular Einstein radius of the lens with subpercent precision, θE = 1.280 ± 0.009 mas. Combined with the microlensing parallax detected from the event light curve, the mass and distance to the lens are found to be 0.472 ± 0.012 M⊙ and 1.81 ± 0.05 kpc, respectively. We present the procedure for the selection of targets for interferometric observations and discuss possible systematic effects affecting GRAVITY Wide data. This detection demonstrates the capabilities of the new instrument, and it opens up completely new possibilities for the follow-up of microlensing events and future routine discoveries of isolated neutron stars and black holes.

<title>Do Unusually Cold Starburst Galaxies Exist? A Case Study</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada4ac</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada4ac</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report observations of CO(J = 9 → 8) and OH+(N = 1 → 0) toward the four millimeter-selected lensed starburst galaxies SPT 2354−58, 0150−59, 0314−44, and 0452−50, using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Atacama Compact Array, as part of a larger study of OH+ in the early Universe. In this work, we use these observations for the main purpose of spectroscopic redshift measurements. For all sources except SPT 0452−50, we confirm the previously reported most likely redshifts, and we find typical CO and OH+ properties for massive starbursts. For SPT 0452−50, we rule out the previously reported value of z = 2.0105, measuring a firm redshift of z = 5.0160 based on [O i], [C ii], H2O, and CO emission instead when adding in ancillary ALMA data. Previously, SPT 0452−50 was considered an outlier in relations between dust temperature, far-infrared luminosity, and redshift, which may have hinted at an unusually cold starburst with a dust temperature of only Tdust = (21 ± 2) K. Instead, our new measurements suggest it to be among highly luminous massive dusty starbursts at z > 5, with rather typical properties within that population. We find a revised dust temperature of Tdust = (76.2 ± 2.5) K, and an updated lensing-corrected far-infrared luminosity (42.5–122.5 μm) of (2.35 ) × 1013L⊙, i.e., about an order of magnitude higher than previously reported. We thus do not find evidence for the existence of unusually cold starburst galaxies in the early Universe that were missed by previous selection techniques.

<title>ALMA Observations of Massive Clouds in the Central Molecular Zone: External-pressure-confined Dense Cores and Salpeter-like Core Mass Functions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Band 6 (1.3 mm) observations of dense cores in three massive molecular clouds within the central molecular zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way, including the Dust Ridge cloud e, Sgr C, and the 20 km s−1 cloud, at a spatial resolution of 2000 au. Among the 834 cores identified from the 1.3 mm continuum, we constrain temperatures and linewidths of 253 cores using local thermodynamic equilibrium methods to fit the H2CO and/or CH3CN spectra. We determine their masses using the 1.3 mm dust continuum and derived temperatures, and then evaluate their virial parameters using the H2CO and/or CH3CN linewidths and construct the core mass functions (CMFs). We find that the contribution of external pressure is crucial for the virial equilibrium of the dense cores in the three clouds, which contrasts with the environment in the Galactic disk where dense cores are already bound, even without the contribution of external pressure. With our new temperature estimates we also find that the CMFs show a Salpeter-like slope in the high-mass (≳3–6 M⊙) end, a change from previous works. Combined with the possible top-heavy initial mass functions (IMFs) in the CMZ, our result suggests that gas accretion and further fragmentation may play important roles in transforming the CMF to the IMF.

<title>Signatures of Core-envelope Rotational Misalignment in the Mixed-mode Asteroseismology of Kepler-56</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada4a3</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada4a3</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Existing asteroseismic rotational measurements assume that stars rotate around a single axis. However, tidal torques from misaligned companions, or their possible engulfment, may bring the rotational axis of a star's envelope out of alignment with its core, breaking azimuthal symmetry. I derive perturbative expressions for asteroseismic signatures of such hitherto unexamined rotational configurations, under the “shellular approximation” of constant rotation rates on radially stratified mass shells. In the aligned case, the distribution of power between multiplet components is determined by the inclination of the rotational axis; radial differential misalignment causes this to vary from multiplet to multiplet. I examine in particular detail the phenomenology of gravitoacoustic mixed modes as seen in evolved sub- and red giants, where near-resonance avoided crossings may break geometrical degeneracies. Upon applying the revised asteroseismic observational methodology that results from this theoretical discussion to revisit Kepler-56—a red giant with a misaligned planetary system—I find that its core and envelope rotate around different rotational axes. While the rotational axis of its core is indeed misaligned from the orbit normal of its transiting planets (consistently with earlier studies), its envelope's rotational axis is close to lying in the sky plane, and may well be aligned with them. More detailed asteroseismic modeling, and spectroscopic follow-up, will be required to fully elucidate the full spin–orbit geometry of the Kepler-56 system, and potentially discriminate between hypotheses for how it formed.

<title>Dust Scattering Albedo at Millimeter Wavelengths in the TW Hya Disk</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9f31</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9f31</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Planetary bodies are formed by coagulation of solid dust grains in protoplanetary disks. Therefore, it is crucial to constrain the physical and chemical properties of the dust grains. In this study, we measure the dust albedo at millimeter wavelength, which depends on dust properties at the disk midplane. Since the albedo and dust temperature are generally degenerate in observed thermal dust emission, it is challenging to determine them simultaneously. We propose to break this degeneracy by using multiple optically thin molecular lines as a dust–albedo-independent thermometer. In practice, we employ pressure-broadened CO line wings that provide an exceptionally high signal-to-noise ratio as an optically thin line. We model the CO J = 2–1 and 3–2 spectra observed by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array at the inner region (r < 6 au) of the TW Hya disk and successfully derive the midplane temperature. Combining multiband continuum observations, we constrain the albedo spectrum at 0.9–3 mm for the first time without assuming a dust opacity model. The albedo at these wavelengths is high, ~0.5–0.8, and broadly consistent with the L. Ricci et al., DIANA, and DSHARP dust models. Even without assuming dust composition, we estimate the maximum grain size to be ~340 μm, the power-law index of the grain size distribution to be >−4.1, and the porosity to be <0.96. The derived dust size may suggest efficient fragmentation with a threshold velocity of ~0.08 m s−1. We also note that the absolute flux uncertainty of ~10% (1σ) is measured and used in the analysis, which is approximately twice the usually assumed value.

<title>Little Red Dots: Rapidly Growing Black Holes Reddened by Extended Dusty Flows</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada5fb</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada5fb</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have revolutionized extragalactic research, particularly with the discovery of little red dots (LRDs), which have been discovered as a population of dust-reddened broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Their unique V-shaped spectral feature, characterized by a red optical continuum and a UV excess in the rest frame, challenges us to discern the relative contributions of the galaxy and AGN. We study a spectral energy distribution (SED) model for LRDs from rest-frame UV to infrared bands. We hypothesize that the incident radiation from an AGN, characterized by a typical SED, is embedded in an extended dusty medium with an extinction law similar to those seen in dense regions such as Orion Nebula or certain AGN environments. The UV−optical spectrum is described by dust-attenuated AGN emission, featuring a red optical continuum at λ > 4000 Å and a flat UV spectral shape established through a gray extinction curve at λ < 3000 Å, due to the absence of small-size grains. There is no need for additional stellar emission or AGN scattered light. In the infrared, the SED is shaped by an extended dust and gas distribution (γ < 1; ρ ∝ r−γ) with characteristic gas densities of ≃10–103 cm−3, which allows relatively cool dust temperatures to dominate the radiation. As a result, these dust structures shift the emission energy peak from near-infrared to mid-infrared bands in the rest frame; for sources at z ~ 4–7, the corresponding wavelengths shift from the JWST/MIRI to Herschel range. This model, unlike the typical AGN hot torus models, can produce an infrared SED flattening that is consistent with LRD observations through JWST MIRI. Such a density structure can arise from the coexistence of inflows and outflows during the early assembly of galactic nuclei. This might be the reason why LRDs emerge preferentially in the high-redshift Universe younger than 1 billion years.

<title>Detectability of Emission from Exoplanet Outflows Calculated by pyTPCI, a New 1D Radiation-hydrodynamic Code</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Photoevaporation in exoplanet atmospheres is thought to contribute to the shaping of the small planet radius valley. Escaping atmospheres have been detected in transmission across a variety of exoplanet types, from hot Jupiters to mini-Neptunes. However, no work has yet considered whether outflows might also be detectable in emission. We introduce pyTPCI, a new, open-source self-consistent 1D radiative-hydrodynamics code that is an improved version of The PLUTO-CLOUDY Interface. We use pyTPCI to model seven exoplanets (HD 189733b, HD 209458b, WASP-69b, WASP-107b, TOI-1430b, TOI-560b, and HAT-P-32b) at varying metallicities and compute their emission spectra to investigate their detectability across a variety of spectral lines. We calculate the eclipse depths and signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of these lines for a 10 m class telescope with a high-resolution spectrograph, taking into account appropriate line broadening mechanisms. We show that the most detectable spectral lines tend to be the 589 nm Na i doublet and the 1083 nm metastable helium triplet. Hα and Mg i 457 nm are moderately strong for some planets at some metallicities, but they are almost always optically thin, so some of their emission may not be from the outflow. The planet with the highest-flux, highest-eclipse-depth, and highest-SNR lines is HD 189733b, with a Na i eclipse depth of 410 ppm and SNR of 2.4 per eclipse, and a He* eclipse depth of 170 ppm and SNR of 1.3. These signals would be marginally detectable with Keck if 3–10 eclipses were observed, assuming (over optimistically) photon limited observations.

<title>Strong-lensing Analysis of SPT-CL J2325−4111 and SPT-CL J0049−2440, Two Powerful Cosmic Telescopes (R E > 40″) from the SPT Clusters Sample</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report the results from a study of two massive (M500c > 6.0 × 1014 M⊙) strong-lensing clusters selected from the South Pole Telescope cluster survey for their large Einstein radius (RE > 40″), SPT-CL J2325−4111 and SPT-CL J0049−2440. Ground-based and shallow Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging indicated extensive strong-lensing evidence in these fields, with giant arcs spanning 18″ and 31″, respectively, motivating further space-based imaging follow-up. Here, we present multiband HST imaging and ground-based Magellan spectroscopy of the fields, from which we compile detailed strong-lensing models. The lens models of SPT-CL J2325−4111 and SPT-CL J0049−2440 were optimized using nine and eight secure multiply imaged systems with a final image-plane rms of 0 63 and 0 73, respectively. From the lensing analysis, we measure a projected mass density within 500 kpc of M(<500 kpc) = (7.30 ± 0.07) × 1014M⊙ and M⊙ for these two clusters, and subhalo mass ratios of 0.12 ± 0.01 and , respectively. Both clusters produce a large area with high magnification (μ ≥ 3) for a source at z = 9, arcmin2 and arcmin2, respectively, placing them in the top tier of strong-lensing clusters. We conclude that these clusters are spectacular sightlines for further observations that will reduce the systematic uncertainties due to cosmic variance. This paper provides the community with two additional well-calibrated cosmic telescopes, as strong as the Frontier Fields and suitable for studies of the highly magnified background Universe.

<title>A Search for Radio Millisecond Pulsar Companions around Extremely Low-mass White Dwarfs with Ellipsoidal Variability</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Extremely low-mass (ELM) white dwarfs (WDs) are helium-core WDs with masses less than 0.3 M⊙. Short-period ELM WD binaries that exhibit ellipsoidal variations may harbor heavier companions, either massive WDs or millisecond pulsars (MSPs). In this study, we selected ∼12,000 ELM WDs or their candidates, and searched for ellipsoidal-like lightcurves with orbital periods shorter than 1 day, by using the public data from Zwicky Transient Facility. Finally, 23 such systems were found, with 17 being newly discovered. We selected nine high-priority targets likely to evolve from the Roche lobe overflow channel and estimated their companion masses from the extracted ellipsoidal variation amplitude. Among them, four targets have companion masses exceeding 1 M⊙. We performed a search for radio pulsations from six of these targets by using Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope. However, no convincing radio pulse signals were found, resulting in upper limits for the radio flux at around 8 μJy. Given the nondetection of radio pulsations from a total of 11 similar systems, the fraction of ellipsoidal ELM WDs around MSPs is estimated to be below 15 %. We anticipate that multiwavelength studies of more ellipsoidal-like ELM WDs will further constrain the fraction.

<title>Analysis of the Internal Radial Gradient of Chemical Abundances in Spiral Galaxies from CALIFA</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The study of chemical evolution is of paramount importance for understanding the evolution of galaxies. Models and observations propose an inside-out mechanism in the formation of spiral galaxy disks, implying a negative radial gradient of elemental abundances when represented on a logarithmic scale. However, in some instances, the observed chemical abundance gradients deviate from a single negative straight line, revealing inner drops or outer flattenings, particularly in more massive galaxies. This study analyzes oxygen abundance gradients in spiral galaxies based on observations from the Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area survey. Our focus is specifically on examining oxygen abundance gradient profiles, as obtained with data from H ii regions, with a special emphasis on the inner radial gradient. We employ an automated fitting procedure to establish correlations between the physical properties of galaxies and bulges and the presence of these inner drops, seeking potential explanations for these variations in gradient. We find that the different criteria used in the literature to distinguish H ii regions from other ionization sources in the galaxies, such as active galactic nuclei, significantly impact the results, potentially altering abundance gradient profiles and uncovering galaxies with distinct inner drops. Additionally, we analyze the abundance radial gradients to investigate the impact of diffuse ionized gas (DIG) decontamination on oxygen abundances over these inner drops. We observe that DIG, concentrated mainly in the central regions of galaxies, can modify oxygen abundance gradient profiles if left unaddressed.

<title>JWST Imaging of Edge-on Protoplanetary Disks. IV. Mid-infrared Dust Scattering in the HH 30 Disk</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9c6f</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present near- and mid-infrared (IR) broadband imaging observations of the edge-on protoplanetary disk around HH 30 with the James Webb Space Telescope/Near Infrared Camera and the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI). We combine these observations with archival optical/near-IR scattered light images obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope and a millimeter-wavelength dust continuum image obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) with the highest spatial resolution ever obtained for this target. Our multiwavelength images clearly reveal the vertical and radial segregation of micron-sized and submillimeter-sized grains in the disk. In the near- and mid-IR, the images capture not only bireflection nebulae separated by a dark lane but also diverse dynamical processes occurring in the HH 30 disk, such as spiral- and tail-like structures, a conical outflow, and a collimated jet. In contrast, the ALMA image reveals a flat dust disk in the disk midplane. By performing radiative transfer simulations, we show that grains of about 3 μm in radius or larger are fully vertically mixed to explain the observed mid-IR scattered light flux and its morphology, whereas millimeter-sized grains are settled into a layer with a scale height of ≳1 au at 100 au from the central star. We also find a tension in the disk inclination angle inferred from optical/near-IR and millimeter observations, with the latter being closer to exactly edge-on. Finally, we report the first detection of the proper motion of an emission knot associated with the mid-IR collimated jet detected by combining two epochs of our MIRI 12.8 μm observations.

<title>Revisiting Near-infrared Features of Kilonovae: The Importance of Gadolinium</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The observation of the kilonova AT2017gfo and investigations of its light curves and spectra confirmed that neutron star mergers are sites of r-process nucleosynthesis. However, the identification of elements responsible for the spectral features is still challenging, particularly at the near-infrared wavelengths. In this study, we systematically searched for all possible near-infrared transitions of heavy elements using experimentally calibrated energy levels. Our analysis reveals that most candidate elements with strong absorption lines are lanthanides (Z = 57–71) and actinides (Z = 89–103). This is due to their complex structures leading to many low-lying energy levels, which results in strong transitions in the near-infrared range. N. Domoto et al. (2022) have shown that La iii and Ce iii can explain the absorption features at λ ∼ 12000–15000 Å. While our results confirm that these two elements show strong infrared features, we additionally identify Gd iii as the next most promising species. Due to its unique atomic structure involving the half-filled 4f and the outer 5d orbitals, Gd iii has one of the lowest-lying energy levels, between which relatively strong transitions occur. We also find absorption lines caused by Gd iii in the near-infrared spectrum of a chemically peculiar star HR 465, which supports their emergence in kilonova spectra. By performing radiative transfer simulations, we confirm that Gd iii lines affect the feature at ∼12000 Å previously attributed to La iii. Future space-based time-series observations of kilonova spectra will allow the identification of Gd iii lines.

Over the past three decades, a lot of coronal fast-mode waves have been detected by space missions, but their counterparts in the chromosphere, called Moreton waves, have rarely been captured. How this happens remains a mystery. Here, to shed light on this problem, we investigate the photospheric vector magnetograms of the Moreton-wave events associated with M- and X-class solar flares during 2010–2023. The Hα data are taken with the Global Oscillation Network Group and the Chinese Hα Solar Explorer. Our statistical results show that more than 80% of the events occur at the edges of active regions and propagate nonradially, due to asymmetric magnetic fields above the flares. According to the reconstructed magnetic field and atmospheric model, Moreton waves propagate in the direction along which the horizontal fast-mode wave speed drops the fastest. This result supports the inclined magnetic configuration of the eruption being crucial for generating Moreton waves, even for X-class flares. It may explain the low occurrence rate of Moreton waves and why some X-class flares accompanied with coronal mass ejections do not generate Moreton waves.

<title>Asymmetries and Circumstellar Interaction in the Type II SN 2024bch</title>

We present a comprehensive multi-epoch photometric and spectroscopic study of SN 2024bch, a nearby (19.9 Mpc) Type II supernova (SN) with prominent early high-ionization emission lines. Optical spectra from 2.8 days after the estimated explosion reveal narrow lines of H i, He ii, C iv, and N iv that disappear by day 6. High-cadence photometry from the ground and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite show that the SN brightened quickly and reached a peak MV ~ −17.8 mag within a week of explosion, and late-time photometry suggests a 56Ni mass of 0.050 M⊙. High-resolution spectra from days 7.9 and 43 trace the unshocked circumstellar medium (CSM) and indicate a wind velocity of 30–40 km s−1, a value consistent with a red supergiant (RSG) progenitor. Comparisons between models and the early spectra suggest a pre-SN mass-loss rate of , which is too high to be explained by quiescent mass loss from RSGs, but is consistent with some recent measurements of similar SNe. Persistent blueshifted H i and [O i] emission lines seen in the optical and near-IR spectra could be produced by asymmetries in the SN ejecta, while the multicomponent Hα may indicate continued interaction with an asymmetric CSM well into the nebular phase. SN 2024bch provides another clue to the complex environments and mass-loss histories around massive stars.

<title>First Results from the JWST Early Release Science Program Q3D: The Fast Outflow in a Red Quasar at z = 0.44</title>

Quasar feedback may play a key role in the evolution of massive galaxies. The dust-reddened quasar F2M110648.35+480712 at z = 0.4352 is one of the few cases at its redshift that exhibits powerful quasar feedback through bipolar outflows. Our new observation with the integral field unit mode of the Near-infrared Spectrograph on board JWST opens a new window to examine this spectacular outflow through the Paα emission line with ~3× better spatial resolution than previous work. The morphology and kinematics of the Paα nebula confirm the existence of a bipolar outflow extending on a scale of ∼17 × 14 kpc and with a velocity reaching ∼1100 km s−1. The higher spatial resolution of our new observation leads to more reliable measurements of outflow kinematics. Considering only the spatially resolved outflow and assuming an electron density of 100 cm−2, the mass, momentum, and kinetic energy outflow rates are ∼50–210 M⊙ yr−1, ∼(0.3–1.7) × 1036 dynes (∼14%–78% of the quasar photon momentum flux), and ∼(0.16–1.27) × 1044 erg s−1 (∼0.02%–0.20% of the quasar bolometric luminosity), respectively. The local instantaneous outflow rates generally decrease radially. We infer that the quasar is powerful enough to drive the outflow, while stellar processes cannot be overlooked as a contributing energy source. The mass outflow rate is ∼0.4–1.5 times the star formation rate, and the ratio of kinetic energy outflow rate to the quasar bolometric luminosity is comparable to the minimum value required for negative quasar feedback in simulations. This outflow may help regulate the star formation activity within the system to some extent.

<title>3D Nonequilibrium Ionization and Spectroscopic Modeling of Coronal Mass Ejections. I. Comparison with Hinode/EIS Observations</title>

High-resolution EUV spectroscopy provides an informative diagnostic tool for the early evolution of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) since it can directly measure many physical properties of CME plasma close to the Sun that cannot be determined from white-light coronagraphs or narrowband imagers. The Hinode/EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) captured a series of high-resolution EUV spectra of the 2008 April 9 event, also known as the “Cartwheel CME,” during its initial acceleration period. CMEs are inherently dynamic events, driving the plasma from ionization equilibrium, which makes the nonequilibrium ionization (NEI) effects important when analyzing spectral observations. In this work, we performed simulations of the Cartwheel CME using the Alfvén Wave Solar atmosphere Model (AWSoM) to provide insight into the plasma structure and dynamics during the early evolution of this CME. For the first time, we combined self-consistent nonequilibrium charge state calculations in the EUV spectral line synthesis for a CME simulation to account for the plasma departures from ionization equilibrium everywhere in the CME. In this first paper of the series, we compare the simulation results to the EIS observations of this event to assess the quality of the AWSoM predictions. We find that the CME is out of equilibrium, indicating that NEI effects should be considered in the EUV spectral synthesis. Overall, the model reproduces the thermodynamic evolution of the CME in the low solar corona well, as compared to the EIS observations.

<title>Hybrid Simulations of Interstellar Pickup Ions at the Solar Wind Termination Shock Revisited</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada89c</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada89c</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We revisit previous hybrid simulations of the heating and acceleration of interstellar pickup ions (PUIs) at the solar wind termination shock. In previous simulations, a relatively cold initial distribution of PUIs was assumed; and while the resulting shock-heated distribution was consistent with Voyager 2 LECP measurements at about 30 keV, the intensity of the distribution downstream of the shock in the ~1–10 keV energy range was lower than predictions based on analysis of energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) from the Interstellar Boundary Explorer-Hi and Cassini's Ion and Neutral Camera. Here we perform new simulations with more realistic initial PUI distributions. We assume the distribution is a partially filled spherical shell in velocity space with a radius that varies from 320 to 640 km s−1. We then use the distributions downstream of the shock from these new simulations to estimate the ENA flux spectrum and compare with observations. We find that the predicted ENA spectrum from the new simulations much better matches the observations over a broad range of energies. We conclude that the hybrid simulations provide reasonable predictions for the distribution of charged particles in the energy range from ~0.5 to 50 keV.

<title>AEOS: Star-by-star Cosmological Simulations of Early Chemical Enrichment and Galaxy Formation</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada4a1</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The Aeos project introduces a series of high-resolution cosmological simulations that model star-by-star chemical enrichment and galaxy formation in the early Universe, achieving 1 pc resolution. These simulations capture the complexities of galaxy evolution within the first ~300 Myr by modeling individual stars and their feedback processes. By incorporating chemical yields from individual stars, Aeos generates galaxies with diverse stellar chemical abundances, linking them to hierarchical galaxy formation and early nucleosynthetic events. These simulations underscore the importance of chemical abundance patterns in ancient stars as vital probes of early nucleosynthesis, star formation histories, and galaxy formation. We examine the metallicity floors of various elements resulting from Population III enrichment, providing best-fit values for eight different metals (e.g., [O/H] = −4.0) to guide simulations without Population III models. Additionally, we identify galaxies that begin star formation with Population II after external enrichment and investigate the frequency of carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars at varying metallicities. The Aeos simulations offer detailed insights into the relationship between star formation, feedback, and chemical enrichment. Future work will extend these simulations to later epochs to interpret the diverse stellar populations of the Milky Way and its satellites.

<title>The Dynamical History of HIP-41378 f—Oblique Exorings Masquerading as a Puffy Planet</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The super-puff HIP-41378 f represents a fascinating puzzle due to its anomalously low density on a far-out orbit in contrast with other known super-puffs. In this work, we explore the hypothesis that HIP-41378 f is not in fact a low-density planet, but rather hosts an opaque ring system. We analyze the dynamical history of the system and show that convergent migration is necessary to explain the system's long-term stability. We then show that this same migration process plausibly captures HIP-41378 f into spin–orbit resonance and excites the planetary obliquity to high values. This tilts the surrounding ring and is a plausible explanation for the large transit depth. In the end, we also briefly comment on the likelihood of other super-puff planets being in high-obliquity states. We show that the existence of a tilted extensive ring around a high obliquity planet can serve as an explanation for puffy planets, particularly in multiplanetary systems at far distances from their host stars.

<title>Systematic Search for Long-term Trends in Fermi-LAT Jetted Active Galactic Nuclei</title>

Jetted active galactic nuclei (AGN) exhibit variability across a wide range of timescales. Traditionally, this variability can often be modeled well as a stochastic process. However, in certain cases, jetted AGN variability displays regular patterns, enabling us to conduct investigations aimed at understanding its origins. Additionally, a novel type of variability has emerged in jetted AGN light curves, specifically, the observation of a long-term trend characterized by a linear increase of the flux with time in blazars such as PG 1553+113, which is among the objects most likely to display periodic behavior. In this paper, we present the results of a systematic search for long-term trends, spanning ≈10 yr, utilizing 12 yr of Fermi-LAT observations. The study is focused on detecting the presence of linear or quadratic long-term trends in a sample of 3308 jetted AGN. Our analysis has identified 40 jetted AGN that exhibit long-term trends, each with distinct properties, which we also characterize in this study. These long-term trends may originate from the dynamics of a supermassive black hole binary system, or they could be the result of intrinsic phenomena within the jet itself. Our findings can help in addressing questions pertaining to the astrophysical origins of variability and periodicity within jetted AGN.

<title>Autoencoder Reconstruction of Cosmological Microlensing Magnification Maps</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada5ff</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Enhanced modeling of microlensing variations in light curves of strongly lensed quasars improves measurements of cosmological time delays, the Hubble Constant, and quasar structure. Traditional methods for modeling extragalactic microlensing rely on computationally expensive magnification map generation. With large data sets expected from wide-field surveys like the Vera C. Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time, including thousands of lensed quasars and hundreds of multiply imaged supernovae, faster approaches become essential. We introduce a deep-learning model that is trained on pre-computed magnification maps covering the parameter space on a grid of κ, γ, and s. Our autoencoder creates a low-dimensional latent space representation of these maps, enabling efficient map generation. Quantifying the performance of magnification map generation from a low dimensional space is an essential step in the roadmap to develop neural network-based models that can replace traditional feed-forward simulation at much lower computational costs. We develop metrics to study various aspects of the autoencoder generated maps and show that the reconstruction is reliable. Even though we observe a mild loss of resolution in the generated maps, we find this effect to be smaller than the smoothing effect of convolving the original map with a source of a plausible size for its accretion disk in the red end of the optical spectrum and larger wavelengths and particularly one suitable for studying the broad-line region of quasars. Used to generate large samples of on-demand magnification maps, our model can enable fast modeling of microlensing variability in lensed quasars and supernovae.

<title>The Sunburst Arc with JWST. III. An Abundance of Direct Chemical Abundances</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We measure the gas-phase abundances of the elements He, N, O, Ne, S, Ar, and Fe in an individual H ii region known to be leaking Lyman-continuum photons in the Sunburst Arc, a highly magnified galaxy at redshift z = 2.37. We detect the temperature-sensitive auroral lines [S ii] λλ4070, 4076, [O iii] λ4363, [S iii] λ6314, [O ii] λλ7320, 7330, and [Ne iii] λ3343 in a stacked spectrum of five multiple images of the Lyman-continuum emitter (LCE), from which we directly measure the electron temperature in the low-, intermediate-, and high-ionization zones. We also detect the density-sensitive doublets of [O ii] λλ3727, 3730, [S ii] λλ6718, 6733, and [Ar iv] λλ4713, 4741, which constrain the density in both the low- and high-ionization gas. With these temperature and density measurements, we measure gas-phase abundances with similar rigor as studies of local galaxies and H ii regions. We measure a gas-phase metallicity for the LCE of , and find an enhanced nitrogen abundance . This nitrogen abundance is consistent with enrichment from a population of Wolf–Rayet stars, additional signatures of which are reported in a companion paper. Abundances of sulfur, argon, neon, and iron are consistent with local low-metallicity H ii regions and low-redshift galaxies. This study represents the most complete chemical abundance analysis of an individual H ii region at Cosmic Noon to date, which enables direct comparisons between local H ii regions and those in the distant Universe.

<title>The Quest for a Stable Disk</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The majority of disk galaxies manifest spirals and/or bars that are believed to result from dynamical instabilities. However, some galaxies have featureless disks, which are therefore inferred to be dynamically stable. Yet despite many years of effort, theorists have been unable to construct realistic models of galaxy disks that possess no instabilities and therefore could remain featureless. This conclusion has been reached through simulations for the most part, some of which have been confirmed by linear stability analyses. A. Toomre (1981) claimed that the Mestel disk, embedded in an equal-mass halo, is a notable counterexample, but his prediction of stability could not be reproduced in simulations, due to complicated nonlinear effects that caused secular growth of Poisson noise–driven disturbances until strong features emerged. Here, we revisit this issue and show that simply eliminating the most nearly circular orbits from Toomre's disk model can inhibit troublesome secular growth. We also present both 2D and 3D simulations of particle disks that remain featureless for over 50 orbit periods. We report that spiral evolution naturally depletes circular orbits and that the radial velocity distribution in the featureless disks of S0 galaxies should have negative kurtosis.

<title>Dark Galactic Subhalos and the Gaia Snail</title>

Gaia has revealed a clear signal of disequilibrium in the solar neighborhood in the form of a spiral (or snail) feature in the vertical phase-space distribution. We investigate the possibility that this structure emerges from ongoing perturbations by dark Galactic subhalos. We develop a probabilistic model for generating subhalo orbits based on a semianalytic model of structure formation, and combine this framework with an approximate prescription for calculating the response of the disk to external perturbations. We also develop a phenomenological treatment for the diffusion of phase-space spirals caused by gravitational scattering between stars and giant molecular clouds, a process that erases the kinematic signatures of old (t ≳ 0.6 Gyr) events. Perturbations caused by dark subhalos are, on average, orders of magnitude weaker than those caused by luminous satellite galaxies, but the ubiquity of dark halos predicted by cold dark matter makes them a more probable source of strong perturbation to the dynamics of the solar neighborhood. Dark subhalos alone do not cause enough disturbance to explain the Gaia snail, but they excite fluctuations of ∼0.1–0.5 km s−1 in the mean vertical velocity of stars near the Galactic midplane that should persist to the present day. Subhalos also produce correlations between vertical frequency and orbital angle that could be mistaken as originating from a single past disturbance. Our results motivate investigation of the Milky Way's dark satellites by characterizing their kinematic signatures in phase-space spirals across the Galaxy.

<title>Tracking Outflow Using Line Locking (TOLL). II. Large Line-locking Web Identified in Quasar J151352+085555</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Quasar outflows often consist of two clouds with velocity separations matching the doublet spacings of common UV resonance transitions, a phenomenon known as line locking, which is commonly observed in quasar spectra. Multiple clouds can be locked together through multi-ion doublets, forming a “line-locking web.” In the second paper of the TOLL project, we present the discovery of one of the largest “line-locking webs” known to date from the Very Large Telescope UVES spectra of QSO J151352+085555. We identify 12 associated narrow absorption line systems through the C iv, N v, Si iv, O vi, and multiple Lyman lines (Lyα to Lyϵ) and find 10 out of the 12 absorbers are line-locked together by comparing velocity separations between different absorption systems. By conducting photoionization modeling with CLOUDY, we measure the total hydrogen column densities, metallicities, and ionization parameters of these absorbers, which suggests that the absorbers likely have subsolar metallicities. A preliminary statistical analysis demonstrates that the shadowed clouds tend to have similar ionization states compared to the shadowing ones. Identification of one of the largest line-locking webs implies that radiative acceleration plays an important role in sorting out cloud velocities in quasar outflows and highlights the need for more sophisticated theoretical models to explain its formation and evolution.

<title>Stellar X-Ray Variability and Planetary Evolution in the DS Tucanae System</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada948</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present an analysis of four Chandra observations of the 45 Myr old DS Tuc binary system. We observed X-ray variability of both stars on timescales from hours to months, including two strong X-ray flares from star A. The implied flaring rates are in agreement with past observations made with XMM-Newton, though these rates remain imprecise due to the relatively short total observation time. We find a clear, monotonic decline in the quiescent level of the star by a factor of 1.8 across 8 months, suggesting stellar variability that might be due to an activity cycle. If proven through future observations, DS Tuc A would be the youngest star for which a coronal activity cycle has been confirmed. The variation in our flux measurements across the four visits is also consistent with the scatter in empirical stellar X-ray relationships with Rossby number. In simulations of the possible evolution of the currently super-Neptune-sized planet DS Tuc A b, we find a range of scenarios for the planet once it reaches a typical field age of 5 Gyr, from Neptune size down to a completely stripped super-Earth. Improved constraints on the planet's mass in the future would significantly narrow these possibilities. We advocate for further Chandra observations to better constrain the variability of this important system.

<title>Retracing the Cold Plasma Dispersion Law in Pulsar B0329+54: New Insights into Frequency-dependent Dispersion Measures</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada956</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada956</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Multiple studies have investigated potential frequency-dependent dispersion measures (DMs) in PSR B0329+54, with sensitivities at levels of 10−3 pc cm−3 or higher, using frequencies below 1 GHz. Utilizing the extensive bandwidth of the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope, we conducted simultaneous observations of this pulsar across a frequency range of 300–1460 MHz. Our observations reveal a distinct point in the pulse profile of PSR B0329+54 that appears to align remarkably well with the cold-plasma dispersion law, resulting in a unique measured DM across the entire frequency range. In contrast, using times of arrival from widely adopted pulsar timing techniques (e.g., FFTFIT) leads to frequency-dependent DMs. We investigated the potential causes of these frequency-dependent DMs in this pulsar and their relationship with the underlying magnetic field geometry corresponding to the radio emission. Our study reveals that all frequencies in the range 300–1460 MHz originate from a region no larger than 204 km, and the dipolar magnetic-field geometry model indicates that the emission region is centered at ~800 km from the star. This is the tightest constraint on the size of the emission region reported so far for PSR B0329+54 at the given frequencies, and it is at least 5 times more stringent than the existing emission height constraints based on the dipolar geometry model.

<title>FEASTS: Radial Distribution of H i Surface Densities Down to 0.01 M ⊙ pc−2 of 35 Nearby Galaxies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the H i surface density (ΣH i) radial distributions based on total-power H i images obtained by FAST in the FEASTS program, for 35 galaxies with inclinations lower than 72°. We derive the H i radius R001, which is the radius for the 0.01 M⊙ pc−2 (~1018.1 cm−2) isodensity level, 100 times deeper than the 1 M⊙ pc−2 level previously commonly used to measure R1. The profile shapes show a large diversity at a given radius in units of kpc, group virial radius, and R1, but they align more tightly with the radius normalized by R001. The universal H i profile has a scatter of ~0.2 dex and a scale length of ~0.11R001 in the outer region. We derive a new R001–MH i relation, which has a scatter of 0.03 dex and a similar slope of ~0.5 to the previously known R1–MH i relation. Excluding strongly tidal-interacting galaxies, the ratio R001/R1 (anti)correlates strongly and significantly with the H i-to-stellar mass ratio and specific star formation rate, but not with the stellar mass, MH i, dark matter mass, or star formation rate. The strongly tidal-interacting galaxies tend to show deviations from these trends and have the most flattened profiles. These results imply that, in the absence of major tidal interactions, physical processes must cooperate so that ΣH i distributes in a self-similar way in the outer region down to the 0.01 M⊙ pc−2 level. Moreover, they may drive gas flows in such a way that H i-richer galaxies have H i disks that not only extend further but also transport H i inward more efficiently from R001 to R1.

<title>Characteristics of the IBEX Ribbon and Their Implications for a Source Region Outside the Heliopause</title>

This paper presents a comprehensive exploration of the Interstellar Boundary Explorer energetic neutral atom (ENA) ribbon, focusing on its spatial and temporal variations over 14 yr. Methodological advancements, including a refined map modeling procedure and a new ribbon separation technique with appropriate error propagation, enable a detailed investigation of the ribbon’s features. Utilizing statistically robust metrics, this study reveals details of the ribbon across energy and time. Key findings include energy- and time-dependent variations in flux, angular radius, ribbon profile width, and higher moments. By applying these metrics, we reveal new complexity to the evolution of the ribbon over time, highlighting the nuanced relationship between it and the solar wind. Furthermore, the study examines for the first time the ribbon as it passes through the starboard/heliotail region (LonEC 120°–180°), revealing properties distinct from other portions of the ribbon. The analysis uncovers an anticorrelation between ribbon width and flux, which provides quantitative support for a multisource ribbon created by a combination of solar wind neutrals that generate a spatiall narrow ribbon component and heliosheath neutrals giving rise to a broad component. Finally, differences in the temporal evolution of the ENA flux at different energies provide additional support that the location of the ribbon source region is beyond the heliopause.

A core sample of 59 unobscured type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with simultaneous XMM-Newton X-ray and UV observations is compiled from the archives to probe the nature of soft X-ray excess (SE). In the first paper of this series, our focus centers on scrutinizing the spectral profile of the soft excess. Of the sources, ≈71% (42/59) exhibit power-law-like (po-like) soft excess, while ≈29% (17/59) exhibit blackbody-like (bb-like) soft excess. We show that a cutoff power law could uniformly characterize both types of soft excesses, with a median Ecut of 1.40 keV for po-like and 0.14 keV for bb-like. For the first time, we report a robust and quantitative correlation between the SE profile and SE strength (the ratio of SE luminosity to that of the primary power-law continuum in 0.5–2.0 keV), indicating that stronger soft excess is more likely to be po-like, or effectively has a higher Ecut. This correlation cannot be explained by ionized disk reflection alone, which produces mostly bb-like soft excess (Ecut ~ 0.1 keV) as revealed by relxilllp simulation. Remarkably, we show with simulations that a toy hybrid scenario, where both ionized disk reflection (relxilllp, with all reflection parameters fixed at default values except for ionization of the disk) and warm corona (compTT, with temperature fixed at 1 keV) contribute to the observed soft excess, can successfully reproduce the observed correlation. This highlights the ubiquitous hybrid nature of the SE in AGNs, and underscores the importance of considering both components while fitting the spectra of soft excess.

<title>Residual Energy and Broken Symmetry in Reduced Magnetohydrodynamics</title>

Alfvénic interactions that transfer energy from large to small spatial scales lie at the heart of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. An important feature of the turbulence is the generation of negative residual energy—excess energy in magnetic fluctuations compared to velocity fluctuations. By contrast, an MHD Alfvén wave has equal amounts of energy in fluctuations of each type. Alfvénic quasi-modes that do not satisfy the Alfvén wave dispersion relation and exist only in the presence of a nonlinear term can contain either positive or negative residual energy, but until now, an intuitive physical explanation for why negative residual energy is preferred has remained elusive. This paper shows that the equations of reduced MHD are symmetric in that they have no intrinsic preference for one sign of the residual energy over the other. An initial state that is not an exact solution to the equations can break this symmetry in a way that leads to net-negative residual energy generation. Such a state leads to a solution with three distinct parts: nonresonant Alfvénic quasi-modes, normal modes produced to satisfy initial conditions, and resonant normal modes that grow in time. The latter two parts strongly depend on initial conditions; the resulting symmetry breaking leads to net-negative residual energy both in Alfvénic quasi-modes and ω = k∥VA = 0 modes. These modes have net-positive residual energy in the equivalent boundary value problem, suggesting that the initial value setup is a better match for solar wind turbulence.

<title>Revisiting the Flaring Activity in Early 2015 of BL Lacertae Object S5 0716+714</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this work, we analyzed multiwavelength data of the BL Lac object S5 0716+714 to investigate its emission mechanisms during a flaring state observed in early 2015. We examined the temporal behavior and broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) during the flare. The size of the γ-ray emission region was estimated based on the variability timescale. To explore the multiwavelength properties of S5 0716+714, we employed three one-zone models: the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model, the SSC plus external Compton (EC) model, and the SSC plus pp interactions model, to reproduce the SEDs. Our findings indicate that, while the SSC model can describe the SEDs, it requires an extreme Doppler factor. In contrast, the SSC plus EC model successfully fits the SEDs under the assumption of weak external photon fields but requires a high Doppler factor. Additionally, the SSC plus pp interactions model also reproduces the SEDs, with γ-ray emission originating from π0 decay. However, this model leads to a jet power that exceeds the Eddington luminosity, which remains plausible due to the flaring state or the presence of a highly collimated jet.

<title>Bulge Oscillation Driven by Outflows of Active Galactic Nuclei. I. Fast Outflow Case</title>

There is growing evidence for star formation inside outflows of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The formed stars are injected into bulges and give rise to perturbation of bulges. In this paper, we investigate the issues of nonrotating, spherically symmetric bulges under the perturbation of fast, massive outflows with stars formed inside. We show that the potential perturbation of outflows, together with injection and dynamical friction of these stars, could drive bulge oscillations. Still, we find that nonzero radial velocity of bulges will be driven by the episodic outflows of AGNs, and after the AGN has quenched, the radial velocity will tend to zero within a timescale ~τAGN, which is the AGN's lifetime. For some typical values of bulges and AGNs, we find that the expansion and contraction velocities are a few × 10 km s−1 for 1010M⊙ bulges and mass outflowing rate 500 M⊙ yr−1, which would give observational signatures.

<title>Improving the Determination of Supernova Cosmological Redshifts by Using Galaxy Groups</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada285</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
At the low-redshift end (z < 0.05) of the Hubble diagram with Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia), the contribution to Hubble residual scatter from peculiar velocities (PVs) is of similar size to that due to the limitations of the standardization of the SN Ia light curves. A way to improve the redshift measurement of the SN host galaxy is to utilize the average redshift of the galaxy group, effectively averaging over small-scale/intracluster PVs. One limiting factor is the fraction of SN host galaxies in galaxy groups, previously found to be 30% using (relatively incomplete) magnitude-limited galaxy catalogs. Here, we do the first analysis of N-body simulations to predict this fraction, finding ∼73% should have associated groups and group averaging should improve redshift precision by ∼135 km s−1 (∼0.04 mag at z = 0.025). Furthermore, using spectroscopic data from the Anglo-Australian Telescope, we present results from the first pilot program to evaluate whether or not 23 previously unassociated SN Ia hosts belong in groups. We find that 91% of these candidates can be associated with groups, consistent with predictions from simulations given the sample size. Combining with previously assigned SN host galaxies in Pantheon+, we demonstrate improvement in Hubble residual scatter equivalent to 145 km s−1, also consistent with simulations. For new and upcoming low-z samples from, for example, the Zwicky Transient Facility and the Legacy Survey of Space and Time, a separate follow-up program identifying galaxy groups of SN hosts is a highly cost-effective way to enhance their constraining power.

<title>Vertical Shear Instability in Thermally Stratified Protoplanetary Disks. I. A Linear Stability Analysis</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9f41</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Vertical shear instability (VSI), driven by a vertical gradient of rotational angular velocity, is a promising source of turbulence in protoplanetary disks. We examine the semiglobal stability of thermally stratified disks and find that the VSI consists of surface and body modes: surface modes are confined to regions of strong shear, while body modes extend perturbations across the disk, consistent with the previous findings. In thermally stratified disks, surface modes bifurcate into two branches. The branch associated with the strongest shear at mid-height exhibits a higher growth rate compared to the branch near the surfaces. Surface modes generally grow rapidly and require a high radial wavenumber kR, whereas body mode growth rates increase as kR decreases. Thermal stratification enhances the growth rates of both surface and body modes and boosts VSI-driven radial kinetic energy relative to vertical energy. Our results suggest that simulations will initially favor surface modes with large kR, followed by an increase in body modes with smaller kR, with faster progression in more thermal stratified disks.

<title>Vertical Shear Instability in Thermally Stratified Protoplanetary Disks. II. Hydrodynamic Simulations and Observability</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We conduct 3D hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the nonlinear outcomes and observability of vertical shear instability (VSI) in protoplanetary disks. Our models include both vertically isothermal and thermally stratified disks, with the latter representing realistic conditions featuring a hotter atmosphere above the midplane. We find that the VSI grows more rapidly and becomes stronger in thermally stratified disks due to enhanced shear, resulting in higher levels of turbulence. At saturation, the turbulence stress reaches αRϕ ≳ 10−3, more than 1 order of magnitude stronger than the isothermal case. The saturated turbulence is more pronounced near the disk surfaces than at the midplane. On synthetic velocity residual maps, obtained by subtracting the Keplerian rotational velocity, perturbations driven by the VSI manifest as axisymmetric rings in isothermal disks and as ring segments in thermally stratified disks. The latter are visible at disk inclinations as high as 45° in thermally stratified disks. The amplitudes of these residual velocities range from ∼50 to ∼100 m s−1 at a 20° inclination, with larger values corresponding to greater thermal stratification. The magnitude of the observed velocity residual increases with the optical depth of the tracer used, as optically thick lines probe the regions near the disk surfaces.

<title>Pushing the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array to the Limit: 140 pc Resolution Observations of a z = 6.6 Quasar–Galaxy Merger Resolve Strikingly Different Morphologies of Dust Continuum and [C ii] 158 μm Emission</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present (140 pc) resolution Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of [C ii] 158 μm and dust continuum emission of the z = 6.6 quasar J0305–3150, resolved over ~300–400 independent resolution elements. The dust continuum emission is compact with ~80% recovered within (1.6 kpc), whereas the [C ii] emission profile is composed of a central Gaussian ( , i.e., <2.2 kpc) and an extended component (detected up to ~10 kpc at >3σ). We infer a direct contribution of the quasar to the observed 260 GHz continuum Sν,QSO/Sν,QSO + Host ≲ 1%. We report the detection of far-infrared (FIR)-detected star-forming clumps with r < 200 pc and properties similar to that of rest-frame UV–optical clumps reported in the literature. The 200 pc resolved [C ii]/FIR ratio follows the global relation with the FIR surface brightness established in low- and high-redshift galaxies, even at the quasar location. We find that dust continuum is emitted in regions of consistent with the size of photodissociation regions (PDRs), whereas 50% of the [C ii] originates from larger physical scales (θ ≳ 2″). The large-scale [C ii] emission presents a velocity gradient aligned with a nearby companion with perturbed kinematics, and misaligned with the kinematics of the small-scale emission. The absence of significant [C ii] emission by structures with physical scale ≲ 1 kpc implies that [C ii] emission is not produced in dense PDRs located at the boundary of giant molecular clouds. We argue instead that [C ii] is produced in low-density PDRs in the interstellar medium and diffuse H i gas tidally stripped during the ongoing merger.

<title>The Eruptive Duality of a Filament on 2023 April 21</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Here we study a filament eruption on 2023 April 21. The filament was composed of two segments, named S1 and S2. Initially, the brightening and bidirectionally plasmoid flows appeared inside S1, and then the west part of S1 (WS1) experienced rapid rising and eruption, accompanied by coronal dimming, flare ribbons, and a secondary flare ribbon. However, the east part of S1 (ES1) rose slowly and was confined. The material within ES1 drained back to its eastern footpoint, resulting in the footpoint brightening. In the later phase, the south footpoint of the stable extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) loops overlying ES1 was brightened also, which may result from the disturbance of drainage. During S1 eruption and activation, S2 remained stable. Nonlinear force-free field extrapolation shows that the footpoints of the magnetic field lines overlying WS1 are rooted on the flare ribbons, while the field lines overlying ES1, which share a negative field with other lines, correspond to the stable EUV loops. Based on potential field extrapolation, we calculate the decay index of the background fields overlying the filament. It indicates that the critical height of the torus instability of the fields overlying WS1 is lower than that overlying ES1. To interpret this filament eruption, we first put forward the eruptive duality, characterized by the eruption of the partial filament structure and the confinement of the other structure, and this duality is determined by the properties of the overlying fields.

<title>Contribution of Unresolved Sources to Diffuse Gamma-Ray Emission from the Galactic Plane</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The diffuse gamma-ray emission from the Milky Way serves as a crucial probe for understanding the propagation and interactions of cosmic rays within our Galaxy. The Galactic diffuse gamma-ray emission between 10 TeV and 1 PeV has been recently measured by the square kilometer array (KM2A) of the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). The flux is higher than predicted for cosmic rays interacting with the interstellar medium. In this work, we utilize a nonparametric method to derive the source count distribution using the published first LHAASO source catalog. Based on this distribution, we calculate the contribution of unresolved sources to the diffuse emission measured by KM2A. When comparing our results to the measured diffuse gamma-ray emission, we demonstrate that for the outer Galactic region, the contributions from unresolved sources and those predicted by models are roughly consistent with the observations within the uncertainties. However, for the inner Galactic region, additional components are required to account for the observed data.

<title>Coordinated Velocity Shift of Multiple C iv and Si iv Broad Absorption Lines in Quasar SDSS J113048.45+225206.6</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present an analysis of the coordinated velocity shifts observed in multiple C iv and Si iv broad absorption lines (BALs) in the quasar SDSS J113048.45+225206.6. The quasar exhibits an extensive BAL system spanning a velocity range of approximately 13,000 km s−1, which can be further delineated into five absorption systems (A1 to A5). Our analysis revealed coordinated velocity shifts in the C iv BALs of systems A1 and A2 and in the Si iv BALs of systems A2 and A3. These shifts were accompanied by coordinated variations in equivalent widths, which can be attributed to changes in the ionization state of the clouds in response to fluctuations in the ionizing continuum. By comparing the absorption line systems, we deduced that the velocity-shifted systems (A1 to A3) are located closer to the central engine, possess higher velocities, and are in a higher ionization state compared to the nonshifted systems (A4 to A5). These characteristics suggest that the outflow producing the velocity-shifted systems is situated in a more extreme environment and is more severely impacted by background radiation energy than the nonshifted systems. Furthermore, the synchronization of these velocity shifts across multiple components suggests a common underlying mechanism. Consequently, we infer that the coordinated velocity-shift signatures may indicate actual deceleration of the outflow clouds, driven by radiation pressure from the background light source.

<title>Rare Occasions: Tidal Disruption Events Rarely Power the AGNs Observed in Dwarf Galaxies</title>

Tidal disruption events (TDEs) could be an important growth channel for massive black holes in dwarf galaxies. Theoretical work suggests that the observed active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in dwarf galaxies are predominantly TDE-powered. To assess this claim, we perform variability analyses on the dwarf-hosted AGNs detected in the 7 Ms Chandra Deep Field-South survey, with observations spanning ≈16 yr. Based on the spectral energy distribution modeling with x-cigale, we select AGNs hosted by dwarf galaxies (stellar mass below 1010M⊙). We focus on X-ray sources with full-band detections, leading to a sample of 78 AGNs (0.122 ≤ z ≤ 3.515). We fit the X-ray light curves with a canonical TDE model of t−5/3 and a constant model. If the former outperforms the latter in fitting quality for a source, we consider the source as a potential TDE. We identify five potential TDEs, constituting a small fraction of our sample. Using true- and false-positive rates obtained from fitting models to simulated light curves, we perform Bayesian analysis to obtain the posterior of the TDE fraction for our sample. The posterior peaks close to zero (2.56%), and we obtain a 2σ upper limit of 9.80%. Therefore, our result indicates that the observed AGNs in dwarf galaxies are not predominantly powered by TDEs.

<title>A SPectroscopic Survey of Biased Halos in the Reionization Era (ASPIRE): Spectroscopically Complete Census of Obscured Cosmic Star Formation Rate Density at z = 4–6</title>

We present a stringent measurement of the dust-obscured star formation rate density (SFRD) at z = 4–6 from the ASPIRE JWST Cycle-1 medium and ALMA Cycle-9 large program. We obtained JWST/NIRCam grism spectroscopy and ALMA 1.2 mm continuum map along 25 independent quasar sightlines, covering a total survey area of ∼35 arcmin2 where we search for dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at z = 0–7. We identify eight DSFGs in seven fields at z = 4–6 through the detection of Hα or [O iii] λ5008 lines, including fainter lines such as Hβ, [O iii] λ4960, [N ii] λ6585, and [S ii] λλ6718,6733 for six sources. With this spectroscopically complete DSFG sample at z = 4–6 and negligible impact from cosmic variance (shot noise), we measure the infrared luminosity function (IRLF) down to LIR ∼ 2 × 1011L⊙. We find flattening of IRLF at z = 4–6 towards the faint end (power-law slope ). We determine the dust-obscured cosmic SFRD at this epoch to be . This is significantly higher than previous determinations using ALMA data in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field, which is void of DSFGs at z = 4–6 because of strong cosmic variance (shot noise). We conclude that the majority (66% ± 7%) of cosmic star formation at z ∼ 5 is still obscured by dust. We also discuss the uncertainty of SFRD propagated from far-IR spectral energy distribution and IRLF at the bright end, which will need to be resolved with future ALMA and JWST observations.

<title>UNCOVER: The Rest-ultraviolet to Near-infrared Multiwavelength Structures and Dust Distributions of Submillimeter-detected Galaxies in A2744</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
With the wavelength coverage, sensitivity, and high spatial resolution of JWST, it is now possible to peer through the dust attenuation to probe the rest-frame near-infrared (NIR) and stellar structures of extremely dusty galaxies at cosmic noon (z ∼ 1−3). In this paper we leverage the combined Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and JWST/Hubble Space Telescope coverage in A2744 to study the multiwavelength (0.5−4.4 μm) structures of 11 submillimeter detected galaxies at z ∼ 0.9−3.5 that are fainter than bright “classical” submillimeter galaxies, seven of which are detected in deep X-ray data. While these objects reveal a diversity of structures and sizes, all are smaller and more concentrated toward longer wavelengths. Of the X-ray-detected objects, only two show evidence for appreciable active galactic nucleus (AGN) flux contributions (at ≳2 μm). Excluding the two AGN-dominated objects, the smaller long-wavelength sizes indicate that their rest-frame NIR light profiles, inferred to trace their stellar mass profiles, are more compact than their optical profiles. The submillimeter detections and visible dust lanes suggest that centrally concentrated dust is a key driver of the observed color gradients. Further, we find that more concentrated galaxies tend to have lower size ratios (rest-frame NIR to optical); this suggests that the galaxies with the most compact light distributions also have the most concentrated dust. The 1.2 mm flux densities and size ratios of these nine objects suggest that both total dust quantity and geometry impact these galaxies’ multiwavelength structures. Upcoming higher-resolution 1.2 mm ALMA imaging will facilitate joint spatially resolved analysis and will directly test the dust distributions within this representative submillimeter population.

<title>Simulating High-redshift Galaxies: Enhancing UV Luminosity with Star Formation Efficiency and a Top-heavy IMF</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada27d</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada27d</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Recent findings from photometric and spectroscopic JWST surveys have identified examples of high-redshift galaxies at z ≳ 10. These high-z galaxies appear to form much earlier and exhibit greater UV luminosity than predicted by theoretical work. In this study, our goal is to reproduce the brightness of these sources by simulating high-redshift galaxies with virial masses Mvir = 109–1010M⊙ at z > 10. To achieve this, we conduct cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations, modifying baryonic subgrid physics, and post-process our simulation results to confirm the observability of our simulated galaxies. Specifically, we enhanced star formation activity in high-redshift galaxies by either increasing the star formation efficiency up to 100% or adopting a top-heavy initial mass function (IMF). Our simulation results indicate that both increasing star formation efficiency and adopting a top-heavy IMF play crucial roles in boosting the UV luminosity of high-redshift galaxies, potentially exceeding the limiting magnitude of JWST surveys in earlier epochs. In particular, the episodic starburst resulting from enhanced star formation efficiency may explain the high-redshift galaxies observed by JWST, as it evacuates dust from star-forming regions, making the galaxies more observable. We demonstrate this correlation between star formation activity and dust mass evolution within the simulated galaxies. Also, adopting a top-heavy IMF could enhance observability due to an overabundance of massive stars, although it may also facilitate rapid metal enrichment. Using our simulation results, we derive several observables such as effective radius, UV slope, and emission-line rates, which could serve as valuable theoretical estimates for comparison with existing spectroscopic results and forthcoming data from the JWST NIRSpec and MIRI instruments.

<title>Similarities and Differences between ICME-driven Shocks Observed by VEX (∼0.72 au) and WIND (∼1.0 au)</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The features of interplanetary shocks driven by interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) observed by WIND (∼1.0 au) and Venus Express (VEX; ∼0.72 au) during the same period are statistically analyzed by comparing their similarities and differences. It is found that the proportion of ICME-driven shocks in all shocks decreases slightly from ∼0.72 to ∼1 au. The yearly occurrence of ICME-driven shocks at both ∼0.72 and ∼1 au roughly follows the sunspot cycle, while the magnetic field ratio does not show such a correspondence. In each year, the annual medians of the shock angle for ICME-driven shocks at ∼1 au are consistently larger than those at ∼0.72 au, and the annual medians of the magnetic field ratio for events at ∼1 au are slightly smaller than those at ∼0.72 au. Planar magnetic structures (PMSs) downstream of ICME-driven shocks are also analyzed. Approximately 28.57% of the detected PMS events from VEX observations and 28.84% from WIND observations cover the entire 2 hr intervals downstream of the shocks, which are referred to as full PMS events. Through comparative analysis for VEX and WIND observations, it is found that strong and quasi-perpendicular ICME-driven shocks are the most preferable conditions for full PMS formation.

We address the issue of which broad set of initial conditions for the planet Jupiter best matches the current presence of a “fuzzy core” of heavy elements, while at the same time comporting with measured parameters such as its effective temperature, atmospheric helium abundance, radius, and atmospheric metallicity. Our focus is on the class of fuzzy cores that can survive convective mixing to the present day and on the unique challenges of an inhomogeneous Jupiter with stably stratified regions now demanded by the Juno gravity data. Hence, using the new code APPLE, we attempt to put a nonadiabatic Jupiter into an evolutionary context. This requires not only a mass density model, the major relevant byproduct of the Juno data, but a thermal model that is subject to interior heat transport, a realistic atmospheric flux boundary, a helium rain algorithm, and the latest equation of state. The result is a good fit to most major thermal, compositional, and structural constraints that still preserve a fuzzy core and that should inform future more detailed models of the current Jupiter in the context of its evolution from birth.

<title>Resonant Damping and Instability of Propagating Magnetohydrodynamic Body Modes in a Flux Tube with Shear Flow under Photospheric Conditions</title>

The influence of shear flow on resonant absorption is theoretically investigated for propagating magnetohydrodynamic body modes in cusp (slow) and Alfvén continua in a cylindrical flux tube under photospheric conditions. An analytical dispersion relation for resonant absorption in the presence of flow shear is developed by assuming a thin boundary layer. The numerical solutions reveal that the presence of flow shear has a rather negative impact on the resonant absorption of the body mode compared to the surface modes. As the flow shear increases, it first slightly increases the strength of resonant absorption for the forward body modes and then decreases it below the strength of no flow shear case for both resonances. It is also found that as the flow shear increases, the range of the axial wavenumber and wave frequency for the cusp resonance decreases when the wave frequency is close to the upper boundary of the cusp continuum. For the backward body modes, the strength of the resonance absorption decreases with the increment of the flow shear. When the flow shear is sufficiently large, the waves propagate in the forward direction, and their amplitude grows with a small increment.

<title>Propagating Bright Knots in the Chromospheric Fibrils</title>

The solar chromosphere is a crucial layer for resolving the problem of atmospheric heating. There are many bright features, which are considered as the thermal signals for heating the atmosphere, and these features are suggested to have resulted from either magnetic reconnection or wave dissipation. It has been reported that a large number of propagating bright knots are detected in the chromosphere and corona. In this paper, we employ the high-resolution chromospheric Hα data from the New Vacuum Solar Telescope to study the propagating bright knots. As the propagating bright knots move along the chromospheric fibrils, we select isolated and clear fibrils and track the knots along these fibrils. While the number of knots in a fibril region is equal to or greater than 5, the fibril and the knots are recorded. Based on the data on 2019 September 4, we detected 98 knots, and these knots move along 13 fibrils. On 2019 November 2, 87 knots, which move along 12 fibrils, were recorded. These propagating bright knots have an average area of around 0.8 Mm2, with propagating distances from 190 to 2450 km, propagating velocities from 5 to 51 km s−1, and an average lifetime of 71 s. To examine the relationship between the knots and the photospheric magnetic fields, we measure the field underneath these knots. The average magnetic flux densities are less than 10 Gauss, comparable with the noise level. We suggest that these knots are not produced by magnetic reconnection, but rather by wave dissipation.

<title>Observations of the Ultraviolet-bright Star III-60 in the Globular Cluster NGC 6723</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We have analyzed archival far-ultraviolet spectra of the UV-bright star III-60 in the globular cluster NGC 6723 obtained with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer and the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph. We find that the star's photospheric parameters (effective temperature Teff = 44,800 ± 1200 K, surface gravity , and helium abundance ) are consistent with the values derived from its optical spectrum, suggesting that optically derived values are generally accurate for evolved stars with Teff ≲ 50,000 K. Relative to the cluster's red giant branch stars, III-60 is enhanced in nitrogen and depleted in carbon and oxygen. The star exhibits strong P Cygni profiles in both components of the N vλ1240 doublet, but the resonance lines of other species show no evidence of a stellar wind. The star's effective temperature and luminosity place it on the evolutionary tracks of stars evolving from the blue horizontal branch, but its high mass (∼1.2 M⊙) indicates that it is the product of a stellar merger. Its helium, carbon, and nitrogen abundances suggest that it is following an evolutionary path similar to that of the low-carbon, intermediate helium-rich hot subdwarfs.

<title>A 22 yr Cycle of the Network Topology of Solar Active Regions</title>

In this paper, solar cycles 21–24 were compared using complex network analysis. A network was constructed for these four solar cycles to facilitate the comparison. In these networks, the nodes represent the active regions of the Sun that emit flares, and the connections correspond to the sequence of solar flares over time. This resulted in a directed network with self-connections allowed. The model proposed by Abe and Suzuki for earthquake networks was followed. The incoming degree for each node was calculated, and the degree distribution was analyzed. It was found that for each solar cycle, the degree distribution follows a power law, indicating that solar flares tend to appear in correlated active zones rather than being evenly distributed. Additionally, a variation in the characteristic exponent γ for each cycle was observed, with higher values in even cycles compared to odd cycles. A more detailed analysis was performed by constructing 11 yr networks and shifting them in 1 yr intervals. This revealed that the characteristic exponent shows a period of approximately 22 yr coincident with the Hale cycle, suggesting that the complex networks provide information about the solar magnetic activity.

<title>Rotating Neutron Stars with Relativistic Ab Initio Calculations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The equation of state (EOS) of extremely dense matter is crucial for understanding the properties of rotating neutron stars. Starting from the widely used realistic Bonn potentials rooted in a relativistic framework, we derive EOSs by performing state-of-the-art relativistic Brueckner–Hartree–Fock calculations in the full Dirac space. The self-consistent and simultaneous consideration of both positive- and negative-energy states (NESs) of the Dirac equation allows us to avoid the uncertainties present in calculations where NESs are treated using approximations. To manifest the impact of rotational dynamics, several structural properties of neutron stars across a wide range of rotation frequencies and up to the Keplerian limit are obtained, including the gravitational and baryonic masses, the polar and equatorial radii, and the moments of inertia. Our theoretical predictions align well with the latest astrophysical constraints from observations of massive neutron stars and joint mass–radius measurements. The maximum mass for rotating configurations can reach up to 2.93 M⊙ for Bonn A potential, while the radius of a 1.4 M⊙ neutron star in the nonrotating case can be extended to around 17 km through constant baryonic mass sequences. Relations with good universalities between the Keplerian frequency and static mass as well as radius are obtained, from which the radius of the black widow PSR J0952-0607 is predicted to be less than 19.58 km. Furthermore, to understand how rotation deforms the equilibrium shape of a neutron star, the eccentricity is also calculated. The approximate universality between the eccentricity at the Keplerian frequency and the gravitational mass is found.

<title>Mach Number Scaling of Foreshock Magnetic Fluctuations at Quasi-parallel Bow Shocks and Their Role in Magnetospheric Driving Throughout the Solar System</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada440</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada440</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Upstream of quasi-parallel bow shocks, reflected ions generate ion–ion instabilities. The resulting magnetic fluctuations can advect through the shock and interact with planetary magnetospheres. The amplitude of magnetic fluctuations depends on the strength of the shock, quantified by the Alfvén Mach number (MA), which is the ratio of solar wind velocity to the local Alfvén velocity. With increasing heliocentric distance, the solar wind MA generally increases, such that Mercury typically experiences a lower MA ∼ 5 compared to Earth (MA ∼ 8), and Mars a slightly higher MA ∼ 9. Farther out in the solar system, Saturn has even higher MA (∼10). However, the solar wind flow is highly irregular, and on top of solar cycle variations these values for average MA at each planet do not capture extreme events. Statistical analysis of OMNIWeb observations from 2015 to 2023 shows that sustained (30 minutes or more) high MA (30–100) occurs at Earth about once a month. Using a selection of events in the ion foreshock regions of Mercury, Earth, Mars, and Saturn, a linear scaling is calculated for the maximum magnetic fluctuation amplitude as a function of MA. The resulting slope is ∼0.2. Based on the dominant fluctuation frequency for the largest-amplitude events at each planet, it is found that Mars exists in a special regime where the wave period of the magnetic fluctuations can be similar to or longer than the magnetospheric convection timescale, making Mars more susceptible to space weather effects associated with foreshock fluctuations.

<title>The Influence of General Relativity on the Spins of Celestial Bodies in Inclined Orbits</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Through the Rossiter–McLaughlin effect, several hot Jupiters have been found to exhibit spin–orbit misalignment and even retrograde orbits. The high obliquity observed in these planets can be attributed to two primary formation mechanisms, as summarized in the existing literature. First, the host star's spin becomes misaligned with the planetary disk during the late stages of star formation, primarily due to chaotic accretion and magnetic interactions between the star and the planetary disk. Second, the orbital inclination of an individual planet can be excited by dynamical processes such as planet–planet scattering, the Lidov–Kozai cycle, and secular chaos within the framework of Newtonian mechanics. This study introduces a third mechanism, where, within the framework of general relativity, the post-Newtonian spin–orbit coupling term induces precession of the host star's spin around the orbital angular momentum. The orbital inclination, relative to a reference plane, can expand the range of deviation in the spatial orientation of the bodies’ spins from the plane's normal. The varying amplitude and period of spin precession for both the star and the planet are derived theoretically, and the results, which can be applied without restriction, agree well with numerical simulations.

<title>The JADES Transient Survey: Discovery and Classification of Supernovae in the JADES Deep Field</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) is a multicycle JWST program that has taken among the deepest near- and mid-infrared images to date (down to ∼30 AB mag) over ∼25 arcmin2 in the GOODS-S field in two sets of observations with 1 yr of separation. This presented the first opportunity to systematically search for transients, mostly supernovae (SNe), out to z > 2. We found 79 SNe: 38 at z < 2, 23 at 2 < z < 3, 8 at 3 < z < 4, 7 at 4 < z < 5, and 3 with undetermined redshifts, where the redshifts are predominantly based on spectroscopic or highly reliable JADES photometric redshifts of the host galaxies. At this depth, the detection rate is ∼1–2 arcmin–2 yr–1, demonstrating the power of JWST as an SN discovery machine. We also conducted multiband follow-up NIRCam observations of a subset of the SNe to better constrain their light curves and classify their types. Here, we present the survey, sample, search parameters, spectral energy distributions, light curves, and classifications. Even at z ≥ 2, the NIRCam data quality is high enough to allow SN classification via multiepoch light-curve fitting with confidence. The multiepoch SN sample includes a Type Ia SN at zspec = 2.90, a Type IIP SN at zspec = 3.61, and a Type Ic-BL SN at zspec = 2.83. We also found that two z ∼ 16 galaxy candidates from the first imaging epoch were actually transients that faded in the second epoch, illustrating the possibility that moderate/high-redshift SNe could mimic high-redshift dropout galaxies.

<title>The Arp 240 Galaxy Merger: A Detailed Look at the Molecular Kennicutt–Schmidt Star Formation Law on Subkiloparsec Scales</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9bab</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9bab</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The molecular Kennicutt–Schmidt Law has been key for understanding star formation (SF) in galaxies across all redshifts. However, recent subkiloparsec observations of nearby galaxies reveal deviations from the nearly unity slope (N) obtained with disk-averaged measurements. We study SF and molecular gas (MG) distribution in the early-stage luminous infrared galaxy merger Arp 240 (NGC 5257-8). Using Very Large Array radio continuum (RC) and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array CO(2–1) observations at 500 pc scale, with a uniform grid analysis, we estimate SF rates and MG surface densities (ΣSFR and , respectively). In Arp 240, N is sublinear at 0.52 ± 0.17. For NGC 5257 and NGC 5258, N is 0.52 ± 0.16 and 0.75 ± 0.15, respectively. We identify two SF regimes: high surface brightness (HSB) regions in RC with N ~ 1, and low surface brightness (LSB) regions with shallow N (ranging 0.15 ± 0.09–0.48 ± 0.04). Median CO(2–1) linewidth and MG turbulent pressure (Pturb) are 25 km s−1 and 9 × 105 K cm−3. No significant correlation was found between ΣSFR and CO(2–1) linewidth. However, ΣSFR correlates with Pturb, particularly in HSB regions (ρ > 0.60). In contrast, SF efficiency moderately anticorrelates with Pturb in LSB regions but shows no correlation in HSB regions. Additionally, we identify regions where peaks in SF and MG are decoupled, yielding a shallow N (≤0.28 ± 0.18). Overall, the range of N reflects distinct physical properties and distribution of both the SF and MG, which can be masked by disk-averaged measurements.

<title>Obliquity Dependence of Ocean Productivity and Atmospheric CO2 on Earth-like Worlds</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada277</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada277</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Obliquity can shape the habitability of a planet by changing the seasonal availability of incident solar radiation. Changes in incident radiation can lead to changes in the availability of light, temperature, ocean circulation, stratification, and corresponding nutrient availability, all of which are important in determining ocean net primary productivity (NPP). Moreover, a fraction of the carbon assimilated by phytoplankton is sequestered in the deep ocean. Therefore, changes in productivity can alter the distribution of CO2 between the ocean and atmosphere. In this study, we investigate the effects of obliquity on ocean NPP and the atmospheric CO2 concentration using ROCKE-3D fully coupled to the NASA GISS Ocean Biogeochemistry Model. We find sea surface temperature primarily controls the NPP response, with both properties reaching a maximum at an obliquity of 45°. We find that the response of the seasonal amplitude of NPP to obliquity is controlled primarily by photosynthetically available radiation and secondarily by changes in nutrient availability. We also find that atmospheric CO2 increases in response to obliquity, with a minimum at 15° and a maximum at 60°. The obliquity-driven CO2 changes are controlled primarily by temperature-driven solubility changes, with circulation and biology either enhancing solubility-driven changes at low obliquities or acting against and partially offsetting solubility-driven changes at higher obliquities. The magnitude of obliquity-driven changes is likely too small to be detectable, though future studies are needed to determine whether changing obliquity simultaneously with other orbital parameters can lead to larger, potentially detectable changes in NPP and CO2.

<title>The Arizona Molecular ISM Survey with the SMT: Variations in the CO(2–1)/CO(1–0) Line Ratio across the Galaxy Population</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The J = 1 → 0 spectral line of carbon monoxide (CO(1–0)) is the canonical tracer of molecular gas. However, CO(2–1) is frequently used in its place, following the assumption that the higher-energy line can be used to infer the CO(1–0) luminosity and molecular gas mass. The use of CO(2–1) depends on a knowledge of the ratio between CO(2–1) and CO(1–0) luminosities, r21. Here, we present galaxy-integrated r21 measurements for 122 galaxies spanning stellar masses from 109 to 1011.5M⊙ and star formation rates (SFRs) from 0.08 to 35 M⊙ yr−1. We find strong trends between r21 and SFR, SFR surface density, star formation efficiency, and distance from the star formation main sequence (SFMS). We show that the assumption of a constant r21 can introduce biases into the molecular gas trends in galaxy population studies and demonstrate how this affects the recovery of important galaxy scaling relations, including the Kennicutt–Schmidt law and the relation between SFMS offset and star formation efficiency. We provide a prescription that accounts for variations in r21 as a function of SFR and can be used to convert between CO(2–1) and CO(1–0) when only one line is available. Our prescription matches variations in r21 for both AMISS and literature samples and can be used to derive more accurate gas masses from CO(2–1) observations.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Irradiated brown dwarfs offer a unique opportunity to bridge the gap between stellar and planetary atmospheres. We present high-quality Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Camera 3/G141 phase-resolved spectra of the white dwarf–brown dwarf binary GD 1400, covering more than one full rotation of the brown dwarf. Accounting for brightness variations caused by ZZ Ceti pulsations, we revealed weak (∼1%) phase-curve amplitude modulations originating from the brown dwarf. Subband light-curve exploration in various bands showed no significant wavelength dependence on amplitude or phase shift. Extracted day- and nightside spectra indicated chemically similar hemispheres, with slightly higher dayside temperatures, suggesting efficient heat redistribution or the dominance of radiative escape over atmospheric circulation. A simple radiative and energy redistribution model reproduced the observed temperatures well. Cloud-inclusive models fit the day and night spectra better than cloudless models, indicating global cloud coverage. We also begin qualitatively exploring atmospheric trends across six irradiated brown dwarfs, from the now complete “Dancing with the Dwarfs” white dwarf–brown dwarf sample. The trend we find in the dayside/nightside temperature and irradiation levels is consistent with efficient heat redistribution for irradiation levels less than ∼109 erg s−1 cm−2 and decreasing efficiency above that level.

JWST has enabled detecting and spatially resolving the heavily dust-attenuated stellar populations of submillimeter galaxies, revealing detail that was previously inaccessible. In this work, we construct a sample of 289 submillimeter galaxies with joint Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and JWST constraints in the COSMOS field. Sources are originally selected using the SCUBA-2 instrument and have archival ALMA observations from various programs. Their JWST NIRCam imaging is from COSMOS-Web and PRIMER. We extract multiwavelength photometry in a manner that leverages the unprecedented near-infrared (NIR) spatial resolution of JWST, and we fit the data with spectral energy distribution models to derive photometric redshifts, stellar masses, star formation rates, and optical attenuation. The sample has an average , , , and . There are 81 (30%) galaxies that have no previous optical/NIR detections, including 75% of the z > 4 subsample (n = 28). The faintest observed NIR sources have the highest redshifts and largest AV = 4 ± 1. In a preliminary morphology analysis we find that ∼10% of the members of our sample exhibit spiral arms and 5% host stellar bars, with one candidate bar found at z > 3. Finally, we find that the clustering of JWST sources within 10″ of a submillimeter galaxy is a factor of 2 greater than what is expected based on either random clustering or the distribution of sources around any red galaxy irrespective of a submillimeter detection.

<title>Carbon and Iron Deficiencies in Quiescent Galaxies at z = 1–3 from JWST-SUSPENSE: Implications for the Formation Histories of Massive Galaxies</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad96b6</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the stellar metallicities and multielement abundances (C, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, and Fe) of 15 massive (log M/M⊙ = 10.2–11.2) quiescent galaxies at z = 1–3, derived from ultradeep JWST-SUSPENSE spectra. Compared to quiescent galaxies at z ∼ 0, these galaxies exhibit a deficiency of 0.26 ± 0.04 dex in [C/H], 0.16 ± 0.03 dex in [Fe/H], and 0.07 ± 0.04 dex in [Mg/H], implying rapid formation and quenching before significant enrichment from asymptotic giant branch stars and Type Ia supernovae. Additionally, we find that galaxies forming at higher redshift consistently show higher [Mg/Fe] and lower [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], regardless of their observed redshift. The evolution in [Fe/H] and [C/H] is therefore primarily driven by lower-redshift samples naturally including galaxies with longer star formation timescales. In contrast, the lower [Mg/H] likely reflects earlier-forming galaxies expelling larger gas reservoirs during their quenching phase. Consequently, the mass–metallicity relation, primarily reflecting [Mg/H], is somewhat lower at z = 1–3 compared to the lower-redshift relation. Finally, we compare our results to standard stellar population modeling approaches employing solar abundance patterns and nonparametric star formation histories (using Prospector). Our simple stellar population (SSP)-equivalent ages agree with the mass-weighted ages from Prospector, while the metallicities disagree significantly. Nonetheless, the metallicities better reflect [Fe/H] than total [Z/H]. We also find that the star formation timescales inferred from elemental abundances are significantly shorter than those from Prospector, and we discuss the resulting implications for the early formation of massive galaxies.

<title>H-AMR FORGE’d in FIRE. I. Magnetic State Transitions, Jet Launching, and Radiative Emission in Super-Eddington, Highly Magnetized Quasar Disks Formed from Cosmological Initial Conditions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Quasars are powered by supermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion disks, yet standard thin disk models are inconsistent with many observations. Recently, P. F. Hopkins et al. simulated the formation of a quasar disk feeding an SMBH of mass M = 1.3 × 107M⊙ in a galaxy. The disk had surprisingly strong toroidal magnetic fields that supported it vertically from gravity and powered rapid accretion. What feedback can such a system produce? To answer this, we must follow the gas to the event horizon. For this, we interpolated the quasar into the general-relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamics code H-AMR and performed 3D simulations with BH spins a = 0 and a = 0.9375. This remapping generates magnetic monopoles, which we erase using a novel divergence cleaning approach. Despite the toroidal magnetic field's dominance at large radii, vertical magnetic flux builds up near the event horizon, leading to a magnetic state transition within the inner 200 gravitational radii of the disk. This powers strong winds and, for spinning BHs, relativistic jets that can spin down the BH within 5−10 Myr. Sometimes, vertical magnetic fields of opposite polarity reach the BH, causing a polarity inversion event that briefly destroys the jets and, possibly, the X-ray corona. These strong fields power accretion at rates 5× the Eddington limit, which can double the BH mass in 5–10 Myr. When a = 0.9375 (a = 0), the energy in mechanical outflows and radiation equals about 60% (10%) and 100% (3%) of the accreted rest mass energy, respectively. Much of the light escapes in cool, ≳1300 au photospheres, consistent with quasar microlensing and spectral energy distributions.

We present the results of a Keck and Northern Extended Millimeter Array spectroscopic survey of 507 galaxies, where we confirm the presence of two massive overdensities at z = 3.090−3.110 and z = 3.133−3.155 in the neighborhood of the GOODS-N, each with over a dozen spectroscopically confirmed members. We find that both of these have galaxy overdensities of near-infrared-detected galaxies of δgal,obs = 6−9 within corrected volumes of (6−7) × 103 cMpc3. We estimate the properties of the z = 0 descendants of these overdensities using a spherical collapse model and find that both should virialize by z ≃ 0.5−0.8, with total masses of Mtot ≃ (6−7) × 1014M⊙. The same spherical collapse calculations, as well as a clustering-of-clusters statistical analysis, suggest a >80% likelihood that the two overdensities will collapse into a single cluster with Mtot = (1.0−1.5) × 1015M⊙ by z ~ 0.1−0.4. The z = 3.14 substructure contains a core of four bright dusty star-forming galaxies with ΣSFR = 2700 ± 700M⊙ yr−1 in a volume of only 280 cMpc3.

<title>Tearing-mediated Alfvénic Turbulence in a Relativistic Plasma</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In astrophysical relativistic plasmas, Alfvénic turbulence exists across a wide range of scales. Similar to a nonrelativistic case, this turbulence can be influenced by the tearing instability. We argue that in an ultrarelativistic pair plasma the tearing effects become significant at the critical scale given by , where L⊥ represents the outer scale of the turbulence and drel the relativistic electron inertial scale. Here n = 1 corresponds to the Harris magnetic configurations, while n = 2 applies to localized (non-Harris) magnetic profiles of turbulence-generated current sheets. Below the critical scale, the energy spectrum of magnetic fluctuations steepens to W(k)dk ∝ k−(7n+2)/3ndk. However, this happens only when , where is the magnetization parameter based on the magnetic fluctuations. If the opposite inequality holds, the Alfvénic cascade is instead affected by charge starvation at scales below , and the energy spectrum becomes steeper than W(k)dk ∝ k−3dk. When drel is replaced by its nonrelativistic equivalent, our results agree with the nonrelativistic analysis of N. F. Loureiro & S. Boldyrev (2018). In the Harris case n = 1, they agree with the recent relativistic studies by I. Demidov & Y. Lyubarsky.

<title>Fast-rotating A- and F-type Stars with Hα Emissions in NGC 3532: Candidate UV-dim Stars?</title>

Extended main-sequence stars that are dim in the ultraviolet passbands of the Hubble Space Telescope (UV-dim stars) are found in several young and intermediate-age star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs). The obscuring of the dust in the disks of stars expelled as a result of fast rotation has been suggested to be responsible for the appearance of UV-dim stars and to play an important role in the formation of extended main sequences. In this paper, we report a population of A- and F-type stars that show Hα emission features in their spectra in the young (~340 Myr old) neighboring Galactic star cluster NGC 3532. By fitting the observed absorption profiles, we found that most Hα emitters are fast-rotating stars, indicating that they form decretion disks by fast rotation like Be stars. As A- and F-type stars dominate the extended main-sequence turnoff regions of intermediate-age clusters, their appearance provides observational evidence to support the dust extinction scenario for these clusters, and they might be the counterparts of UV-dim stars that are detected in remote MC star clusters such as NGC 1783.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Disks of gas accreting onto supermassive black holes may host numerous stellar-mass objects, formed within the disk or captured from a nuclear star cluster. We present a simplified model of stellar evolution in these dense environments, which exhibits exceptional agreement with full stellar evolution calculations at a minuscule fraction of the cost. Although the model presented here is limited to stars burning hydrogen in their cores, it is sufficient to determine the evolutionary fate of disk-embedded stars: whether they proceed to later stages of nuclear burning and leave behind a compact remnant, reach a quasi-steady state where mass loss and accretion balance one another, or whether accretion proceeds faster than stellar structure can adjust, causing a runaway. We highlight how various disk parameters and phenomena such as gap opening affect stellar evolution outcomes. We also highlight how our model can accommodate time-varying conditions, such as those experienced by a star on an eccentric orbit, and can couple to N-body integrations. This model will enable more detailed studies of stellar populations and their interaction with accretion disks than have previously been possible.

<title>Vortex-induced Rings and Gaps within Protoplanetary Disks</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9f2c</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Observations of protoplanetary disks have revealed the presence of both crescent-shaped and ring-like structures in dust continuum emission. These crescents are thought to arise from dust-trapping vortices generated by the Rossby wave instability, which induces density waves akin to those caused by planets. These vortices have the potential to create gaps and rings within the disk, resulting from the dissipation of their density waves. We carry out 2D hydrodynamic simulations in the shearing box to investigate vortex–disk interaction. We find that long-lived vortices can produce dust rings and gaps in inviscid discs detectable by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, and a more elongated vortex produces rings at larger separations. Vortex-induced density waves carry over 2 orders of magnitude higher angular momentum flux compared to planet-induced ones that shock at the same location, making the former much more effective at producing dust gaps and rings far away.

<title>Detection of Enhanced Germanium in a New Cool Extreme Helium Star A980: Insights and Implications</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada1c2</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A fine abundance analysis of a recently discovered hydrogen-deficient carbon (HdC) star, A980, is presented. Based on the observed high-resolution optical spectrum, we ascertain that A980 is a cool extreme helium (EHe) star and not an HdC star. Singly ionized germanium Ge ii lines are identified in A980’s optical spectrum. These are the first-ever detections of germanium lines in an EHe star's observed spectrum and provide the first measurements of germanium abundance in an EHe star. The overabundance of germanium in A980’s atmosphere provides us with evidence for the synthesis of germanium in EHe stars. Among the known cool EHe stars, A980 exhibits a maximum enhancement of the s-process elements based on a significant number of transitions. The measured elemental abundances reveal signs of H-burning, He-burning, and specifically the nucleosyntheses of the key elements Ge, Sr, Y, Zr, and Ba. The nucleosyntheses of these key elements are discussed in light of asymptotic giant branch evolution and the expectation from the accretion of an He white dwarf by a C–O white dwarf or by a neutron star.

<title>Reverberation Evidence for Stream Collision and Delayed Disk Formation in Tidal Disruption Events</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada274</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada274</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
When a star passes through the tidal disruption radius of a massive black hole (BH), it can be torn apart by the tidal force of the BH, known as the tidal disruption event (TDE). Since the observed UV/optical luminosity significantly exceeds the predictions of the compact disk model in classical TDE theory, two competing models, stream collision and envelope reprocessing, have been proposed to address this discrepancy. To distinguish between these models, we investigated the continuum reverberation behaviors for ~30 TDEs with high-quality multiband light curves. We found that over half of them exhibit a positive lag by a few days in UV/optical bands, indicating that their inferred sizes are significantly larger than the envelope sizes in reprocessing. Moreover, X-ray emissions are not only significantly delayed relative to the primary UV/optical peak but also lag behind the rebrightening bump by up to several tens of days, completely different from the X-ray illumination reprocessing. Additionally, the anticorrelated UV−optical continuum in ASASSN-15lh further disfavors the reprocessing scenario. In contrast, the model of stream collisions, combined with delayed accretion disk formation, can provide a unified explanation for the diverse TDE observations, e.g., the optical/X-ray population and the frequently observed rebrightening bump. This model describes a unification scheme wherein the UV/optical emission originates from stream collisions during the early stage of TDE evolution and gradually transitions to being dominated by a accretion disk with detectable X-ray emission in the late stage. After transitioning to a quiescent state, recurrent flares may be observed in some cases, possibly related to repeating partial TDEs.

<title>Secular Perturbations from Exterior Giants Strongly Influence Gap Complexity in Peas-in-a-pod Exoplanetary Systems</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
It has been demonstrated that systems of tightly packed inner planets with giant exterior companions tend to have less regular orbital spacings than those without such companions. We investigate whether this observed increase in the gap complexity of the inner systems can be explained solely as the result of secular dynamics caused by the disturbing potential of the exterior companions. Amplification of mutual orbital inclinations in the inner system due to such secular dynamics may lead to the inner system attaining nonmutually transiting geometries, thereby creating artificial observed gaps that result in a higher calculated gap complexity. Using second-order secular theory, we compute time-averaged observed gap complexities along a favorable line of sight for a set of hypothetical systems, both with and without an outer giant. We find that these secular interactions can significantly contribute to the observed gap complexity dichotomy in tightly packed multiple-planet systems.

<title>Unraveling the Dusty Environment around RT Vir</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Infrared (IR) studies of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are critical to our understanding of the formation of cosmic dust. In this investigation, we explore the mid- to far-IR emission of the oxygen-rich AGB star RT Virginis. This optically thin dusty environment has unusual spectral features when compared to other stars in its class. To explore this enigmatic object we use the one-dimensional radiative transfer modeling code DUSTY. Modeled spectra are compared with observations from the Infrared Space Observatory, InfraRed Astronomical Satellite, the Herschel Space Observatory, and a host of other sources to determine the properties of RT Vir's circumstellar material. Our models suggest a set of two distant and cool dust shells at low optical depths (τV,inner = 0.16, τV,outer = 0.06), with inner dust temperatures T1 = 330 K, T3 = 94 K. Overall, these dust shells exhibit a chemical composition consistent with dust typically found around O-rich AGB stars. However, the distribution of materials differs significantly. The inner shell consists of a mixture of silicates, Al2O3, FeO, and Fe, while the outer shell primarily contains crystalline Al2O3 polymorphs. This chemical change is indicative of two distinct epochs of dust formation around RT Vir. These changes in dust composition are driven by either changes in the pressure–temperature conditions around the star or by a decrease in the C/O ratio due to hot-bottom burning.

<title>A Dichotomy in the 1–24 GHz Parsec-scale Radio Spectra of Radio-quiet Quasars</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada142</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the parsec-scale radio spectra of a representative sample of 13 Palomar–Green radio-quiet quasars, based on our new Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations at 8.4 and 23.6 GHz and our earlier VLBA studies at 1.5 and 5.0 GHz. The radio core emission generally exhibits a flat spectrum at 1.5–5.0 GHz, which indicates a compact optically thick synchrotron source on a scale smaller than the broad-line region (BLR) radius RBLR ∼ 0.01–0.1 pc. The 8.4–23.6 GHz spectral slope remains flat in four objects indicating the inner radius of the radio source Rin < 0.1RBLR, and becomes steep in four other objects indicating Rin ∼ 0.5 RBLR. The flat 8.4–23.6 GHz slope sources may be associated with a continuous ejection starting at the accretion disk corona. The steep 8.4–23.6 GHz slope sources may be produced by an interaction of an active-galactic-nucleus-driven wind with the BLR gas or a low-power jet extending to the BLR scale. Seven of these eight objects, which have a flat or steep 8.4–23.6 GHz slope, reside at the Eddington ratios L/LEdd < 0.3, and four of the remaining five objects, where the 8.4–23.6 GHz fluxes are too faint to significantly constrain the slope, reside at L/LEdd > 0.3. The 8.4–23.6 GHz radio emission in the high-L/LEdd objects may be weak due to more extended emission from a radiation-pressure-driven wind. Future submillimeter observations can further constrain the inward radial extent of the radio emission down to the coronal scale.

<title>HCG 57: Evidence for Shock-heated Intergalactic Gas from X-Rays and Optical Emission Line Spectroscopy</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray observations of the compact group HCG 57, and optical integral field spectroscopy of the interacting galaxy pair HCG 57A/D. These two spiral galaxies recently suffered an off-axis collision with HCG 57D passing through the disk of A. We find evidence of a gas bridge linking the galaxies, containing ∼108M⊙ of hot, ∼1 keV thermal plasma and warm ionized gas radiating in Hα, Hβ, [O iii] and [N ii] lines. The optical emission lines in the central regions of HCG 57D show excitation properties consistent with H ii-regions, while the outer rim of HCG 57D parts of the bridge and the outer regions of HCG 57A show evidence of shocked gas consistent with shock velocities of 200–300 km s−1. In contrast, the X-ray emitting gas requires a collision velocity of 650–750 km s−1 to explain the observed temperatures. These different shock velocities can be reconciled by considering the contributions of rotation to collision velocity in different parts of the disks, and the clumpy nature of the preshock medium in the galaxies, which likely lead to different shock velocities in different components of the turbulent postshocked gas. We examine the diffuse X-ray emission in the group members and their associated point sources, identifying X-ray active galactic nuclei in HCG 57A, B, and D. We also confirm the previously reported ∼1 keV intra-group medium and find it to be relaxed with a low central entropy (18.0 ± 1.7 keV cm2 within 20 kpc) but a long cooling time (5.9 ± 0.8 Gyr).

<title>Exploring the Evolution of a Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy with SPH Simulations. II. AGN Feedback</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We investigate active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback from an intermediate-mass black hole at the center of a dwarf spheroidal galaxy, by performing isolated galaxy simulations using a modified version of the GADGET-3 code. We consider Leo II (PGC 34176) in the Local Group as our simulation reference model. Beginning with black hole seeds ranging from 103−106M⊙, our simulations focus on comparing stellar/SN-only feedback with AGN+stellar/SN feedback over 13.7 Gyr of galactic evolution. Our results indicate that a low-mass AGN in a dwarf galaxy influences the star formation history under specific physical conditions. While AGN feedback is generally negative on star formation, instances of positive feedback were also identified. Despite measurable effects on the evolution of the dwarf host galaxy, black hole seeds exhibited only marginal growth. We tested several physical scenarios as modified models in our simulations, primarily concerning the dynamics of the central black holes, which may wander within dwarf galaxies rather than being centrally located. However, none of these adjustments significantly impacted the growth of the black hole seeds. This suggests that intermediate-mass black holes may struggle to achieve higher masses in isolated environments, with mergers and interactions likely playing crucial roles in their growth. Nevertheless, AGN feedback exhibited nonnegligible effects in our simulated dwarf spheroidal galaxies, despite the assumed dominant role of stellar feedback in the low-mass regime.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Dynamical interactions in dense star clusters could significantly influence the properties of black holes, leaving imprints on their gravitational-wave signatures. While previous studies have mostly focused on repeated black hole mergers for spin and mass growth, this work examines the impact of physical collisions and close encounters between black holes and (noncompact) stars. Using Monte Carlo N-body models of dense star clusters, we find that a large fraction of black holes retained upon formation undergo collisions with stars. Within our explored cluster models, the proportion of binary black hole mergers affected by stellar collisions ranges from 10%–60%. If all stellar-mass black holes are initially nonspinning, we find that up to 40% of merging binary black holes may have components with dimensionless spin parameter χ ≳ 0.2 because of prior stellar collisions, while typically about 10% have spins near χ = 0.7 from prior black hole mergers. We demonstrate that young star clusters are especially important environments, as they can produce collisions of black holes with very massive stars, allowing for significant spin-up of the black holes through accretion. Our predictions for black hole spin distributions from these stellar collisions highlight their sensitivity to accretion efficiency, underscoring the need for detailed hydrodynamic calculations to better understand the accretion physics following these interactions.

<title>The Coronal Power Spectrum from MHD Mode Conversion above Sunspots</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Sunspots are intense regions of magnetic flux that are rooted deep below the photosphere. It is well established that sunspots host magnetohydrodynamic waves, with numerous observations showing a connection to the internal acoustic (or p-)modes of the Sun. The p-modes are fast waves below the equipartition layer and are thought to undergo a double mode conversion as they propagate upward into the atmosphere of sunspots, which can generate Alfvénic modes in the upper atmosphere. We employ 2.5D magnetohydrodynamic numerical simulations to investigate the adiabatic wave propagation and examine the resulting power spectra of coronal Alfvénic waves. A broadband wave source is used, which has a 1D power spectrum mimicking aspects of the observed p-mode power spectrum. We examine magnetoacoustic wave propagation and mode conversion from the photosphere to the corona. Frequency filtering of the upwardly propagating acoustic waves is a natural consequence of a gravitationally stratified atmosphere and plays a key role in shaping the power spectra of mode-converted waves. We demonstrate that the slow and fast magnetoacoustic waves and Alfvén waves above the equipartition layer have similarly shaped power spectra, which are modified versions of the driver spectrum. Notably, the results reveal that the coronal wave power spectra have a peak at a higher frequency than that of the underlying p-mode driver. This matches observations of coronal Alfvénic waves and further supports the role of the mode conversion process as a mechanism for Alfvénic wave generation in the Sun's atmosphere.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Recent high-angular-resolution observations indicate the need for core growth to form high-mass stars. To understand the gas dynamics at the core scale in the very early evolutionary stages before being severely affected by feedback, we have conducted Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations toward a 70 μm dark massive clump, G337.541-00.082 as part of the Global and Local infall in the ASHES sample (GLASHES) program. Using dense gas tracers such as N2H+ (J = 1–0) and HNC (J = 3–2), we find signs of infall from the position–velocity diagram and more directly from the blue asymmetry profile in addition to the clump-scale velocity gradient. We estimate infall velocities from intermediate and low-mass cores to be 0.28–1.45 km s−1, and infall rates to be on the order of 10−4–10−3M⊙ yr−1, both are higher than those measured in low-mass star-forming regions by more than a factor of 5 and an order of magnitude, respectively. We find a strong correlation between the infall velocity with the nonthermal velocity dispersion, suggesting that infall may contribute significantly to the observed line width. Consistent with clump-fed scenarios, we show that the mass infall rate is larger for larger core masses and shorter distances to the clump center. Such high infall rates in cores embedded in IRDCs can be considered as strong signs of core growth, allowing high-mass star formation from intermediate-mass cores that would not initially form high-mass stars at their current mass.

Understanding which processes control atmospheric escape and the loss of water from planetary environments is crucial. The ESA’s Venus Express spacecraft has observed a significant depletion in Venus’s upper atmosphere, driven by the solar wind. In such scenarios, the electromagnetic force can accelerate planetary ions to energies that allow them to escape from the planet. However, it is extremely challenging to directly measure electromagnetic forces on planetary ions. Here we present a 3D multifluid Hall–magnetohydrodynamics simulation model to investigate electromagnetic force terms and the effects of each term on solar wind plasma and planetary ions. We find that the total electromagnetic force reaches its peak near the bow shock and the magnetic pileup boundary, with obvious asymmetric characteristics, which slows down the solar wind plasma and compresses the heavy ions toward Venus. In addition, the morphology of the convection electric field force shows obvious north–south asymmetry, which leads to the formation of asymmetric structures and plasma flows in the Venusian magnetotail. The electromagnetic force patterns obtained by simulation are consistent with the results and speculation from observations, suggesting that the multifluid model developed here has substantial capacity in further analysis regarding planetary ion escape.

The flat spectrum radio quasar PKS 1510−089 is one of the most active blazars across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, displaying periods of flaring activity. This study explores its spectral variability over a decade. By employing the nonthermal dominance parameter, we analyze the Hβ and λ5100 continuum light curves, as well as the FWHM of the Hβ emission line, to identify whether the primary source of the continuum emission is the accretion disk or the jet during activity periods. Our results show an anticorrelation between the FWHM and the luminosity of the Hβ emission line across all data sets. This indicates that variations in Hβ luminosity consistently reflect the canonical broad-line region (BLR), irrespective of whether the primary ionizing source is the accretion disk or the jet. The anticorrelation persisted when comparing the FWHM of Hβ against the luminosity at λ5100 in the disk dominance regime. These findings, along with the observation that flaring events in the λ5100 continuum, attributed to the jet, coincide with flares in the Hβ emission line, suggest that the base of the jet is located within the BLR. Based on the 219 spectra within the disk dominance regime, we estimated a mean black hole mass of MBH = 2.85 ± 0.37 × 108M⊙.

<title>Quasi-parallel Antisunward-propagating Whistler Waves Associated with the Electron Deficit in the Near-Sun Solar Wind: Particle-in-cell Simulation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In situ observations of the solar wind have shown that the electron velocity distribution function (VDF) consists of a quasi-Maxwellian core, comprising most of the electron population, and two sparser components: the halo, which are suprathermal and quasi-isotropic electrons, and an escaping beam population, the strahl. Recent Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar Orbiter (SO) observations have added one more ingredient to the known nonthermal features, the deficit—a depletion in the sunward region of the VDF, already predicted by exospheric models but never so extensively observed. By employing particle-in-cell simulations, we study electron VDFs that reproduce those typically observed in the inner heliosphere and investigate whether the electron deficit may contribute to the onset of kinetic instabilities. Previous studies and in situ observations show that strahl electrons drive oblique whistler waves unstable, which in turn scatters them. As a result, suprathermal electrons can occupy regions of phase space where they fulfill resonance conditions with the parallel-propagating whistler wave. The suprathermal electrons lose kinetic energy, resulting in the generation of unstable waves. The sunward side of the VDF, initially depleted of electrons, is gradually filled, as this wave−particle interaction process, triggered by the depletion itself, takes place. Our findings are compared and validated against current PSP and SO observations: among others, our study provides a mechanism explaining the presence in the heliosphere of regularly observed parallel antisunward whistler waves, suggests why these waves are frequently observed concomitant with distributions presenting an electron deficit, and describes a noncollisional heat flux regulating process.

<title>Precise Measurement of the Cosmic-Ray Spectrum and 〈ln A〉 by LHAASO: Connecting the Galactic to the Extragalactic Components</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Recently, the LHAASO Collaboration has provided precise measurements of the cosmic rays (CRs) all-particle energy spectrum and mean logarithmic mass from 0.3 to 30 PeV. Combining the CR measurements by AMS-02 and DAMPE in space and those by LHAASO and Auger on the ground, we construct a model to recover all these measurements from tens of GeV to tens of EeV. We find that the LHAASO measurement is crucial in the model construction by connecting the Galactic component to the extragalactic component. The precise measurements of CR spectra for individual species by AMS-02 and DAMPE together with the newest LHAASO results clearly indicate three Galactic CR components, that is, a soft low-energy background, a hard high-energy component, and a local source contribution. However, the LHAASO data show that above ∼1016 eV, a nonnegligible extra component, possibly of extragalactic origin, must be included. Combining the Auger results and the LHAASO results, we figure out the extragalactic CRs that need at least two components at lower and higher energies. Thanks to the measurements by LHAASO, the constraints on the model parameters are quite stringent. The spectrum features and mass measurements in all energy ranges are all well reproduced in the model.

<title>Analytical Verification of the Normal Vector Determination Methods for Planar Magnetic Structures</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada446</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Minimum variance analysis of magnetic fields (MVAB) is conventionally implemented to determine the normal vector of a planar magnetic structure (PMS) for which the average of the normal magnetic field component vanishes (i.e., = 0). A more suitable normal vector determination method for single-spacecraft measurements, based on the minimum variance concept, is recommended for PMS studies, namely the MVAB method associated with the constraint = 0 (MVABC). An analytical PMS model is employed to verify the performance of the MVAB and MVABC methods for three different types of PMSs, under the circumstances that the values are highly fluctuated but the remains zero. The results show that MVABC outperforms MVAB in estimating the PMS normal vector. By analyzing a large number of test data sets randomly selected from the original data set, the conclusion remains unchanged. The normal of a PMS discontinuity, which is associated with significant fluctuations, is accurately predicted by MVABC and the cross-product method, as compared to MVAB. Moreover, the normal of the discontinuity aligns with the PMS normal, as expected. Two PMS events observed by the Advanced Composition Explorer spacecraft in the sheath of an interplanetary coronal mass ejection are presented. From the MVAB perspective, these two events are not classified as PMSs. The estimated normals of the in situ PMS discontinuities from the cross-product method form angles between 10° and 20° with the predicted PMS normals from MVABC. Discussions are given regarding the failure of the MVAB method in PMS identification.

<title>Merger Response of Halo Anisotropy Properties</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada4aa</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Anisotropy properties—halo spin, shape, position offset, velocity offset, and orientation—are an important family of dark matter halo properties that indicate the level of directional variation of the internal structures of halos. These properties reflect the dynamical state of halos, which in turn depends on the mass assembly history. In this work, we study the evolution of anisotropy properties in response to merger activity using the IllustrisTNG simulations. We find that the response trajectories of the anisotropy properties significantly deviate from secular evolution. These trajectories have the same qualitative features and timescales across a wide range of merger and host properties. We propose explanations for the behavior of these properties and connect their evolution to the relevant stages of merger dynamics. We measure the relevant dynamical timescales. We also explore the dependence of the strength of the response on time of merger, merger ratio, and mass of the main halo. These results provide insight into the physics of halo mergers and their effects on the statistical behavior of halo properties. This study paves the way toward a physical understanding of scaling relations, particularly to how systematics in their scatter are connected to the mass assembly histories of halos.

<title>PUI Heating in the Supersonic Solar Wind</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada891</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada891</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The outer heliosphere is profoundly influenced by nonthermal energetic pickup ions (PUIs), which dominate the internal pressure of the solar wind beyond ~10 au, surpassing both solar wind and magnetic pressures. PUIs are formed mostly through charge exchange between interstellar neutral atoms and solar wind ions. This study examines the apparent heating of PUIs in the distant supersonic solar wind before reaching the heliospheric termination shock. New Horizons’ SWAP observations reveal an unexpected PUI temperature change between 2015 and 2020, with a notable bump in PUI temperature. Concurrent observations from the ACE and Wind spacecraft at 1 au indicate a ~50% increase in solar wind dynamic pressure at the end of 2014. Our simulation suggests that the bump observed in the PUI temperature by New Horizons is largely associated with the enhanced solar wind dynamic pressure observed at 1 au. Additional PUI temperature enhancements imply the involvement of other heating mechanisms. Analysis of New Horizons data reveals a correlation between shocks and PUI heating during the declining phase of the solar cycle. Using a PUI-mediated plasma model, we explore shock structures and PUI heating, finding that shocks preferentially heat PUIs over the thermal solar wind in the outer heliosphere. We also show that the broad shock thickness observed by New Horizons is due to the large diffusion coefficient associated with PUIs. Shocks and compression regions in the distant supersonic solar wind lead to elevated PUI temperatures and thus they can increase the production of energetic neutral atoms with large energy.

<title>Enhancing Mars Gravity Field Solutions with China’s Tianwen-1 Tracking Data</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The Tianwen-1 (TW1) mission, which successfully entered Mars's orbit in 2021, provides a valuable data set for enhancing the understanding of Mars’s gravity field. The highly elliptical near-polar orbit of the TW1 orbiter offers unique sensitivity to long-wavelength gravity signals, complementing the contributions of low-altitude missions like the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). In this study, we used 4 months of TW1 radio tracking data in combination with MRO data to develop a new Mars gravity field model up to degree and order 50. We evaluated the improvement of gravity field determination through power spectrum analysis, gravity anomaly maps, and trajectory precision assessment. The result shows significant improvements in accuracy up to degree and order 30, with an average enhancement of 38% in the zonal harmonic coefficients. There are obvious differences between the two gravity field models in gravity anomaly maps. The range of gravity anomaly errors improves after incorporating TW1 data, with the maximum error decreasing from 53.4 to 46.4 mGal and the average error improving from 8.4 to 7.3 mGal. Additionally, orbit determination experiments confirm that the fused gravity field model enhances trajectory modeling for both MRO and TW1. These findings highlight the scientific value of TW1 tracking data in advancing Mars’s gravity field modeling and provide critical insights for future deep-space missions.

<title>Sledgehamr: Simulating Scalar Fields with Adaptive Mesh Refinement</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Understanding the nonlinear dynamics of coupled scalar fields often necessitates simulations on a 3D mesh. These simulations can be computationally expensive if a large scale separation is involved. A common solution is adaptive mesh refinement, which, however, greatly increases a simulation's complexity. In this work, we present sledgehamr, an AMReX-based code package to make the simulation of coupled scalar fields on an adaptive mesh more accessible. Compatible with both GPU and CPU clusters, sledgehamr offers a flexible and customizable framework. While the code had been primarily developed to evolve axion string networks, this framework enables various other applications, such as the study of gravitational waves sourced by the dynamics of scalar fields.

<title>Not Just Winds: Why Models Find That Binary Black Hole Formation Is Metallicity-dependent, while Binary Neutron Star Formation Is Not</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada14a</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada14a</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Both detailed and rapid population studies alike predict that binary black hole (BHBH) formation is orders of magnitude more efficient at low metallicity than high metallicity, while binary neutron star (NSNS) formation remains mostly flat with metallicity, and black hole–neutron star mergers show intermediate behavior. This finding is a key input to employ double compact objects as tracers of low-metallicity star formation, as spectral sirens, and for merger rate calculations. Yet the literature offers various (sometimes contradicting) explanations for these trends. We investigate the dominant cause for the metallicity dependence of double compact object formation. We find that the BHBH formation efficiency at low metallicity is set by initial condition distributions, and conventional simulations suggest that about one in eight interacting binary systems with sufficient mass to form black holes will lead to a merging BHBH. We further find that the significance of metallicities in double compact object formation is a question of formation channel. The stable mass transfer and chemically homogeneous evolution channels mainly diminish at high metallicities due to changes in stellar radii, while the common envelope channel is primarily impacted by the combined effects of stellar winds and mass-scaled natal kicks. Outdated giant wind prescriptions exacerbate the latter effect, suggesting that BHBH formation may be much less metallicity-dependent than previously assumed. NSNS formation efficiency remains metallicity-independent, as they form exclusively through the common envelope channel, with natal kicks that are assumed to be uncorrelated with mass. Forthcoming gravitational-wave observations will provide valuable constraints on these findings.

<title>Constraining Solar Wind Transport Model Parameters Using Bayesian Analysis</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9f2f</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We apply nested-sampling Bayesian analysis to a model for the transport of magnetohydrodynamic-scale solar wind fluctuations. The dual objectives are to obtain improved constraints on parameters present in the turbulence transport model (TTM) and to support quantitative comparisons of the quality of distinct versions of the transport model. The TTMs analyzed are essentially the 1D steady-state ones presented in Breech et al. that describe the radial evolution of the energy, correlation length, and normalized cross helicity of the fluctuations, together with the proton temperature, in prescribed background solar wind fields. Modeled effects present in the TTM include nonlinear turbulence interactions, shear driving, and energy injection associated with pickup-ions. Each of these modeled effects involves adjustable parameters that we seek to constrain using Bayesian analysis. We find that, given the TTMs and observational data sets analyzed, the most appropriate TTM to recommend corresponds to 2D fluctuations and has von Kármán–Howarth parameters of α ≈ 0.16 and β ≈ 0.10, along with reasonably standard values for the other adjustable parameters. The analysis also indicates that it is advantageous to include pickup ion effects in the lengthscale evolution equation by assuming Z2β/αλ is locally conserved. Such Bayesian analysis is readily extended to more sophisticated solar wind models, space weather models, and might lead to improved predictions of, for example, solar flare and coronal mass ejection interactions with the Earth.

<title>Planet–Planet Scattering and Von Zeipel–Lidov–Kozai Migration—The Dynamical History of HAT-P-11</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The two planets of the HAT-P-11 system represent fascinating dynamical puzzles due to their significant eccentricities and orbital misalignments. In particular, HAT-P-11 b is in a close-in orbit in which tides should have circularized well within the age of the system. Here we propose a two-step dynamical process that can reproduce all intriguing aspects of the system. We first invoke planet–planet scattering to generate significant eccentricities and mutual inclinations between the planets. We then propose that this misalignment initiated von-Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai cycles and high-eccentricity migration that ultimately brought HAT-P-11 b to its present-day orbit. We find that this scenario is fully consistent only when significant tidally driven radius inflation is accounted for during the tidal migration. We present a suite of N-body simulations exploring each phase of evolution and show that this scenario is consistent with all observational posteriors and the reported age of the system.

<title>3D Convective Urca Process in a Simmering White Dwarf</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A proposed setting for thermonuclear (Type Ia) supernovae is a white dwarf that has gained mass from a companion to the point of carbon ignition in the core. In the early stages of carbon burning, called the simmering phase, energy released by the reactions in the core drive the formation and growth of a core convection zone. One aspect of this phase is the convective Urca process, a linking of weak nuclear reactions to convection, which may alter the composition and structure of the white dwarf. The convective Urca process is not well understood and requires 3D fluid simulations to properly model the turbulent convection, an inherently 3D process. Because the neutron excess of the fluid both sets and is set by the extent of the convection zone, the realistic steady state can only be determined in simulations with real 3D mixing processes. Additionally, the convection is relatively slow (Mach number less than 0.005) and thus a low Mach number method is needed to model the flow over many convective turnovers. Using the MAESTROeX low Mach number hydrodynamic software, we present the first full-star 3D simulations of the A = 23 convective Urca process, spanning hundreds of convective turnover times. Our findings on the extent of mixing across the Urca shell, the characteristic velocities of the flow, the energy-loss rates due to neutrino emission, and the structure of the convective boundary can be used to inform 1D stellar models that track the longer-timescale evolution.

<title>Extreme Scale Height Variations and Nozzle Shocks in Warped Disks</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9a85</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Accretion disks around both stellar-mass and supermassive black holes (BHs) are likely often warped. Whenever a disk is warped, its scale height varies with azimuth. Sufficiently strong warps cause extreme compressions of the scale height, which fluid parcels “bounce” off of twice per orbit to high latitudes. We study the dynamics of strong warps using (i) the nearly analytic “ring theory” of Fairbairn & Ogilvie, which we generalize to the Kerr metric, and (ii) three-dimensional general-relativistic hydrodynamic simulations of tori (“rings”) around BHs, using the H-AMR code. We initialize a ring with a warp and study its evolution on tens of orbital periods. The simulations agree excellently with the ring theory until the warp amplitude, ψ, reaches a critical value ψc. When ψ > ψc, the rings enter the bouncing regime. We analytically derive (and numerically validate) that in the non-Keplerian regime, where rg = GM/c2 is the gravitational radius, and M is the mass of the central object. Whenever the scale height bounces, the vertical velocity becomes supersonic, leading to “nozzle shocks” as gas collides at the scale height minima. Nozzle shocks damp the warp within ≈10–20 orbits, which is not captured by the ring theory. Nozzle shock dissipation leads to inflow timescales 1–2 orders of magnitude shorter than unwarped α disks, which may result in rapid variability, such as in changing-look active galactic nuclei or in the soft state of X-ray binaries. We propose that steady disks with strong warps may self-regulate to have amplitudes near ψc.

<title>The M BH–M ∗ Relation up to z ∼ 2 through Decomposition of COSMOS-Web NIRCam Images</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Our knowledge of relations between supermassive black holes and their host galaxies at z ≳ 1 is still limited, even though being actively sought out to z ∼ 6. Here, we use the high resolution and sensitivity of JWST to measure the host galaxy properties for 107 X-ray-selected type-I active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at 0.68 < z < 2.5 with rest-frame optical/near-infrared imaging from COSMOS-Web and PRIMER. Black hole masses ( ) are available from previous spectroscopic campaigns. We extract the host galaxy components from four NIRCam broadband images and the Hubble Space Telescope/Advanced Camera for Surveys F814W image by applying a 2D image decomposition technique. We detect the host galaxy for ∼90% of the sample after subtracting the unresolved AGN emission. With host photometry free of AGN emission, we determine the stellar mass of the host galaxies to be through spectral energy distribution fitting and measure the evolution of the mass relation between SMBHs and their host galaxies. Considering selection biases and measurement uncertainties, we find that the MBH/M*ratio evolves as thus remains essentially constant or exhibits mild evolution up to z ∼ 2.5. We also see an amount of scatter ( ), similar to the local relation and consistent with low-z studies, and a noncausal cosmic assembly history where mergers contribute to the statistical averaging toward the local relation is still feasible. We highlight improvements to come with larger samples from JWST and, particularly, Euclid, which will exceed the statistical power of current wide and deep surveys.

The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission identified a potential 0.88R⊕ planet with a period of 7.577 days, orbiting the nearby M1V star GJ 341 (TOI 741.01). This system has already been observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to search for presence of an atmosphere on this planet. Here, we present an in-depth analysis of the GJ 341 system using all available public data. We provide improved parameters for the host star, an updated value of the planet radius, and support the planetary nature of the object (now GJ 341 b). We use 57 HARPS radial velocities to model the magnetic cycle and activity of the host star, and constrain the mass of GJ 341 b to upper limits of 4.0 M⊕ (3σ) and 2.9 M⊕ (1σ). We also rule out the presence of additional companions with M sin i > 15.1 M⊕, and P < 1750 days, and the presence of contaminating background objects during the TESS and JWST observations. These results provide key information to aid the interpretation of the recent JWST atmospheric observations and other future observations of this planet.

<title>Identifying Galactic Substructures in 5D Space Using All-sky RR Lyrae Stars in Gaia DR3</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Motivated by the vast gap between photometric and spectroscopic data volumes, there is great potential in using 5D kinematic information to identify and study substructures of the Milky Way. We identify substructures in the Galactic halo using 46,575 RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) from Gaia Data Release 3, with photometric metallicities and distances newly estimated by X.-Y. Li et al. Assuming a Gaussian prior distribution of radial velocity, we calculate the orbital distribution characterized by the integrals of motion for each RRL, based on its 3D positions, proper motions, and corresponding errors, and then apply the friends-of-friends algorithm to identify groups moving along similar orbits. We have identified several known substructures, including the Sagittarius stream, the Hercules-Aquila Cloud (HAC), the Virgo Overdensity (VOD), Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage (GES), the Orphan-Chenab stream, Cetus-Palca, the Helmi streams, Sequoia, Wukong, and the Large Magellanic Cloud leading arm, as well as 18 unknown groups. Our findings indicate that the HAC and VOD have kinematic and chemical properties remarkably similar to GES, with most HAC and VOD members exhibiting eccentricity as high as GES, suggesting that they may share a common origin with GES. The ability to identify low-mass and spatially dispersed substructures further demonstrates the potential of our method, which breaks the limit of spectroscopic surveys and is competent for probing substructures throughout the whole Galaxy. Finally, we also identify 18 unknown groups with good spatial clustering and proper-motion consistency, suggesting the possibility of further excavation of Milky Way substructures in the future with only 5D data.

<title>Causal Discovery in Astrophysics: Unraveling Supermassive Black Hole and Galaxy Coevolution</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Correlation does not imply causation, but patterns of statistical association between variables can be exploited to infer a causal structure (even with purely observational data) with the burgeoning field of causal discovery. As a purely observational science, astrophysics has much to gain by exploiting these new methods. The supermassive black hole (SMBH)–galaxy interaction has long been constrained by observed scaling relations, which is low-scatter correlations between variables such as SMBH mass and the central velocity dispersion of stars in a host galaxy's bulge. This study, using advanced causal discovery techniques and an up-to-date data set, reveals a causal link between galaxy properties and dynamically measured SMBH masses. We apply a score-based Bayesian framework to compute the exact conditional probabilities of every causal structure that could possibly describe our galaxy sample. With the exact posterior distribution, we determine the most likely causal structures and notice a probable causal reversal when separating galaxies by morphology. In elliptical galaxies, bulge properties (built from major mergers) tend to influence SMBH growth, while, in spiral galaxies, SMBHs are seen to affect host galaxy properties, potentially through feedback in gas-rich environments. For spiral galaxies, SMBHs progressively quench star formation, whereas, in elliptical galaxies, quenching is complete, and the causal connection has reversed. Our findings support theoretical models of hierarchical assembly of galaxies and active galactic nuclei feedback regulating galaxy evolution. Our study suggests the potentiality for further exploration of causal links in astrophysical and cosmological scaling relations, as well as any other observational science.

<title>Spectral Energy Distribution Variability of the Blazar OJ 287 During 2009–2021</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Using nearly simultaneous radio, near-infrared, optical, and ultraviolet (UV) data collected since 2009, we constructed 106 spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the blazar OJ 287. These SEDs are well fitted by a log-parabolic model. By classifying the data into “flare” and “quiescent” segments, we find that the median flux at the peak frequency of the SEDs during the flare segments is 0.37 ± 0.22 dex higher compared to the quiescent segments, while no significant differences are observed in the median values of the curvature parameter b or the peak frequency . A significant bluer-when-brighter trend is confirmed through the relation between the V magnitude and B − V color index, with this trend being stronger in the flare segments. Additionally, a significant anticorrelation is detected between and b, with a slope of 5.79 in the relation between 1/b and , closer to the prediction from a statistical acceleration model than a stochastic acceleration interpretation, though a notable discrepancy persists. This discrepancy indicates that additional factors—such as deviations from idealized conditions or radiative contributions, such as the thermal emission from the accretion disk in the optical–UV range during quiescent states—may play a role in producing the observed steeper slope. Within the framework of the statistical acceleration mechanism, the lack of correlation between the change in the peak intensity and the change in the peak frequency suggests that the change in the electron energy distribution is unlikely to be responsible for the time-dependent SED changes. Instead, changes in Doppler boosting or magnetic fields may have a greater influence.

<title>A New Approach to Identifying Red Supergiant Stars in Metal-poor Galaxies: A Case Study of NGC 6822</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A complete sample of red supergiant (RSG) stars is important for studying their properties. Identifying RSGs in extragalactic fields first requires removing the Galactic foreground dwarfs. The color–color diagram (CCD) method, specifically using r − z/z − H and J − H/H − K, has proven successful in several studies. However, in metal-poor galaxies, faint RSGs will mix into the dwarf branch in the CCD and would be removed, leading to an incomplete RSG sample. This work attempts to improve the CCD method in combination with the Gaia astrometric measurement to remove foreground contamination in order to construct a complete RSG sample in metal-poor galaxies. The empirical regions of RSGs in both CCDs are defined and modified by fitting the locations of RSGs in galaxies with a range of metallicity. The metal-poor galaxy NGC 6822 is taken as a case study for its low metallicity ([Fe/H] ≈ −1.0) and moderate distance (about 500 kpc). In the complete sample, we identify 1184 RSG, 1559 oxygen-rich AGB (O-AGBs), 1075 carbon-rich AGB (C-AGBs), and 140 extreme AGB (x-AGBs) candidates, with a contamination rate of approximately 20.5%, 9.7%, 6.8%, and 5.0%, respectively. We also present a pure sample, containing only the sources away from the dwarf branch, which includes 843 RSG, 1519 O-AGB, 1059 C-AGB, and 140 x-AGB candidates, with a contamination rate of approximately 6.5%, 8.8%, 6.1%, and 5.0%, respectively. About 600 and 450 RSG candidates are newly identified in the complete and pure samples, respectively, compared to the previous RSG sample in NGC 6822.

<title>Dynamics and Energetics of Resistive, Thermally Conductive, and Radiative Plasma in Coronal Current Sheets due to Asymmetric External Perturbation</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada1d6</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We study the asymmetric interaction of wave-like velocity perturbation with a coronal current sheet (CS) in the presence of resistivity, thermal conduction (TC), and radiative cooling (RC). We analyze the dynamics and energetics of the CS in four cases, namely, (i) no energy loss, (ii) TC only, (iii) RC only, and (iv) TC+RC. Before fragmentation, thinning and elongation of the CS are found to be identical in all four cases and therefore independent of the presence or absence of energy loss effects. Onset times, corresponding Lundquist numbers, and aspect ratios suggest that TC advances the onset of fragmentation while RC has the opposite effect in comparison to the absence of energy losses. Reconnection takes place at a higher rate in the presence of TC and TC+RC in the tearing unstable CS. Speeds of plasmoids are also found to be higher under the effect of TC and TC+RC. In the presence of TC and TC+RC, average density becomes higher within the tearing unstable CS than in the other two cases. As expected, the estimated average temperature is increasing with the highest and lowest rates in the absence of energy losses and in the presence of both TC and RC, respectively. After the onset of fragmentation, the rate of decrement of average magnetic energy density and increment of average kinetic energy density becomes higher in the presence of TC and TC+RC than in the other two cases. Thus, we conclude that the presence of energy-loss mechanisms critically influences the dynamics, energetics, and plasmoid formation within a reconnecting coronal CS.

<title>Nonthermal Velocities in a Solar Active Region Observed by SERTS</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada24d</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada24d</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present measurements of coronal nonthermal Doppler velocities in NOAA Active Region 7870 observed by the Solar EUV Research Telescope and Spectrograph during its 1995 sounding rocket flight (SERTS-95). The instrument included a multilayer-coated toroidal diffraction grating that enhanced its sensitivity in second order at wavelengths between about 171 and 225 Å. Analyses of spectra from this flight were previously published but did not address the issue of nonthermal velocities; we do so here for spectra averaged over the 123 8 segment of the slit for which the brightest portion of the region observed by SERTS was recorded. All emission lines are fit with Gaussian profiles. With post-flight laboratory spectra of He ii and Ne II-IIINe we derive a first-order instrumental width (full width at half-maximum intensity) of Finst,1 = 50.6 ± 3.1 mÅ and a second-order instrumental width of Finst,2 = 25.3 ±1.5 mÅ. For emission lines of Fe x−Fe xv, formed at 6.05 ≤ log T(K) ≤ 6.35, we find nonthermal velocities between 26.1 and 35.0 km s−1, independent of temperature; this range corresponds to Vnonth = 30.6 ± 4.5 km s−1. For the two unblended Fe xii lines at 192.394 and 193.509 Å closest to the maximum sensitivity of SERTS-95, we have Vnonth = 33.7 ± 1.3 km s−1. When solar observations are used to derive or confirm instrumental widths for spectrometers in orbit, those observations should compensate for nonthermal velocities such as the ones reported here in order to extract instrumental widths that are free of nonthermal broadening.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
From >1000 orbits of HST imaging, we present deep homogeneous resolved star color–magnitude diagrams that reach the oldest main-sequence turnoff and uniformly measured star formation histories (SFHs) of 36 dwarf galaxies (−6 ≥ MV ≥ −17) associated with the M31 halo, and for 10 additional fields in M31, M33, and the Giant Stellar Stream. From our SFHs, we find: (i) The median stellar age and quenching epoch of M31 satellites correlate with galaxy luminosity and galactocentric distance. Satellite luminosity and present-day distance from M31 predict the satellite quenching epoch to within 1.8 Gyr at all epochs. This tight relationship highlights the fundamental connection between satellite halo mass, environmental history, and star formation duration. (ii) There is no difference between the median SFH of galaxies on and off the great plane of Andromeda satellites. (iii) ~50% of our M31 satellites show prominent ancient star formation (>12 Gyr ago) followed by delayed quenching (8–10 Gyr ago), which is not commonly observed among the MW satellites. (iv) A comparison with TNG50 and FIRE-2 simulated satellite dwarfs around M31-like hosts shows that some of these trends (dependence of SFH on satellite luminosity) are reproduced in the simulations while others (dependence of SFH on galactocentric distance, presence of the delayed-quenching population) are weaker or absent. We provide all photometric catalogs and SFHs as High-Level Science Products on MAST.

<title>Ion Charge States from a Global Time-dependent Wave-turbulence-driven Model of the Solar Wind: Comparison with in Situ Measurements</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada253</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Solar wind charge-state measurements contain a wealth of knowledge related to the properties of the solar corona from where they originated. However, their interpretation has remained challenging because it convolves coronal temperature, density, and velocity along the particles’ trajectory through the corona before they “freeze in” and are convected outward through the solar wind. In this study, we calculate ion charge states by coupling a nonequilibrium ionization model with a global magnetohydrodynamic model of the corona and inner heliosphere. We present results for two periods characteristic of solar minimum and maximum and compare them with observations from the ACE spacecraft. We find that the model reproduces the essential features of the observations, rectifying an earlier inconsistency that was apparent in 1D calculations, and allows us to unambiguously trace the evolution of charge states from the base of the corona into the solar wind.

<title>Constraining Solar Emission Radius at 42 MHz During the 2024 Total Solar Eclipse Using a Student-commissioned Radio Telescope</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada26e</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada26e</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Low-frequency solar radio emission is sourced in the solar corona, with sub-100 MHz radio emission largely originating from the ∼105 K plasma around 2 optical radii. However, the region of emission has yet to be constrained at 35–45 MHz due to both instrumentation limitations and the rarity of astronomical events, such as total solar eclipses, which allow for direct observational approaches. In this work, we present the results from a student-led project to commission a low-frequency radio telescope array situated in the path of totality of the 2024 total solar eclipse in an effort to probe the middle corona. The Deployable Low-Band Ionosphere and Transient Experiment (DLITE) is a low-frequency radio array comprised of four dipole antennas, optimized to observe at 35–45 MHz, and capable of resolving the brightest radio sources in the sky. We constructed a DLITE station in Observatory Park, a dark-sky park in Montville, Ohio. Results of observations during the total solar eclipse demonstrate that DLITE stations can be quickly deployed for observations and provide constraints on the radius of solar emission at our center observing frequency of 42 MHz. In this work, we outline the construction of DLITE Ohio and the solar observation results from the total solar eclipse that transversed North America in 2024 April.

<title>A New Interpretation for the Hot Corona in Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada35e</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada35e</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work attempts to provide a new interpretation for the hot corona in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). A thin parabolic magnetic reconnection layer, anchored at the innermost disk and extending along the boundary of the magnetic tower for a few tens of gravitational radii, serves as a hard-X-ray source above the disk. Within this reconnection layer, the tearing instability leads to the formation of a chain of plasmoids, which contain relativistic electrons that generate X-ray radiation through inverse-Compton (IC) scattering of soft photons emitted by the accretion disk. Based on previous theoretical works and numerical simulations, we develop a heuristic framework to parameterize the geometry and magnetization of the reconnection layer, as well as to compute both the power of the IC-scattering radiation and the height of the reconnection layer. Our model allows for a quantitative investigation of the relation between the height of the corona and the X-ray radiation luminosity, which can be directly compared against the observed relation from X-ray reverberation mapping of individual AGNs. The theoretical results are in good agreement with the observations of IRAS 13224-3809, indicating the validation of our model.

<title>Ellipticities of Galaxy Cluster Halos from Halo–Shear–Shear Correlations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report the first detection of the halo ellipticities of galaxy clusters by applying the halo–shear–shear correlations (HSSCs), without the necessity of using major axis determination. We use the Fourier_Quad shear catalog based on the Hyper Suprime-Cam Survey and the group catalog from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Legacy Surveys for the measurement of group/cluster lensing and HSSC. Our analysis includes off-centering effects. We obtain the average projected ellipticity of dark matter halos with mass within a 1.3 virial radius to be . We divide the sample into two groups based on mass and redshift, and we find that halos with higher mass tend to exhibit increased ellipticity. We also reveal that high-richness halos have larger ellipticities, confirming the physical picture from numerical simulation that high-richness halos have a dynamical youth and more active mass accretion phase.

<title>Bulk Motions in the Black Hole Jet Sheath as a Candidate for the Comptonizing Corona</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada385</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada385</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Using two-dimensional general relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we investigate the properties of the sheath separating the black hole jet from the surrounding medium. We find that the electromagnetic power flowing through the jet sheath is comparable to the overall accretion power of the black hole. The sheath is an important site of energy dissipation as revealed by the copious appearance of reconnection layers and plasmoid chains. About 20% of the sheath power is dissipated between 2 and 10 gravitational radii. The plasma in the dissipative sheath moves along a nearly paraboloidal surface with transrelativistic bulk motions dominated by the radial component, whose dimensionless 4-velocity is ∼1.2 ± 0.5. In the frame moving with the mean (radially dependent) velocity, the distribution of stochastic bulk motions resembles a Maxwellian with an “effective bulk temperature” of ∼100 keV. Scaling the global simulation to Cygnus X-1 parameters gives a rough estimate of the Thomson optical depth across the jet sheath, ∼0.01–0.1, and it may increase in future magnetohydrodynamic simulations with self-consistent radiative losses. These properties suggest that the dissipative jet sheath may be a viable “coronal” region, capable of upscattering seed soft photons into a hard, nonthermal tail, as seen during the hard states of X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei.

<title>Inner-heliospheric Signatures of Steadily Declining Solar Magnetic Fields and Their Possible Implications</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We examined solar photospheric magnetic fields for the solar cycles 21–25, covering the period 1975–2024. The unsigned photospheric magnetic fields at low latitudes (0°–45°), known as solar toroidal fields, showed a solar cycle variation with the total field strength being stronger during the maximum of cycle 25 than the maximum of cycle 24. However, the unsigned field strength of photospheric magnetic fields at high latitudes (45°–78°), known as solar polar fields, has shown a significant steady decline since around the mid-1990s. The unsigned field strength of solar polar fields, after an increase during 2015–2020, has declined again until 2024, continuing the declining trend for a long 30 yr. Also, we examined the solar wind microturbulence levels in the inner heliosphere (0.2–0.8 au), using interplanetary scintillation observations at 327 MHz, covering the period 1983–2022, that steadily declined since the mid-1990s and continued until 2022, synchronously with the solar polar fields. We found that the floor level in both solar toroidal fields and solar wind magnetic fields was reduced during the minimum of cycle 23 and recovered back during the minimum of cycle 24. In addition, a hemispherically asymmetric solar polar reversal was evident in the signed (axial) solar polar fields during cycles 21–25, with the reversal in cycle 25 for the northern hemisphere already completed but the same for the southern hemisphere yet to be completed. We discuss the implications of the long declining trend and other anomalies in solar cycle activity.

<title>Angular Power Spectrum of TeV–PeV Cosmic-Ray Anisotropies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Simulations of the cosmic-ray (CR) anisotropy down to TeV energies are presented, using turbulence parameters consistent with those inferred from observations of the interstellar medium. We compute the angular power spectra Cℓ of the CR anisotropy obtained from the simulations. We demonstrate that the amplitude of the large-scale gradient in the CR density profile affects only the overall normalization of the Cℓ values, without affecting the shape of the angular power spectrum. We show that the power spectrum depends on CR energy and that it is sensitive to the location of the observer at small ℓ. It is found to flatten at large ℓ and can be modeled by a broken power law, exhibiting a break at ℓ ≈ 4. Our computed power spectrum at ~10 TeV fits well HAWC and IceCube measurements. Moreover, we calculate all coefficients of the spherical harmonics and compute the component of the angular power spectrum projected onto the direction of the local magnetic field line. We find that deviations from gyrotropy become increasingly important at higher CR energies and larger values of ℓ.

<title>Pulsar Scattering as a Probe for Structures in the Interstellar Medium</title>

Due to the inhomogeneity of electron number density, radio waves emitted by pulsars undergo scattering as they pass through the interstellar medium (ISM). However, a connection between large-scale pulsar scattering data and the structure of the Galactic ISM has yet to be established. In this paper, we explore the capability of pulsar scattering time data in discovering structures in the ISM. Using a large data set of scattering time measurements for 473 pulsars, we fit the pulsar reduced scattering intensity as a function of Galactic latitude and distance, constructing a smooth model of the Galactic pulsar scattering distribution. By comparing this smooth distribution with observational data, we identify two ISM structures responsible for pulsar scattering, one is associated with the Vela supernova remnant region within the Gum Nebula, while the other is a newly discovered structure—a distant superbubble, G38, located at a distance of 2.3 kpc with a size of ~50 pc. Analysis of the correlation coefficient of the pulsar scattering distribution shows that the correlation is dominated by structures smaller than 0.15 kpc—the closest separation approachable by the current data set. As measurements of the pulsar scattering time continue to increase in the future, they can potentially become an independent tool for exploring structures in the ISM.

<title>Ubiquitous Small-scale Extreme-ultraviolet Upflow-like Events above Network Regions Observed by the Solar Orbiter/Extreme Ultraviolet Imager</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Universal small-scale solar activity in the quiet region is suggested to be a potential source of solar wind and the upper solar atmosphere. Here, with the high-resolution 174 Å imaging observations from the Solar Orbiter/Extreme Ultraviolet Imager, we investigate 59 EUV upflow-like events observed in the quiet Sun. Their average apparent (plane-of-sky) velocity, lifetime, and propagation distance are measured as 62 km s−1, 68.6 s, and 3.94 Mm, respectively. These upflow-like events exhibit dynamic characteristics but lack base brightening, featuring a hot front and subsequent cold plasma ejection. A total of 39% of the EUV upflow-like events exhibit recurrent characteristics. Unprecedented high-resolution 174 Å observations reveal that some EUV upflow-like events exhibit blob-like fine structures and multistrand evolutionary features, and some upflow-like events can cause localized haze-like plasma heating ahead of their spire region during the ejection process. A subset of the EUV upflow-like events covered by the Solar Dynamics Observatory reveals that they appear at the chromospheric networks. Through emission measure analysis, we found that these upflow-like events eject hot plasma of transient region or coronal temperature (an average of ~105.5 K). We suggest that EUV upflow-like events may be EUV counterparts of chromospheric spicules and/or transition region network jets and play a role in heating the localized corona above the network regions.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Polarization spectra were predicted within the photosphere model. To seek more clues to distinguish between the models, both the time-resolved and time-integrated polarization spectra from optical band to MeV gamma-rays of the magnetic reconnection model are studied here. There are two newly found differences between the two models. First, the time-integrated polarization degree of the magnetic reconnection model would in general increase with frequency for on-axis observations, while it is not monotonous for the photosphere model. Second, the variations of both the time-integrated and the time-resolved polarization angles (PAs) with frequency of the magnetic reconnection model are not random, while the time-integrated PA varies randomly with frequency for the photosphere model. Therefore, future energy-resolved polarization analysis could distinguish between the two models. In addition, the PA rotation spectra are studied for the first time. The rotation value of PA within the burst duration will decrease with the increase of the observational energy band. Most significant PA rotation would happen for slightly off-axis observations in each energy band. The PA would rotate even for on-axis observations in the optical band. Compared with the aligned magnetic field case, the PA rotation is quite rare in the gamma-ray band for the case with a toroidal field in the radiation region.

<title>Impacts and Statistical Mitigation of Missing Data on the 21 cm Power Spectrum: A Case Study with the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The precise characterization and mitigation of systematic effects is one of the biggest roadblocks impeding the detection of the fluctuations of cosmological 21 cm signals. Missing data in radio cosmological experiments, often due to radio frequency interference (RFI), pose a particular challenge to power spectrum analysis as this could lead to the ringing of bright foreground modes in the Fourier space, heavily contaminating the cosmological signals. Here we show that the problem of missing data becomes even more arduous in the presence of systematic effects. Using a realistic numerical simulation, we demonstrate that partially flagged data combined with systematic effects can introduce significant foreground ringing. We show that such an effect can be mitigated through inpainting the missing data. We present a rigorous statistical framework that incorporates the process of inpainting missing data into a quadratic estimator of the 21 cm power spectrum. Under this framework, the uncertainties associated with our inpainting method and its impact on power spectrum statistics can be understood. These results are applied to the latest Phase II observations taken by the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array, forming a crucial component in power spectrum analyses as we move toward detecting 21 cm signals in the ever more noisy RFI environment.

<title>Streaming Torque with Turbulent Diffusion</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Fast type I migration of (proto)planets poses a challenging problem for the core accretion formation scenario. We found that the dust-induced “Streaming Torque” (ST) may slow down or even reverse the planet migration in Q. Hou & C. Yu. But in realistic protoplanetary disks, dust diffusion induced by gas turbulence may have important influences on ST. We perform linear analysis to investigate the effects of dust diffusion on ST. The dependence of ST on dust diffusion may provide better constraints on the turbulence strength and the stopping time τ. We derive the dispersion relation for all the wave modes in the two-fluid system. The dust diffusion will smooth the short-wavelength structure of the the quasi-drift mode and split it into two predominant D-drift modes with opposite directions. The outgoing D-drift mode will contribute to a negative torque on planets, particularly when τ ∼ 0.1, which slightly shifts the zero-torque turning point. We explore how ST depends on the regimes of aerodynamic drag, dust mass fraction, and disk scale height. We compare the radial wavenumbers of D-drift modes under different formulations of dust diffusion and find qualitative agreement. In all cases, τ at the zero-torque turning point, which determines the direction of planetary migration, consistently remains on the order of ∼0.1, corresponding to large pebble-sized dust grains. This suggests that rapid dust coagulation can inhibit the inward migration of planets, implying that weak gas turbulence may enhance the survival of protoplanets.

<title>Constraints on Primordial Black Holes from N eff: Scalar-induced Gravitational Waves as an Extra Radiation Component</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In 2023 June, multiple pulsar timing array collaborations provided evidence for the existence of a stochastic gravitational-wave background. Scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs), as one of the most likely sources of stochastic gravitational waves, have received widespread attention. When primordial curvature perturbations on small scales are sufficiently large, primordial black holes (PBHs) inevitably form, concurrently producing SIGWs with significant observable effects. These SIGWs can serve as an additional radiation component, influencing the relativistic degrees of freedom Neff. Taking into account primordial non-Gaussianity, we study the energy density spectrum of SIGWs up to the third order and use the current observational data of Neff to constrain small-scale primordial curvature perturbations and the abundance of PBHs.

<title>Jetted Seyfert Galaxies at z = 0: Simulating Feedback Effects on Galactic Morphology and Beyond</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We use high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations to model feedback from Seyfert-type supermassive black hole (SMBH) jets onto galaxies with identical dark matter (DM) halos of log M/M⊙ ∼ 11.8. The low-mass, ∼106M⊙, seed SMBHs have been introduced when the parent DM halos have reached log M/M⊙ ∼ 11. In a controlled experiment, we vary only the efficiency of the SMBH accretion and focus on galaxies and their immediate environment properties. Our results show that the active galactic nucleus jet feedback has a substantial effect on the basic properties of Seyfert-type galaxies, such as morphology, gas fraction and distribution, star formation rate and distribution, B/D ratio, DM halo baryon fraction, and properties of the circumgalactic medium and beyond. These have been compared to a galaxy with supernovae only feedback. We focus on the energy deposition by the jet in the interstellar medium (ISM) and intergalactic gas medium, and follow the expansion of the multiple jet cocoons to ∼2 Mpc. We find that the jet–ISM interaction gradually pushes the star formation to larger radii with increasing accretion efficiency, which results in increased mass of the outer stellar disk, which is best fit as a double-exponential disk. Furthermore, we compare our galaxies and their properties with the observed nearby Seyfert galaxies, including the scaling relations, and find a close agreement, although statistical analysis of observed Seyferts is currently missing. In a forthcoming paper, we focus on the evolution of these objects at z ≲ 10 and study the effect of the SMBH seeding redshift.

Advances in time domain astronomy have produced a growing population of flares from galactic nuclei, including both tidal disruption events (TDEs) and flares in active galactic nuclei (AGN). Because TDEs are uncommon and AGN variability is abundant, large-amplitude AGN flares are usually not categorized as TDEs. While TDEs are normally channelled by the collisional process of two-body scatterings over a relaxation timescale, the quadrupole moment of a gas disk alters the stellar orbits, allowing them to collisionlessly approach the central massive black hole (MBH). This leads to an effectively enlarged loss cone, the loss wedge. Earlier studies found a moderate enhancement, up to a factor ~2–3, of TDE rates for a static axisymmetric perturbation. Here, we study the loss wedge problem for an evolving AGN disk, which can capture large number of stars into the growing loss wedge over much shorter times. The rates of collisionless TDEs produced by these time-evolving disks are much higher than the collisional rates in a static loss wedge. We calculate the response of a stellar population to the axisymmetric potential of an adiabatically growing AGN disk and find that the highest rates of collisionless TDEs are achieved for the largest (i) MBH masses M• and (ii) disk masses Md. For M• ~ 107M⊙ and Md ~ 0.1M•, the rate enhancement can be up to a factor . The orbits of collisionless TDEs sometimes have a preferred orientation in apses, carrying implications for observational signatures of resulting flares.

The astrophysical origins of the majority of the IceCube neutrinos remain unknown. Effectively characterizing the spatial distribution of the neutrino samples and associating the events with astrophysical source catalogs can be challenging given the large atmospheric neutrino background and underlying non-Gaussian spatial features in the neutrino and source samples. In this paper, we investigate a framework for identifying and statistically evaluating the cross-correlations between IceCube data and an astrophysical source catalog based on the k-nearest-neighbor cumulative distribution functions (kNN-CDFs). We propose a maximum likelihood estimation procedure for inferring the true proportions of astrophysical neutrinos in the point-source data. We conduct a statistical power analysis of an associated likelihood ratio test with estimations of its sensitivity and discovery potential with synthetic neutrino data samples and a WISE–2MASS galaxy sample. We apply the method to IceCube’s public ten-year point-source data and find no statistically significant evidence for spatial cross-correlations with the selected galaxy sample. We discuss possible extensions to the current method and explore the method’s potential to identify the cross-correlation signals in data sets with different sample sizes.

<title>CEERS: Increasing Scatter along the Star-forming Main Sequence Indicates Early Galaxies Form in Bursts</title>

We present the star formation rate–stellar mass (SFR–M*) relation for galaxies in the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science survey at 4.5 ≤ z ≤ 12. We model the JWST and Hubble Space Telescope rest-UV and rest-optical photometry of galaxies with flexible star formation histories (SFHs) using BAGPIPES. We consider SFRs averaged from the SFHs over 10 Myr (SFR10) and 100 Myr (SFR100), where the photometry probes SFRs on these timescales, effectively tracing nebular emission lines in the rest-optical (on ~10 Myr timescales) and the UV/optical continuum (on ~100 Myr timescales). We measure the slope, normalization and intrinsic scatter of the SFR–M* relation, taking into account the uncertainty and the covariance of galaxy SFRs and M*. From z ~ 5 to 9 there is larger scatter in the SFR10–M* relation, with dex, compared to the SFR100–M* relation, with dex. This scatter increases with redshift and increasing stellar mass, at least out to z ~ 7. These results can be explained if galaxies at higher redshift experience an increase in star formation variability and form primarily in short, active periods, followed by a lull in star formation (i.e., “napping” phases). We see a significant trend in the ratio RSFR = SFR10/SFR100 in which, on average, RSFR decreases with increasing stellar mass and increasing redshift. This yields a star formation “duty cycle” of ~40% for galaxies with at z ~ 5, declining to ~20% at z ~ 9. Galaxies also experience longer lulls in star formation at higher redshift and at higher stellar mass, such that galaxies transition from periods of higher SFR variability at z ≳ 6 to smoother SFR evolution at z ≲ 4.5.

<title>Uniform Modeling of Observed Kilonovae: Implications for Diversity and the Progenitors of Merger-driven Long Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9c77</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9c77</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present uniform modeling of eight kilonovae, five following short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs; including GRB 170817A) and three following long GRBs. We model their broadband afterglows to determine the relative contributions of afterglow and kilonova emission. We fit the kilonovae using a three-component model in MOSFiT, and report population median ejecta masses for the total, blue (κB = 0.5 cm2 g−1), purple (κP = 3 cm2 g−1), and red (κR = 10 cm2 g−1) components. The kilonova of GW170817 is near the sample median in most derived properties. We investigate trends between the ejecta masses and the isotropic-equivalent and beaming-corrected γ-ray energies (Eγ,iso, Eγ), as well as rest-frame durations (T90,rest). We find long GRB kilonovae have higher median red ejecta masses (Mej,R ≳ 0.05 M⊙) compared to on-axis short GRB kilonovae (Mej,R ≲ 0.02 M⊙). We also observe a weak scaling between the total and red ejecta masses with Eγ,iso and Eγ, though a larger sample is needed to establish a significant correlation. These findings imply a connection between merger-driven long GRBs and larger tidal dynamical ejecta masses, which may indicate that their progenitors are asymmetric compact object binaries. We produce representative kilonova light curves, and find that the planned depths and cadences of the Rubin and Roman Observatory surveys will be sufficient for order-of-magnitude constraints on Mej,B (and, for Roman, Mej,P and Mej,R) of future kilonovae at z ≲ 0.1.

<title>The Observed Phase Space of Mass-loss History from Massive Stars Based on Radio Observations of a Large Supernova Sample</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9e93</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9e93</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this work, we study the circumstellar material (CSM) around massive stars, and the mass-loss rates depositing this CSM, using a large sample of radio observations of 325 core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe; only ~22% of them being detected). This sample comprises both archival data and our new observations of 99 CCSNe conducted with the AMI-LA radio array in a systematic approach devised to constrain the mass loss at different stages of stellar evolution. In the supernova (SN)–CSM interaction model, observing the peak of the radio emission of an SN provides the CSM density at a given radius (and therefore the mass-loss rate that deposited this CSM). On the other hand, limits on the radio emission, and/or on the peak of the radio emission provide a region in the CSM phase space that can be ruled out. Our analysis shows a discrepancy between the values of mass-loss rates derived from radio-detected and radio-nondetected SNe. Furthermore, we rule out mass-loss rates in the range of 2 × 10−6–10−4M⊙ yr−1 for different epochs during the last 1000 yr before the explosion (assuming wind velocity of 10 km s−1) for the progenitors of ~80% of the Type II supernovae (SNe II) in our sample. In addition, we rule out the ranges of mass-loss rates suggested for red supergiants for ~50% of the progenitors of SNe II in our sample. We emphasize here that these results take a step forward in constraining mass loss in winds from a statistical point of view.

<title>Study of Satellite Plane Structure Characteristics Based on TNG50 Simulations: A Comparative Analysis from Plane to Nonplane Structures</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9f34</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In recent years, multiple plane structures of satellite galaxies have been identified in the nearby Universe, although their formation mechanisms remain unclear. In this work, we employ the TNG50-1 numerical simulation to classify satellite systems into plane and nonplane structures, based on their geometric and dynamical properties. We focus on comparing the characteristics of these plane and nonplane structures. The plane structures in TNG50-1 exhibit a mean height of 5.24 kpc, with most of them found in galaxy groups with intermediate halo virial masses within the narrow range of 1011.5–1012.5M⊙. Statistical analyses reveal that plane structures of satellite galaxies constitute approximately 11.30% in TNG50-1, with this proportion increasing to 27.11% in TNG100-1, aligning closely with previous observations. Additionally, central galaxies in clusters and groups hosting corotating plane structures are intermediate massive and slightly metal-poorer than those in nonplane structures. Significant differences are found between in-plane and out-of-plane satellite galaxies, suggesting that in-plane satellites exhibit slightly longer formation times and more active interstellar matter cycles. The satellites within these plane structures in TNG50-1 exhibit similar radial distributions with observations but are fainter and more massive than those in observational plane structures due to the over- or underestimation of galaxy properties in simulations. Our analysis also shows that the satellite plane structures might be affected by some low- or high-mass galaxies temporarily entering the plane structures due to the gravitational potential of the clusters and groups after the plane structures had formed.

<title>Study on the Shallow Decay Segment of Gamma-Ray Burst X-Ray Afterglow</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada0b9</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada0b9</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The X-ray afterglow of a certain fraction of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) comprises a phase of shallow decay. However, the origin of the shallow decay segment is still a mystery. In this paper, we select 103 GRBs that exhibit a shallow decay segment, based on Swift/XRT data prior to 2023 June. We apply the fallback accretion energy external dissipation model to the shallow decay segment in our sample, and find the model can interpret the shallow decay segment within a reasonable range of parameter space. The fallback rate of the progenitor envelope materials onto the accretion disk can reach a peak of 10−7–0.1 M⊙ s−1 within a time frame of 10–105 s, which is consistent with the typical density profile and spin profile of the progenitor of a GRB. During the fallback process of progenitor envelope materials, progenitor stars of most GRBs have the highest fallback rate at a radius ~1010 cm, which is consistent with the typical radius of a Wolf–Rayet star. The production of shallow decay segments of most GRBs in our sample requires injecting Blandford–Znajek (BZ) energy equal to 10–100 times the kinetic energy of the initial GRB blast wave into the blast wave. However, the shallow decay segment of a few GRBs requires the injected energy to be comparable to the kinetic energy of the blast wave, which means that even if less energy is injected into a GRB blast wave, it is still possible to produce a shallow decay segment. In addition, the peak time of the fallback rate of the progenitor envelope materials is close to the time when BZ energy is injected into the blast wave, which means that the fallback accretion is more active in the initial phase. In summary, our research results provide further support to an external origin for the shallow decay segment in GRBs.

<title>COOL-LAMPS. VII. Quantifying Strong-lens Scaling Relations with 177 Cluster-scale Strong Gravitational Lenses in DECaLS</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We estimate the Einstein-radius-enclosed total mass for 177 cluster-scale strong gravitational lenses identified by the ChicagO Optically selected Lenses Located At the Margins of Public Surveys (COOL-LAMPS) collaboration with lens redshifts ranging from 0.2 ⪅ z ⪅ 1.0 using the brightest-cluster-galaxy (BCG) redshift and an observable proxy for the Einstein radius. We constrain the Einstein-radius-enclosed luminosity and stellar mass by fitting parametric spectral energy distributions to aperture photometry from the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS) in the g-, r-, and z-band Dark Energy Camera filters. We find that the BCG redshift, enclosed total mass, and enclosed luminosity are strongly correlated and well described by a planar relationship in 3D space. We find that the enclosed total mass and stellar mass are correlated with a logarithmic slope of , and the enclosed total mass and stellar-to-total mass fraction are correlated with a logarithmic slope of . In tandem with the small radii within which these slopes are constrained, this may suggest invariance in baryon conversion efficiency and feedback strength as a function of cluster-centric radii in galaxy clusters. Additionally, the correlations described here should have utility in ranking strong-lensing candidates in upcoming imaging surveys—such as Rubin/Legacy Survey of Space and Time—in which an algorithmic treatment of strong lenses will be needed due to the sheer volume of data these surveys will produce.

<title>Subaru High-z Exploration of Low-luminosity Quasars (SHELLQs). XXI. Candidate Red Quasars at z ≥ 6 from Near-infrared Photometry</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present an analysis of near-infrared photometry of 59 quasars at 5.83 < z < 7.07, obtained with the Gemini North Telescope and the Gran Telescopio CANARIAS. The sample consists of low-luminosity quasars discovered in the Subaru High-z Exploration of Low-Luminosity Quasars (SHELLQs) project. With the near-infrared magnitudes combined with the optical photometric and spectroscopic data from the previous Hyper Suprime-Cam and SHELLQs observations, we searched for red (dust-reddened) quasars, characterized by the color excess of E(B − V) > 0.1. We identified five red quasar candidates. The low fraction (8%) of red quasars in our sample suggests that the low luminosity of the SHELLQs quasars is mostly due to the nature of the quasars, not due to extinction by dust. The candidates tend to be found on the low-luminosity side (measured with the rest-ultraviolet absolute magnitude at 1450 Å of M1450 > −24 mag) of the sample. This luminosity trend may support the idea that red quasars represent an evolutionary stage preceding unobscured quasars, often invoked in the merger-driven galaxy evolution scenario.

<title>Magnetic Reconnection between a Solar Jet and a Filament Channel</title>

The solar corona is highly structured by bunches of magnetic field lines forming either loops, or twisted flux ropes representing prominences/filaments, or very dynamic structures such as jets. The aim of this paper is to understand the interaction between filament channels and jets. We use high-resolution Hα spectra obtained by the ground-based telescope Télescope Héliographique pour l'Etude du Magnétisme et des Instabilités Solaires on the Canary Islands and data from Helioseismic Magnetic Imager and Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory. In this paper we present a multiwavelength study of the interaction of filaments and jets. They both consist of cool plasma embedded in magnetic structures. A jet is particularly well studied in all the AIA channels with a flow reaching 100–180 km s−1. Its origin is linked to cancelling flux at the edge of the active region. Large Doppler shifts in Hα are derived in a typical area for a short time (order of minute). They correspond to flows around 140 km s−1. In conclusion we conjecture that these flows correspond to some interchange of magnetic field lines between the filament channel and the jets leading to cool plasmoid ejections or reconnection jets perpendicularly to the jet trajectory.

<title>Discrepancies between JWST Observations and Simulations of Quenched Massive Galaxies at z > 3: A Comparative Study with IllustrisTNG and ASTRID</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Recent JWST observations have uncovered an unexpectedly large population of massive quiescent galaxies at z > 3. Using the cosmological simulations IllustrisTNG and ASTRID, we identify analogous galaxies and investigate their abundance, formation, quenching mechanisms, and post-quenching evolution for stellar masses . We apply three different quenching definitions and find that both simulations significantly underestimate the comoving number density of quenched massive galaxies at z ≳ 3 compared to JWST observations by up to ∼2 dex. In both simulations, the high-z quenched massive galaxies often host overmassive central black holes above the local MBH–M⋆ relation, implying that AGN feedback is key in quenching galaxies in the early Universe. The typical quenching timescales for these galaxies are ∼200–600 Myr. IllustrisTNG primarily employs AGN kinetic feedback, while ASTRID relies on AGN thermal feedback at z > 2.3, which is less effective and has a longer quenching timescale. Although these simulations differ in many aspects, making a direct comparison challenging, our findings suggest the need for improved physical models of AGN feedback in galaxy formation simulations. At lower stellar masses, the quenched galaxies have denser local environments than the star-forming galaxies, suggesting that environmental quenching helps quench less-massive galaxies. We also study the post-quenching evolution of the high-z massive quiescent galaxies and find that many experience subsequent reactivation of star formation, evolving into primary progenitors of z = 0 brightest cluster galaxies.

<title>Multiple Episodes of Remote Brightenings Driven by a Coronal Extreme-ultraviolet Jet on the Sun</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Remote brightening (RB) is compact brightening at footpoints of magnetic loops, which are remotely connecting to and confining an eruption in the solar atmosphere. Here, we report on observations of an RB resulting from an EUV jet with a speed of about 90 km s−1. The loops connecting the RB and the jet have an apparent length of about 59 Mm. Intriguingly, the RB exhibits at least two episodes of brightenings, as characterized by two peaks in its lightcurve. The energies that sustain the first and second peaks of the RB are 6.3 × 1026 erg and 8.4 × 1026 erg, respectively, and comprise a significant proportion of the total energy. The first peak of the RB brightenings coincides with the jet's peak with a time delay of 12 s, while the second peak lags behind by 108 s. Besides the flows of the ejecta, we have identified two additional flows originating from the eruption site. One is relatively cool with a temperature of –6.1 and a speed of about 275 ± 15 km s−1. The other is hot with a temperature of –7.3 and a much greater speed of about 750 ± 70 km s−1. We attribute the second peak of RB directly to this hot flow, which our numerical experiments suggest is the result of a slow shock wave. Considering the minimal time delay between the first peak of RB and the eruption, we infer that this first episode is due to heating by nonthermal electrons. Our research demonstrates that the dynamics in an RB can offer vital insights into the nature of the corresponding eruption and help understand how energy is distributed throughout the solar atmosphere.

<title>Electron Acceleration by Multiple Fast Fermi Reflections at Earth’s Bow Shock</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada5f0</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The generation of energetic particles in the Universe is an important topic in astrophysical and space physics. Although the diffusive shock acceleration has been acknowledged to play an essential role in particle acceleration, the injection problem has not been well resolved yet. Using measurements from the Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft, we report unexpected spiky enhancements of energetic electron flux in the upstream region of the Earth’s bow shock. Such enhancements are then demonstrated to result from the accelerated electron population by shock reflection. Meanwhile, the magnetic field exhibits no variations except an increase in radius of curvature. Based on the results above, we uncover the underlying acceleration scenario. When the interplanetary magnetic field with a proper curvature approaches the bow shock, the two ends of a magnetic field line may touch the shock front earlier than its middle part. Magnetic mirror points form at the two field-line-shock intersections. The solar wind electrons are therefore trapped and bounce between two mirror points. Eventually, these electrons undergo fast Fermi reflection several times and gain substantial energies. The spacecraft observation of accelerated electrons is reproduced with a numerical method based on the reflection model. Such an acceleration process may be a potential solution to the injection problem.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Observations of the Milky Way and external galaxies support the idea that large-scale magnetic fields are concentrated in galactic disks, with halo magnetic fields at least an order of magnitude weaker. However, very little is known about the transition between the two. We present the discovery of linearly polarized radio emission at the interface between interacting shells of gas within a well-known grouping of high-velocity clouds (HVCs), the anticenter shell. Faraday rotation of diffuse emission and of background extragalactic compact sources demonstrates an enhancement of the field at the interface. This is the clearest observed example of an HVC altering the large-scale magnetic field at the disk–halo interface and is the first image of magnetic field effects in an HVC. These results demonstrate the possibility of future three-dimensional reconstruction of the Galactic magnetic field and showcase the versatility of the Synthesis Telescope at the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory as one of the few existing telescopes that can exploit this new method of probing Galactic magnetism.

<title>The 100 pc White Dwarf Sample in the SDSS Footprint. II. A New Look at the Spectral Evolution of White Dwarfs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We increase the spectroscopic completeness of the 100 pc white dwarf sample in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey footprint with 840 additional spectra. Our spectroscopy is 86% complete for white dwarfs hotter than Teff = 5000 K, where Hα remains visible and provides reliable constraints on the atmospheric composition. We identify 2108 DA white dwarfs with pure hydrogen atmospheres, and show that ultramassive DA white dwarfs with M ≥ 1.1 M⊙ are an order of magnitude less common below 10,000 K. This is consistent with a fraction of them getting stuck on the crystallization sequence due to 22Ne distillation. In addition, there are no ultramassive DA white dwarfs with M ≥ 1.1M⊙ and Teff ≤ 6000 K in our sample, likely because Debye cooling makes them rapidly fade away. We detect a significant trend in the fraction of He atmosphere white dwarfs as a function of temperature; the fraction increases from 9% at 20,000 K to 32% at 6000 K. This provides direct evidence of convective mixing in cool DA white dwarfs. Finally, we detect a relatively tight sequence of low-mass DQ white dwarfs in color–magnitude diagrams for the first time. We discuss the implications of this tight DQ sequence, and conclude with a discussion of the future prospects from the upcoming Ultraviolet Transient Astronomy Satellite mission and the large-scale multi-fiber spectroscopic surveys.

<title>Chemical Abundances in the Nuclear Star Cluster of the Milky Way: Alpha-element Trends and Their Similarities with the Inner Bulge</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9b2b</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Chemical characterization of the Galactic center is essential for understanding its formation and structural evolution. Trends of alpha (α) elements, such as magnesium, silicon, and calcium, serve as powerful diagnostic tools, offering insights into star formation rates and gas-infall history. However, high extinction has previously hindered such studies. In this study, we present a detailed chemical abundance analysis of M giants in the Milky Way's nuclear star cluster (NSC), focusing on α-element trends with metallicity. High-resolution, near-infrared spectra were obtained using the Immersion GRating INfrared Spectrograph on the Gemini South telescope for nine M giants. Careful selection of spectral lines, based on a solar-neighborhood control sample of 50 M giants, was implemented to minimize systematic uncertainties. Our findings show enhanced α-element abundances in the predominantly metal-rich NSC stars, consistent with trends in the inner bulge. The NSC stars follow the high-[α/Fe] envelope seen in the solar vicinity's metal-rich population, indicating a high star formation rate. The α-element trends decrease with increasing metallicity, also at the highest metallicities. Our results suggest the NSC population likely shares a similar evolutionary history with the inner bulge, challenging the idea of a recent dominant star formation burst. This connection between the NSC and the inner-disk sequence suggests that the chemical properties of extragalactic NSCs of Milky Way–type galaxies could serve as a proxy for understanding the host galaxies’ evolutionary processes.

Analyzing all available archival soft and hard X-ray observations, we investigate the line-of-sight hydrogen column density (NH,los) variability on timescales ranging from a few days to approximately 20 yr. Each source is analyzed by simultaneously modeling the data with three physical torus models, providing tight constraints on torus properties, including the covering factor, the cloud dispersion, and the torus average hydrogen column density (NH,av). Our final sample includes 27 variable, Compton-thin AGN after implementing another 14 AGN analyzed in our previous work. We find that all sources require either flux or NH,los variability. Based on the degree of variability, we classify 37% of them as “NH,los Variable,” 44% as “Nonvariable in NH,los,” and 19% as “Undetermined.” Noticeably, there is no discernible difference between geometrical and intrinsic properties among the three variability classes, suggesting no intrinsic differences between the NH,los-variable and nonvariable sources within the considered sample. We measure the median variation in NH,los between any observation pair of the same source to be 25% with respect to the lowest NH,los measure in the pair. Furthermore, 48% of the analyzed sources require the inclusion of a Compton-thick reflector in the spectral fitting. Among these, 30% exhibit recorded 22 GHz water megamaser emission, suggesting a potential shared nature between the two structures.

<title>A Pride of Satellites in the Constellation Leo? Discovery of the Leo VI Milky Way Satellite Ultra-faint Dwarf Galaxy with DELVE Early Data Release 3</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report the discovery and spectroscopic confirmation of an ultra-faint Milky Way satellite in the constellation of Leo. This system was discovered as a spatial overdensity of resolved stars observed with Dark Energy Camera (DECam) data from an early version of the third data release of the DECam Local Volume Exploration (or DELVE) survey. The low luminosity ( ; ), large size ( pc), and large heliocentric distance ( kpc) are all consistent with the population of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs). Using Keck/DEIMOS observations of the system, we were able to spectroscopically confirm nine member stars, while measuring a tentative mass-to-light ratio of and a nonzero metallicity dispersion of , further confirming Leo VI’s identity as a UFD. While the system has a highly elliptical shape, , we do not find any conclusive evidence that it is tidally disrupting. Moreover, despite the apparent on-sky proximity of Leo VI to members of the proposed Crater-Leo infall group, its smaller heliocentric distance and inconsistent position in energy–angular momentum space make it unlikely that Leo VI is part of the proposed infall group.

<title>Segue 2 Recently Collided with the Cetus-Palca Stream: New Opportunities to Constrain Dark Matter in an Ultra-faint Dwarf</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Stellar streams in the Milky Way are promising detectors of low-mass dark matter (DM) subhalos predicted by ΛCDM. Passing subhalos induce perturbations in streams that indicate the presence of the subhalos. Understanding how known DM-dominated satellites impact streams is a crucial step toward using stream perturbations to constrain the properties of dark perturbers. Here, we cross-match a Gaia Early Data Release 3 and SEGUE member catalog of the Cetus-Palca stream (CPS) with H3 for additional radial velocity measurements and fit the orbit of the CPS using this six-dimensional (6D) data. We demonstrate for the first time that the ultra-faint dwarf Segue 2 had a recent (77 ± 5 Myr ago) close flyby (within the stream's 2σ width) with the CPS. This interaction enables constraints on Segue 2’s mass and density profile at larger radii ( kpc) than are probed by its stars ( pc). While Segue 2 is not expected to strongly affect the portion of the stream covered by our 6D data, we predict that if Segue 2’s mass within ∼ 6 kpc is 5 × 109M⊙, the CPS's velocity dispersion will be ∼ 40 km s−1 larger at ϕ1 > 20° than at ϕ1 < 0°. If no such heating is detected, Segue 2’s mass cannot exceed 109M⊙ within ∼ 6 kpc. The proper motion distribution of the CPS near the impact site is mildly sensitive to the shape of Segue 2’s density profile. This study presents a critical test for frameworks designed to constrain properties of dark subhalos from stream perturbations.

<title>Morphology of 137 Fast Radio Bursts Down to Microsecond Timescales from the First CHIME/FRB Baseband Catalog</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9b11</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a spectro-temporal analysis of 137 fast radio bursts (FRBs) from the first CHIME/FRB baseband catalog, including 125 one-off bursts and 12 repeat bursts, down to microsecond resolution using the least-squares optimization fitting routine fitburst. We measure subburst components within burst envelopes as narrow as ~23 μs (FWHM), with 20% of the sample displaying substructures narrower than 100 μs, offering constraints on emission mechanisms. Scattering timescales in the sample range from 30 μs to 13 ms at 600 MHz. Our measured values are compared with those in the first CHIME/FRB intensity catalog, revealing that nearly one-third of our sample exhibits additional burst components at higher time resolutions. We observe no correlations between scattering time and dispersion measure, rotation measure, or linear polarization fraction, with the latter suggesting that depolarization due to multipath propagation is negligible in our sample. Bursts with narrower envelopes (≤1 ms) in our sample exhibit higher flux densities, indicating the potential presence of submillisecond FRBs that are being missed by our real-time system below a brightness threshold. Most multicomponent bursts in our sample exhibit subburst separations of ≤1 ms, with no bursts showing separations < 41 μs, even at a time resolution of 2.56 μs, but both scattering and low signal-to-noise ratio can hinder the detection of additional components. Lastly, given the morphological diversity of our sample, we suggest that one-off and repeating FRBs can come from different classes but have overlapping property distributions.

<title>Fuzzy Galaxies or Cirrus? Decomposition of Galactic Cirrus in Deep Wide-field Images</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9b25</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Diffuse Galactic cirrus, or diffuse Galactic light (DGL), can be a prominent component in the background of deep wide-field imaging surveys. The DGL provides unique insights into the physical and radiative properties of dust grains in our Milky Way, and it also serves as a contaminant on deep images, obscuring the detection of background sources such as low surface brightness galaxies. However, it is challenging to disentangle the DGL from other components of the night sky. In this paper, we present a technique for the photometric characterization of Galactic cirrus based on (1) extraction of its filamentary or patchy morphology and (2) incorporation of color constraints obtained from Planck thermal dust models. Our decomposition method is illustrated using a ~10 deg2 imaging data set obtained by the Dragonfly Telephoto Array, and its performance is explored using various metrics that characterize the flatness of the sky background. As a concrete application of the technique, we show how removal of cirrus allows low surface brightness galaxies to be identified on cirrus-rich images. We also show how modeling the cirrus in this way allows optical DGL intensities to be determined with high radiometric precision.

<title>Deep Swift/UVOT Observations of GOODS-N and the Evolution of the Ultraviolet Luminosity Function at 0.2 < z < 1.2</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present Swift Ultraviolet Optical Telescope (UVOT) observations of the deep field GOODS-N in four near-UV filters. A catalog of detected galaxies is reported, which will be used to explore galaxy evolution using UV emission. Swift/UVOT observations probe galaxies at z ≲ 1.5 and combine a wide field of view with moderate spatial resolution; these data complement the wide-field observations of Galaxy Evolution Explorer and the deep, high-angular-resolution observations by Hubble Space Telescope. Using our catalog of detected galaxies, we calculate the UV galaxy number counts as a function of apparent magnitude and compute the UV luminosity function (LF) and its evolution with redshift. From the LF fits in various redshift bins, we calculate the star formation rate density as a function of redshift and find evolution consistent with past works. We explore how different assumptions such as dust attenuation corrections can dramatically change how quickly the corrected star formation rate density changes with redshift. At these low redshifts, we find no trend between UV attenuation and redshift or absolute magnitude with significant scatter in the UV spectral slope β. This data set will complement the extensive observations of GOODS-N already in the literature.

<title>ALMA/SCUBA-2 COSMOS Survey: Properties of X-Ray- and SED-selected Active Galactic Nuclei in Bright Submillimeter Galaxies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We investigate the properties of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the brightest submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) in the COSMOS field. We utilize the bright sample of the ALMA/SCUBA-2 COSMOS Survey (AS2COSMOS), which consists of 260 SMGs with S870 μm = 0.7–19.2 mJy at z = 0–6. We perform optical to millimeter spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling for the whole sample. We identify 24 AGN-host galaxies from the SEDs. Supplemented by 23 X-ray-detected AGNs (X-ray AGNs), we construct an overall sample of 40 AGN-host galaxies. The X-ray luminosity upper bounds indicate that the X-ray-undetected SED-identified AGNs are likely to be nearly Compton thick or have unusually suppressed X-ray emission. From visual classification, we identify % of the SMGs without AGNs as major merger candidates. This fraction is almost consistent with the general galaxy population at z ∼ 2, suggesting that major mergers are not necessarily required for the enhanced star formation in SMGs. We also identify % of the AGN hosts as major merger candidates, which is about twice as high as that in the SMGs without AGNs. This suggests that major mergers play a key role in triggering AGN activity in bright SMGs.

<title>A Second Candidate Magnetic Helium Core White Dwarf and 3 Other Variable White Dwarfs in the Globular Cluster NGC 6397</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada144</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada144</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Using archival Hubble Space Telescope observations, we report the discovery of four variable low-mass white dwarfs (WDs; 0.18 M⊙ ≤ M ≤ 0.5 M⊙) in the globular cluster NGC 6397. One source exhibits a periodic optical modulation of 5.21 ± 0.02 hr, which we interpret as potentially due to the rotation of a magnetic helium core WD (He WD). This makes this candidate the second magnetic He WD in NGC 6397, and one of the few He WDs with a measured rotation period. The other three candidates show aperiodic variability, with a change in magnitude ranging from ∼0.11 to 0.6. These discoveries highlight the importance of high-cadence photometric surveys in dense stellar environments. Follow-up spectroscopic observations are needed to confirm the nature of the variability of these systems.

<title>Bar Instability and Formation Timescale across Toomre’s Q Parameter and Central Mass Concentration: Slow Bar Formation or True Stability</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada35f</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada35f</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We investigate the bar formation process using N-body simulations across the Toomre’s parameter Q and central mass concentration (CMC), focusing principally on the formation timescale. Of importance is that, as suggested by cosmological simulations, disk galaxies have a limited time of ~8 Gyr in the Universe’s timeline to evolve secularly, starting when they became physically and kinematically steady to prompt the bar instability. By incorporating this time limit, bar-unstable disks are further subdivided into those that establish a bar before and after that time, namely, the normal and the slowly bar-forming disks. Simulations demonstrate that evolutions of bar strengths and configurations of the slowly bar-forming and the bar-stable cases are nearly indistinguishable prior to 8 Gyr, albeit dynamically distinct, while differences can be noticed afterward. Differentiating them before 8 Gyr is possible by identifying the proto-bar, a signature of bar development visible in kinematical maps such as the Fourier spectrogram and the angular velocity field, which emerges in the former group 1–2 Gyr before the fully developed bar, whereas it is absent in the latter group until 8 Gyr and such bar-stable disk remains unbarred until at least 10 Gyr. In addition, we find complicated interplays between Q and CMC in regulating the bar formation. First, disk stabilization requires both high Q and CMC. Either high Q or high CMC only results in slow bar formation. Second, some hot disks can form a bar more rapidly than the colder ones in a specific range of Q and CMC.

<title>Dynamic Evolution of Magnetic Flux Ropes in Active Region 11429. II. Magnetic Characteristic of the Footpoints During the Preeruption and Eruption Phases</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada383</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada383</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Magnetic flux rope (MFRs) are the most probable core structure of coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Their footpoints on the photosphere are the only feature for which their magnetic properties can be accurately measured, and to some extent, determine the property of the whole MFR. So far, the magnetic properties of footpoints are still a mystery. Y. Zhang et al. presented the dynamic evolution of four MFRs involved in a major eruption. For this special event, the footpoints of the MFRs could be identified by extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) brightening and MFR morphology during the preeruption phase, and by conjunction, EUV dimming during the eruption phase. This is a new effort to identify the footpoints of MFRs during the preeruption phase. This identification discloses that all footpoints originate out of the umbra and penumbra of the sunspots. The footpoint areas and magnetic flux during the preeruption phase are about 107 km2 and around the order of 1019–1020 Mx, respectively. During the eruption phase, the footpoint area and the magnetic flux are about 108 km2 and around the order of 1020 Mx, respectively. The temporal evolution of the magnetic features around the footpoints disclose that all footpoint pairs belong to nonconjugated opposite polarities. This observational evidence will help us to understand the magnetic nature of MFRs and their associated CMEs.

<title>The Hidden Magnetic Structures of a Solar Intermediate Filament Revealed by the Injected Flare Material</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9d13</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Solar filaments are spectacular objects in the solar atmosphere, consisting of accumulations of cool, dense, and partially ionized plasma suspended in the hot solar corona against gravity. The magnetic structures that support the filament material remain elusive, partly due to the lack of high-resolution magnetic field measurements in the chromosphere and corona. In this study, we reconstruct the magnetic structures of a solar intermediate filament using EUV observations and two different methods, to follow the injection of hot material from a B-class solar flare. Our analysis reveals the fine-scale magnetic structures of the filament, including a compact set of mutually wrapped magnetic fields encasing the cool filament material, two groups of helical magnetic structures intertwining with the main filament, and a series of arched magnetic loops positioned along the filament. Additionally, we find that the northern footpoints of the helical structures are rooted in the same location, while their southern footpoints are rooted in different areas. The results obtained in this study offer new insights into the formation and eruption mechanisms of solar filaments.

<title>A Study of the Star Clusters’ Population in the Giant Molecular Cloud G174+2.5</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad957d</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad957d</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We study the structure, interstellar absorption, color–magnitude diagrams (CMDs), kinematics, and dynamical state of embedded star clusters in the star-forming region associated with the giant molecular cloud G174+2.5. Our investigation is based on photometric data from the UKIDSS Galactic Plane Survey catalog and astrometric data from the Gaia DR3 catalogs. First, we recover all the known embedded clusters and candidate clusters in the region using surface density maps. Then, for the detected clusters, we determine their general parameters: the center positions, radii, number of stars, and reddening. To evaluate the reddening, we use both the NICEST algorithm and the Q-method. Both methods produce consistent extinction maps in the regions of the four studied clusters. However, the Q-method yields a much smaller color scatter in the CMD. For four clusters in particular (S235 North-West, S235 A-B-C, S235 Central, and S235 East1+East2), we were able to compute individual membership probabilities, the cluster distances, the cluster masses, and their average proper motions. By building on these results, we have studied the clusters’ kinematics and dynamics. Moreover, we estimate the mass of the gas component and the star formation efficiency in the regions of these four clusters. Finally, we provide an estimate of the total energy of the stellar and gas components in the area of these four clusters to determine whether the clusters are bound (here, we consider a “cluster” as the system “stars + gas”). The gravitational bound strongly depends on the region for which we estimate the gas mass. If we consider the mass of the entire cloud, all these four clusters turn out to be bound.

<title>Extreme Heating of Minor Ions in Imbalanced Solar-wind Turbulence</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad95fc</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad95fc</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Minor ions in the solar corona are heated to extreme temperatures, far in excess of those of the electrons and protons that comprise the bulk of the plasma. These highly nonthermal distributions make minor ions sensitive probes of the collisionless processes that heat the corona and power the solar wind. The recent discovery of the “helicity barrier” offers a mechanism in which imbalanced Alfvénic turbulence in low-β plasmas preferentially heats protons over electrons, generating high-frequency, proton-cyclotron-resonant fluctuations. We use the hybrid-kinetic particle-in-cell code Pegasus++ to drive imbalanced Alfvénic turbulence in a 3D low-β plasma with additional passive ion species, He2+ and O5+. A helicity barrier naturally develops, followed by clear phase-space signatures of oblique proton-cyclotron-wave heating and Landau-resonant heating from the imbalanced Alfvénic fluctuations. The former results in characteristically arced ion velocity distribution functions, whose non-bi-Maxwellian features are shown by linear ALPS calculations to be critical to the heating process. Additional features include a steep transition-range electromagnetic spectrum, proton-cyclotron waves propagating in the direction of the imbalance, significantly enhanced proton-to-electron heating ratios, ion temperatures that are considerably more perpendicular with respect to magnetic field, and extreme heating of heavier species in a manner consistent with mass scalings inferred from spacecraft measurements. None of these features are realized in an otherwise equivalent simulation of balanced turbulence. If seen simultaneously in the fast solar wind, these signatures of the helicity barrier would testify to the necessity of incorporating turbulence imbalance in a complete theory for the evolution of the solar wind.

<title>Discovery and Spectroscopic Confirmation of Aquarius III: A Low-mass Milky Way Satellite Galaxy</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8eba</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8eba</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the discovery of Aquarius III, an ultra-faint Milky Way satellite galaxy identified in the second data release of the DECam Local Volume Exploration survey. Based on deeper follow-up imaging with DECam, we find that Aquarius III is a low-luminosity ( ), extended ( pc) stellar system located in the outer halo (D⊙ = 85 ± 4 kpc). From medium-resolution Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopy, we identify 11 member stars and measure a mean heliocentric radial velocity of for the system and place an upper limit of σv < 3.5 km s−1 (σv < 1.6 km s−1) on its velocity dispersion at the 95% (68%) credible level. Based on calcium-triplet metallicities of the six brightest red giant members, we find that Aquarius III is very metal-poor ([Fe/H]= − 2.61 ± 0.21) with a statistically significant metallicity spread ( dex). We interpret this metallicity spread as strong evidence that the system is a dwarf galaxy as opposed to a star cluster. Combining our velocity measurement with Gaia proper motions, we find that Aquarius III is currently situated near its orbital pericenter in the outer halo (rperi = 78 ± 7 kpc) and that it is plausibly on first infall onto the Milky Way. This orbital history likely precludes significant tidal disruption from the Galactic disk, notably unlike other satellites with comparably low velocity dispersion limits in the literature. Thus, if further velocity measurements confirm that its velocity dispersion is truly below σv ≲ 2 km s−1, Aquarius III may serve as a useful laboratory for probing galaxy formation physics in low-mass halos.

<title>Maximum Energy of Particles in Plasmas</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9916</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9916</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Particles are accelerated to very high, nonthermal energies in space, solar, and astrophysical plasma environments. In cosmic-ray physics, the Hillas limit is often used as a rough estimate (or the necessary condition) of the maximum energy of particles. This limit is based on the concepts of one-shot direct acceleration by a system-wide motional electric field, as well as stochastic and diffusive acceleration in strongly turbulent environments. However, it remains unclear how well this limit explains the actual observed maximum energies of particles. Here, we show, based on a systematic review, that the observed maximum energy of particles—those in space, solar, astrophysical, and laboratory environments—often reach the energy predicted by the Hillas limit. We also found several exceptions, such as electrons in solar flares and jet-terminal lobes of radio galaxies, as well as protons in planetary radiation belts, where deviations from this limit occur. We discuss possible causes of such deviations, and we argue in particular that there is a good chance of detecting ultra-high-energy (∼100 GeV) solar flare electrons that have not yet been detected. We anticipate that this study will facilitate further interdisciplinary discussions on the maximum energy of particles and the underlying mechanisms of particle acceleration in diverse plasma environments.

<title>The Puzzling Long GRB 191019A: Evidence for Kilonova Light</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9b7b</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9b7b</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
GRB 191019A was a long gamma-ray burst (GRB) lasting ~65 s and, as such, originally thought to be linked to a core-collapse supernova. However, even though follow-up observations identified the optical counterpart close to the bright nucleus of a nearby ancient galaxy (z = 0.248), no associated supernova was found. This led to the suggestion that the burst was caused by the merger of two compact stellar objects, likely in a dense circumnuclear environment. By using a recently developed diagnostic tool based on prompt emission temporal properties, we noticed that GRB 191019A falls among those long GRBs which are associated with compact mergers and with evidence of kilonova light. We thus reanalyzed unpublished GROND multicolor ( ) data obtained between 0.4 and 15 days posttrigger. Image subtraction confirmed the optical counterpart in all four optical bands, with GROND tracking its fading until 1.5 days postburst. Incorporating publicly available Swift-XRT data, a joint fit of an afterglow plus a kilonova model revealed a better match than an afterglow-only scenario. The resulting kilonova properties resemble those of AT2017gfo associated with the binary neutron star merger GW170817, with a total ejected mass of ~0.06 M⊙. Contrary to previous findings inferring a high-density circumburst environment (n0 ~ 107−8 cm−3), our analysis finds standard conditions (n0 ~ 1 cm−3), suggesting the long duration of GRB 191019A was intrinsic rather than due to jet interaction with a dense external medium.

<title>Potential Interior Structures and Habitability of Super-Earth Exoplanets LHS 1140 b, K2-18 b, TOI-1452 b, and TOI-1468 c</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We analyze four super-Earth exoplanets, LHS 1140 b, K2-18 b, TOI-1452 b, and TOI-1468 c, which orbit M dwarf stars in the habitable zone. Their relative proximity, within 40 pc, makes them prime candidates for follow-up observations and atmospheric and habitability studies. This paper aims to assess their internal structure and habitability, considering their tidal heating, atmospheric heating, and global transport. We model the interior structure of the planets by applying Bayesian inference to an exoplanet's interior model. A model with constant quality factor is used to calculate the range of tidal heating, and a one-dimensional analytical model of tidally locked planets is used to assess their surface temperature distribution and habitability. Assuming no or only thin atmospheres, K2-18 b and TOI-1468 c are likely to be water worlds. However, TOI-1452 b and LHS 1140 b may have rocky surfaces. We find that tidal heating is not enough to raise the global mean surface temperature, but greenhouse heating can effectively do so. If the considered planets have retained thick atmospheres, K2-18 b, TOI-1468 c, and TOI-1452 b may, for significant atmospheric heating and heat transport factors, be too hot to sustain liquid water on their surfaces. However, the lower instellation of LHS 1140 b and the nonzero probability of it having a rocky surface give more space for habitable conditions on the planet.

<title>Linear Bending Wave Propagation in Laminar and Turbulent Disks</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Bending waves are perhaps the most fundamental and analytically tractable phenomena in warped disk dynamics. In this work, we conduct 3D grid-based, numerical experiments of bending waves in laminar, viscous hydrodynamic and turbulent, weakly magnetized disks, capturing their behavior in unprecedented detail. We clearly elucidate the theory from first principles, wherein the general Fourier–Hermite formalism can be simplified to a reduced framework which extends previous results toward locally isothermal disks. We obtain remarkable agreement with our laminar simulations wherein the tilt evolution is well described by the reduced theory, while higher-order vertical modes should be retained for capturing the detailed disk twisting and internal velocity profiles. We then relax this laminar assumption and instead launch bending waves atop a magnetorotationally turbulent disk. Although the turbulence can be quantified with an effective α parameter, the bending waves behave distinctly from a classical viscous evolution and are readily disrupted when the turbulent velocity is comparable to the induced warping flows. This may have implications for the inclination damping rates induced by planet–disk interactions, the capture rate of black holes in active galactic nucleus disks or the warped shapes assumed by disks in misaligned systems.

<title>Redshifting the Study of Cold Brown Dwarfs and Exoplanets: The Mid-infrared Wavelength Region as an Indicator of Surface Gravity and Mass</title>

JWST is opening many avenues for exploration. For cold brown dwarfs and exoplanets, JWST has opened the door to the mid-infrared wavelength region, where such objects emit significant energy. For the first time, astronomers have access to mid-infrared spectroscopy for objects colder than 600 K. The first spectra appear to validate the model suite known as ATMO 2020++: atmospheres that include disequilibrium chemistry and have a nonadiabatic pressure–temperature relationship. Preliminary fits to JWST spectroscopy of Y dwarfs show that the slope of the energy distribution from λ ≈ 4.5 μm to λ ≈ 10 μm is very sensitive to gravity. We explore this phenomenon using PH3-free ATMO 2020++ models and updated Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer W2−W3 colors. We find that an absolute 4.5 μm flux measurement constrains temperature, and the ratio of the 4.5 μm flux to the 10–15 μm flux is sensitive to gravity and less sensitive to metallicity. We identify 10 T dwarfs with red W2−W3 colors that are likely to be very-low-gravity, young, few-Jupiter-mass objects; one of these is the previously known COCONUTS-2b. The unusual Y dwarf WISEPA J182831.08+265037.8 is blue in W2−W3, and we find that the 4–18 μm JWST spectrum is well reproduced if the system is a pair of high-gravity 400 K dwarfs. Recently published JWST colors and luminosity-based effective temperatures for late-T and -Y dwarfs further corroborate the ATMO 2020++ models, demonstrating the potential for significant improvement in our understanding of cold, very-low-mass bodies in the solar neighborhood.

<title>A Parameter Study of the Electromagnetic Signatures of an Analytical Mini-disk Model for Supermassive Black Hole Binary Systems</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9c74</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are thought to be located at the centers of most galactic nuclei. When galaxies merge, they form SMBH binary (SMBHB) systems, and these central SMBHs will also merge at later times, producing gravitational waves. Because galaxy mergers are likely gas-rich environments, SMBHBs are also potential sources of electromagnetic (EM) radiation. The EM signatures depend on gas dynamics, orbital dynamics, and radiation processes. The gas dynamics are governed by general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in a time-dependent spacetime. Numerically solving the MHD equations for a time-dependent binary spacetime is computationally expensive. Therefore, it is challenging to conduct a full exploration of the parameter space of these systems and the resulting EM signatures. We have developed an analytical accretion-disk model for the mini-disks of an SMBHB system and produced images and light curves using a general-relativistic ray-tracing code and a superimposed harmonic binary BH metric. This analytical model greatly reduces the time and computational resources needed to explore these systems, while incorporating some key information from simulations. We present a parameter-space exploration of the SMBHB system, in which we study the dependence of the EM signatures on the spins of the BHs, the mass ratio, the accretion rate, the viewing angle, and the initial binary separation. Additionally, we study how the commonly used fast-light approximation affects the EM signatures and evaluate its validity in general-relativistic MHD simulations.

<title>Numerical Simulation of Electron Magnetohydrodynamics with Landau-quantized Electrons in Magnetar Crusts</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9dea</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In magnetar crusts, magnetic fields are sufficiently strong to confine electrons into a small to moderate number of quantized Landau levels. This can have a dramatic effect on the crust's thermodynamic properties, generating field-dependent de Haas–van Alphen oscillations. We previously argued that the large-amplitude oscillations of the magnetic susceptibility could enhance the ohmic dissipation of the magnetic field by continuously generating small-scale, rapidly dissipating field features. This could be important to magnetar field evolution and contribute to their observed higher temperatures. To study this, we performed quasi-3D numerical simulations of electron MHD in a representative volume of neutron star crust matter, for the first time including the magnetization and magnetic susceptibility resulting from Landau quantization. We find that the potential enhancement in the ohmic dissipation rate due to this effect can be a factor ∼3 for temperatures of the order of 108 K, and ∼4.5 for temperatures of the order of 5 × 107 K, depending on the magnetic field configuration. The nonlinear Hall term is crucial to this amplification: without it, the magnetic field decay is only enhanced by a factor ≲2 even at 5 × 107 K. These effects generate a high wavenumber plateau in the magnetic energy spectrum associated with the small-scale de Haas–van Alphen oscillations. Our results suggest that this mechanism could help explain the magnetar heating problem, though due to the effect's temperature-dependence, full magneto-thermal evolution simulations in a realistic stellar model are needed to judge whether it is viable explanation.

<title>Evolution of Magnetohydrodynamic Turbulence in the Expanding Solar Wind: Residual Energy and Intermittency</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We conduct 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of decaying turbulence in the context of the solar wind. To account for the spherical expansion of the solar wind, we implement the expanding box model. The initial turbulence comprises uncorrelated counterpropagating Alfvén waves and exhibits an isotropic power spectrum. Our findings reveal the consistent generation of negative residual energy whenever nonlinear interactions are present, independent of the normalized cross helicity σc and compressibility. The spherical expansion facilitates this process. The resulting residual energy is primarily distributed in the perpendicular direction, with S2(b) − S2(u) ∝ l⊥ or equivalently . Here S2(b) and S2(u) are second-order structure functions of magnetic field and velocity respectively. In most runs, S2(b) develops a scaling relation ( ). In contrast, S2(u) is consistently shallower than S2(b), which aligns with in situ observations of the solar wind. We observe that the higher-order statistics of the turbulence, which act as a proxy for intermittency, depend on the initial σc and are strongly affected by the expansion effect. Generally, the intermittency is more pronounced when the expansion effect is present. Finally, we find that in our simulations, although the negative residual energy and intermittency grow simultaneously as the turbulence evolves, the causal relation between them seems to be weak, possibly because they are generated on different scales.

<title>Phase-transition-induced Collapse of Proto-compact Stars and Its Implication for Supernova Explosions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A hadron–quark phase transition (PT) may trigger supernova explosions during stellar core collapse. However, both success and failure have occurred in previous attempts to explode dying stars via this mechanism. We systematically explore the outcomes of the PT-induced collapse of mock proto-compact stars (PCSs) with a constant entropy and lepton fraction, with spherically symmetric general relativistic hydrodynamic simulations and a controlled series of hybrid equations of state. Our results reveal the qualitative dependence of successful and failed explosions on the PT and quark matter characteristics. A small portion (∼0.04%−1%) of the released binding energy ΔEB transforms into the diagnostic explosion energy Eexp,diag, which saturates at ∼6 × 1051 erg near the black hole formation. Note that our Eexp,diag represents an upper limit of the final explosion energies in realistic supernova simulations. We draw the phase diagrams indicative of the possible fates of supernova explosions driven by hadron−quark PTs, where the control parameters are the onset density, the energy gap of the PT, and the quark matter speed of sound. Our findings can guide further self-consistent investigations on PT-driven core-collapse supernovae and help identify hadron−quark PT-induced PCS collapse from future observations.

<title>Cosmic Reionization on Computers: The Evolution of the Ionizing Background and Mean Free Path</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada1d3</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada1d3</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Observations of the end stages of reionization indicate that at z ≈ 5–6, the ionizing background is not uniform and the mean free path (MFP) changes drastically. As the MFP is closely related to the distribution of Lyman-limit systems (LLSs) and damped Lyα absorbers, it is important to understand them. In this study, we utilize the Cosmic Reionization on Computers (CROC) simulations, which have both sufficient spatial resolution to resolve galaxy formation and LLSs alongside a fully coupled radiative transfer, to simulate the reionization processes. We analyze two CROC boxes with distinct reionization histories and find that the distributions of the ionizing background in both simulations display significant skewness. Further, the ionizing background in the late-reionization box still displays significant fluctuations (∼40%) at z ≈ 5. We also measure the MFP along sightlines that center on potential quasar hosting halos. The evolution of the MFP measured from these sightlines exhibits a break that coincides with the disappearance of all the neutral islands in the reionization history of each box. In the absence of LLSs, the MFP will be biased high by ≈20% at z ≈ 5. We also compare the MFPs measured in random sightlines. We find that at z ≈ 5, the MFPs measured in sightlines that start from massive halos are systematically smaller by ≈10% compared with the MFPs measured in random sightlines. We attribute this difference to the concentration of dense structures within 1 pMpc of massive halos. Our findings highlight the importance of high-fidelity models in the interpretation of observational measurements.

Collision-induced spectra are essential for radiative transfer modeling of Titan's atmosphere. We present experimental spectra of nitrogen–methane mixtures with an accompanying fit of N2-CH4 collision-induced absorption in the 30–400 cm−1 region at about 130 K. We found a peak absorption of 2.30 × 10−5 cm−1 amagat−2 at 75 cm−1 and a secondary peak of 1.35 × 10−5 cm−1 amagat−2 at 206.5 cm−1, which agrees with previous studies. Our work does not support the suggestion that N2-CH4 CIA in the far-infrared should be increased by about 50%, as suggested by spectroscopic modeling of Titan using data from A. Borysow & C. Tang.

<title>Optical Quasiperiodic Oscillations with 550 Day Periodicity in the Reverberation-mapped Broad Line Quasar PG 1411+442</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this paper, optical quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) with 550 day periodicity related to a candidate subparsec binary black hole (BBH) system are reported in the reverberation-mapped broad line quasar PG 1411+442 but with a different line profile of broad Hα from that of broad Hβ in its rms spectrum. First, considering the sine function to describe the 18.8 yr long light curves from the Catalina Sky Survey, All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae, and Zwicky Transient Facility, 550 day periodicity can be confirmed with a confidence level higher than 5σ. Second, the stable 550 day optical QPOs can be reconfirmed with confidence levels higher than 5σ by the generalized Lomb–Scargle periodogram, the sine-like phase-folded light curves, and the weighted wavelet z-transform technique determined power maps. Third, based on simulated light curves by the continuous autoregressive process, a confidence level higher than 3.5σ can be confirmed for the optical QPOs not related to intrinsic active galactic nucleus (AGN) variability. Moreover, considering the spatial separation of central two black hole (BH) accreting systems with smaller than expected sizes of broad emission line regions, a central total BH mass higher than 106 M⊙ could lead to few effects of supposed BBH systems on estimated virial BH masses. Meanwhile, disk precession is not preferred due to the similar estimated sizes of the optical and near-ultraviolet emission regions, and jet precession can be ruled out due to PG 1411+442 being a radio-quiet quasar. The results strongly indicate it would be practicable, by applying very different line profiles of broad Balmer emission lines, to detect candidate BBH systems in normal broad line AGN in the near future.

<title>Modeling the Magnetic Connection from Earth to Solar Corona during the May 11 Geomagnetic Superstorm</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In early 2024 May, the solar active region AR 13664 released a series of X-class solar flares and multiple coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that resulted in the strongest geomagnetic storm of the last 20 yr. This study aims at improving our understanding of the magnetic connectivity between Earth and the solar corona by reconstructing the magnetic footpoint of the Earth on the solar surface during this geomagnetic superstorm. A Monte Carlo simulation was applied to model the random walk of interplanetary magnetic field lines due to low-frequency turbulence in the solar wind. This model uses local diffusion coefficients dependent on magnetic fluctuations and the correlation length of solar wind turbulence. The simulation revealed an enhanced diffusion of magnetic field lines due to the passage of CMEs, leading to a broader area of solar surface magnetically connected to Earth, particularly near AR 13664. This proximity facilitated the rapid propagation of solar energetic protons, increasing fluxes observed at L1. The findings have significant implications for predicting space weather effects on Earth and other solar system bodies, contributing to the development of more accurate models for future space exploration missions. Since the Parker spiral reconstruction is consistent with the Magnetic Connectivity Tool, validating the model's reliability, it shows promise for reconstructing magnetic connections for potential real-time purposes.

<title>SIRI-2 Detection of the Gamma-Ray Burst 221009A</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
SIRI-2 is a collection of strontium iodide gamma-ray detectors sensitive at approximately 400 keV to 10 MeV, launched on the Department of Defense's STPSat-6 to geosynchronous orbit. SIRI-2 detected the gamma-ray burst (GRB) 221009A and, unlike most GRB detectors, was not saturated and did not require any pulse pileup corrections. The energetics of this burst as measured by SIRI-2 are consistent with those found by other instruments, and the Band function fits to the spectra are consistent with those from the unsaturated Insight and GECAM instruments and similar to corrected spectra from the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor, but softer than those found by Konus-Wind when that instrument was saturated. The total fluence measured with SIRI-2 was measured to be 0.140 ± 0.002 erg cm−2, lower than other instruments, likely due to the increasing background of SIRI-2 forcing the calculation to use a smaller time interval. An extrapolation of the distributions of fluences from GRBs to the fluence of 221009A measured with SIRI-2 indicates bursts brighter than this one should occur about once every 4000 yr.

<title>Physics-driven Explosions of Stripped High-mass Stars: Synthetic Light Curves and Spectra of Stripped-envelope Supernovae with Broad Light Curves</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada26d</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Stripped-envelope supernovae (SESNe) represent a significant fraction of core-collapse supernovae, arising from massive stars that have shed their hydrogen and, in some cases, helium envelopes. The origins and explosion mechanisms of SESNe remain a topic of active investigation. In this work, we employ radiative-transfer simulations to model the light curves and spectra of a set of explosions of single, solar-metallicity, massive Wolf–Rayet stars with ejecta masses ranging from 4 to 11 M⊙, which were computed from a turbulence-aided and neutrino-driven explosion mechanism. We analyze these synthetic observables to explore the impact of varying ejecta mass and helium content on observable features. We find that the light curve shape of these progenitors with high ejecta masses is consistent with observed SESNe with broad light curves but not the peak luminosities. The commonly used analytic formula based on rising bolometric light curves overestimates the ejecta mass of these high-initial-mass progenitor explosions by a factor of up to 2.6. In contrast, the calibrated method by Haynie et al., which relies on late-time decay tails, reduces uncertainties to an average of 20% within the calibrated ejecta mass range. Spectroscopically, the He i 1.083 μm line remains prominent even in models with as little as 0.02 M⊙ of helium. However, the strength of the optical He i lines is not directly proportional to the helium mass but instead depends on a complex interplay of factors such as the 56Ni distribution, composition, and radiation field. Thus, producing realistic helium features requires detailed radiative transfer simulations for each new hydrodynamic model.

<title>The PANORAMIC Survey: Pure Parallel Wide Area Legacy Imaging with JWST/NIRCam</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the PANORAMIC survey, a pure parallel extragalactic imaging program with JWST/NIRCam observed during Cycle 1. The survey obtained ∼530 square arcmin of NIRCam imaging from 1–5 μm, totaling ∼192 hr of science integration time. This represents the largest on-sky time investment of any Cycle 1 GO extragalactic NIRCam imaging program by nearly a factor of 2. The survey includes ∼432 square arcmin of novel sky area not yet observed with JWST using at least six NIRCam broadband filters, increasing the existing area covered by similar Cycle 1 data by ∼60%. Additionally, 70 square arcmin was also covered by a seventh filter (F410M). A fraction of PANORAMIC data (∼200 square arcmin) was obtained in or around extragalactic deep fields, enhancing their legacy value. Pure parallel observing naturally creates a “wedding cake” survey with both wide and ultra-deep tiers, with 5σ point-source depths at F444W ranging from 27.8–29.4 (ABmag), and with minimized cosmic variance. The ≳6-filter strategy yields remarkably good photometric redshift performance, achieving similar median scatter and outlier fraction as CANDELS (σNMAD ∼ 0.07; η ∼ 0.2), enabling a wealth of science across redshift without need for follow-up or ancillary data. We overview the proposed survey, the data obtained as part of this program, and document the science-ready data products in the data release. PANORAMIC has delivered wide-area and deep imaging with excellent photometric performance, demonstrating that pure parallel observations with JWST are a highly efficient observing mode that is key to acquiring a complete picture of galaxy evolution from rare bright galaxies to fainter, more abundant sources across redshifts.

<title>What Does the LMC Look Like? It Depends on [M/H] and Age</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9b17</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9b17</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We offer a new way to look at the LMC through stellar mono-abundance and mono-age mono-abundance maps. These maps are based on ≳500,000 member stars with estimates of [M/H] (σ[M/H] ~ 0.17) and age ), derived from Gaia Data Release 3 XP spectra and photometry, which are tied to and validated against APOGEE. This results in the first area-complete, metallicity- and age-differentiated stellar maps of any disk galaxy. Azimuthally averaged, these maps reveal a surprisingly simple picture of the Milky Way's largest satellite galaxy. For any [M/H] below −0.1 dex, the LMC's radial profile is well described by a simple exponential, but with a scale length that steadily shrinks toward higher metallicities, from nearly 2.3 kpc at [M/H] = −1.8 to only 0.75 kpc at [M/H] = −0.25, as fit by forward modeling the spatial distribution of mono-[M/H] populations. The prominence of the bar decreases dramatically with [M/H], making it barely discernible at [M/H] ≲ −1.5. Yet, even for metal-rich populations, the bar has little impact on the azimuthally averaged profile of the mono-abundance components. Including ages, we find that the scale length is a greater function of age than of metallicity, with younger populations far more centrally concentrated. Only at old ages does the scale length change, specifically decrease, with increasing metallicity. These findings provide quantitative support for a scenario in which the LMC built its stellar structure effectively outside-in.

<title>On the Formation of Planets in the Milky Way’s Thick Disk</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9aa1</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Exoplanet demographic surveys have revealed that close-in (≲1 au) small planets orbiting stars in the Milky Way’s thick disk are ∼50% less abundant than those orbiting stars in the Galactic thin disk. One key difference between the two stellar populations is the time at which they emerged: thick-disk stars are the likely product of cosmic noon (redshift z ∼ 2), an era characterized by high star formation rate, massive and dense molecular clouds, and strong supersonic turbulence. Solving for the background radiation field in these early star-forming regions, we demonstrate that protoplanetary disks at cosmic noon experienced radiation fields up to ∼7 orders of magnitude more intense than in solar neighborhood conditions. Coupling the radiation field to a one-dimensional protoplanetary disk evolution model, we find that external UV photoevaporation destroys protoplanetary disks in just ∼0.2–0.5 Myr, limiting the timescale over which planets can assemble. Disk temperatures exceed the sublimation temperatures of common volatile species for ≳Myr timescales, predicting more spatial homogeneity in gas chemical composition. Our calculations imply that the deficit in planet occurrence around thick-disk stars should be even more pronounced for giant planets, particularly those at wide orbital separations, predicting a higher rocky-to-giant planet ratio in the Galactic thick disk versus thin disk.

<title>Giant Hall Waves Launched by Superconducting Phase Transition in Pulsars</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad90a3</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The cores of pulsars are expected to become superconducting soon after birth. The transition to type-II superconductivity is associated with the bunching of magnetic field lines into discrete superconducting flux tubes which possess enormous tension. The coupling of the crust to the flux tubes implies the existence of huge tangential magnetic fields at the crust–core interface. We show that the transition to superconductivity triggers a highly nonlinear response in the Hall drift of the crustal magnetic field, an effect which was neglected in previous numerical modeling. We argue that at the time of the phase transition giant Hall waves are launched from the crust–core interface toward the surface. Our models show that if the crust contains a multipolar magnetic field ∼1013 G, the amplitude of the Hall waves is ∼1015 G. The elastic deformation of the lattice is included in our models, which allows us to track the time-dependent shear stresses everywhere in the crust. The simulations indicate that the Hall waves may be strong enough to break the crust, and could cause star quakes which trigger rotation glitches and changes in the radio pulse profile. The Hall waves also couple to slow magnetospheric changes, which cause anomalous braking indices. The emission of the giant Hall waves from the crust–core interface facilitates fast flux expulsion from the superconducting core, provided that the flux tubes in the core are themselves sufficiently mobile. For all of the flux tube mobility prescriptions implemented in this work, the core approaches the Meissner state with B = 0 at late times.

Eclipses of radio emission have been reported for ∼58 spider millisecond pulsars (MSPs), of which only around 19% have been extensively studied. Such studies at low frequencies are crucial for probing the properties of the eclipse medium. This study investigates eclipses in 10 MSPs in compact orbit using wide-bandwidth observations with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope. We report the first evidence of eclipsing for PSR J2234+0944 and J2214+3000 in one epoch, while no evidence of eclipsing was observed in the subsequent two epochs, indicating temporal evolution of the eclipse cutoff frequency in these systems. Constraints on the eclipse cutoff frequency were obtained for PSR J1555–2908, J1810+1744, and J2051–0827. Moreover, for the first time, we detected an eclipse at a nonstandard orbital phase (∼0.5) for PSR J1810+1744, with a duration longer than the eclipse observed at superior conjunction. No eclipses were detected for PSR J0751+1807, J1738+0333, and J1807–2459A at 300–500 MHz and 550–750 MHz. We calculated the mass-loss rate of the companion for PSR J1555–2908 and PSR J1810+1744 and found that these rates are insufficient to ablate the companion stars. We cataloged the , mass function, Roche lobe filling factor, and inclination angle for compact MSP binaries with low-mass companions and found that higher spin-down flux does not guarantee eclipses. Our analysis, supported by the Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic, confirms that eclipsing black widow binaries generally exhibit a higher mass function compared to noneclipsing black widow binaries, consistent with previous studies.

<title>Peculiar Dust Emission within the Orion Molecular Cloud</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad93c7</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
It is widely assumed that dust opacities in molecular clouds follow a power-law profile with an index, β. Recent studies of the Orion Molecular Cloud (OMC) 2/3 complex, however, show a flattening in the spectral energy distribution (SED) at λ > 2 mm, implying nonconstant indices on scales ≳0.08 pc. The origin of this flattening is not yet known, but it may be due to the intrinsic properties of the dust grains or contamination from other sources of emission. We investigate the SED slopes in OMC 2/3 further using observations of six protostellar cores with Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) from 2.9–3.6 mm and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Atacama Compact Array in Band 4 (1.9–2.1 mm) and Band 5 (1.6–1.8 mm) on core and envelope scales of ∼0.02–0.08 pc. We confirm flattened opacity indices between 2.9 mm and 3.6 mm for the six cores with β ≈ −0.16 to 1.45, which are notably lower than the β-values of >1.3 measured for these sources on 0.08 pc scales from single-dish data. Four sources have consistent SED slopes between the ALMA data and the NOEMA data. We propose that these sources may have a significant fraction of emission coming from large dust grains in embedded disks, which biases the emission more at longer wavelengths. Two sources, however, had inconsistent slopes between the ALMA and NOEMA data, indicating different origins of emission. These results highlight how care is needed when combining multiscale observations or extrapolating single-band observations to other wavelengths.

<title>Detecting Stellar Flares in Photometric Data Using Hidden Markov Models</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad95f6</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad95f6</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a hidden Markov model (HMM) for discovering stellar flares in light-curve data of stars. HMMs provide a framework to model time series data that are nonstationary; they allow for systems to be in different states at different times and consider the probabilities that describe the switching dynamics between states. In the context of the discovery of stellar flares, we exploit the HMM framework by allowing the light curve of a star to be in one of three states at any given time step: quiet, firing, or decaying. This three-state HMM formulation is designed to enable straightforward identification of stellar flares, their duration, and associated uncertainty. This is crucial for estimating the flare's energy, and is useful for studies of stellar flare energy distributions. We combine our HMM with a celerite model that accounts for quasiperiodic stellar oscillations. Through an injection recovery experiment, we demonstrate and evaluate the ability of our method to detect and characterize flares in stellar time series. We also show that the proposed HMM flags fainter and lower energy flares more easily than traditional sigma-clipping methods. Lastly, we visually demonstrate that simultaneously conducting detrending and flare detection can mitigate biased estimations arising in multistage modeling approaches. Thus, this method paves a new way to calculate stellar flare energy. We conclude with an example application to one star observed by TESS, showing how the HMM compares with sigma clipping when using real data.

<title>What Can DKIST/DL-NIRSP Tell Us about Quiet-Sun Magnetism?</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad98e7</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Quiet-Sun regions cover most of the Sun's surface; their magnetic fields contribute significantly to solar chromospheric and coronal heating. However, characterizing the magnetic fields of the quiet Sun is challenging due to their weak polarization signal. The 4 m Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) is expected to improve our understanding of quiet-Sun magnetism. In this paper, we assess the diagnostic capability of the Diffraction Limited Near Infrared Spectropolarimeter (DL-NIRSP) instrument on DKIST for the energy transport processes in the quiet-Sun photosphere. To this end, we synthesize high-resolution, high-cadence Stokes profiles of the Fe i 630 nm lines using a realistic magnetohydrodynamic simulation, degrade them to emulate the DKIST/DL-NIRSP observations, and subsequently infer the vector magnetic and velocity fields. For the assessment, we first verify that a widely used flow tracking algorithm, the Differential Affine Velocity Estimator for Vector Magnetograms, works well for estimating the large-scale (>200 km) photospheric velocity fields with these high-resolution data. We then examine how the accuracy of the inferred velocity depends on the temporal resolution. Finally, we investigate the reliability of the Poynting flux estimate and its dependence on the model assumptions. The results suggest that the unsigned Poynting flux, estimated with existing schemes, can account for about 71.4% and 52.6% of the reference ground truth at and . However, the net Poynting flux tends to be significantly underestimated. The error mainly arises from the underestimated contribution of the horizontal motion. We discuss the implications for DKIST observations.

<title>An Investigation into the Selection and Colors of Little Red Dots and Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9920</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9920</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Recently, a large number of compact sources at z > 4 with blue UV slopes and extremely red rest-frame optical slopes have been found in James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) extragalactic surveys. As a subsample of these sources, commonly called “little red dots” (LRDs), have been spectroscopically observed to host a broad-line active galactic nucleus (AGN), they have been the focus of multiple recent studies in an attempt to understand the origin of their UV and optical emission. Here, we assemble a sample of 123 LRDs from the literature along with spectroscopic and photometric JWST-identified samples of AGNs to compare their colors and spectral slopes. We find that while obscured AGNs at z < 6 have highly dissimilar colors to LRDs, unobscured AGNs at z < 6 span a wide range of colors, with only a subsample showing colors similar to LRDs. At z > 6, the majority of the unobscured AGNs that have been found in these samples are LRDs, but this may be related to the fact that these sources are at large bolometric luminosities. Because LRDs occupy a unique position in galaxy color space, they are more straightforward to target, and the large number of broad-line AGNs that do not have LRD colors and slopes are therefore underrepresented in many spectroscopic surveys because they are more difficult to preselect. Current LRD selection techniques return a large and disparate population, including many sources having 2–5 μm colors impacted by emission-line flux boosting in individual filters.

<title>Potential Technosignature from Anomalously Low Deuterium/Hydrogen in Planetary Water Depleted by Nuclear Fusion Technology</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Deuterium–deuterium (DD) fusion is viewed as an ideal energy source for humanity in the far future, given a vast seawater supply of D. Here, we consider long-lived, extraterrestrial, technological societies that develop DD fusion. If such a society persisted over geologic timescales, oceanic deuterium would diminish. For an ocean mass and initial deuterium/hydrogen (D/H) ratio that were Earth-like, fusion power use of only ∼10 times that projected for humankind next century would deplete the D/H ratio in ∼(a few) ×108 yr to values below that of the local interstellar medium (ISM). Ocean masses of a few percent of Earth’s would reach an anomalously low D/H in ∼106–107 yr. The timescale shortens with greater energy consumption, smaller oceans, or lower initial D/H. Here, we suggest that anomalous D/H in planetary water below local ISM values of ∼16 × 10−6 (set by Big Bang nucleosynthesis plus deuterium loss onto dust or small admixtures of deuterium-poor stellar material) may be a technosignature. Unlike SETI using radio signals, anomalous D/H would persist for eons, even if civilizations perished or relocated. We discuss the wavelengths of strong absorption features for detecting D/H anomalies in atmospheric water vapor. These are vibrational O–D stretching at 3.7 μm in transmission spectroscopy of Earth-like worlds, ∼1.5 μm (in the wings of the 1.4 μm water band) in the shorter near-infrared for direct imaging by the Habitable Worlds Observatory, and ∼7.5-8 μm (in the wings of the broad 6.3 μm bending vibration of water) for concepts like the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The cosmic X-ray background (CXB) is dominated by the obscured and unobscured coronal light of active galactic nuclei (AGN). At energies below 10 keV, the CXB can be well explained by models taking into account the known AGN and the observed distribution of their obscuring, line-of-sight column densities, NH,l.o.s. However, at energies around the Compton reflection hump (~30 keV), the models fall short of the data. This suggests the existence of a population of as yet undetected Compton-thick (CT) AGN (NH,l.o.s > 1.5 × 1024 cm−2) whose X-ray spectra are dominated by the light that has been reprocessed by the obscuring material. In this work, we continue the effort to find and catalog all local (z < 0.05) CT AGN. To this end, we obtained soft X-ray data with Chandra for six local BAT detected sources lacking ROSAT (0.1–2.4 keV) counterparts, indicating potential obscuration. We fit their spectra with Bayesian and least squares methods using two different models, borus02 and UXCLUMPY. We compare the results of the different models and methods and find that the NH,l.o.s is consistently measured in each case. Three of the sources were also observed with XMM-Newton, allowing the opportunity to search for variability in soft X-ray flux or NH,l.o.s. From this sample, we find one strong CT candidate (NGC 5759) and one weaker CT candidate (CGCG 1822.3+2053). Furthermore, we find tentative evidence of NH,l.o.s variability in 2MASX J17253053–4510279, which has NH,l.o.s < 1022 cm−2.

<title>Testing the Breakdown of the Asteroseismic Scaling Relations in Luminous Red Giants</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Nearly all cool, evolved stars are solar-like oscillators, and fundamental stellar properties can be inferred from these oscillations with asteroseismology. Scaling relations are commonly used to relate global asteroseismic properties—the frequency of maximum power and the large-frequency separation Δν—to stellar properties. Mass, radius, and age can then be inferred with the addition of stellar spectroscopy. There is excellent agreement between seismic radii and fundamental data on the lower red giant branch and red clump. However, the scaling relations appear to breakdown in luminous red-giant stars. We attempt to constrain the contributions of the asteroseismic parameters to the observed breakdown. We test the and Δν scaling relations separately, by using stars of known mass and radius in star clusters and the Milky Way's high-α sequence. We find evidence that the Δν scaling relation contributes to the observed breakdown in luminous giants more than the relation. We test different methods of mapping the observed Δν to the mean density via a correction factor, FΔν, and find a ≈ 1%–3% difference in the radii in the luminous giant regime, depending on the technique used to measure FΔν. The differences between the radii inferred by these two techniques are too small on the luminous giant branch to account for the inflated seismic radii observed in evolved giant stars. Finally, we find that the FΔν correction is insensitive to the adopted mixing length, chosen by calibrating the models to observations of Teff .

<title>Can Active Galactic Nuclei Activity Be Enhanced by Ram Pressure Stripping?—X-Ray Perspective</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9b7f</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Ram pressure stripping (RPS) is an important process that plays a significant role in shaping the evolution of cluster galaxies and their surrounding environment. Despite its recognized significance, the potential connection between RPS and active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity in cluster galaxies remains poorly understood. Recent claims, based on optical emission-line diagnostics, have suggested such a connection. Here, we investigate this relationship from an X-ray perspective, using a sample of galaxies undergoing RPS in four nearby galaxy clusters: A1656, A1367, A426, and A3627. This study is the first to test such a connection from an X-ray standpoint. Our analysis reveals no signs of enhanced X-ray AGN activity in our sample, with most RPS galaxies (~90%) showing X-ray luminosities below 1041 erg s−1 in their central point sources. Moreover, there is no noticeable difference in X-ray AGN activity among RPS galaxies compared to a control sample of non-RPS galaxies, as demonstrated by the similar X-ray luminosities observed in their central point sources. While the most luminous X-ray AGN in our sample is found in ESO 137-002, a galaxy undergoing RPS in A3627, there is no evidence for a widespread enhancement of X-ray AGN activity due to RPS. Given the limited sample size of our study, this could also indicate that either the X-ray AGN enhancement from RPS is at most weak or the timescale for the X-ray AGN enhancement is short. This emphasizes the need for further investigations with larger X-ray samples to better understand the impact of RPS on AGN activity in cluster galaxies.

<title>Tides on Lava Worlds: Application to Close-in Exoplanets and the Early Earth–Moon System</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Understanding the physics of planetary magma oceans has been the subject of growing efforts, in light of the increasing abundance of solar system samples and extrasolar surveys. A rocky planet harboring such an ocean is likely to interact tidally with its host star, planetary companions, or satellites. To date, however, models of the tidal response and heat generation of magma oceans have been restricted to the framework of weakly viscous solids, ignoring the dynamical fluid behavior of the ocean beyond a critical melt fraction. Here we provide a handy analytical model that accommodates this phase transition, allowing for a physical estimation of the tidal response of lava worlds. We apply the model in two settings: the tidal history of the early Earth–Moon system in the aftermath of the giant impact, and the tidal interplay between short-period exoplanets and their host stars. For the former, we show that the fluid behavior of the Earth's molten surface drives efficient early lunar recession to ~25 Earth radii within 104–105 yr, in contrast with earlier predictions. For close-in exoplanets, we report on how their molten surfaces significantly change their spin–orbit dynamics, allowing them to evade spin–orbit resonances and accelerating their track toward tidal synchronization from a gigayear to megayear timescale. Moreover, we reevaluate the energy budgets of detected close-in exoplanets, highlighting how the surface thermodynamics of these planets are likely controlled by enhanced, fluid-driven tidal heating, rather than vigorous insolation, and how this regime change substantially alters predictions for their surface temperatures.

<title>Finding Lensed Radio Sources with the Very Large Array Sky Survey</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Radio observations of strongly lensed objects are valuable as cosmological probes. Lensed radio sources have proven difficult to identify, in large part due to the limited depth and angular resolution of the previous generation of radio sky surveys, and, as such, only a few dozen lensed radio sources are known. In this work, we present the results of a pilot study, using the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) in combination with optical data to more efficiently identify lensed radio sources. We obtain high-resolution (0 2) VLA follow-up observations for 11 targets that we identify using three different techniques: (i) a search for compact radio sources offset from galaxies with high lensing potential, (ii) VLASS detections of known lensed galaxies, and (iii) VLASS detections of known lensed quasars. Five of our targets show radio emission from the lensed images, including 100% of the lensed optical quasar systems. This work demonstrates the efficacy of combining deep- and high-resolution wide-area radio and optical survey data to efficiently find lensed radio sources, and we discuss the potential impact of such an approach using next-generation surveys with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, Euclid, and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.

<title>Reverberation Mapping of Two Variable Active Galactic Nuclei: Probing the Distinct Characteristics of the Inner and Outer Broad-line Regions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Current reverberation mapping (RM) studies primarily focus on single emission lines, particularly the Hβ line, which may not fully reveal the geometry and kinematic properties of the broad-line region (BLR). To overcome this limitation, we have conducted multiline RM observations on two highly variable active galactic nuclei (AGNs), KUG 1141+371 and UGC 3374, using the Lijiang 2.4 m telescope. Our goal was to investigate the detailed structures of different regions within the BLR. We measured the time lags of multiple broad emission lines (Hα, Hβ, Hγ, He i, and He ii) and found clear evidence of radial ionization stratification in the BLRs of both AGNs. Velocity-resolved RM analysis revealed distinct geometry and kinematics between the inner and outer regions of the BLRs. Assuming that the velocity-resolved lags reflect the kinematics of the BLR, our observations indicate that: (1) in KUG 1141+371, the inner BLR exhibits outflow signatures, while the outer region is consistent with virialized motion; and (2) in UGC 3374, the inner region displays virial motion, while the outer region shows inflow. Furthermore, we detected “breathing” behavior in the outer BLR regions of both AGNs, while the inner BLR regions show “anti-breathing,” which may be linked to intrinsic BLR properties. We discuss these findings in the context of various BLR formation models, highlighting the importance of long-term, multiline RM campaigns in understanding of BLR structure and evolution. Additionally, our results suggest that the observed stratification in BLR geometry and kinematics may contribute to the scatter in black hole mass estimates and the rapid changes in velocity-resolved RM signatures reported in recent studies.

<title>Figuring Out Gas and Galaxies In Enzo (FOGGIE). VIII. Complex and Stochastic Metallicity Gradients at z > 2</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Gas-phase metallicity gradients are a crucial element in understanding the chemical evolution of galaxies. We use the FOGGIE simulations to study the metallicity gradients (∇Z) of six Milky Way–like galaxies throughout their evolution. FOGGIE galaxies generally exhibit steep negative gradients for most of their history, with only a few short-lived instances reaching positive slopes that appear to arise mainly from interactions with other galaxies. FOGGIE concurs with other simulation results but disagrees with the robust observational finding that flat and positive gradients are common at z > 1. By tracking the metallicity gradient at a rapid cadence of simulation outputs (∼5–10 Myr), we find that theoretical gradients are highly stochastic: the FOGGIE galaxies spend ∼30%–50% of their time far away from a smoothed trajectory inferred from analytic models or other, less high-cadence simulations. This rapid variation makes instantaneous gradients from observations more difficult to interpret in terms of physical processes. Because of these geometric and stochastic complications, we explore nonparametric methods of quantifying the evolving metallicity distribution at z > 1. We investigate how efficiently nonparametric measures of the 2D metallicity distribution respond to metal production and mixing. Our results suggest that new methods of quantifying and interpreting gas-phase metallicity will be needed to relate trends in upcoming high-z James Webb Space Telescope observations with the underlying physics of gas accretion, expulsion, and recycling in early galaxies.

<title>Simulations of Eccentricity Growth in Compact Binary Accretion Disks with Magnetohydrodynamic Turbulence</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the results of four magnetohydrodynamic simulations and one alpha-disk simulation of accretion disks in a compact binary system, neglecting vertical stratification and assuming a locally isothermal equation of state. We demonstrate that in the presence of a net vertical field, disks that extend out to the 3:1 mean-motion resonance grow eccentricity in full MHD in much the same way as in hydrodynamical disks. Hence, turbulence due to the magnetorotational instability (MRI) does not impede the tidally driven growth of eccentricity in any meaningful way. However, we find two important differences with alpha-disk theory. First, in MHD, eccentricity builds up in the inner disk with a series of episodes of radial disk-breaking into two misaligned eccentric disks, separated by a region of circular orbits. Standing eccentric waves are often present in the inner eccentric disk. Second, the successful spreading of an accretion disk with MRI turbulence out to the resonant radius is nontrivial—and much harder than spreading an alpha disk. This is due to the tendency to develop overdense rings in which tidal torques overwhelm MRI transport and truncate the disk too early. We believe that the inability to spread the disk sufficiently was the reason why our previous attempt to excite eccentricity via the 3:1 mean-motion resonance with MHD failed. Exactly how MHD disks successfully spread outward in compact binary systems is an important problem that has not yet been understood.

<title>Physical Pathways for JWST-observed Supermassive Black Holes in the Early Universe</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed active galactic nuclei (AGN) powered by supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with estimated masses of 107–108M⊙ at redshifts z ∼ 7–9. Some reside in overmassive systems with higher AGN to stellar mass ratios than locally. Understanding how massive black holes could form so early in cosmic history and affect their environment to establish the observed relations today are some of the major open questions in astrophysics and cosmology. One model to create these massive objects is through direct collapse black holes (DCBHs) that provide massive seeds (∼105–106M⊙), able to reach high masses in the limited time available. We use the cosmological simulation code GIZMO to study the formation and growth of DCBH seeds in the early Universe. To grow the DCBHs, we implement a gas swallowing model set to match the Eddington accretion rate as long as the nearby gaseous environment, affected by stellar and accretion disk feedback, provides sufficient fuel. We find that to create massive AGN in overmassive systems at high redshifts, massive seeds accreting more efficiently than the fiducial Bondi–Hoyle model are needed. We assess whether the conditions for such enhanced accretion rates are realistic by considering limits on plausible transport mechanisms. We also examine various DCBH growth histories and find that mass growth is more sustained in overdense cosmological environments, where high gas densities are achieved locally. We discuss the exciting prospect to directly probe the assembly history of the first SMBHs with upcoming, ultradeep JWST surveys.

<title>Radial-dependent Responsivity of Broad-line Regions in Active Galactic Nuclei: Observational Consequences for Reverberation Mapping and Black Hole Mass Measurements</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The reverberation mapping (RM) technique has seen wide applications in probing geometry and kinematics of broad-line regions (BLRs) and measuring masses of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in active galactic nuclei. However, key quantities in RM analysis such as emissivity, responsivity, transfer functions, and mean and rms spectra are fragmentally defined in the literature and largely lack a unified formulation. Here we establish a rigorous framework for BLR RM and include a locally dependent responsivity according to photoionization calculations. The mean and rms spectra are analytically expressed with emissivity- and responsivity-weighted transfer functions, respectively. We demonstrate that the rms spectrum is proportional to the responsivity-weighted transfer function only when the continuum variation timescale is much longer than the typical extension in time delay of the BLR; otherwise, biases arise in the obtained rms line widths. The long-standing phenomenon pertaining to the different shapes between the mean and rms spectra can be explained by a radial-increasing responsivity of BLRs. The debate on the choice of emission-line widths for SMBH mass measurements is explored, and the virial factors are suggested to also depend on the luminosity states, in addition to the geometry and kinematics of BLRs.

<title>Exploring Variation of Double-peak Broad-line Profile in Strongly Variable AGNs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The geometry and kinematics of the broad-line region (BLR) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are still unclear, which is crucial for studying the physics and evolution of supermassive black holes and AGNs. The broad-line profile provides valuable information on BLR geometry and kinematics. In this work, we explore the evolution of line profiles in variable AGNs based on the BLR model of Czerny and Hryniewicz, where the BLR is driven by the radiation pressure acting on dust at the surface layers of the accretion disk. The line profiles in the low-Eddington-ratio regime show a double-peak profile, which will become a single peak at high Eddington ratios. The high metallicity of Z ≳ 5 Z⊙ is required to reproduce the observational anticorrelation between the peak separation of broad lines and the Eddington ratio for a sample of AGNs. For the broad lines in variable AGNs, it will take several years to several decades to change their line profile if the disk luminosity suffers strong variation in a much shorter timescale. More monitoring of the broad line and continuum in strongly variable AGNs can shed special light on BLR physics.

<title>High-resolution BOES Spectroscopy of Raman-scattered He ii λ6545 in Young Planetary Nebulae</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Young planetary nebulae (PNe) are characterized by their hot central stars and the presence of abundant neutral and molecular components, which result from significant mass loss during the asymptotic giant branch phase of stellar evolution. Far-UV He iiλ1025 line photons produced near the central star can undergo Raman scattering by hydrogen atoms, creating a broad emission feature centered at ~6545 Å. We conducted high-resolution spectroscopy of 12 young PNe from 2019 April to 2020 March using the Bohyunsan Observatory Echelle Spectrograph. Building on the study by Choi and Lee, who identified Raman-scattered He ii at 6545 Å in NGC 6881 and NGC 6886, we report new detections of this feature in NGC 6741 and NGC 6884. Profile fitting reveals that the velocity of the H i component relative to the He ii emission region ranges from 26 to 33 km s−1 in these PNe. Using photoionization modeling, we estimate the line flux of He iiλ1025 and derive Raman conversion efficiencies of 0.39, 0.21, 0.24, and 0.07 for NGC 6881, NGC 6741, NGC 6886, and NGC 6884, respectively. These results, combined with radiative transfer modeling, suggest the presence of H i components with masses around 10−2M⊙, moving outward from the central He ii emission region at speeds characteristic of the slow stellar wind from a mass-losing giant star.

<title>The Microlensing Event Rate and Optical Depth from MOA-II 9 Yr Survey Toward the Galactic Bulge</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present measurements of the microlensing optical depth and event rate toward the Galactic bulge using the data set from the 2006 to 2014 MOA-II survey, which covers 22 bulge fields spanning ∼42 deg2 between −5° < l < 10° and −7° < b < −1°. In the central region with ∣l∣ < 5°, we estimate an optical depth of and an event rate of Γ = [16.08 ± 0.28] × 10−6 using a sample consisting of 3525 microlensing events, with Einstein radius crossing times of tE < 760 days and a source star magnitude of Is < 21.4 mag. We confirm our results are consistent with the latest measurements from the OGLE-IV 8 yr data set. We find our result is inconsistent with a prediction based on Galactic models, especially in the central region with ∣b∣ < 3°. These results can be used to improve the Galactic bulge model, and more central regions can be further elucidated by upcoming microlensing experiments, such as the PRime-focus Infrared Microlensing Experiment and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.

<title>Deep Searches for Radio Pulsations and Bursts from Four Magnetar and a Magnetar-like Pulsar with FAST</title>

We report on radio observations of four magnetars SGR 0501+4516, Swift 1834.9–0846, 1E 1841–045, SGR 1900+14, and a magnetar-like pulsar PSR J1846–0258 with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope at 1250 MHz. Notably, PSR J1846–0258 was observed 1 month after its 2020 X-ray outburst. The data from these observations were searched for periodic emissions and single pulses. No radio emission was detected for any of our targets. After accounting for the effect of red noise, the nondetections yield stringent upper limits on the radio flux density, with S1250 ≤ 16.9 μJy for the four magnetars and the magnetar-like pulsar, along with constraints on single-pulse flux densities. Our deep radio observations suggest that these magnetars and the magnetar-like pulsar are indeed radio-quiet sources or unfavorably beamed. The resulting flux upper limits, along with previous findings, are discussed, highlighting the significance of further radio observations of radio-quiet magnetars and the high-B magnetar-like pulsar.

<title>The First Exploration of the Correlations Between WISE 12 μm and CO Emission in Early-type Galaxies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the analysis of a comprehensive sample of 352 early-type galaxies using public data, to investigate the correlations between CO luminosities and mid-infrared luminosities observed by Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. We find strong correlations between both CO (1–0) and CO (2–1) luminosities and 12 μm luminosity, boasting a correlation coefficient greater than 0.9 and an intrinsic scatter smaller than 0.1 dex. The consistent slopes observed for the relationships of CO (1–0) and CO (2–1) suggest that the line ratio R21 lacks correlation with mid-infrared emission in early-type galaxies, which is significantly different from star-forming galaxies. Moreover, the slopes of LCO(1−0)–L12 μm and LCO(2−1)–L12 μm relations in early-type galaxies are steeper than those observed in star-forming galaxies. Given the absence of correlation with color, morphology, or specific star formation rate (sSFR), the correlation between deviations and the molecular gas mass surface density could be eliminated by correcting the possible 12 μm emission from old stars or adopting a systematically different αCO. The latter, on average, is equivalent to adding a constant CO brightness density, specifically and for CO (1–0) and (2–1), respectively. These explorations will serve as useful tools for estimating the molecular gas content in gas-poor galaxies and understanding associated quenching processes.

<title>Molecular Distributions and Abundances in the Binary-shaped Outflow of V Hya</title>

Binaries are known to play a key role in the mass loss and dynamical environments of evolved stars. Stellar and substellar companion interactions produce complex wind morphologies including rotating/expanding disks, bipolar outflows, and spiral wind patterns; however, the connection between these many structures and the gas-phase chemistry they harbor is not well constrained. To expand the sample of chemical inventories in interacting systems, we present a detailed spectroscopic case study of the binary C-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star V Hya. Using spatially resolved Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations at Bands 3, 6, and 7, we characterize the rotational emission lines and distributions of molecules in its surrounding disk undergoing dynamical expansion (DUDE). We detect emission from over 15 molecules and isotopologues toward this source, and present resolved maps for the brightest tracers of carbonaceous chemistry (e.g., CCH, C4H, HC5N, HNC, and ). Employing LTE and non-LTE models of emission from the DUDE, we estimate the abundance distributions for optically thin species, and compare them with prototypical carbon-rich AGB envelopes. We find that the average abundances of detected species are within a factor of ∼5 from sources with similar mass-loss rates; however, the distribution of daughter species in V Hya is much more compact, with carbon chain species (CCH, C4H, and HC3N) appearing with abundances >10−7 even in the innermost sampled regions (200 au) of the disk.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The European Space Agency's Rosetta mission is the only space mission that has performed long-term monitoring of a comet at close distances. For over two years, Rosetta rendezvoused with comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko, which revealed diverse evolutionary processes of the cometary nucleus. One of the most striking events is the migration of a ∼30 m boulder in the southern hemisphere region of Khonsu. Previous works found the boulder's ∼140 m displacement occurred during the three months from 2015 August to October, and several triggering mechanisms were proposed, including outburst at the boulder site, seismic vibrations from nearby activities, or surface erosion of the slope beneath the boulder. In this work, we further analyze this impressive event by analyzing imaging data from Rosetta's OSIRIS camera. We constrained the boulder's migration time to within 14 hr and derived a detailed timeline of the boulder migration event and local dust activities. High-resolution thermophysical modeling shows significant dichotomy in the thermal history of the boulder's southern and northern sides, which could have triggered or facilitated its migration via its own volatile activity.

<title>The Prevalence of Star-forming Clumps as a Function of Environmental Overdensity in Local Galaxies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
At the peak of cosmic star formation (1 ≲ z ≲ 2), the majority of star-forming galaxies hosted compact, star-forming clumps, which were responsible for a large fraction of cosmic star formation. By comparison, ≲5% of local star-forming galaxies host comparable clumps. In this work, we investigate the link between the environmental conditions surrounding local (z < 0.04) galaxies and the prevalence of clumps in these galaxies. To obtain our clump sample, we use a Faster R-CNN object detection network trained on the catalog of clump labels provided by the Galaxy Zoo: Clump Scout project, then apply this network to detect clumps in approximately 240,000 Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxies (originally selected for Galaxy Zoo 2). The resulting sample of 41,445 u-band bright clumps in 34,246 galaxies is the largest sample of clumps yet assembled. We then select a volume-limited sample of 9964 galaxies and estimate the density of their local environment using the distance to their projected fifth nearest neighbor. We find a robust correlation between environment and the clumpy fraction (fclumpy) for star-forming galaxies (specific star formation rate, sSFR > 10−2 Gyr−1) but find little to no relationship when controlling for galaxies’ sSFR or color. Further, fclumpy increases significantly with sSFR in local galaxies, particularly above sSFR > 10−1 Gyr−1. We posit that a galaxy’s gas fraction primarily controls the formation and lifetime of its clumps, and that environmental interactions play a smaller role.

<title>The Red Supergiant Progenitor Luminosity Problem</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8f3f</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Analysis of pre-explosion imaging has confirmed red supergiants (RSGs) as the progenitors to Type II-P supernovae (SNe). However, extracting an RSG's luminosity requires assumptions regarding the star’s temperature or spectral type and the corresponding bolometric correction, circumstellar extinction, and possible variability. The robustness of these assumptions is difficult to test since we cannot go back in time and obtain additional pre-explosion imaging. Here, we perform a simple test using the RSGs in M31, which have been well observed from optical to mid-IR. We ask the following: By treating each star as if we only had single-band photometry and making assumptions typically used in SN progenitor studies, what bolometric luminosity would we infer for each star? How close is this to the bolometric luminosity for that same star inferred from the full optical-to-IR spectral energy distribution (SED)? We find common assumptions adopted in progenitor studies systematically underestimate the bolometric luminosity by a factor of 2, typically leading to inferred progenitor masses that are systematically too low. Additionally, we find a much larger spread in luminosity derived from single-filter photometry compared to SED-derived luminosities, indicating uncertainties in progenitor luminosities are also underestimated. When these corrections and larger uncertainties are included in the analysis, even the most luminous known RSGs are not ruled out at the 3σ level, indicating there is currently no statistically significant evidence that the most luminous RSGs are missing from the observed sample of II-P progenitors. The proposed correction also alleviates the problem of having progenitors with masses below the expected lower-mass bound for core collapse.

The Compton Spectrometer and Imager balloon payload (COSI-Balloon) is a wide field-of-view Compton gamma-ray telescope that operates in the 0.2–5 MeV bandpass. COSI-Balloon had a successful 46 day flight in 2016 during which the instrument observed the Crab Nebula, Cygnus X-1, and Centaurus A. Using the data collected by the COSI-Balloon instrument during this flight, we present the source flux extraction of signals from the variable balloon background environment and produce images of these background-dominated sources by performing Richardson–Lucy deconvolutions. We also present the spectra measured by the COSI-Balloon instrument, compare and combine them with measurements from other instruments, and fit the data. The Crab Nebula was observed by COSI-Balloon, and we obtain a measured flux in the energy band 325–480 keV of (4.5 ± 1.6) × 103 ph cm−2 s−1. The model that best fits the COSI-Balloon data combined with measurements from NuSTAR and Swift-BAT is a broken power law with a measured photon index Γ = 2.20 ± 0.02 above the 43 keV break. Cygnus X-1 was also observed during this flight, and we obtain a measured flux of (1.4 ± 0.2) × 103 ph cm−2 s−1 in the same energy band and a best-fit result (including data from NuSTAR, Swift-BAT, and INTEGRAL/IBIS) was a cutoff power law with a high-energy cutoff energy of 138.3 ± 1.0 keV and a photon index of Γ = 1.358 ± 0.002. Finally, we present the measured spectrum of Centaurus A and our best model fit to a power law with a photon index of Γ = 1.73 ± 0.01.

<title>ATClean: A Novel Method for Detecting Low-luminosity Transients and Application to Pre-explosion Counterparts from SN 2023ixf</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In an effort to search for faint sources of emission over arbitrary timescales, we present a novel method for analyzing forced photometry light curves in difference imaging from optical surveys. Our method “ATLAS Clean,” or ATClean, utilizes the reported fluxes, uncertainties, and fits to the point-spread function (PSF) from difference images to quantify the statistical significance of individual measurements. We apply this method to control light curves across the image to determine whether any source of flux is present in the data for a range of specific timescales. From ATLAS o-band imaging at the site of the Type II supernova (SN) 2023ixf in M101 from 2015–2023, we show that this method accurately reproduces the 3σ flux limits produced from other, more computationally expensive methods. We derive limits for emission on timescales of 5 days and 80–300 days at the site of SN 2023ixf, which are 19.8 and 21.3 mag, respectively. The latter limits rule out variability for unextinguished red supergiants with initial masses >22 M⊙, comparable to the most luminous predictions for the SN 2023ixf progenitor system. We also compare our limits to short-timescale outbursts, similar to those expected for Type IIn SN progenitor stars or the Type II SN 2020tlf, and rule out outburst ejecta masses of >0.021 M⊙, much lower than the inferred mass of circumstellar matter around SN 2023ixf in the literature. In the future, these methods can be applied to any forced photometry on difference imaging from other surveys, such as Rubin optical imaging.

<title>Failure of a Solar Filament Eruption Caused by Magnetic Reconnection with Overlying Coronal Loops</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The failure of a filament eruption caused by magnetic reconnection between the erupting filament and the overlying magnetic field has been previously proposed in numerical simulations. It is, however, rarely observed. In this study, we report a reconnection between an erupting filament and its overlying coronal loops that results in the failure of the filament eruption. On 2023 September 24, a filament was located in active region 13445. It slowly rose, quickly erupted, rapidly decelerated, then finally stopped, with an untwisting motion. As a failed eruption, the event is associated with an M4.4 flare but no coronal mass ejection. During the eruption, the filament became bright, and the overlying loops appeared first in the high-temperature channels. They have average temperatures of ∼12.8 and ∼9.6 MK, respectively, indicating that both of them were heated. Two sets of new loops, separately connecting the filament endpoints and the overlying loop footpoints, then formed. Subsequently, the heated overlying loops were seen sequentially in the low-temperature channels, showing the cooling process, which is also supported by the light curves. Plasmoids formed and propagated bidirectionally along the filament and the overlying loops, indicating the presence of plasmoid instability. These results suggest that reconnection occurs between the erupting filament and the overlying loops. The erupting filament eventually disappeared, with the appearance of more newly formed loops. We propose that the reconnection between the erupting filament and the overlying loops ruins the filament completely, hence resulting in the failed eruption.

<title>Modeling High Mass X-Ray Binaries to Double Neutron Stars through Common Envelope Evolution</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present detailed evolutionary simulations of wide binary systems with high-mass (8–20 M⊙) donor stars and a 1.4 M⊙ neutron star. Mass transfer in such binaries is dynamically unstable, and common envelope (CE) evolution is followed. We use a recently developed prescription to deal with CE evolution and consider various CE ejection efficiencies varying in the range of 0.1–3.0. We focus on the evolutionary consequences of the binaries that survived CE evolution. We demonstrate that it is possible for the binaries to enter a CE decoupling phase (CEDP) when the donor stars are partially stripped, leaving a hydrogen envelope of ≲1.0–4.0 M⊙ after CE evolution. This phase is expected to last ∼104–105 yr, during which mass transfer occurs stably via Roche lobe overflow with super-Eddington rates. Identification of some X-ray binaries in a CEDP is important for the understanding of the physics of CE evolution itself, the origin of ultraluminous X-ray sources, and the recycling process of accreting pulsars. Also, we discuss the formation of double neutron stars and the occurrence of ultrastripped supernovae according to the results from our simulations. On the whole, the properties of post-CE binaries are sensitive to the options of CE ejection efficiencies.

<title>3D Localization of FRB 20190425A for Its Potential Host Galaxy and Implications</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are high-energy, short-duration phenomena in radio astronomy. Identifying their host galaxies can provide insights into their mysterious origins. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to identifying potential host galaxies in three-dimensional space. We use FRB 20190425A and GW190425 as examples to illustrate our method. Recently, due to spatial and temporal proximity, the potential association of GW190425 with FRB 20190425A has drawn attention, leading to the identification of a likely host galaxy, UGC 10667, albeit without confirmed kilonova emissions. We search for the host galaxy of FRB 20190425A with a full CHIME localization map. Regardless of the validity of the association between GW190425 and FRB 20190425A, we identify an additional potential host galaxy (SDSS J171046.84+212732.9) from the updated GLADE galaxy catalog, supplementing the importance of exploring the new volume. We employed various methodologies to determine the most probable host galaxy of GW190424 and FRB 20190425A, including a comparison of galaxy properties and constraints on their reported observation limits using various kilonova models. Our analysis suggests that current observations do not definitively identify the true host galaxy. Additionally, the kilonova models characterized by a gradual approach to their peak are contradicted by the observational upper limits of both galaxies. Although the absence of optical emission detection raises doubts, it does not definitively disprove the connection between the gravitational wave (GW) and FRB.

<title>Tidally Distorted Stars Are Triaxial Pulsators</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Stars in close binaries are tidally distorted, and this has a strong effect on their pulsation modes. We compute the mode frequencies and geometries of tidally distorted stars using perturbation theory, accounting for the effects of the Coriolis force and the coupling between different azimuthal orders m of a multiplet induced by the tidal distortion. For tidally coupled dipole pressure modes, the tidal coupling dominates over the Coriolis force and the resulting pulsations are “triaxial,” with each of the three modes in a multiplet “tidally tilted,” to be aligned with one of the three principal axes of the star. The observed amplitudes and phases of the dipole modes aligned orthogonal to the spin axis are modulated throughout the orbit, producing doublets in the power spectrum that are spaced by exactly twice the orbital frequency. Quadrupole modes have similar but slightly more complex behavior. This amplitude modulation allows for mode identification, which can potentially enable detailed asteroseismic analyses of tidally tilted pulsators. Pressure modes should exhibit this behavior in stellar binaries close enough to be tidally synchronized, while gravity modes should remain aligned with the star's spin axis. We discuss applications to various types of pulsating stars and the relationship between the tidal tilting of pulsations and the “single-sided” pulsations sometimes observed in very tidally distorted stars.

<title>The Origins of Lithium Enhancement in Polluted White Dwarfs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The bulk abundances of exoplanetesimals can be measured when they are accreted by white dwarfs. Recently, lithium from the accretion of exoplanetesimals was detected in relatively high levels in multiple white dwarfs. There are presently three proposed hypotheses to explain the detection of excess lithium in white dwarf photospheres: Big Bang and Galactic nucleosynthesis, continental crust, and an exomoon formed from spalled ring material. We present new observations of three previously known lithium-polluted white dwarfs (WD J1824+1213, WD J2317+1830, and LHS 2534), and one with metal pollution without lithium (SDSS J1636+1619). We also present atmospheric model fits to these white dwarfs. We then evaluate the abundances of these white dwarfs and two additional lithium-polluted white dwarfs that were previously fit using the same atmospheric models (WD J1644-0449 and SDSS J1330+6435) in the context of the three extant hypotheses for explaining lithium excesses in polluted white dwarfs. We find Big Bang and Galactic nucleosynthesis to be the most plausible explanation of the abundances in WD J1644-0449, WD J1824+1213, and WD J2317+1830. SDSS J1330+6435 will require stricter abundances to determine its planetesimal’s origins, and LHS 2534, as presently modeled, defies all three hypotheses. We find the accretion of an exomoon formed from spalled ring material to be highly unlikely to be the explanation of the lithium excess in any of these cases.

We examine images of the protoplanetary disk 114–426 with JWST/NIRCam in 12 bands. This large disk is oriented edge on with a dark midplane flanked by lobes of scattered light. The outer edges of the midplane are seen in silhouette against the Orion Nebula, providing a unique opportunity to study planet-forming material in absorption. We discover a dip in the scattered light of the disk at 3 μm—compelling evidence for the presence of water ice. The 3 μm dip is also seen in the silhouette of the disk, where we quantify the ice abundance with models of pure absorption and avoid the complications of disk scattering effects. We find grain ice-to-refractory mass ratios of up to ~0.2, maximum grain sizes of 0.25–5 μm, and a total dust plus ice mass of 0.46 M⊕ in the silhouette region. We also discover excess absorption in the NIRCam bands that include the Paα line, suggesting there may be excited atomic hydrogen in the disk. Examining the morphology of the scattered light lobes reveals that they are laterally offset from each other and exhibit a brightness asymmetry that flips with wavelength—both evidence for a tilted inner disk in this system.

<title>Interaction of an Outflow with Surrounding Gaseous Clouds as the Origin of Late-time Radio Flares in Tidal Disruption Events</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9b98</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Close encounter between a star and a supermassive black hole (SMBH) results in the tidal disruption of the star, known as a tidal disruption event (TDE). Recently, a few TDEs, e.g., ASASSN-15oi and AT2018hyz, have shown late-time (hundreds of days after their UV/optical peaks) radio flares with radio luminosities of 1038∼39 erg s−1. The super-Eddington fallback or accretion in a TDE may generate a mass outflow. Here, we investigate a scenario that the late-time radio flares come from the interaction of the outflow with the circumnuclear gaseous clouds, in addition to the slow-evolving emission component due to the outflow–diffuse medium interaction. We calculate the associated radio temporal and spectral signatures and find that they reproduce well the observations. The outflows have the inferred velocity of 0.2c ∼ 0.6c, the total mass of 10−3 ∼ 10−1M⊙ and the ejection duration of a month to a year. The distances of the clouds to the SMBH are 0.1 ∼ 1 pc. This scenario has advantages in explaining the long delay, sharpness of the rise, and the multiplicity of the late radio flares. Future observations may build up a much larger sample of late-time radio flares and enable their use as a probe of the TDE physics and the host circumnuclear environment.

<title>Discoveries and Properties of EL CVn–type Binaries in the TESS Survey</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9b9c</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
EL CVn–type systems represent a rare evolutionary stage in binary star evolution, providing ideal laboratories for investigating stable mass-transfer processes and the formation of extremely low-mass white dwarfs (ELM WDs). The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has delivered an extensive collection of high-precision time-domain photometric data, which is invaluable for studying EL CVn binaries. In this study, we identified 29 EL CVn systems from the TESS eclipsing binary catalogs (sectors 1–65), 11 of which are newly discovered. These systems consist of smaller, hotter prehelium WDs and A/F main-sequence stars. The orbital periods of these binaries range from 0.64 to 2.5 days. Utilizing TESS light curves, Gaia distances, and multiband photometric data (e.g., Galaxy Evolution Explorer, Two Micron All Sky Survey, Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, SkyMapper), we modeled the light curves and spectral energy distributions to derive system parameters, including effective temperatures, masses, and radii. These systems were then compared with the WD mass–period relation and the evolutionary tracks of ELM WDs. The comparison reveals that these binaries are consistent with the expected mass–period relation for WDs and align well with the evolutionary tracks on the Teff − diagram for ELM WDs. This result suggests that these EL CVn systems likely formed through stable mass-transfer processes. We provide a catalog of complete parameters for 29 EL CVn systems identified from the TESS survey. This catalog will serve as an essential resource for studying binary mass transfer, WD formation, and pulsation phenomena in EL CVn–type systems.

<title>Shock and SEP Modeling Study for the 2022 September 5 SEP Event</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
On 2022 September 5, during Parker Solar Probe's (PSP) 13th encounter, a fast shock wave and a related solar energetic particle (SEP) event were observed as the spacecraft approached the perihelion of its orbit. Observations from the Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun (IS⊙IS) instrument suite show that SEPs arrived at the spacecraft with a significant delay from the onset of the parent solar eruption and that the first arriving SEPs exhibited an inverse velocity dispersion (IVD) for energetic protons above ~1 MeV. Utilizing data from multiple spacecraft, we investigate the eruption dynamics and shock wave propagation. Our analysis includes 3D shock modeling and SEP transport simulations to examine the origins of this SEP event and explore the causes of the delayed SEP onset and the observed IVD. The data-driven SEP simulation reproduces the SEP event onset observed at PSP, its evolving energy spectrum, and the IVD. This IVD is attributed to a relatively slow, ongoing particle acceleration process occurring at the flank of the expanding shock wave intercepted by PSP. This has significant implications for the role of shocks in the release of SEPs at widespread events and for methods used to infer the SEP release times. Furthermore, the match between the simulation and observations worsens when cross-field diffusion is considered, indicating that SEP diffusion had a minor effect on this event. These findings underscore the complexity of SEP events and emphasize the need for advanced modeling approaches to better understand the role of shock waves and other physical processes in SEP acceleration and release.

<title>The Fate of Oceans on First-generation Planets Orbiting White Dwarfs</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada149</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada149</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Several groups have recently suggested that small planets orbiting very closely around white dwarf stars could be promising locations for life to arise, even after stellar death. There are still many uncertainties, however, regarding the existence and habitability of these worlds. Here we consider the retention of water during post-main-sequence evolution of a Sun-like star and during the subsequent migration of planets to the white dwarf's habitable zone. This inward migration is driven by dynamical mechanisms such as planet–planet interactions in packed systems, which can excite planets to high eccentricities, setting the initial conditions for tidal migration into short-period orbits. In order for water to persist on the surfaces of planets orbiting white dwarfs, the water must first survive the asymptotic giant branch phase of stellar evolution, then avoid being lost as a result of photoevaporation due to X-ray and extreme-ultraviolet radiation from the newly formed white dwarf, and finally survive the tidal migration of the planet inward to the habitable zone. We find that while this journey will likely desiccate large swaths of post-main-sequence planetary systems, planets with substantial reservoirs of water may retain some surface water, especially if their migration occurs at later white dwarf cooling ages. Therefore, although stellar evolution may pose a challenge for the retention of water on exoplanet surfaces, it is possible for planets to retain surface oceans even as their host stars die and their orbits evolve.

<title>Are Stars Really Ingesting Their Planets? Examining an Alternative Explanation</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada1d5</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada1d5</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Numerous stars exhibit surprisingly large variations in their refractory element abundances, often interpreted as signatures of planetary ingestion events. In this study, we propose that differences in the dust-to-gas ratio near stars during their formation can produce similar observational signals. We investigate this hypothesis using a suite of radiation-dust-magnetohydrodynamic STAR FORmation in Gaseous Environments (or STARFORGE) simulations of star formation. Our results show that the distribution of refractory abundance variations (Δ[X/H]) has extended tails, with about 10%–30% of all stars displaying variations around ∼0.1 dex. These variations are comparable to the accretion of 2–5 M⊕ of planetary material into the convective zones of Sun-like stars. The width of the distributions increases with the incorporation of more detailed dust physics, such as radiation pressure and back-reaction forces, as well as with larger dust grain sizes and finer resolutions. Furthermore, our simulations reveal no correlation between Δ[X/H] and stellar separations, suggesting that dust-to-gas fluctuations likely occur on scales smaller than those of wide binaries. These findings highlight the importance of considering dust dynamics as a potential source of the observed chemical enrichment in stars.

<title>DA 362: A Gamma-Ray-emitting Compact Symmetric Object</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada1d7</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The γ-ray detection from an astrophysical object indicates the presence of an extreme environment where high-energy radiation is produced. With the continuous monitoring of the γ-ray sky by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) leading to deeper sensitivity, high-energy γ-ray emission has now been detected from a diverse class of jetted active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Here, we present the results of a multiwavelength study of the radio source DA 362, which was reported to be a blazar candidate of uncertain type. However, it was recently identified as a bona fide compact symmetric object (CSO) based on its subkiloparsec, bipolar radio morphology, and lack of radio variability. This makes DA 362 only the fourth γ-ray-emitting object of this enigmatic class of radio-loud AGNs. Using five very-long-baseline interferometry observations covering 1996–2018, we found the jet separation velocity to be subluminal (vapp ~ 0.2c), thus supporting its CSO nature. Its Fermi-LAT observations revealed a γ-ray flaring activity, a phenomenon never detected from the other three γ-ray-detected CSOs. This object is bright in the near-infrared band but extremely faint in the optical-UV filters, hinting at possible obscuration. Swift X-Ray Telescope observation of DA 362 reveals an extremely hard X-ray spectrum, though a strong claim cannot be made due to large uncertainties. We conclude that deeper observations are needed to probe the broadband properties of this enigmatic object and to understand the origin of high-energy γ-ray emission.

<title>Autogenous Electron Acceleration by Ion Flow Vortex in Space Plasmas</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Plasma flow vortexes are ubiquitous in space and astrophysical settings and play a vital role in energy and mass transport, contributing to formation of stars and planets, launching and dissipation of astrophysical jets, and coupling between planetary magnetospheres and ionospheres. Here we present in situ observations showing that energetic electrons with energies up to 250 keV can be directly generated inside an ion flow vortex with finite spatial scale. The electron acceleration is achieved by establishment of Fermi acceleration trap and parallel electrostatic potential within the flow vortex, leading to dramatic enhancement of energetic electron flux by at least 1 order of magnitude. The accelerated electrons can drive mass and energy transport along local magnetic field lines and serve as a free energy source for broadband electrostatic emissions. Our observations, suggesting that the ion flow vortex can serve as novel electron accelerators, can be fundamentally important for understanding energetic phenomena in the cosmos, such as nonthermal emissions near astrophysical jets and killer electrons in geospace.

<title>Photometric Selection of Type 1 Quasars in the XMM-LSS Field with Machine Learning and the Disk–Corona Connection</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present photometric selection of type 1 quasars in the ≈5.3 deg2 XMM-Large Scale Structure survey field with machine learning. We constructed our training and blind-test samples using spectroscopically identified Sloan Digital Sky Survey quasars, galaxies, and stars. We utilized the XGBoost machine learning method to select a total of 1591 quasars. We assessed the classification performance based on the blind-test sample, and the outcome was favorable, demonstrating high reliability (≈99.9%) and good completeness (≈87.5%). We used XGBoost to estimate photometric redshifts of our selected quasars. The estimated photometric redshifts span a range from 0.41 to 3.75. The outlier fraction of these photometric redshift estimates is ≈17%, and the normalized median absolute deviation (σNMAD) is ≈0.07. To study the quasar disk–corona connection, we constructed a subsample of 1016 quasars with Hyper Suprime-Cam i < 22.5 after excluding radio-loud and potentially X-ray-absorbed quasars. The relation between the optical-to-X-ray power-law slope parameter (αOX) and the 2500 Å monochromatic luminosity (L2500Å) for this subsample is with a dispersion of 0.159. We found this correlation in good agreement with the correlations in previous studies. We explored several factors, which may bias the αOX–L2500Å relation, and found that their effects are not significant. We discussed possible evolution of the αOX–L2500Å relation with respect to L2500Å or redshift.

<title>Interplay of Large-scale Drift and Turbulence in the Heliospheric Propagation of Solar Energetic Particles</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The gradient and curvature of the Parker spiral interplanetary magnetic field give rise to curvature and gradient guiding-center drifts on cosmic rays (CRs). The plasma turbulence present in interplanetary space is thought to suppress the drifts; however, the extent to which they are reduced is not clear. We investigate the reduction of the drifts using a new analytic model of heliospheric turbulence where the dominant 2D component has both a wavevector and magnetic field vector normal to the Parker spiral, thus fulfilling the main criterion of 2D turbulence. We use full-orbit test-particle simulations of energetic protons in the modeled interplanetary turbulence, and analyze the mean drift velocity of the particles in heliolatitude. We release energetic proton populations of 10, 100, and 1000 MeV close to the Sun and introduce a new method to assess their drift. We compare the drift in the turbulent heliosphere to drift in a configuration without turbulence, and to theoretical estimates of drift reduction. We find that drifts are reduced by a factor 0.2–0.9 of that expected for the heliospheric configuration without turbulence. This corresponds to a much less efficient suppression than what is predicted by theoretical estimates, particularly at low proton energies. We conclude that guiding-center drifts are a significant factor for the evolution of CR intensities in the heliosphere, including the propagation of solar energetic particles in the inner heliosphere.

<title>Collisionless Tearing Instability in Relativistic Nonthermal Pair Plasma and Its Application to MHD Turbulence</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Collisionless tearing instability with a power-law distribution function in a relativistic pair plasma with a guide field is studied. When the current sheet is supported by plasma pressure, the tearing mode is suppressed as the particle spectrum hardens. In the force-free limit, the instability growth rate becomes independent of the particle spectrum. We apply these results to relativistic MHD turbulence, where magnetic energy greatly exceeds plasma rest energy, and derive an expression for the transverse size of turbulent eddies unstable to tearing mode. We also establish the critical plasma magnetization parameter above which charge starvation prevents the tearing instability. These results might be useful for developing more accurate models of particle acceleration in relativistic astrophysical sources.

<title>The Age–Velocity Dispersion Relations of the Galactic Disk as Revealed by the LAMOST-Gaia Red Clump Stars</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9d41</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9d41</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Using nearly 230,000 red clump stars selected from LAMOST and Gaia, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the stellar age–velocity dispersion relations (AVRs) for various disk populations, within 5.0 ≤ R ≤ 15.0 kpc and ∣Z∣ ≤ 3.0 kpc. The AVRs of the whole red clump sample stars are accurately described as σv = σv,0 (τ + 0.1) , with βR, βϕ, and βZ displaying a global exponential decreasing trend with R, which may point to the difference in spatial distributions of various disk heating mechanisms. The measurements of β–R for various disks suggest that the thin disk exhibits a radial dependence, with a global exponential decreasing trend in βR–R and βZ–R, while βϕ remains a nearly constant value (around 0.20 ∼ 0.25) within 8.5 ≤ R ≤ 11.5 kpc. The thick disk displays a global increasing trend in βR–R, βϕ–R, and βZ–R. These results indicate that the thin disk stars are likely heated by long-term heating from giant molecular clouds and spiral arms, while thick disk stars are likely heated by some violent heating process from merger and accretion, and/or formed by the inside-out and upside-down star formation scenarios, and/or born in the chaotic mergers of gas-rich systems and/or turbulent interstellar medium. Our results also suggest that the disk perturbation by a recent minor merger from Sagittarius may have occurred within 3.0 Gyr.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A major challenge in gravitational-wave (GW) multimessenger astrophysics is the imprecise localization of GW compact binary mergers. We investigate the use of a method to include galaxy catalog information in performing parameter estimation of these events. We test its effectiveness with the GW events GW170817, GW190425, and GW190814, as well as with simulated binary neutron star mergers. For GW170817, we recover the true host galaxy as the most probable galaxy after a straightforward mass reweighting, with significantly decreased localization area and volume. On the simulated sample, however, we do not find improvement compared to performing a simple galaxy catalog crossmatch with a regular GW localization. Future investigations into sampling methods may yield improvements that increase the viability of this method.

<title>An Exceptionally Powerful, Radiatively Driven Ultrafast Outflow in the Rapidly Accreting AGN RE J1034+396</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report the analysis of ∼1 Ms of XMM-Newton observations of the rapidly accreting active galactic nucleus RE J1034+396. The 0.3–9 keV EPIC-pn spectra are well described by a model consisting of steep continuum emission from the corona accompanied by relativistically blurred reflection from a highly ionized accretion disk. The source is known to exhibit strong excess soft X-ray emission, which we show is well represented by thermal disk photons Comptonized by a warm plasma spanning the inner accretion flow. Additionally, the EPIC-pn data provide compelling evidence (ΔC ∼ 60 for four additional parameters) for the presence of an ultrafast outflow (UFO) with a line-of-sight velocity , and an emission signature consistent with reflection of the corona from modestly ionized, outflowing gas. The simultaneous 0.5–2.5 keV RGS spectra show clear absorption lines. Modelling of these data confirms the presence of the UFO and constrains its equivalent hydrogen column density, log NH/(atom cm−2) = . The RGS data also reveal at least two warm absorber components with a modest outflow velocity ( km s−1). The measured properties and time evolution of the UFO in RE J1034+396 suggest that it is formed from collisionally ionized plasma, launched from the disk surface and accelerated by radiation pressure. The high terminal velocity and substantial absorbing column density imply that the outflow carries sufficient momentum and energy to transform its environment, being capable of driving out essentially all dust and gas it interacts with along the line of sight, even if the AGN were initially surrounded by a Compton-thick absorber.

<title>Empirical Color Correction to MIST and PARSEC Isochrones on Gaia BR − RP and G − RP with Benchmark Open Clusters</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Recent literature reports a color deviation between observed Gaia color–magnitude diagrams (CMDs) and theoretical model isochrone predictions, particularly in the very low-mass regime. To assess its impact on cluster age determination via isochrone fitting, we quantified the color deviations for three benchmark clusters, Hyades, Pleiades, and Praesepe, both for the Gaia color (BP − RP) and (G − RP). In general, the (G − RP) color deviations are smaller than the (BP − RP) ones. Empirical color-correction functions based on these benchmarks are derived for the currently available MESA Isochrones and Stellar Tracks and PAdova and TRieste Stellar Evolution Code (PARSEC) 1.2S isochrone models. Applying the correction functions to 31 additional open clusters and 3 moving groups results in a significantly improved alignment between the isochrones and observed CMDs. With our empirical corrections, isochrones provide age estimates consistent with literature values obtained through the spectral lithium depletion boundary method, validating the effectiveness of our approach. The corresponding metallicities with PARSEC 1.2S also show a good agreement with the spectroscopic results. The empirical color-correction function we present in this work offers a tool for a consistent age determination within the full mass range of stellar clusters using the isochrone fitting method.

<title>Persistence and Burn-in in Solar Coronal Magnetic Field Simulations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Simulations of solar phenomena play a vital role in space-weather prediction. A critical computational question for automating research workflows in the context of data-driven solar coronal magnetic field simulations is quantifying a simulation's burn-in time, after which a solar quantity has evolved away from an arbitrary initial condition to a physically more realistic state. A challenge to quantifying simulation burn-in is that the underlying solar processes and data, like many physical phenomena, are non-Markovian and exhibit long memory or persistence and, therefore, their analysis evades standard statistical approaches. In this work, we provide evidence of long memory in the nonperiodic variations of solar quantities (including over timescales significantly shorter than previously identified) and demonstrate that magnetofrictional simulations capture the memory structure present in magnetogram data. We also provide an algorithm for the quantitative assessment of simulation burn-in time that can be applied to nonstationary time series with long memory. Our approach is based on time-delayed mutual information, an information-theoretic quantity, and includes a small-sample bias correction.

<title>An Enigmatic PeVatron in an Area around H ii Region G35.6−0.5</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Identifying Galactic PeVatrons (PeV particle accelerators) from ultrahigh-energy (UHE, >100 TeV) γ-ray sources plays a crucial role in revealing the origin of Galactic cosmic rays. The UHE source 1LHAASO J1857+0203u is suggested to be associated with HESS J1858+020, which may be attributed to the possible PeVatron candidate supernova remnant (SNR) G35.6−0.4 or H ii region G35.6−0.5. We perform detailed analysis on the very-high-energy and UHE γ-ray emissions toward this region with data from the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). 1LHAASO J1857+0203u is detected with a significance of 11.6σ above 100 TeV, indicating the presence of a PeVatron. It has an extent of ∼0 18 with a power-law (PL) spectral index of ∼2.5 at 1–25 TeV and pointlike emission with a PL spectral index of ∼3.2 above 25 TeV. Using archival CO and H i data, we identify some molecular and atomic clouds that may be associated with the TeV γ-ray emissions. Our modeling indicates that the TeV γ-ray emissions are unlikely to arise from clouds illuminated by the protons that escaped from SNR G35.6−0.4. In the scenario in which H ii region G35.6−0.5 could accelerate particles to the UHE band, the observed GeV–TeV γ-ray emission could be well explained by a hadronic model with a PL spectral index of ∼2.0 and cutoff energy of ∼450 TeV. However, an origin in an evolved pulsar wind nebula cannot be ruled out.

We securely detect two temperature-sensitive auroral lines, [S iii] 6312 (7.4σ) and [O ii] 7320+7331 doublets (10σ), and tentatively [n ii] 5755 (2.3σ) for the first time in an individual galaxy at z > 1. We perform a detailed analysis of its interstellar media (ISM), and derive electron temperatures, various heavy element abundances (O/H, N/O, S/O, and Ar/O) in the hot ionized region, and the neutral fraction in the warm ionized region. MACS J1149-WR1 shows a broad feature at the wavelength of He ii 4686, which consists of a broad (∼1000 km s−1), blueshifted (∼−110 km s−1) line component. Taken together with its mildly elevated N/O abundance, we conclude that MACS J1149-WR1 is experiencing a young starburst (≲10 Myr), likely hosting a large number of Wolf–Rayet (W-R) stars. None of its spectral features support the presence of active galactic nuclei, including (i) the absence of broad components and velocity shifts in hydrogen recombination lines, (ii) low [Fe ii]1.257 μm/Paβ ratio, and (iii) the absence of high-ionization lines. Our analysis using He i lines reveals a higher electron temperature and a higher attenuation value, indicating that He i may probe a smaller spatial scale than H i, presumably the region dominated by the aforementioned W-R stars. The star formation rates derived from various He i lines broadly agree with those from hydrogen recombination lines. We thus advocate that He i can be an excellent, independent probe of multiphase ISM in the era of JWST.

<title>On Disk Formation around Isolated Black Holes via Stream Accretion</title>

We investigate accretion onto an isolated black hole from uniform winds. If the winds are directed toward the black hole, then the accretion process can be well described by the classical Bondi–Hoyle–Lyttleton or BHL accretion. If the wind is not directed toward the black hole and flows past it, then a smaller fraction of the flow can be attracted by the black hole, and this type of accretion cannot be described by the classical BHL, and we coin the second kind as the lateral BHL. We show that the classical BHL cannot form an accretion disk, while lateral BHL can form transient accretion disks. To describe the thermodynamics of the flow, we have used a variable adiabatic index equation of state which depends on the temperature of the flow as well as the composition of the gas. We show that the electron-proton gas forms an accretion disk, which disappears and forms a shock cone, only to form the disk again at a later time, while for flows with fewer protons, the accretion disk, once lost, does not reappear again. Only when the flow is pair-dominated does it form a persistent accretion disk. We also show that a shock cone is less luminous than the accretion disk.

<title>A Subclass of Gamma-Ray Burst Originating from Compact Binary Merger</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad98ec</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad98ec</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Type I gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are believed to originate from compact binary mergers usually with a duration of main emission less than 2 s. However, recent observations of GRB 211211A and GRB 230307A indicate that some merger-origin GRBs could last much longer. Since they show strikingly similar properties (indicating a common mechanism), which are different from the classic “long”-short burst (e.g., GRB 060614), we find they form an interesting subclass of type I GRBs, and we suggest to name them as type IL GRB. We find that the prompt emission of type IL GRB is composed of three episodes: (1) a precursor followed by a short quiescent (or weak emission) period, (2) a long-duration main emission, and (3) an extended emission. With this burst pattern, a good candidate, GRB 170228A, was found in the Fermi/Gamma-ray Burst Monitor archive data. Temporal and spectral analyses indeed show that GRB 170228A falls in the same group with GRB 211211A and GRB 230307A in many diagnostic figures. Thus, this burst pattern could be a good reference for rapidly identifying type IL GRBs and very helpful for conducting low-latency follow-up observation. We estimated the occurrence rate and discussed the physical origins and implications for the three emission episodes of type IL GRBs. Our analysis suggests the premerger precursor model, especially the magnetar super flare model, is more favored for type IL GRBs. More observations in multiwavelength and multimessenger are required to deepen our understanding of this subclass of GRB.

<title>High-time-cadence Spectroscopy and Photometry of Stellar Flares on M dwarf YZ Canis Minoris with the Seimei Telescope and TESS. I. Discovery of Rapid and Short-duration Prominence Eruptions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
M dwarfs show frequent flares and associated coronal mass ejections (CMEs) may significantly impact close-in habitable planets. M dwarf flares sometimes show blue/red asymmetries in the Hα line profile, suggesting prominence eruptions as an early stage of CMEs. However, their high-time-cadence observations are limited. We conducted spectroscopic monitoring observations of the active M dwarf YZ Canis Minoris with an ∼1 minute time cadence using the Seimei telescope, simultaneously with the optical photometric observations by Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. We detected 27 Hα flares with Hα energies ranging from 1.7 × 1029 to 3.8 × 1032 erg and durations from 8 to 319 minutes. Among them, we identified three blue asymmetry and five red asymmetry events based on criteria using the Bayesian information criterion. The maximum velocity of the blueshifted and redshifted components ranges from 200 to 450 km s−1 and 190 to 400 km s−1, respectively. The duration and time evolution show variety, and in particular, we discovered rapid, short-duration blue/red asymmetry events with the duration of 6–8 minutes. Among the eight blue/red asymmetry events, two blue and one red asymmetry events are interpreted as prominence eruptions because of their fast velocity and time evolution. Based on this interpretation, the lower limit of occurrence frequency of prominence eruptions can be estimated to be ∼1.1 events per day. Our discovery of short-duration events suggests that previous studies with low time cadence may have missed these events, potentially leading to an underestimation of the occurrence frequency of prominence eruptions/CMEs.

<title>A Peculiar Feature of the First Ionization Potential Effect Before a Solar Flare Impulsive Phase Observed by MSS-1B, CHASE, and SDO</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The impulsive phase of solar flares is often accompanied by the depletion of the elements with low first ionization potential (FIP), whose abundance decreases from the coronal level to the photospheric level, and then recovers back to the coronal level during the decay phase. Recently, we analyzed the soft X-ray spectroscopic data of the 2024 February 16 flare event observed by the Macao Science Satellite-1B/Soft X-ray Detection Units. Surprisingly, however, it is revealed that the depletion of the low-FIP elements occurred well before the flare impulsive phase. The timing of this change provides important clues about the location of magnetic reconnection, shedding light on the mass and energy transfer between different layers of the solar atmosphere. By examining the multiwavelength data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory and CHASE missions, we found that there was no filament 0.4 hr before the flare eruption. However, an erupting filament was detected in association with the flare event. Based on these features, we propose for the first time that the flare/filament eruption for this event was initiated by magnetic reconnection in the solar chromosphere, rather than in the corona as stated in the standard flare model.

<title>Shocked POststarburst Galaxy Survey. IV. Outflows in Shocked Poststarburst Galaxies Are Not Responsible for Quenching</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Shocked POstarburst Galaxies (SPOGs) exhibit both emission lines suggestive of shock-heated gas and poststarburst-like stellar absorption, resulting in a unique subset for galaxy evolution studies. We have observed 77 galaxies that fulfilled the SPOG criteria selection using the DeVeny Spectrograph on the Lowell Discovery Telescope. Our long-slit minor axis spectra detect Hα and [O III] in some SPOGs out to 6 kpc above the galactic plane. We find extraplanar ionized gas in 31 targets of our sample overall. Using their internal and external kinematics, we argue that 22 galaxies host outflows with ionized gas masses ranging from 102M⊙ to 105M⊙. The rest are likely extended diffuse ionized gas. A positive correlation exists between active galactic nuclei (AGN) luminosity and the extraplanar gas extent, velocity dispersion, and mass—suggesting that the AGN may indeed drive the outflows detected in AGN hosts. The low masses of the extraplanar gas suggest that these outflows are not depleting each galaxy’s gas reserves. The outflows, therefore, are not likely a significant quenching mechanism in these SPOGs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The growing “Hubble tension” has prompted the need for precise measurements of cosmological distances. This paper demonstrates a purely geometric approach for determining the distances to extragalactic binaries through a joint analysis of spectroastrometry (SA), radial velocity (RV), and light-curve (LC) observations. A parameterized model for the binary system is outlined, and simulated SA, RV, and LC data are computed to infer the probability distribution of model parameters based on the mock data. The impacts of data quality and binary parameters on the distance uncertainties are comprehensively analyzed, showcasing the method’s potential for high-precision distance measurements. For a typical eclipsing binary in the Large Magellanic Cloud, the distance uncertainty is approximately 6% under reasonable observational conditions. Within a specific range of data quality and input parameters, the distance measurement precision of individual binary star systems is generally better than 10%. As a geometric method based on the simplest dynamics, it is independent of empirical calibration, and the systematics caused by model selections can be tested using nearby binaries with known distances. By measuring multiple binary star systems or monitoring one binary system repeatedly, geometric distance measurements of nearby galaxies can be achieved, providing valuable insights into the Hubble tension and advancing our understanding of the Universe’s structure and evolution.

<title>An Effect Study of Structural Jets on the Long Gamma-Ray Burst Formation Rate at Low Redshift</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are considered the most violent explosions in the Universe. Numerous studies have analyzed the formation rate of long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs), which originate from the core collapse of massive stars, in comparison with the star formation rate (SFR). It is found that the LGRB formation rate at redshift z < 1 is significantly distinct from the SFR and is higher. Moreover, due to the threshold of detectors, the structured jets of GRBs also affect detection numbers at different redshifts, which all influence the calculation of the formation rate. Thus we investigate the LGRB formation rate at low redshift and further explore the possible correlation between the LGRB formation rate under the influence of structural jets and the SFR. We use Lynden-Bell's c− method to study the luminosity function and rate of Swift LGRBs without any assumptions. After correcting for the redshift evolution, the luminosity function can be expressed as for dim LGRBs and for bright LGRBs, and the formation rate at z < 1 shows an increase. Then we use Monte Carlo simulations to create pseudo-GRBs with structured jets and calculate the formation rates assuming that the actual LGRB formation rate at low redshift is proportional to the SRF. The results demonstrate that structural jets increase the number of detections at low redshift in response to observational effects. Compared with the observed formation rate, the structured jet model with Gauss-cocoon is found to be relatively more efficient, and the parameters η of this model are limited and analyzed to [0.5, 5].

<title>Foreshock Ultralow Frequency Waves at Mars: Consequence on the Particle Acceleration Mechanisms at the Martian Bow Shock</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Using Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN Magnetometer observations, we report the first statistical study of ultralow frequency (ULF) waves at the Martian foreshock. The analyzed foreshock ULF wave events are observed in the 0.008–0.086 Hz frequency range, with nearly circular and elliptical left-handed polarization in the spacecraft reference frame. These waves are propagated quasi-parallel to the ambient magnetic field, with a moderate wave amplitude. All these properties are consistent with fast magnetosonic waves, most likely generated through the ion–ion right-hand resonant instability. In addition, our results suggest that the associated resonant backstreaming protons’ velocities parallel to the mean magnetic field in the solar wind reference frame are 1.33 ± 0.40 times the solar wind velocity. The similarity between our results and previous reports at other foreshocks may indicate the presence of a common acceleration process acting in planetary bow shocks and that is responsible for this particular backstreaming population.

<title>A Magnetohydrodynamics Simulation of Coronal Mass Ejections in the Upper Corona at 2.5R ⊙ ≤ r ≤ 19R ⊙</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The methodology of a new magnetohydrodynamics simulation model of the propagation of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in the near-Sun solar wind region at 2.5R⊙ ≥ r ≥ 19R⊙ is presented. The simulation model first determines the steady state of the transonic/Alfvénic solar wind with the characteristic-based inner boundary treatment for the middle of the corona at r = 2.5R⊙ (K. Hayashi et al. 2023). To determine the numerical perturbation on the 2.5 R⊙inner boundary surface, a kinetic self-similar model with a torus-shaped magnetic-field rope and a spherically symmetric plasma structure translating and expanding at the constant speed (named TICK model) is developed. A solar-wind MHD model (C.-C. Wu et al. 2020b) traces the temporal evolution of the injected CME through the inner boundary surface. We conducted test simulations with various choices of plasma density and temperature. The test simulation results show that the injected CME, particularly its internal magnetic structure, can be substantially altered through the interactions with the preexisting slow and dense ambient solar wind at the early phase of the propagation in the near-Sun region. The propagation speed of the discontinuity front is found to be dependent on the plasma parameters of the CME perturbation. Therefore, for better simulating the propagation of the CME, it is important for the CME models to include the nonlinear MHD interactions in the subsonic/Alfvénic regions.

<title>The Multiple Extended Tidal Tails of NGC 288</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada2ea</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Using photometry and proper motions from Pan-STARRS, DECaLS, and Gaia Data Release 3, we detect a ∼35°–70° long trailing stellar debris stream associated with the globular cluster NGC 288. The trajectory of the trailing tail is not well matched by a model stream evolved in a static Galactic potential, but is reasonably well matched by a stream modeled in a potential that incorporates a massive, infalling Large Magellanic Cloud. We also detect a broad, at least ∼40° long leading tail that appears to be composed of at least two narrower, spatially offset, and kinematically distinct streams. Stream modeling predicts a similar broad composite of streams and suggests that these narrower components could each be made up of one or more generations of tidal tails, each formed during different orbits over the past few gigayears. On the other hand, NGC 288 is believed to have been brought into the Galactic halo during the Gaia–Enceladus–Sausage accretion event, and the tangential velocity dispersions of our stream candidates are indeed mostly consistent with having been stripped in a parent galaxy that had a large, cored dark matter halo. Tables of the most highly ranked stream star candidates are provided for ongoing and future spectroscopic surveys.

<title>Fitting Methods for Probability Distribution Functions in Turbulent Star-forming Clouds</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad99d5</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We use a suite of 3D simulations of star-forming molecular clouds, with and without stellar feedback and magnetic fields, to investigate the effectiveness of different fitting methods for volume and column density probability distribution functions (PDFs). The first method fits a piecewise lognormal and power-law (PL) function to recover PDF parameters such as the PL slope and transition density. The second method fits a polynomial spline function and examines the first and second derivatives of the spline to determine the PL slope and the functional transition density. The first PL (set by the transition between lognormal and PL function) can also be visualized in the derivatives directly. In general, the two methods produce fits that agree reasonably well for volume density but vary for column density, likely due to the increased statistical noise in the column density PDFs as compared to the volume density PDFs. We test a well-known conversion for estimating volume density PL slopes from column density slopes and find that the spline method produces a better match (χ2 of 3.34 versus χ2 of 5.92), albeit with a significant scatter. Ultimately, we recommend the use of both fitting methods on column density data to mitigate the effects of noise.

<title>Detecting the Black Hole Candidate Population in M51’s Young Massive Star Clusters: Constraints on Accreting Intermediate-mass Black Holes</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Intermediate-mass black holes (102 < MBH < 105M⊙) are an open question in our understanding of black hole evolution and growth. They have long been linked to dense star cluster environments, thanks to cluster dynamics, but there are a limited number of secure detections. We leverage existing X-ray observations from the Chandra X-ray Observatory and optical catalogs from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) as well as new radio observations from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array to search for any evidence of accreting black holes in young massive star clusters in the nearby galaxy M51. We find that of 44 bright (LX > 1038 erg s−1) X-ray point sources in M51, 24 had probable matches to objects including possible associated star clusters in the HST Legacy Extragalactic UV Survey catalog, seven of which were classified as contaminants (background galaxies or foreground stars). We explore the optical properties of the remaining 17 sources, including cluster age and mass estimates, and search for radio counterparts in the 8–12 GHz band. The lack of radio counterparts to X-ray sources we know to be associated with young massive star clusters in M51 suggests that we do not significantly detect hard-state intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) ~104 M⊙ or above. However, more sensitive radio facilities, like the Square Kilometre Array and next-generation Very Large Array, may be able to provide evidence for IMBHs with masses down to ~103 M⊙.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Super-Earths are highly irradiated, small planets with bulk densities approximately consistent with Earth. We construct combined interior atmosphere models of super-Earths that trace the partitioning of water throughout a planet, including an iron-rich core, silicate-rich mantle, and steam atmosphere. We compare these models with exoplanet observations to infer a 1σ upper limit on the total water mass fraction of ≲3% at the population level. We consider end-member scenarios that may change this value, including the efficiency of mantle outgassing, escape of high mean molecular weight atmospheres, and increased iron core mass fractions. Although our constraints are agnostic as to the origin of water, we show that our upper limits are consistent with its production via chemical reactions of primordial hydrogen-dominated atmospheres with magma oceans. This mechanism has also been hypothesised to explain Earth's water content, possibly pointing to a unified channel for the origins of water on small terrestrial planets.

<title>A Sensitivity Analysis of the Modeling of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Emission in Galaxies</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9918</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We have conducted a sensitivity analysis on the mid-infrared spectral decomposition of galaxies and the modeling of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission spectrum with the NASA Ames PAH Infrared Spectroscopic Database (PAHdb) to assess the variance on the average galaxy PAH population properties under a grid of different modeling parameters. We find that the short-low and short-low+long-low Spitzer-IRS decomposition with PAHFIT provides consistent modeling and recovery of the 5–15 μm PAH emission spectrum. For PAHdb modeling, application of a redshift to the calculated spectra to account for anharmonic effects introduces a 15%–20% variance on the derived parameters, while its absence improves the fits by ∼13%. The 4.00-α release of PAHdb achieves the complete modeling of the 6–15 μm PAH spectrum, including the full 6.2 μm band, improving the average fitting uncertainty by a factor of 2. The optimal PAHdb modeling configuration requires selection of pure PAHs without applying a redshift to the bands. Although quantitatively the PAHdb-derived parameters change under different modeling configurations or database versions, their variation follows a linear scaling, with previously reported trends remaining qualitatively valid. PAHdb modeling of JWST observations, and JWST observations smoothed and resampled to the Spitzer-IRS resolution and dispersion have consistent PAHdb derived parameters. Decomposition with different codes, such as PAHFIT and CAFE, produce PAH emission spectra with noticeable variation in the 11–15 μm region, driving a ∼7% difference in the neutral PAH fraction under PAHdb modeling. A new library of galaxy PAH emission templates is delivered to be utilized in galaxy spectral energy distribution modeling.

<title>Dependence of Metal Enrichment of Nuclear Star Clusters on Galaxy Stellar Mass</title>

Nuclear star clusters (NSCs) are commonly found in the centers of galaxies, but their dominant formation mechanisms remain elusive. We perform a consistent analysis of stellar populations of 97 nearby NSCs, based on spectroscopic data from the Very Large Telescope. The sample covers a galaxy stellar mass range of 107–1011 M⊙ and is more than 3 times larger than any previous study. We identify three galaxy stellar mass regimes with distinct NSC properties. In the low-mass regime of ≲ 8.5 (Mhost is in units of M⊙), nearly all NSCs have metallicities lower than their circum-NSC host but similar to those of typical red globular clusters (GCs), supporting the GC inspiral–merger scenario of NSC formation. In the high-mass regime of ≳ 9.5, nearly all NSCs have higher metallicities than their circum-NSC host and red GCs, suggesting significant contributions from in situ star formation. In the intermediate-mass regime, a comparable fraction of NSCs have higher or lower metallicities than their circum-NSC host and red GCs, with no clear dependence on NSC mass, suggesting intermittent in situ star formation. The majority of NSCs with higher metallicities than their host exhibit a negative age–metallicity correlation, providing clear evidence of long-term chemical enrichment. The average metallicity difference between NSC and host peaks broadly around and declines toward both higher and lower galaxy masses. We find that the efficiency of dynamical-friction-driven inspiral of GCs observed in present-day galaxies can explain the NSC mass at but falls short of observed ones at higher galaxy mass, reinforcing our conclusions based on stellar population analysis.

<title>Evolution of Magnetic Reconnection in an Electron-scale Current Sheet</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Recently, a new type of magnetic reconnection, electron-only reconnection—where there is no obvious ion flow and heating—has been observed in various plasma environments. Previous kinetic simulations have shown that electron-only reconnection is a precursor of standard reconnection. In this paper, by performing a 2.5-dimensional particle-in-cell simulation, we investigate the evolution of electron-only magnetic reconnection to standard magnetic reconnection in a current sheet, whose initial width is of the electron inertial length. In the electron-only reconnection stage, electron outflow produces the electron-scale pileup, and ions are slightly accelerated in the outflow direction by the Hall electric field force. As the reconnection electric field expands and is piled up to the ion scale, ions start to be further accelerated inside the ion diffusion region and reflected by the to the outflow direction. With pileup as the bond, ions gradually transit from being accelerated by the Hall electric field to being coupled in reconnection by the Lorentz force.

Kobashi et al. showed that the existence of dense molecular cloud (MC) surrounding a rarefied wind-like circumstellar matter (CSM) can explain this observational finding in terms of the shock-expansion dynamics, supporting the so-called single-degenerate scenario for the progenitor system. We here extend this work to study the nonthermal emission processes and investigate whether such an environment is consistent with the observed multiwavelength spectrum. While the simulated broadband spectrum based on the wind–MC environment is largely consistent with observations, we find that such an environment predicts a harder gamma-ray spectrum than observed due to the relatively low CSM density in the cavity interior of the MC. This difference can be at least partially attributed to the present 1D setup of the model, which does not account for the clumpy and multidimensional structure of the CSM. Our model provides predictions for the long-term evolution of the broadband spectrum, which can be used to further probe Tycho's surrounding environment in the future, a key to resolving the long-standing issue of Type Ia supernova progenitor channels.

<title>Einasto Profile as the Halo Model Solution Coupled to the Depletion Radius</title>

We constrain the halo profiles outside the halo boundaries by solving for the matching profiles required by the halo model. In the halo model framework, the matter distribution in the Universe can be decomposed into the spatial distribution of halos convolved with their internal structures. This leads to a set of linear equations in Fourier space that uniquely determines the matching halo profiles for any given halo catalog. In this work, we construct three halo catalogs with different boundary definitions and solve for the matching profiles in each case using measurements of halo–matter and halo–halo power spectra. Our results show that for a given halo field, there is always a set of matching profiles to accurately reconstruct the input statistics of the matter field, even though it might be complex to model the profiles analytically. Comparing the solutions from different halo catalogs, we find that their mass distributions inside the inner depletion radii are nearly identical, while they deviate from each other on larger scales, with a larger boundary resulting in a more extended profile. For the depletion-radius-based catalog, the numerical solution agrees well with the Einasto profile. Coupling the Einasto profile with the depletion catalog, the resulting halo model can simultaneously predict the halo–matter power spectra to 10% and the matter–matter power spectrum to 5%, improving over conventional models in both interpretability and versatility. The conditions and limitations of using the Navarro–Frenk–White profile in the halo model are also discussed.

<title>The Solar and Geomagnetic Storms in 2024 May: A Flash Data Report</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In 2024 May, the scientific community observed intense solar eruptions that resulted in a great geomagnetic storm and auroral extensions, highlighting the need to document and quantify these events. This study mainly focuses on their quantification. The source active region (AR; NOAA Active Region 13664) evolved from 113 to 2761 millionths of the solar hemisphere between May 4 and 14. NOAA AR 13664’s magnetic free energy surpassed 1033 erg on May 7, triggering 12 X-class flares on May 8–15. Multiple interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) were produced from this AR, accelerating solar energetic particles toward Earth. According to satellite and interplanetary scintillation data, at least four ICMEs erupted from AR 13664, eventually overcoming and combining each other. The shock arrival at 17:05 UT on May 10 significantly compressed the magnetosphere down to ≈5.04 RE and triggered a deep Forbush Decrease. GOES satellite data and ground-based neutron monitors confirmed a ground-level enhancement from 2 UT to 10 UT on 2024 May 11. The ICMEs induced exceptional geomagnetic storms, peaking at a provisional Dst index of −412 nT at 2 UT on May 11, marking the sixth-largest storm since 1957. The AE and AL indices showed great auroral extensions that located the AE/AL stations into the polar cap. We gathered auroral records at that time and reconstructed the equatorward boundary of the visual auroral oval to 29.°8 invariant latitude. We compared naked-eye and camera auroral visibility, providing critical caveats on their difference. We also confirmed global disturbances of the storm-enhanced density of the ionosphere.

<title>Early Enrichment Population Theory at High Redshift</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9826</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9826</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An early enrichment population (EEP) has been theorized to produce the observed intracluster medium (ICM) metallicity of galaxy clusters. This population likely existed at high redshifts (z ∼ 10), relics of which we posit exist today as dwarf galaxies. Previous work has argued that the initial mass function (IMF) of the EEP must be flatter than those found at lower redshifts, but with considerable uncertainties. In this work, we present a more quantitative model for the EEP and demonstrate how observational constraints can be applied to the IMF using supernova Type Ia (SN Ia) rates, delay time distributions (DTDs), and the luminosity functions (LFs) of galaxy clusters. We determine best-fit values for the slope and mass break of the IMF by comparing IMFs from literature with observed DTDs and the low-luminosity component (M(R) > −12) of the Coma LF. We derive two best-fit IMFs, flatter than standard IMFs: (1) αlo = −0.13 ± 0.24 for 0.07 < M/M⊙ < 1.75 and αhi = 0.53 ± 0.01 for 1.75 < M/M⊙ < 150; and (2) αlo = 1.06 ± 0.11 for 0.07 < M/M⊙ < 6 and αhi = 0.53 ± 0.01 for 6 < M/M⊙ < 150. We compare these with sl-5 from M. Loewenstein (2013), with α = 0.5 for 0.07 < M/M⊙ < 8 and α = 0.3 for 8 < M/M⊙ < 150. This EEP model, along with stars formed at later times, can produce the observed ICM metallicity, is consistent with observations, and predicts a significant rise in the SN Ia rate at increasing redshift.

<title>The Effect of Donor Star Rejuvenation on Common Envelope Evolution</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9d3c</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In close binary star systems, common envelope evolution (CEE) may occur after a previous phase of mass transfer. Some isolated formation channels for double neutron star binaries suggest that the donor of CEE was the accretor of a previous phase of stable mass transfer. Accretion should substantially alter the structure of the donor, particularly by steepening the density gradient at the core-envelope interface and rejuvenating the star. We study the CEE of a donor that was the accretor of a previous phase of stable mass transfer and has a rejuvenated structure. We perform 3D hydrodynamics simulations of the CEE of an 18 M⊙ supergiant with a 1.4 M⊙ companion using rejuvenated and non-rejuvenated 1D stellar models for the donor. We compare the two simulations to characterize the effect of the rejuvenation on the outcome of the common envelope phase and the shape of the ejecta. We find that accounting for a previous phase of mass transfer reduces the duration of the inspiral phase by a factor of two, likely due to the different structures in the outer layers of the donor. In the rejuvenated case, the simulations show more equatorially concentrated and asymmetric ejecta, though both cases display evidence for the formation of a pressure-supported thick circumbinary disk. During the dynamical inspiral phase, the impact of rejuvenation on the unbinding of the envelope is unclear; we find that rejuvenation decreases the amount of unbound mass by 20%–40% depending on the energy criterion used.

<title>Magnetic Flux Emergence and Solar Eruptions in Partially Ionized Plasmas</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada0af</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We have performed 3D MHD simulations to study the effect of partial ionization in the process of magnetic flux emergence in the Sun. In fact, we continue previous work, and we now focus (1) on the emergence of the magnetic fields above the solar photosphere and (2) on the eruptive activity that follows the emergence into the corona. We find that in the simulations with partial ionization (PI), the structure of the emerging field consists of arch-like field lines with very little twist since the axis of the initial rising field remains below the photosphere. The plasma inside the emerging volume is less dense, and it is moving faster compared to the fully ionized (FI) simulation. In both cases, new flux ropes (FR) are formed due to reconnection between emerging field lines, and they eventually erupt in an ejective manner toward the outer solar atmosphere. We are witnessing three major eruptions in both simulations. At least for the first eruption, the formation of the eruptive FR occurs in the low atmosphere in the FI case and at coronal heights in the PI case. Also, in the first PI eruption, part of the eruptive FR carries neutrals in the high atmosphere for a short period of time. Overall, the eruptions are relatively faster in the PI case, while a considerable amount of axial flux is found above the photosphere during the eruptions in both simulations.

<title>Time-dependent Acceleration and Escape of Charged Particles at Traveling Shocks in the Near-Sun Environment</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Current multi-spacecraft in situ measurements allow for the investigation of the time evolution of energetic particles at interplanetary shocks (IPs) at small (≲0.1 au) heliocentric distances. The energy spectrum of accelerated particles at IPs was shown by a previous 1D transport model that includes both self-excited plus preexisting turbulence and a term representing the escape of particles from the system to gradually steepen as a result of a finite acceleration-to-escape timescales ratio; such a model was found in excellent agreement with the entire sample of the ground-level enhancement spectra of solar cycle 23. We solve the time-dependent case of such a model in the case of diffusion dominated by preexisting turbulence. The average timescale for particle acceleration at various heliocentric distances, from 1 au down to the inner heliosphere (<0.1 au), is shorter than in the no-escape case, as higher energy particles have a shorter time to accelerate before completely leaving the system into the upstream medium. A simple scaling with time of the time-dependent spectrum is provided. We compare the “nose” structure at a few ∼100s keV protons first measured in situ by Parker Solar Probe in crossing the very fast 2022 September 5 shock at 0.07 au; we find that the nose is reasonably well explained by a lack of the highest energy particles not yet produced by the young shock by both our model and the no-escape version.

<title>Spectrum and Location of Ongoing Extreme Particle Acceleration in Cassiopeia A</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Young supernova remnants (SNRs) are believed to be the origin of energetic cosmic rays (CRs) below the “knee” of their spectrum at ∼3 PeV (1015 eV). Nevertheless, the precise location, duration, and operation of CR acceleration in young SNRs are open questions. Here, we report on multiepoch X-ray observations of Cassiopeia A (Cas A), a 350 yr old SNR, in the 15–50 keV band that probes the most energetic CR electrons. The observed X-ray flux decrease (15% ± 1% over 10 yr), contrary to the expected >90% decrease based on previous radio, X-ray, and gamma-ray observations, provides unambiguous evidence for CR electron acceleration operating in Cas A. A temporal model for the radio and X-ray data accounting for electron cooling and continuous injection finds that the freshly injected electron spectrum is significantly harder (exponential cutoff power-law index q = 2.15), and its cutoff energy is much higher (Ecut = 36 TeV), than the relic electron spectrum (q = 2.44 ± 0.03, Ecut = 4 ± 1 TeV). Both electron spectra are naturally explained by the recently developed modified nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration (mNLDSA) mechanism. The CR protons producing the observed gamma rays are likely accelerated at the same location by the same mechanism as the injected electrons. The Cas A observations and spectral modeling represent the first time radio, X-ray, gamma-ray, and CR spectra have been self-consistently tied to a specific acceleration mechanism—mNLDSA—in a young SNR.

<title>Unveiling the Dark Side of Ultraviolet/Optical Bright Galaxies: Optically Thick Dust Absorption</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Over the past decades, a population of galaxies invisible in optical/near-infrared (NIR), but bright at longer wavelengths, have been identified through color selections. These so-called optically faint/dark galaxies are considered to be massive quiescent galaxies or highly dust-attenuated galaxies. Having the entire galaxy obscured by dust, however, is likely an extreme case of the much more common occurrence of optically thin and thick absorption coexisting in the same system. With the power of JWST imaging, we are able to spatially resolve massive galaxies at z ∼ 3, accurately model their spectral energy distributions, and identify candidate optically thick substructures. We target galaxies with 10.3 and 2.5 < z < 3.5, and get 486 galaxies in Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey and Public Release Imaging for Extragalactic Research fields. Based on excess NIR luminosity, we identify 162 galaxies (∼33% of the parent sample) as candidate hosts of optically thick substructures. We then carry out spatially resolved spectral energy distribution modeling to explore the physical properties of those dark substructures and estimate the amount of optically thick obscuration. We find that optically thick dust is ubiquitous in normal massive galaxies with a wide variety of star formation rate (SFR) and morphology. 10%–20% of the stellar mass/SFR are unaccounted for in our selected galaxies, and the fraction is insensitive to stellar mass or SFR. The dark substructures are generally dustier than the rest of the galaxies and are irregularly distributed, arguing against an obscured active galactic nucleus as the source of the NIR excess. A correlation between the obscured luminosity and the presence of a recent starburst in the past ≲100 Myr is also observed.

<title>Search for and Analysis of Eclipsing Binaries in the LAMOST Medium-resolution Survey Field. I. R.A.: 23h01m51s, Decl.: +34°36′45″</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Eclipsing binaries (EBs) play an important astrophysical role in studying stellar properties and evolution. By analyzing photometric data in the the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) Medium-Resolution Survey field, R.A.: 23h01m51 00, decl.: +34 , 48 EBs are detected and two are newly discovered. This specific field has been observed 52 times by the LAMOST Medium-Resolution Survey DR 9, which facilitates a comprehensive analysis of the EBs. For EBs with LAMOST medium-resolution spectra, radial velocity curves were obtained, and their precise orbital parameters were determined by simultaneously analyzing photometric light curves and radial velocity curves. For the other EBs with only photometric light curves, we used the q-search or the temperature ratio method to determine their initial mass ratios and then determined the orbital parameters. It is found that 15 EBs belong to detached systems, one to semi-detached systems, and 32 to contact systems. Based on the O − C analysis for 26 EBs with sufficient eclipsing times, we found a long-term decrease in the orbital period of 11 EBs and a continuous increase of five EBs, which are due to the material transfer between the two components. The O − C curve of 1 EB shows a distinct periodic variation, which is caused by the light travel time effect, and the third body is likely to be a black hole. By applying the spectral subtraction method to 13 EBs with LAMOST medium-resolution spectra, 10 systems exhibit distinct Hα emission lines, in which one system exhibits double-peaked lines near phases 0.25 and 0.75, implying strong chromospheric activity. In the massluminosities and mass–radius distributions, most of the more massive components are less evolved than the less massive ones.

<title>JWST Discovery of a Very Fast Biconical Outflow of Warm Molecular Gas in the Nearby Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxy F08572+3915 NW</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present new James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Mid-Infrared Instrument Medium-Resolution Spectrometer observations of the nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) F08572+3915 NW. These integral field spectroscopic (IFS) data reveal a kpc-scale warm-molecular rotating disk and biconical outflow traced by the H2ν = 0–0 S(1), S(2), S(3), and S(5) rotational transitions. The outflow maintains a relatively constant median (maximum) projected velocity of 1100 km s−1 (3000 km s−1) out to ∼1.4 kpc from the nucleus. The outflowing H2 material is slightly warmer (640–700 K) than the rotating disk material (460–520 K), perhaps due to shock heating in the highly turbulent outflowing material. This outflow shares the same kinematics and orientation as the sub-kiloparsec scale warm H2 outflow traced by the rovibrational H2 lines in Keck AO near-infrared IFS data. However, this warm H2 outflow is significantly faster than the sub-kiloparsec-scale cold molecular outflow derived from multi-transition far-infrared OH observations with Herschel and the greater than or equivalent to kiloparsec-scale cold molecular outflow mapped by millimeter-wave interferometric CO 1–0 observations with IRAM-PdBI and NOEMA. The new JWST data bolster the scenario where the buried quasar in this ULIRG is excavating the dust screen, accelerating perhaps as much as 60% of the dusty warm molecular material to velocities beyond the escape velocity, and thus influencing the evolution of the host galaxy.

<title>Alignment Parameters: Quantifying Dense Core Alignment in Star-forming Regions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Recent high-resolution observations at millimeter (mm) and submillimeter wavelengths reveal a diverse spatial distribution for subparsec-scale dense cores within star-forming regions, ranging from clustered to aligned arrangements. To address the increasing volume of observational and simulation data, we introduce “alignment parameters” as a quantitative and reproducible method to automatically assess core alignment. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of these parameters by applying them to artificial test clumps and comparing the results with labels from visual inspection. A threshold value is then proposed to differentiate between “clustered” and “aligned” categories. Subsequently, we apply these parameters to dense cores identified from a sample of Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array 1.3 mm dust continuum images in high-mass star-forming regions. Analysis exploring correlations between alignment parameters and clump properties rules out the presence of a moderate or strong correlation, indicating that clump properties do not appear to strongly influence the outcome of fragmentation. One possible explanation for this is that the fragmentation process is chaotic, meaning that small variations in initial conditions can lead to significant differences in fragmentation outcomes, thus obscuring any direct link between clump properties and core alignment/distribution.

<title>From Halos to Galaxies. X. Decoding Galaxy SEDs with Physical Priors and Accurate Star Formation History Reconstruction</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The spectral energy distribution (SED) of galaxies is essential for deriving fundamental properties like stellar mass and star formation history (SFH). However, conventional methods, including both parametric and nonparametric approaches, often fail to accurately recover the observed cosmic star formation rate (SFR) density due to oversimplified or unrealistic assumptions about SFH and their inability to account for the complex SFH variations across different galaxy populations. To address this issue, we introduce a novel approach that improves galaxy broadband SED analysis by incorporating physical priors derived from hydrodynamical simulations. Tests using IllustrisTNG simulations demonstrate that our method can reliably determine galaxy physical properties from broadband photometry, including stellar mass within 0.05 dex, current SFR within 0.3 dex, and fractional stellar formation time within 0.2 dex, with a negligible fraction of catastrophic failures. When applied to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) main photometric galaxy sample with spectroscopic redshift, our estimates of stellar mass and SFR are consistent with the widely used MPA-JHU and GSWLC catalogs. Notably, using the derived SFHs of individual SDSS galaxies, we estimate the cosmic SFR density and stellar mass density with remarkable consistency to direct observations up to z ~ 6. This demonstrates a significant advancement in deriving SFHs from SEDs that closely align with observational data. Consequently, our method can reliably recover observed spectral indices such as Dn(4000) and HδA by synthesizing the full spectra of galaxies using the estimated SFHs and metal enrichment histories, relying solely on broadband photometry as input. Furthermore, this method is extremely computationally efficient compared to conventional approaches.

<title>Examining Turbulence in Galactic Molecular Clouds. I. A Statistical Analysis of Velocity Structures</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a systematic analysis of the velocity structure functions (VSFs) of 167 molecular clouds with angular sizes greater than ~176 arcmin2 in three sectors of the Galactic midplane. We calculated the first-to-third-order VSFs and found that 60% of the VSFs exhibit power-law distributions. The relative power-law exponents are consistent with predictions from intermittent turbulence models. Column density weighting reduces the proportion of power-law VSFs and steepens the VSF slopes, implying a reduction of turbulent energy in high-density regions. All clouds show small-scale intermittency, with slightly stronger intermittency in those molecular clouds showing “none” power-law VSFs. Negative VSF exponents that may indicate gravitational collapse are not observed in our sample. The scaling exponents of the observed VSFs do not correlate with the virial parameters of the molecular clouds. These two observations suggest that gravity-dominated scales in molecular clouds still need further investigation. Consistent VSF scaling exponents for the molecular clouds with significant power-law VSFs suggest large-scale external driving of turbulence in these molecular clouds. However, the driving mechanisms are likely not universal, as the power-law scaling coefficients in our results show relatively large scatter. The fact that nearly 40% of the VSFs deviate to some extent from power-law distributions suggests that the influence of local environments on the internal turbulence of molecular clouds may not be negligible.

Ultraviolet absorption line spectroscopy is a sensitive diagnostic for the properties of interstellar and circumgalactic gas. Down-the-barrel observations, where the absorption is measured against the galaxy itself, are commonly used to study feedback from galactic outflows and to make predictions about the leakage of H i ionizing photons into the intergalactic medium. Nonetheless, the interpretation of these observations is challenging, and observational compromises are often made in terms of signal-to-noise ratio, spectral resolution, or the use of stacking analyses. In this paper, we present a novel quantitative assessment of UV absorption line measurement techniques by using mock observations of a hydrodynamical simulation. We use a simulated galaxy to create 22,500 spectra in the commonly used Si ii lines while also modeling the signal-to-noise ratio and spectral resolution of recent rest-frame UV galaxy surveys at both high and low redshifts. We show that the residual flux of absorption features is easily overestimated for single line measurements and for stacked spectra. Additionally, we explore the robustness of the partial covering model for estimating column densities from spectra and find underpredictions on an average of 1.25 dex. We show that the underprediction is likely caused by high-column-density sight lines that are optically thick to dust making them invisible in UV spectra.

<title>Identifying Coronal Mass Ejection Active Region Sources: An Automated Approach</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Identifying the source regions of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is crucial for understanding their origins and improving space weather forecasting. We present an automated algorithm for matching CMEs detected by the Large Angle Spectrometric Coronagraph with their source active regions, specifically Space Weather HMI Active Region Patches (SHARPs), between 2010 May and 2019 January. Our method uses posteruptive signatures, including flares and coronal dimmings, to associate CMEs with potential source regions. Out of 4190 CMEs, we successfully match 1132, achieving a recall rate of ~57% for frontside events. We find that the algorithm performs better for complex SHARP regions containing multiple NOAA regions and for faster CMEs, consistent with expectations that more energetic events produce stronger eruption signatures. We find that CME–flare association rates increase with flare intensity, aligning with previous studies. While our approach has limitations, such as focusing exclusively on SHARP regions and relying on a limited set of posteruptive signatures, it significantly reduces the time required for CME source identification while providing transparent, reproducible results. We encourage the solar physics community to build upon this work, developing improved automated tools for CME source identification. The resulting catalog of CME–source region associations is made publicly available, offering a valuable resource for statistical studies and machine learning applications in solar physics and space weather forecasting.

Using Helioseismic Magnetic Imager data we found that the magnetic flux of an emerging negative pole increases steadily before declining just as the jets erupt. Certain physical quantities, such as the total unsigned vertical current, align with the periodicity of the jets. The differential affine velocity of vector magnetograms reveals strong shear around the negative pole. The Doppler velocity map, calculated from the Hα spectra observed by the Chinese Hα Solar Explorer, shows upflows with large initial velocity before they can be observed by AIA. The magnetic field derived from the nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) model suggests a topology akin to a fan–spine structure, consistent with AIA images. We calculated the evolution of the volumetric helicity ratio using the NLFFF model and found its phase aligns with the jet flux in AIA 171 Å. These results suggest that recurrent jets may be triggered by the accumulation and release of energy and helicity, driven by emergence, shearing, and cancellation of photospheric magnetic field.

<title>Comparison of Bar Formation Mechanisms. I. Does a Tidally Induced Bar Rotate Slower than an Internally Induced Bar?</title>

Galactic bars can form via the internal bar instability or external tidal perturbations by other galaxies. We systematically compare the properties of the bars formed through the two mechanisms with a series of controlled N-body simulations that form bars through internal or external mechanisms. We create three disk galaxy models with different dynamical “hotness” and evolve them in isolation and under flyby interactions. In the cold- and warm-disk models, where bars can form spontaneously in isolation, tidally induced bars are promoted to a more “advanced” evolutionary stage. However, these bars have similar pattern speeds to those formed spontaneously within the same disk. Bars formed from both mechanisms have similar distributions in pattern-speed–bar-strength (Ωp − A2) space and exhibit comparable ratios of corotation radius to bar length ( ). Dynamical analyses suggest that the inner stellar disk loses the same amount of angular momentum, irrespective of the presence or intensity of the perturbation, which possibly explains the resemblance between tidally and spontaneously formed bars. In the hot-disk model, which avoids the internal bar instability in isolation, a bar forms only under perturbations and rotates more slowly than those in the cold and warm disks. Thus, if “tidally induced bars” refer exclusively to those in galaxies that are otherwise stable against bar instability, they indeed rotate slower than internally induced ones. However, the pattern speed difference is due to the difference in the internal properties of the bar host galaxies, not the different formation mechanisms.

<title>Investigating the Lower Limit of Metallicity for the Galactic Thin Disk</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We explore the metal-poor regime of the Galactic disk on the distribution of stars in the [α/M]–Vϕ plane, to identify the most metal-poor thin disk (MPTnD) stars belonging to the low-α sequence. Chemical abundances and velocities of sample stars are either taken or derived from APOGEE DR17 and Gaia DR3 catalogs. We find the existence of a well-separated extension of the kinematically thin disk stars in the metallicity range of −1.2 < [M/H] < −0.8 dex. Based on two-by-two distributions of [Mg/Mn], [Al/Fe] and [C+N/Fe], we further confirmed 56 high-possibility metal-poor thin disk (HP-MPTnD) giant stars and suggested the lower metallicity limit of the thin disk below −0.95 dex. A comparative analysis of the HP-MPTnD sample with other Galactic components revealed its chemo-dynamical similarities with canonical thin disk stars. These low-α metal-poor stars are predominantly located in the outer disk region and formed in the early stage of the formation of thin disk. Their existence provides compelling support for the two-infall model of the Milky Way's disk formation. Moreover, these stars impose observational constraints on the timing and metallicity of the second gas infall event.

<title>Nuclear and Star Formation Activities in Nearby Galaxies: Roles of Gas Supply and Active Galactic Nucleus Feedback</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We analyze a sample of ~113,000 galaxies (z < 0.3) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, divided into star-forming, composite, Seyfert, and LINER types, to explore the relationships between UV-to-optical colors (u – r), star formation rates (SFRs), specific SFRs (sSFRs), stellar velocity dispersions (σ*), mass accretion rates onto the black hole ( ), and Eddington ratios. Star-forming galaxies predominantly feature young, blue stars along the main-sequence (MS) line, while composite, Seyfert, and LINER galaxies deviate from this line, displaying progressively older stellar populations and lower SFRs. The and Eddington ratios are highest in Seyfert galaxies, moderate in composite galaxies, and lowest in LINERs, with higher ratios associated with bluer colors, indicating a younger stellar population and stronger active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity. These trends suggest a strong correlation between sSFRs and Eddington ratios, highlighting a close connection between AGN and star formation activities. These results may imply an evolutionary sequence where galaxies transition from blue star-forming galaxies to red LINERs, passing through the composite and Seyfert phases, driven primarily by gas supply, with AGN feedback playing a secondary role. While both the radio luminosities (L1.4 GHz) and Eddington ratios correlate with SFRs, their trends differ on the SFR−stellar-mass (M*) plane, with the radio luminosities increasing with stellar mass along the MS line and no direct connection between the radio luminosities and Eddington ratios. These findings may provide new insights into the interplay between star formation, AGN activity, and radio emission in galaxies, shedding light on their evolutionary pathways.

<title>Characterizing Multiband Optical Emission and Variability of 1ES 1215+303 on Diverse Timescales</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study presents analyses of the optical variability of the 1ES 1215+303 on diverse timescales using multiband observations, including observations in the optical BVRI bands carried out with the 0.6 and 1.0 m telescopes located at the Tübitak National Observatory (TUG) from 2022 to 2024 and Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) gri data from 2018 to 2023. Investigation of variability on intraday timescales revealed amplitudes of 4.0% and 5.6% on two nights, with a calculated duty cycle of 63%. We determined a minimum timescale of ~92 minutes from these observations, leading us to limit the radius for the optical emission region and the mass of the black hole. The blazar exhibits moderate short- and long-term variability, with variability amplitudes reaching up to 120% and decreasing as the wavelength shortens. Correlation analysis revealed a strong correlation between the optical multiband emissions without any time lag. Analysis of 109 nightly spectral energy distributions yielded spectral indices ranging from 0.772 to 1.413. The consistent trend of both spectral indices and color with respect to brightness suggests a mild bluer when brighter trend persists throughout the observation period, in contrast to the intraday timescale. Utilizing the weighted wavelet z-transform and Lomb–Scargle methods, we analyzed recurrent optical emission patterns on the combined R-band light curves from TUG, ZTF, and Tuorla observations, revealing a quasiperiodic signal at around 1000 days and a secondary signal at approximately 300 days. These signals were found to be insignificant after accounting for the stochastic process and the trial factor.

<title>Local 2D Simulations of the Ignition of a Helium Shell Detonation on a White Dwarf by an Impacting Stream</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada034</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada034</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The double detonation model is one of the prevalent explosion mechanisms of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) wherein an outer helium shell detonation triggers a core detonation in the white dwarf (WD). The dynamically driven double degenerate double detonation (D6) is the double detonation of the more massive WD in a binary WD system where the localized impact of the mass transfer stream from the companion sets off the initial helium shell detonation. To have high numerical resolution and control over the stream parameters, we have implemented a study of the local interaction of the stream with the WD surface in 2D. In cases with lower base density of the shell, the stream's impact can cause surface detonation soon after first impact. With higher base densities, after the stream hits the surface, hot material flows around the star and interacts with the incoming stream to produce a denser and narrower impact. Our results therefore show that (1) a directly impacting stream for both a relatively high resolution and for a range of stream parameters can produce a surface detonation, (2) thinner helium shells ignite more promptly via impact, doing so sooner, and (3) there are lower limits on ignition in both shell density and incoming stream speed with lower limits on density being well below those shown by other work to be required for normal appearing SN Ia. This supports stream ignition and therefore the D6 scenario, as a viable mechanism for normal SNe Ia.

<title>Advancing CO2 ++ Modeling in the Martian Dayside Ionosphere: Insights from Natural Lifetime Analysis</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The molecular dication CO2++ has, as previously reported, been detected in the Martian ionosphere by the Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer on the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) mission. Photochemical models have also been developed to reproduce the CO2++ density in the Martian dayside ionosphere but underestimate significantly the observations. In this study, we examine the influence of the CO2++ natural lifetime against spontaneous dissociation on its modeled density. We show that extending the assumed CO2++ lifetime significantly reduces the discrepancy between the photochemical model predictions and MAVEN observations. Specifically, when treating CO2++ as stable against natural dissociation, instead of invoking a lifetime of 4 s as done in previous studies, the data-to-model ratio comes close to unity throughout the altitude range 160–220 km. We argue that stability of CO2++ against natural dissociation does not necessarily conflict with results from a frequently cited experimental investigation. Our study provides new insights for advancing photochemical modeling of the Martian ionosphere and underscores the need for further laboratory measurements targeting fundamental properties of doubly charged ions.

<title>Cosmic Chronometers, Pantheon+ Supernovae, and Quasars Favor Coasting Cosmologies over the Flat ΛCDM Model</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We test and compare coasting cosmological models with curvature parameters in units and the flat ΛCDM model by fitting them to cosmic chronometers (CCs), the Pantheon+ sample of Type Ia supernovae (SNe), and standardized quasars (QSOs). We used the emcee code for fitting CC data, a custom Markov Chain Monte Carlo implementation for SNe and QSOs, and Anderson–Darling tests for normality on normalized residuals for model comparison. Best-fit parameters are presented, constrained by data within redshift ranges z ≤ 2 for CCs, z ≤ 2.3 for SNe, and z ≤ 7.54 for QSOs. Coasting models, particularly the flat coasting model, are generally favored over the flat ΛCDM model. The overfitting of the flat ΛCDM model to Pantheon+ SNe and the large intrinsic scatter in QSO data suggest a need to refine error estimates in these data sets. We also highlight the seemingly fine-tuned nature of either the CC data or Ωm,0 in the flat ΛCDM model to an H1 = H0 coincidence when fitting H(z) = H1z + H0, a natural feature of coasting models.

<title>PHAST. The Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Southern Treasury. I. Ultraviolet and Optical Photometry of over 90 Million Stars in M31</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Southern Treasury (PHAST) is a large 195-orbit Hubble Space Telescope program imaging ∼0.45 deg2 of the southern half of M31's star-forming disk at optical and near-ultraviolet (NUV) wavelengths. The PHAST survey area extends the northern coverage of the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) down to the southern half of M31, covering out to a radius of ∼13 kpc along the southern major axis and in total ∼two-thirds of M31's star-forming disk. This new legacy imaging yields stellar photometry of over 90 million resolved stars using the Advanced Camera for Surveys in the optical (F475W and F814W), and the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) in the NUV (F275W and F336W). The photometry is derived using all overlapping exposures across all bands, and achieves a 50% completeness-limited depth of F475W ∼ 27.7 in the lowest surface density regions of the outer disk and F475W ∼ 26.0 in the most crowded, high surface brightness regions near M31's bulge. We provide extensive analysis of the data quality, including artificial star tests to quantify completeness, photometric uncertainties, and flux biases, all of which vary due to the background source density and the number of overlapping exposures. We also present seamless population maps of the entire M31 disk, which show relatively well-mixed distributions for stellar populations older than 1–2 Gyr, and highly structured distributions for younger populations. The combined PHAST + PHAT photometry catalog of ∼0.2 billion stars is the largest ever produced for equidistant sources and is available for public download by the community.

<title>Recovering Pulsar Periodicity from Time-of-arrival Data by Finding the Shortest Vector in a Lattice</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The strict periodicity of pulsars is one of the primary ways through which their nature and environment can be studied, and it has also enabled precision tests of general relativity and studies of nanohertz gravitational waves using pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). Identifying such a periodicity from a discrete set of arrival times is a difficult algorithmic problem, In particular when the pulsar is in a binary system. This challenge is especially acute in γ-ray pulsar astronomy, as there are hundreds of unassociated Fermi-LAT sources that may be produced by γ-ray emission from unknown pulsars. Recovering their timing solutions will help reveal their properties and may allow them to be added to PTAs. The same issue arises when attempting to recover a strict periodicity for repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs). Such a detection would be a major breakthrough, providing us with the FRB source’s age, magnetic field, and binary orbit. The problem of recovering a timing solution from sparse time-of-arrival data is currently unsolvable for pulsars in unknown binary systems, and incredibly hard even for isolated pulsars. In this paper, we frame the timing recovery problem as the problem of finding a short vector in a lattice and obtain the solution using off-the-shelf lattice reduction and sieving techniques. As a proof of concept, we solve PSR J0318+0253, a millisecond γ-ray pulsar discovered by FAST in a γ-ray-directed search, in a few CPU minutes. We discuss the assumptions of the standard lattice techniques and quantify their performance and limitations.

<title>Suzaku Observations of the Cold Front in A3667: A Nonequilibrium Ionization State of the Intracluster Medium</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a systematic study of the thermodynamic properties of the intracluster medium (ICM), including the plasma conditions in the ICM, in the merging galaxy cluster A3667 using Suzaku. We analyze the X-ray spectra of the ICM between the northwestern and the southeastern radio relics across a prominent cold front in A3667 to search for the ICM in a nonequilibrium ionization (NEI) state. We find that the ICM inside the cold front exhibits an NEI state with an ionization parameter of (2.2 ± 0.4) × 1011 s cm−3 at the 90% confidence level, which is lower than that expected from a collisional ionization equilibrium state of the ICM (i.e., net > 1012 s cm−3). The timescale calculated from the ionization parameter of the ICM inside the cold front is , which is much shorter than the thermal equilibration timescale. A weak transonic sloshing motion might explain the possibility that the ICM inside the cold front of A3667 is in the NEI state. In addition, the NEI state of the ICM in A3667 seems to be associated with the elongated radio halo bridging the region between the northwestern radio relic and the prominent cold front in A3667 across the cluster center.

<title>The Effect of Stellar Evolution on Dispersal of Protoplanetary Disks: Disk Fraction in Star-forming Regions</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9746</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We study the effect of stellar evolution on the dispersal of protoplanetary disks by performing one-dimensional simulations of long-term disk evolution. Our simulations include viscous disk accretion, magnetohydrodynamic winds, and photoevaporation as important disk dispersal processes. We consider a wide range of stellar mass of 0.1–7 M⊙ and incorporate the luminosity evolution of the central star. For solar-mass stars, stellar evolution delays the disk dispersal time as the far-ultraviolet (FUV) luminosity decreases toward the main sequence. In the case of intermediate-mass stars, the FUV luminosity increases significantly over a few million years, driving strong photoevaporation and enhancing disk mass loss during the later stages of disk evolution. This highlights the limitations of assuming a constant FUV luminosity throughout a simulation. Photoevaporation primarily impacts the outer regions of the disk and is the dominant disk dispersal process in the late evolutionary stage. Based on the results of a large set of simulations, we study the evolution of a population of star–disk systems and derive the disk fraction as a function of time. We demonstrate that the inclusion of stellar luminosity evolution can alter the disk fraction by several tens of percent, bringing the simulations into closer agreement with recent observations. We argue that it is important to include the stellar luminosity evolution in simulations of the long-term dispersal of protoplanetary disks.

<title>Increased Surface Temperatures of Habitable White Dwarf Worlds Relative to Main-sequence Exoplanets</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Discoveries of giant planet candidates orbiting white dwarf (WD) stars and the demonstrated capabilities of the James Webb Space Telescope bring the possibility of detecting rocky planets in the habitable zones (HZs) of WDs into pertinent focus. We present simulations of an aqua planet with an Earth-like atmospheric composition and incident stellar insolation orbiting in the HZ of two different types of stars—a 5000 K WD and main-sequence K-dwarf star Kepler-62 (K62) with a similar effective temperature—and identify the mechanisms responsible for the two differing planetary climates. The synchronously rotating WD planet's global mean surface temperature is 25 K higher than that of the synchronously rotating planet orbiting K62, due to its much faster (10 hr) rotation and orbital period. This ultrafast rotation generates strong zonal winds and meridional flux of zonal momentum, stretching out and homogenizing the scale of atmospheric circulation, and preventing an equivalent buildup of thick, liquid water clouds on the dayside of the planet compared to the synchronous planet orbiting K62, while also transporting heat equatorward from higher latitudes. White dwarfs may therefore present amenable environments for life on planets formed within or migrated to their HZs, generating warmer surface environments than those of planets with main-sequence hosts to compensate for an ever shrinking incident stellar flux.

<title>Some Stars Fade Quietly: Varied Supernova Explosion Outcomes and Their Effects on the Multiphase Interstellar Medium</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present results from galaxy evolution simulations with a multiphase interstellar medium (ISM), a mass resolution of 4 M⊙, and a spatial resolution of 0.5 pc. These simulations include a resolved stellar stellar feedback model. Our fiducial run WLM-fid adopts 1051 erg for the supernova (SN) energy. Among the remaining seven simulations, there are two runs where we vary this number by fixing the energy at 1050 erg and 1052 erg (WLM-1e50 and WLM-1e52). Additionally, we carry out one run with variable SN-energy (WLM-variable) and run two simulations where only 10% or 60% of stars explode as SNe with 1051 erg, while the remaining stars do not explode (WLM-60prob and WLM-10prob). We find that the variation in the SN energy, has only minor effects: the star formation rate changes by roughly a factor of 2 compared to WLM-fid, and the strength of the galactic outflows in mass and energy is reduced by 30%, with typical values of ηm ∼ 0.1 and ηe ∼ 0.05 (at a height of 3 kpc after the hot wind is fully decoupled from the galactic ISM). In contrast, the increase and decrease in the canonical SN-energy have a clear impact on the phase structure, with loading factors that are at least 10 times lower/higher and a clear change in the phase structure (the energy loading is normalized self-consistently to the initial mass function averaged explosion energy). We conclude that these modulations are driven not by the minor change in SN-energy but rather by the likelihood of whether or not an event occurs when variable SN energies are applied.

<title>Star-forming Nuclear Clusters in Dwarf Galaxies Mimicking Active Galactic Nucleus Signatures in the Mid-infrared</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Effectively finding and identifying active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in dwarf galaxies is an important step in studying black hole formation and evolution. In this work, we examine four mid-infrared (IR)-selected AGN candidates in dwarf galaxies with stellar masses between M⋆ ~ 108 and 109 M⊙ and find that the galaxies are host to nuclear star clusters (NSCs) that are notably rare in how young and massive they are. We perform photometric measurements on the central star clusters in our target galaxies using Hubble Space Telescope optical and near-IR imaging and compare their observed properties to models of stellar population evolution. We find that these galaxies are host to very massive (~107 M⊙), extremely young (≲8 Myr), and dusty (0.6 ≲ Av ≲ 1.8) NSCs. Our results indicate that these galactic nuclei have ongoing star formation, are still at least partially obscured by clouds of gas and dust, and are most likely producing the extremely red AGN-like mid-IR colors. Moreover, prior work has shown that these galaxies do not exhibit X-ray or optical AGN signatures. Therefore, we recommend caution when using mid-IR color–color diagnostics for AGN selection in dwarf galaxies, since, as directly exemplified in this sample, they can be contaminated by massive star clusters with ongoing star formation.

<title>Tempered Superdiffusive Shock Acceleration at a Perpendicular Shock</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A theory for steady-state tempered superdiffusive shock acceleration of energetic particles at a plane perpendicular shock is presented that involves solving analytically a tempered fractional Parker transport equation for perpendicular transport in quasi-2D turbulence. The main predictions of the theory are as follows: (i) Tempered perpendicular superdiffusion (tempered Lévy flights) upstream reduces the effectiveness of classical perpendicular superdiffusion (standard Lévy flights) through a transition toward normal perpendicular diffusion when the particle transport distance upstream surpasses a critical spatial scale. Consequently, the accelerated particle distribution upstream decays spatially as a stretched exponential close to the shock that becomes a power law farther upstream under some conditions (superdiffusion), followed by an exponential rollover (transition to normal diffusion); (ii) Downstream, the accelerated particle distribution for tempered superdiffusion converges to a uniform distribution closer to the shock because of a stronger decay close to the shock compared to classical superdiffusion, and a shift of the peak in the distribution at the shock to just downstream of the shock occurs under some conditions; (iii) The accelerated power-law momentum spectrum at the shock is modulated upstream by the incoming solar wind flow to be a hardened power law instead of featuring an exponential rollover at lower particle momenta as for classical diffusive shock acceleration; and (iv) Tempered superdiffusive shock acceleration tends to be more efficient compared to standard superdiffusive shock acceleration.

<title>From Halos to Galaxies. VI. Improved Halo Mass Estimation for SDSS Groups and Measurement of the Halo Mass Function</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad991f</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In ΛCDM cosmology, galaxies form and evolve in their host dark matter (DM) halos. Halo mass is crucial for understanding the halo–galaxy connection. The abundance-matching (AM) technique has been widely used to derive the halo masses of galaxy groups. However, the quenching of the central galaxy can decouple the coevolution of its stellar mass and DM halo mass. Different halo assembly histories can also result in significantly different final stellar masses of the central galaxies. These processes can introduce substantial uncertainties into the halo masses derived from the AM method, particularly leading to a systematic bias between groups with star-forming centrals (blue groups) and passive centrals (red groups). To improve this, we have developed a new machine learning (ML) algorithm that accounts for these effects and is trained on simulations. Our results show that the ML method eliminates the systematic bias in the derived halo masses for blue and red groups and is, on average, ~one-third more accurate than the AM method. With careful calibrations of observable quantities from simulations and observations from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we apply our ML model to the SDSS groups to derive their halo masses down to 1011.5M⊙ or even lower. The derived SDSS group halo mass function agrees well with the theoretical predictions, and the derived stellar-to-halo mass relations for both the red and blue groups match well with those obtained from direct weak-lensing measurements. These new halo mass estimates enable more accurate investigation of the galaxy–halo connection and the role of halos in galaxy evolution.

We present results from a Keck/DEIMOS survey to study satellite quenching in group environments at z ~ 0.8 within the Extended Groth Strip (EGS). We target 11 groups in the EGS with extended X-ray emission. We obtain high-quality spectroscopic redshifts for group member candidates, extending to depths over 1 order of magnitude fainter than existing DEEP2/DEEP3 spectroscopy. This depth enables the first spectroscopic measurement of the satellite quiescent fraction down to stellar masses of ~109.5M⊙ at this redshift. By combining an infall-based environmental quenching model, constrained by the observed quiescent fractions, with infall histories of simulated groups from the IllustrisTNG100-1-Dark simulation, we estimate environmental quenching timescales (τquench) for the observed group population. At high stellar masses (M⋆ = 1010.5M⊙) we find that Gyr, which is consistent with previous estimates at this epoch. At lower stellar masses (M⋆ = 109.5M⊙), we find that Gyr, which is shorter than prior estimates from photometry-based investigations. These timescales are consistent with satellite quenching via starvation, provided the hot gas envelope of infalling satellites is not stripped away. We find that the evolution in the quenching timescale between 0 <1 aligns with the evolution in the dynamical time of the host halo and the total cold gas depletion time. This suggests that the doubling of the quenching timescale in groups since z ~ 1 could be related to the dynamical evolution of groups or a decrease in quenching efficiency via starvation with decreasing redshift.

<title>Repeating Partial Tidal Encounters of Sun-like Stars Leading to Their Complete Disruption</title>

Stars grazing supermassive black holes on bound orbits may produce periodic flares over many passages, known as repeating partial tidal disruption events (TDEs). Here, we present 3D hydrodynamic simulations of Sun-like stars over multiple tidal encounters. The star is significantly restructured and becomes less concentrated as a result of mass loss and tidal heating. The vulnerability to mass loss depends sensitively on the stellar density structure, and the strong correlation between the fractional mass loss ΔM/M* and the ratio of the central and average density , which was initially derived in disruption simulations of main-sequence stars, also applies for stars strongly reshaped by tides. Over multiple orbits, the star loses progressively more mass in each encounter and is doomed to a complete disruption. Throughout its lifetime, the star may produce numerous weak flares (depending on the initial impact parameter), followed by a couple of luminous flares whose brightness increases exponentially. Flux-limited surveys are heavily biased toward the brightest flares, which may appear similar to the flare produced by the same star undergoing a full disruption on its first tidal encounter. This places new challenges on constraining the intrinsic TDE rates, which need to take repeating TDEs into account. Other types of stars with different initial density structures (e.g., evolved stars with massive cores) follow distinct evolution tracks, which might explain the diversity of the long-term luminosity evolution seen in recently uncovered repeaters.

<title>Low-energy Injection and Nonthermal Particle Acceleration in Relativistic Magnetic Turbulence</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9b12</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Relativistic magnetic turbulence has been proposed as a process for producing nonthermal particles in high-energy astrophysics. The particle energization may be contributed by both magnetic reconnection and turbulent fluctuations, but their interplay is poorly understood. It has been suggested that during magnetic reconnection the parallel electric field dominates the particle acceleration up to the lower bound of the power-law particle spectrum, but recent studies show that electric fields perpendicular to the magnetic field can play an important, if not dominant role. In this study, we carry out two-dimensional fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations of magnetically dominated decaying turbulence in a relativistic pair plasma. For a fixed magnetization parameter σ0 = 20, we find that the injection energy εinj converges with increasing domain size to εinj ≃ 10 mec2. In contrast, the power-law index, the cut-off energy, and the power-law extent increase steadily with domain size. We trace a large number of particles and evaluate the contributions of the work done by the parallel (W∥) and perpendicular (W⊥) electric fields during both the injection phase and the postinjection phase. We find that during the injection phase, the W⊥ contribution increases with domain size, suggesting that it may eventually dominate injection for a sufficiently large domain. In contrast, on average, both components contribute equally during the postinjection phase, insensitive to the domain size. For high energy (ε ≫ εinj) particles, W⊥ dominates the subsequent energization. These findings may improve our understanding of nonthermal particles and their emissions in astrophysical plasmas.

<title>Simultaneous Multiband Photometry of the Early Optical Afterglow of GRB 240825A with Mephisto</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most luminous transients in the Universe. The interaction of the relativistic jet with the circumburst medium produces an afterglow and generates multiwavelength emission. In this work, we present simultaneous multiband photometry of GRB 240825A with the Multi-channel Photometric Survey Telescope (Mephisto) and analyze its temporal and spectral properties. The measurement began 128 s after the GRB trigger and continued until the fourth day, when the afterglow essentially diminished and the measured brightness was close to that of the host galaxy. Based on the multiband light curves in the uvgriz bands, we find that the optical flux density satisfies Fν,obs ∝ t−1.34ν−2.48 with a spectral index of 2.48, much larger than those of most other GRBs. To reconcile the measured much softer spectral energy distribution (SED) with that predicted by the standard afterglow model, an extra host-galaxy extinction of EB−V ∼ (0.37–0.57) mag is required. We interpreted this excess as arising from a dense circumburst medium. We further find that the SED of the optical afterglow hardened as the afterglow decayed and the color excess EB−V decreased ∼0.26 mag from 100 to 3000 s after the GRB trigger. Finally, we analyze the properties of the host galaxy of GRB 240825A based on data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the Pan-STARRS survey, and the HSC-SSP survey. For a host redshift of z = 0.659, the stellar mass and star formation rate of the host galaxy are estimated to be and , respectively, pointing to a gas-rich, star-forming, medium-size galaxy.

<title>Dynamics of Small, Constant-size Particles in a Protoplanetary Disk with an Embedded Protoplanet</title>

Hydrodynamical simulations of protoplanetary disk dynamics are useful tools for understanding the formation of planetary systems, including our own. Approximations are necessary to make these simulations computationally tractable. A common assumption when simulating dust fluids is that of a constant Stokes number, a dimensionless number that characterizes the interaction between a particle and the surrounding gas. Constant Stokes number is not a good approximation in regions of the disk where the gas density changes significantly, such as near a planet-induced gap. In this paper, we relax the assumption of a constant Stokes number in the popular FARGO3D code using semianalytic equations for the drag force on dust particles, which enables an assumption of constant particle size instead. We explore the effect this change has on disk morphology and particle fluxes across the gap for both outward- and inward-drifting particles. The assumption of constant particle size, rather than constant Stokes number, is shown to make a significant difference in some cases, emphasizing the importance of the more accurate treatment.

<title>An Indication of Gas Inflow in Clumpy Star-forming Galaxies near z ∼ 1: Lower Gas-phase Metallicities in Clumpy Galaxies Compared to Nonclumpy Galaxies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Despite the ubiquity of clumpy star-forming galaxies at high-redshift, the origin of clumps are still largely unconstrained due to the limited observations that can validate the mechanisms for clump formation. We postulate that if clumps form due to the accretion of metal-poor gas that leads to violent disk instability, clumpy galaxies should have lower gas-phase metallicities compared to nonclumpy galaxies. In this work, we obtain the near-infrared spectrum for 42 clumpy and nonclumpy star-forming galaxies of similar masses, star formation rates, and colors at z ≈ 0.7 using the Gemini Near-Infrared Spectrograph (GNIRS) and infer their gas-phase metallicity from the [N ii]λ6584 and Hα line ratio. We find that clumpy galaxies have lower metallicities compared to nonclumpy galaxies, with an offset in the weighted average metallicity of 0.07 ± 0.02 dex. We also find an offset of 0.06 ± 0.02 dex between clumpy and nonclumpy galaxies in a comparable sample of 23 star-forming galaxies at z ≈ 1.5 using existing data from the FMOS-COSMOS survey. Similarly, lower [N ii]λ6584/Hα ratios are typically found in galaxies that have more of their UVrest luminosity originating from clumps, suggesting that clumpier galaxies are more metal-poor. We also derive the intrinsic velocity dispersion and line-of-sight rotational velocity for galaxies from the GNIRS sample. The majority of galaxies have σ0/vc ≈ 0.2, with no significant difference between clumpy and nonclumpy galaxies. Our result indicates that clump formation may be related to the inflow of metal-poor gas; however, the process that forms them does not necessarily require significant, long-term kinematic instability in the disk.

<title>Deconstructing the Properties of Solar Super Active Region 13664 in the Context of the Historic Geomagnetic Storm of 2024 May 10–11</title>

Active regions (ARs) are sites of strong magnetic fields on the solar surface whose size can be several times that of Earth. They spawn dynamic activity, sometimes resulting in severe space weather. Some ARs characterized by extraordinary magnetic properties and exhibiting extreme activity are termed as super active regions (SARs). Recently, solar AR 13664 produced 23 X-class flares and unleashed multiple coronal mass ejections, which triggered a severe geomagnetic storm during 2024 May 10–11—the strongest storm on record since 2003. Here, we put AR 13664 in historical context over the cumulative period of 1874 May–2024 June. We find that AR 13664 stands at the 99.95th percentile in the distribution of area over 1874 May–2024 June and at the 99.10th percentile in terms of flux content among all ARs over the period 1996 April–2024 June. Our analysis indicates that five of its magnetic properties rank at the 100.00th percentile among all ARs observed during 2010 May–2024 June by the Solar Dynamic Observatory. A total of 16 magnetic properties of AR 13664 are ranked higher than the 99.00th percentile when compared to other ARs recorded in Space-weather Helioseismic Magnetic Imager Active Region Patch data series, which includes all well-established flare relevant parameters. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AR 13664 reached its most dynamic flare productive state following a rapid rate of rise of its flare-relevant parameters and that the X-class flares were more frequent near their peak values. Our analyses establish AR 13644 to be an SAR and provide a paradigm for investigating their flare-relevant physical characteristics.

<title>Red Stellar Populations and Dust Extinction toward W3</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We explore red stellar populations toward the W3 giant molecular cloud through the use of optical-to-infrared (IR) photometry and Gaia DR 3 data, simultaneously characterizing stellar content and properties of dust in the molecular medium. We use a Rayleigh–Jeans color excess method modified to de-redden stellar observations of both red giants (RGs) and OB stars, and construct an IR Hertzsprung–Russell diagram validated against the Besançon Galactic model. Taking advantage of the near-universal IR interstellar extinction law and precise Gaia measurements, we develop a method for obtaining the spectral classification, foreground extinction, and distance moduli of stars, validated by spectroscopically confirmed OB stars. We constrain the observed parallax and proper motion of OB stars in W3, demonstrating the importance of considering systematic effects in the parallax bias, and assign parallax- and proper-motion-based cloud membership to our stellar samples. While it has been assumed that all spectroscopic OB stars are inside the W3 cloud, we find evidence of seven background B stars and three potential runaway OB stars. The methods developed here, which are based on known stellar populations, enable us to identify 82 new OB candidates that are confidently within the cloud. We quantify several dust-to-dust empirical correlations, in particular the IR color excess E(H − [4.5]) and the optical depth τ1 of submillimeter dust emission at 1 THz using RGs behind W3, measuring a best fit of .

<title>Disk-locking Regulates Stellar Rotation in Young Clusters: Insights from NGC 2264</title>

Many young clusters possess extended main sequences, a phenomenon commonly ascribed to stellar rotation. However, the mechanism behind their very wide stellar rotation distributions remains unclear. A proposed explanation is that magnetic star–disk interaction can regulate stellar rotation, i.e., protostars with longer disk lifetimes will eventually evolve into slow rotators, and vice versa. To examine this hypothesis, we took the star-forming region NGC 2264, as a test bed. We have studied its high-mass pre-main-sequence and zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) stars. We find that, on average, diskless pre-main-sequence stars rotate faster than their disk-bearing counterparts. The stellar rotation distribution of the ZAMS stars is similar to evolved young clusters. We conclude that disk-locking may play a crucial role in the rotational velocity distribution of intermediate-mass early-type stars. We suggest that the observed wide stellar rotation distributions in many young clusters can occur in their early stages.

The spectral analysis of molecule-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars is challenging. Although other calcium and fluorine bearing molecules are observed in the microwave and in the visible spectrum of AGB stars, CaF has never been detected, despite favorable chemical equilibrium predictions. Yet, measuring the CaF abundance could give more insight into the fluorine budget of AGB stars and allow better simulation of stellar spectra. In this work, we present an analysis of the visible spectrum of CaF obtained with a Fourier transform spectrometer. CaF A2Π−X2Σ+ and B2Σ+−X2Σ+ band systems were excited with a hollow cathode discharge. Using previous fluorescence spectroscopy measurements, highly accurate ground state constants, and reasonable extrapolation schemes, the strongest features of CaF in the visible spectrum can be accurately modeled for both band systems. Spectroscopic constants are determined for A2 Π with v ≤ 16 and for B2Σ+ with v ≤ 20. Ab initio transition dipole moment curves of both transitions were calculated and scaled, and we provide a line list with Einstein A coefficients and oscillator strengths. This line list can be used to simulate spectra of CaF at temperatures and pressures relevant to astrophysical environments.

<title>The Theory of Resonant Cosmic Ray–driven Instabilities—Growth and Saturation of Single Modes</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Cosmic-ray (CR) feedback is critical for galaxy formation as CRs drive galactic winds, regularize star formation in galaxies, and escape from active galactic nuclei to heat the cooling cores of galaxy clusters. The feedback strength of CRs depends on their coupling to the background plasma and, as such, on the effective CR transport speed. Traditionally, this has been hypothesized to depend on the balance between the wave growth of CR-driven instabilities and their damping. Here, we study the physics of CR-driven instabilities from first principles, starting from a gyrotropic distribution of CR ions that stream along a background magnetic field. We develop a theory of the underlying processes that organize the particles’ orbits and in particular their gyrophases, which provides an intuitive physical picture of (i) wave growth as the CR gyrophases start to bunch up lopsidedly toward the local wave magnetic field, (ii) instability saturation as a result of CRs overtaking the wave and damping its amplitude without isotropizing CRs in the wave frame, and (iii) CR backreaction onto the unstable plasma waves as the CR gyrophases follow a pendulum motion around the wave magnetic field. Using our new fluid-particle-in-cell code fluid-SHARP, we validate our theory on the evolution and excitation of individual unstable modes, such as forward- and backward-propagating Alfvén and whistler waves. We show that these kinetic simulations support our theoretical considerations, thus potentially foreshadowing a revision of the theory of CR transport in galaxies and galaxy clusters.

<title>Exploring Simple-population and Multiple-population Globular Clusters in the Outer Galactic Halo Using the Hubble Space Telescope</title>

The pseudo two-color diagram, known as chromosome map (ChM), is a valuable tool for identifying globular clusters (GCs), which consist of single or multiple stellar populations (MPs). Recent surveys of Galactic GCs using ChMs have provided stringent observational constraints on the formation of GCs and their stellar populations. However, these surveys have primarily focused on GCs at moderate distances from the Galactic center and composed of MPs. In this paper, we present the first detailed study of the stellar composition of four GCs in the outer halo of the Milky Way: Arp 2, Ruprecht 106, Terzan 7, and Terzan 8. Our analysis is based on high-precision photometry obtained from images collected with the Hubble Space Telescope in the F275W, F336W, F438W, F606W, and F814W bands. We find that Ruprecht 106 and Terzan 7 are composed solely of a single stellar population, whereas Arp 2 and Terzan 8 host both first- and second-population stars. In these clusters, the second population comprises about half and one-third of the total number of GC stars, respectively. The results from this paper and the literature suggest that the threshold in the initial GC mass, if present, should be smaller than approximately 105M⊙. The first-population stars of Arp 2 and Terzan 8, along with the stars of the simple-population GCs Ruprecht 106 and Terzan 7, exhibit intrinsic F275W – F814W color spreads, likely indicative of [Fe/H] variations of approximately 0.05–0.30 dex. This suggests that star-to-star metallicity variations are a common feature of star clusters, regardless of the presence of MPs.

<title>Photospheric Swirls in a Quiet-Sun Region</title>

Swirl-shaped flow structures have been observed throughout the solar atmosphere, in both emission and absorption, at different altitudes and locations, and are believed to be associated with magnetic structures. However, the distribution patterns of such swirls, especially their spatial positions, remain unclear. Using the Automated Swirl Detection Algorithm, we identified swirls from the high-resolution photospheric observations, centered on Fe i 630.25 nm, of a quiet region near the Sun's central meridian by the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope. Via a detailed study of the locations of the detected small-scale swirls with an average radius of ~300 km, we found that most of them are located in lanes between mesogranules (which have an average diameter of ~5.4 Mm) instead of the commonly believed intergranular lanes. The squared rotation, expansion/contraction and vector speeds, and proxy kinetic energy are all found to follow Gaussian distributions. Their rotation speed, expansion/contraction speed, and circulation are positively correlated with their radius. All these results suggest that photospheric swirls at different scales and locations across the observational 56 5 × 57 5 field of view could share the same triggering mechanism at preferred spatial and energy scales. A comparison with our previous work suggests that the number of photospheric swirls is positively correlated with the number of local magnetic concentrations, stressing again the close relation between swirls and local magnetic concentrations: the number of swirls should positively correlate with the number and strength of local magnetic concentrations.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Considering radio-interferometric observations, we present a fast and efficient estimator to compute the binned angular bispectrum (ABS) from gridded visibility data. The estimator makes use of Fast Fourier Transform techniques to compute the ABS covering all possible triangle shapes and sizes. Here, we present the formalism of the estimator and validate it using simulated visibility data for the Murchison Widefield Array observations at ν = 154.25 MHz. We find that our estimator is able to faithfully recover the ABS of the simulated sky signal with ≈10%–15% accuracy for a wide variety of triangle shapes and sizes across the range of angular multipoles 46 ≤ ℓ ≤ 1320. In future work, we plan to apply this to actual data and also generalize it to estimate the three-dimensional redshifted 21 cm bispectrum.

<title>Predictions of Dust Continuum Emission from a Potential Circumplanetary Disk: A Case Study of the Planet Candidate AB Aurigae b</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Gas-accreting planets embedded in protoplanetary disks are expected to show dust thermal emission from their circumplanetary disks (CPDs). However, a recently reported gas-accreting planet candidate, AB Aurigae b, has not been detected in (sub)millimeter continuum observations. We calculate the evolution of dust in the potential CPD of AB Aurigae b and predict its thermal emission at 1.3 mm wavelength as a case study, where the obtained features may also be applied to other gas-accreting planets. We find that the expected flux density from the CPD is lower than the 3σ level of the previous continuum observation by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array with broad ranges of parameters, consistent with a nondetection. However, the expected planet mass and gas accretion rate are higher if the reduction of the observed near-infrared continuum and Hα line emission due to the extinction by small grains is considered, resulting in higher flux density of the dust emission from the CPD at (sub)millimeter wavelengths. We find that the corrected predictions of the dust emission are stronger than the 3σ level of the previous observation with the typical dust-to-gas mass ratio of the inflow to the CPD. This result suggests that the dust supply to the vicinity of AB Aurigae b is small if the planet candidate is not the scattered light of the star but is a planet and has a CPD. Future continuum observations at shorter wavelengths are required to obtain more robust clues to the question of whether the candidate is a planet or not.

<title>Prospects for Gamma-Ray Emission from Magnetar Regions in CTAO Observations</title>

Recent multiwavelength observations have highlighted magnetars as significant sources of cosmic rays, particularly through their gamma-ray emissions. This study examines three magnetar regions—CXOU J171405.7–31031, Swift J1834−0846, and SGR 1806−20—known for emitting detectable electromagnetic signals. We assess the detectability of these regions using the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) by conducting an ON/OFF spectral analysis and compare the expected results with existing observations. Our findings indicate that CTAO will detect gamma-ray emissions from these three magnetar regions with significantly reduced emission flux errors compared to current instruments. In particular, the study shows that the CXOUJ1714−3810 and SwiftJ1834−0846 magnetar regions can be observed by the full southern and northern CTAO arrays in just 5 hr of observation, with mean significances above 10σ and 30σ, respectively. This paper discusses the regions analyzed, presents key results, and concludes with insights drawn from the study.

<title>Type IV-like Solar Radio Burst Consisting of a Series of Short-time Bursts Observed by PSP</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Solar and interplanetary radio bursts can reflect the existence and motion of energetic electrons and are therefore a kind of vital phenomenon in solar activities. The present study reported a solar radio storm observed by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) in its eighth orbital encounter phase, and it lasted about 20 hr in a frequency range of 0.5–15 MHz, called the type IV-like burst. It consists of a series of numerous short-time (ST) bursts with the central frequency drifting slowly from ~5 to ~1 MHz, and each individual ST burst appears at a much faster frequency drifting rate and has a typical frequency range of a few MHz and a short duration of about 1–4 minutes. Based on the empirical models of the solar atmosphere adopted commonly, combining the in situ measurement by PSP, we analyzed and compared some possible mechanisms for the generation of these small-scale ST bursts and proposed that they were generated probably by a group of solitary kinetic Alfvén waves (SKAWs) in a magnetic loop accompanying coronal mass ejection and slowly moving outward, in which the frequency drifting of individual ST burst is caused by the SKAW's propagation and the central frequency drifting may be attributed to the motion of the magnetic loop.

<title>Epsilon Canis Majoris: The Brightest Extreme-ultraviolet Source with Surprisingly Low Interstellar Absorption</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9b8b</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The B2 star Epsilon Canis Majoris (ϵ CMa), at parallax distance d = 124 ± 2 pc, dominates the H i photoionization of the Local Interstellar Cloud. At its closer parallax distance compared to previous estimates, ϵ CMa has a 0.9 mag fainter absolute magnitude MV = −3.97 ± 0.04. We combine measurements of distance with the integrated flux f = (41.5 ± 3.3) × 10−6 erg cm−2 s−1 and angular diameter θd = 0.80 ± 0.05 mas to produce a consistent set of stellar parameters: radius R = 10.7 ± 0.7 R⊙, mass M = 13.1 ± 2.3 M⊙, gravity , effective temperature Teff ≈ 21,000 K, and luminosity L ≈ 20,000 L⊙. These parameters place ϵ CMa outside the β Cephei instability strip, consistent with its observed lack of pulsations. The observed extreme-ultraviolet spectrum yields a hydrogen photoionization rate ΓHI ≈ 10−15 s−1 (at Earth). The total flux decrement factor at the Lyman limit (ΔLL = 5000 ± 500) is a combination of attenuation in the stellar atmosphere (Δstar = 110 ± 10) and interstellar medium (ΔISM = 45 ± 5) with optical depth τLL = 3.8 ± 0.1. After correcting for interstellar H i column density NHI = (6 ± 1) × 1017cm−2, we find a stellar LyC photon flux ΦLyC ≈ 3000 cm−2 s−1 and ionizing luminosity QLyC = 1045.7±0.3 photons s−1. The photoionization rate ΓH ≈ (1–2) × 10−14 s−1 at the cloud surface produces an ionization fraction (30%–40%) for total hydrogen density nH = 0.2 cm−3. With its 27.3 ± 0.4 km s−1 heliocentric radial velocity and small proper motion, ϵ CMa passed within 9.3 ± 0.5 pc of the Sun 4.4 Myr ago, with a 180 times higher photoionization rate.

<title>Transients by Black Hole Formation from Red Supergiants: Impact of Dense Circumstellar Matter</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Failed supernovae (SNe), which are likely the main channel for forming stellar-mass black holes, are predicted to accompany mass ejections much weaker than typical core-collapse SNe. We conduct a grid of one-dimensional radiation hydrodynamical simulations to explore the emission of failed SNe from red supergiant progenitors, leveraging recent understanding of the weak explosion and the dense circumstellar matter (CSM) surrounding these stars. We find from these simulations and semianalytical modeling that diffusion in the CSM prolongs the early emission powered by shock breakout/cooling. The early emission has peak luminosities of ~107–108 L⊙ in optical and UV and durations of days to weeks. The presence of dense CSM aids in the detection of the early bright peak from these events via near-future wide-field surveys such as Rubin Observatory, ULTRASAT, and UVEX.

<title>Implication of Galaxy-scale Negative Feedback by One of the Most Powerful Multiphase Outflows in a Hyperluminous Infrared Galaxy at Intermediate Redshift</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad93ab</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Powerful galactic outflows driven by active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are commonly considered as one of the main mechanisms to regulate star formation in massive galaxies. Ultra- and hyperluminous IR galaxies (U/HyLIRGs) are thought to represent a transition phase of galaxies from a rapidly growing period to a quiescent status as gas is swept out by outflows, providing a laboratory in which to investigate outflows and their feedback effects on hosts. In this paper we report recent Gemini and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of a HyLIRG, J1126, at z = 0.46842, which has been identified with a puzzling coexistence of a fast ionized outflow (>2000 km s−1) and an intense starburst (star formation rate of 800 M⊙ yr−1). The Gemini observation shows the fast ionized outflow is extended to several kiloparsecs with a mass-loss rate of 180 M⊙ yr−1. A massive molecular outflow with a high mass-loss rate (2500 M⊙ yr−1) is revealed by ALMA. The multiphase outflows show large factors of momentum boost and loading of kinetic power, indicating a driving by the thermal pressure of a nuclear hot wind and/or the radiation pressure of a highly obscured AGN. In addition to ejection of kinetic energy, it is also found that the powerful outflow can induce an ionizing shock in the galaxy disk and enhance the excitation and dissociation of molecular gas. The powerful outflow probably results in an instantaneous negative feedback and shows potential to regulate host growth in the long term.

<title>Nebular and Nonthermal Radio Emissions for Young Stellar Populations with PARSEC v1.2s</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9901</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9901</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this paper, we compute, by means of the recently and thoroughly updated PARSE v1.2 s database of stellar nonrotating evolutionary tracks, the integrated stellar spectra, the ionizing photon budget, and the supernovae rates of young simple stellar populations (SSPs), for five metallicities between 0.0001 and 0.02 and four choices of stellar initial mass function (IMF) upper mass limits between 40 M⊙ and 350 M⊙. Using the photo-ionization code CLOUDY, we compute, at this same range of metallicities and limits, the intensities of some selected recombination and collisionally excited lines as a function of the age of the SSP. We account for the electron temperature dependence on IMF upper mass limit and metallicity while computing the thermal radio emission component, and also accounted for recent advances in core-collapse supernova explosion models while computing the nonthermal radio emission component. We self-consistently add the emission lines, nebular continuum, and nonthermal radio emission to the original SSP integrated photospheric spectra. Finally, from the resulting new suite of SSPs, we provide a consistent set of analytical relations between star formation rate (SFR) and ultraviolet, optical, and thermal radio luminosities that can be used to convert attenuation-corrected and dust-unaffected luminosities to SFR estimates. In a forthcoming paper, we will use our new SSP libraries as input to the state-of-the-art radiative transfer model GRAphites and SILicates to test the overall performance of these SSPs in reproducing the observed spectral energy distribution of young star-forming galaxies.

<title>Ionized Gas Outflows in the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) Survey: Signatures of AGN Feedback in Low-mass Galaxies</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9a57</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9a57</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a sample of 398 galaxies with ionized gas outflow signatures in their spectra from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly Survey Data Release 4, including 45 low-mass galaxies with stellar masses M* < 1010M⊙. We assemble our sample by systematically searching for the presence of a second velocity component in the [O iii]λλ4959, 5007 doublet emission line in 39,612 galaxies with redshifts z < 0.3. The host galaxies are classified using the Baldwin–Phillips–Terlevich diagram, with ~89% identified as active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and composites and 11% as star-forming (SF) galaxies. The outflows are typically faster in AGNs with a median velocity of 936 km s−1 compared to 655 km s−1 in the SF objects. Of particular interest are the 45 galaxies in the low-mass range, of which a third are classified as AGNs/composites. The outflows from the low-mass AGNs are also faster and more blueshifted compared to those in the low-mass SF galaxies. This indicates that black hole outflows can affect host galaxies in the low-mass range and that AGN feedback in galaxies with M* < 1010M⊙ should be considered in galaxy evolution models.

<title>PS1-11aop: Probing the Mass-loss History of a Luminous Interacting Supernova Prior to Its Final Eruption with Multiwavelength Observations</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9336</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Luminous interacting supernovae (SNe) are a class of stellar explosions whose progenitors underwent vigorous mass loss in the years prior to core collapse. While the mechanism by which this material is ejected is still debated, obtaining the full density profile of the circumstellar medium (CSM) could reveal more about this process. Here, we present an extensive multiwavelength study of PS1-11aop, a luminous and slowly declining Type IIn SNe discovered by the Pan-STARRS Medium Deep Survey. PS1-11aop had a peak r-band magnitude of −20.5 mag, a total radiated energy >8 × 1050 erg, and it exploded near the center of a star-forming galaxy with super-solar metallicity. We obtained multiple detections at the location of PS1-11aop in the radio and X-ray bands between 4 and 10 yr post-explosion, and if due to the supernova (SN), it is one of the most luminous radio SNe identified to date. Taken together, the multiwavelength properties of PS1-11aop are consistent with a CSM density profile with multiple zones. The early optical emission is consistent with the SN blastwave interacting with a dense and confined CSM shell, which contains multiple solar masses of material that was likely ejected in the final <10–100 yr prior to the explosion, (∼0.05−1.0 M⊙ yr−1 at radii of ≲1016 cm). The radio observations, on the other hand, are consistent with a sparser environment (≲2 × 10−3M⊙ yr−1 at radii of ∼0.5–1 × 1017 cm)—thus probing the history of the progenitor star prior to its final mass-loss episode.

<title>SN H0pe: The First Measurement of H 0 from a Multiply Imaged Type Ia Supernova, Discovered by JWST</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The first James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Near InfraRed Camera imaging in the field of the galaxy cluster PLCK G165.7+67.0 (z = 0.35) uncovered a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) at z = 1.78, called “SN H0pe.” Three different images of this one SN were detected as a result of strong gravitational lensing, each one traversing a different path in spacetime, thereby inducing a relative delay in the arrival of each image. Follow-up JWST observations of all three SN images enabled photometric and rare spectroscopic measurements of the two relative time delays. Following strict blinding protocols which oversaw a live unblinding and regulated postunblinding changes, these two measured time delays were compared to the predictions of seven independently constructed cluster lens models to measure a value for the Hubble constant, H0 = 71.8 + 9.2 − 8.1 km s−1 Mpc−1. The range of admissible H0 values predicted across the lens models limits further precision, reflecting the well-known degeneracies between lens model constraints and time delays. It has long been theorized that a way forward is to leverage a standard candle, but this has not been realized until now. For the first time, the lens models are evaluated by their agreement with the SN absolute magnifications, breaking degeneracies and producing our best estimate, H0 = km s−1 Mpc−1. This is the first precise measurement of H0 from a multiply imaged SN Ia and only the second from any multiply imaged SN.

<title>The S4G-WISE View of Global Star Formation in the Nearby Universe</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this work, we present source-tailored Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) mid-infrared photometry (at 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 23 μm) of 2812 galaxies in the extended Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies sample, and characterize the mid-infrared colors and dust properties of this legacy nearby galaxy data set. Informed by the relative emission between W3 (12 μm) and W4 (23 μm), we rederive star formation rate (SFR) scaling relations calibrated to LTIR, which results in improved agreement between the two tracers. By inverse–variance weighting the W3 and W4-derived SFRs, we generate a combined mid-infrared SFR that is a broadly robust measure of star formation activity in dusty, star-forming galaxies in the nearby Universe. In addition, we investigate the use of a W3-derived dust density metric, Σ12 μm (L⊙/kpc2), to estimate the SFR deficit of low mass, low dust galaxies. This is achieved by combining WISE with existing Galaxy Evolution Explorer ultraviolet (UV) photometry, which we further use to explore the relationship between dust and UV emission as a function of morphology. Finally, we use our derived SFR prescriptions to examine the location of galaxies in the log SFR–log Mstellar plane, as a function of morphological type, which underscores the complexity of dust-derived properties seen in galaxies of progressively earlier type.

<title>ALMA Survey of Orion Planck Galactic Cold Clumps (ALMASOP): Nested Morphological and Kinematic Structures of Outflows Revealed in SiO and CO Emission</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Survey of Orion Planck Galactic Cold Clumps (ALMASOP) reveals complex nested morphological and kinematic features of molecular outflows through the CO (J = 2−1) and SiO (J = 5−4) emission. We characterize the jet and outflow kinematics of the ALMASOP sample in four representative sources (HOPS 10, 315, 358, and G203.21-11.20W2) through channel maps and position–velocity diagrams (PVDs) parallel and transverse to the outflow axes. The combined CO and SiO emission exhibits the coexistence of the conventional extremely high-velocity jets and shell-like low-velocity cavity walls and new features. More complex, nested bubble-like and filamentary structures in the images and channel maps, triangle-shaped regions near the base of the parallel PVDs, and regions composed of rhombus/oval shapes in the transverse PVDs are also evident. Such features find natural explanations within the bubble structure of the unified model of jet, wind, and ambient medium. The reverse shock cavity is revealed on the PVD base regions, and other features naturally arise within the dynamic postshock region of magnetic interaction. The finer nested shells observed within the compressed wind region reveal previously unnoticed shocked emission between the jet and the conventional large cavity walls. These pseudopulse-produced filamentary features connect to the jetlike knotty blobs, creating an impression of episodicity in mass ejection. SiO emission is enhanced downstream of the reverse shock boundary, with jetlike excitation conditions. Combined, these observed features reveal the extended structures induced by the magnetic interplay between a jet-bearing magnetized wide-angle wind and its ambient magnetized surrounding medium.

<title>Blowing Out the Candle: How to Quench Galaxies at High Redshift—An Ensemble of Rapid Starbursts, AGN Feedback, and Environment</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9472</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Recent observations with JWST and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array have revealed extremely massive quiescent galaxies at redshifts of z = 3 and higher, indicating both rapid onset and quenching of star formation. Using the cosmological simulation suite Magneticum Pathfinder, we reproduce the observed number densities and stellar masses, with 36 quenched galaxies of stellar mass larger than 3 × 1010M⊙ at z = 3.42. We find that these galaxies are quenched through a rapid burst of star formation and subsequent active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback caused by a particularly isotropic collapse of surrounding gas, occurring on timescales of around 200 Myr or shorter. The resulting quenched galaxies host stellar components that are kinematically fast rotating and alpha-enhanced, while exhibiting a steeper metallicity and flatter age gradient compared to galaxies of similar stellar mass. The gas of the galaxies has been metal enriched and ejected. We find that quenched galaxies do not inhabit the densest nodes, but rather sit in local underdensities. We analyze observable metrics to predict future quenching at high redshifts, finding that on shorter timescales <500 Myr, the ratio Mbh/M* is the best predictor, followed by the burstiness of the preceding star formation, t50–t90 (time to go from 50% to 90% stellar mass). On longer timescales, >1 Gyr, the environment becomes the strongest predictor, followed by t50–t90, indicating that at high redshifts the consumption of old gas and lack of new gas are more relevant for long-term prevention of star formation than the presence of a massive AGN. We predict that relics of such high-z quenched galaxies should best be characterized by a strong alpha enhancement.

<title>The Optical Extinction Law Depends on Magnetic Field Orientation: The RV –ψ Relation</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9b9a</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9b9a</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
For aspherical interstellar dust grains aligned with their short axes preferentially parallel to the local magnetic field, the amount of extinction per grain is larger when the magnetic field is along the line of sight and smaller when in the plane of the sky. To the extent that optical extinction arises from both aligned and unaligned grain populations with different extinction properties, changes in the magnetic field orientation induce changes in its wavelength dependence, parameterized by RV ≡ AV/E(B − V). We demonstrate that the measured total and polarized extinction curves of the diffuse Galactic interstellar medium imply RV varies from 3.21 when the magnetic field is along the line of sight (ψ = 0) to RV = 3.05 when in the plane of the sky (ψ = 90°). This effect could therefore account for much of the large-scale RV variation observed across the sky (σ(RV) ≃ 0.2), particularly at high Galactic latitudes.

<title>Constraining the Gamma-Ray Burst Jet Opening Angle Based on the Very Steep Decay Phase</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Thanks to the rapid follow-up observations by the Swift X-Ray Telescope (XRT), a good part of gamma-ray bursts' (GRBs) high-latitude emission have been observed in the X-ray band. Some even show a dropdown decay after this period, which strongly indicates the edge of the jet is corresponding to the breaking time. This study constrains the jet opening angles of GRBs by analyzing the very steep decay phase in the early X-ray afterglow. Using data from Swift/XRT, we identified GRBs with significant breaks in their light curves and applied a broken power-law model to describe the decay phases. Assuming a spherical and isotropic emitting surface, we set constraints on the radiation radius (Rγ) to estimate jet opening angles (θjet) from the breaking time. Our results indicate that jet opening angles can be constrained, although they are sensitive to the assumed radiation radius. This approach provides yet another method for estimating GRB jet opening angles.

<title>Quadrupole Moment of a Magnetically Confined Mountain on an Accreting Neutron Star in General Relativity</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
General relativistic corrections are calculated for the quadrupole moment of a magnetically confined mountain on an accreting neutron star. The hydromagnetic structure of the mountain satisfies the general relativistic Grad–Shafranov equation supplemented by the flux-freezing condition of ideal magnetohydrodynamics, as in previous calculations of the magnetic dipole moment. It is found that the ellipticity, and hence the gravitational wave strain, are up to 12% greater than in the analogous Newtonian system. The direct contribution of the magnetic field to the nonaxisymmetric component of the stress-energy tensor is shown to be negligible in accreting systems such as low-mass X-ray binaries.

<title>Closing the Stellar Labels Gap: Stellar Label independent Evidence for [α/M] Information in Gaia BP/RP Spectra</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Data-driven models for stellar spectra that depend on stellar labels suffer from label systematics which decrease model performance: the stellar labels gap. To close the stellar labels gap, we present a stellar label independent model for Gaia BP/RP spectra. We develop a novel implementation of a variational auto-encoder, which learns to generate an XP spectrum and accompanying scatter without relying on stellar labels. We demonstrate that our model achieves competitive XP spectra reconstructions in comparison to stellar label dependent models. We find that our model learns stellar properties directly from the data itself. We then apply our model to XP/APOGEE giant stars to study the [α/M] information in Gaia XP. We provide strong evidence that the XP spectra contain meaningful [α/M] information by demonstrating that our model learns the α-bimodality, without relying on stellar label correlations for stars with Teff < 5000 K, while also being sensitive to the anomalous abundances of Gaia-Enceladus stars. We have publicly released our trained model, codebase and data. Importantly, our stellar label independent model can be implemented for any and all XP spectra because our model's performance scales with training object density, not training label density.

<title>Testing the Cosmic Distance Duality Relation Using Strong Gravitational Lensing Time Delays and Type Ia Supernovae</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a comprehensive test of the cosmic distance duality relation (DDR) using a combination of strong gravitational lensing (SGL) time delay measurements and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) data. We investigate three different parameterizations of potential DDR violations. To bridge the gap between SGL and SNe Ia data sets, we implement an artificial neural network approach to reconstruct the distance modulus of SNe Ia. Our analysis uniquely considers both scenarios where the absolute magnitude of SNe Ia (MB) is treated as a free parameter and where it is fixed to a Cepheid-calibrated value. Using a sample of six SGL systems and the Pantheon+ SNe Ia data set, we find no statistically significant evidence for DDR violations across all parameterizations. The consistency of our findings across different parameterizations not only reinforces confidence in the standard DDR but also demonstrates the robustness of our analytical approach.

<title>Gravitational-wave Dark Siren Cosmology Systematics from Galaxy Weighting</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The detection of GW170817 and the measurement of its redshift from the associated electromagnetic counterpart provided the first gravitational-wave (GW) determination of the Hubble constant (H0), demonstrating the potential power of standard siren cosmology. In contrast to this “bright siren” approach, the “dark siren” approach can be utilized for GW sources in the absence of an electromagnetic counterpart: One considers all galaxies contained within the localization volume as potential hosts. When statistically averaging over the potential host galaxies, weighting them by physically motivated properties (e.g., tracing star formation or stellar mass) could improve convergence. Using mock galaxy catalogs, we explore the impact of these weightings on the measurement of H0. We find that incorrect weighting schemes can lead to significant biases due to two effects: the assumption of an incorrect galaxy redshift distribution, and preferentially weighting incorrect host galaxies during the inference. The magnitudes of these biases are influenced by the number of galaxies along each line of sight, the measurement uncertainty in the GW luminosity distance, and correlations in the parameter space of galaxies. We show that the bias may be overcome from improved localization constraints in future GW detectors, a strategic choice of priors or weighting prescription, and by restricting the analysis to a subset of high-signal-to-noise ratio events. We propose the use of hierarchical inference as a diagnostic of incorrectly weighted prescriptions. Such approaches can simultaneously infer the correct weighting scheme and the values of the cosmological parameters, thereby mitigating the bias in dark siren cosmology due to incorrect host-galaxy weighting.

<title>A Cosmic Ray Acceleration Mechanism Based on Background Flow Velocity Inhomogeneities Yielding Power-law Spectra</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In astrophysics, one significant challenge lies in understanding the acceleration of cosmic rays, which leads to the occurrence of a power law. In this article, momentum transport generated by the combined effects of pitch-angle diffusion and background flow velocity inhomogeneities is proposed to obtain a cosmic rays acceleration mechanism, starting from the well-known focused transport equation describing particle diffusion and acceleration. The inhomogeneities of background flow velocity are ubiquitous in the astrophysical environment. The equation for the isotropic part of the distribution function of charged energetic particles is derived, and its solution is obtained, demonstrating the form of momentum power laws of cosmic rays. In addition, if it is assumed that cosmic rays penetrate compressive MHD waves or turbulence, for quasi-steady states, the spectral index δ of the momentum power law spectrum of cosmic rays is found to be in the range [−5, −3], which includes the observed power law indices of galactic cosmic rays. The results obtained in this article demonstrate that the mechanism proposed in this article, along with shock acceleration, may also contribute to the acceleration of galactic cosmic rays. Furthermore, when momentum convection effect and higher-order momentum derivative terms are considered, the indices of power laws should be smaller than −5. This may explain the power laws of solar energetic particle events.

<title>The Effect of Galaxy Interactions on Starbursts in Milky Way-mass Galaxies in FIRE Simulations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Simulations and observations suggest that galaxy interactions may enhance the star formation rate (SFR) in merging galaxies. One proposed mechanism is the torque exerted on the gas and stars in the larger galaxy by the smaller galaxy. We analyze the interaction torques and star formation activity on six galaxies from the FIRE-2 simulation suite with masses comparable to the Milky Way galaxy at redshift z = 0. We trace the halos from z = 3.6 to z = 0, calculating the torque exerted by the nearby galaxies on the gas in the central galaxy. We calculate the correlation between the torque and the SFR across the simulations for various mass ratios. For near-equal-stellar-mass-ratio interactions in the galaxy sample, occurring between z = 1.2−3.6, there is a positive and statistically significant correlation between the torque from nearby galaxies on the gas of the central galaxies and the SFR. For all other samples, no statistically significant correlation is found between the torque and the SFR. Our analysis shows that some, but not all, major interactions cause starbursts in the simulated Milky Way-mass galaxies, and that most starbursts are not caused by galaxy interactions. The transition from “bursty” at high redshift (z ≳ 1) to “steady” star formation state at later times is independent of the interaction history of the galaxies, and most of the interactions do not leave significant imprints on the overall trend of the star formation history of the galaxies.

<title>On the Existence of Long-period Decayless Oscillations in Short Active Region Loops</title>

Decayless kink oscillations, characterized by their lack of decay in amplitude, have been detected in coronal loops of varying scales in active regions, the quiet Sun, and coronal holes. Short-period (<50 s) decayless oscillations have been detected in short loops (< 50 Mm) within active regions. Nevertheless, long-period decayless oscillations in these loops remain relatively unexplored and crucial for understanding the wave modes and excitation mechanisms of decayless oscillations. We present the statistical analysis of decayless oscillations from two active regions observed by the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager onboard Solar Orbiter. The average loop length and period of the detected oscillations are 19 Mm and 151 s, respectively. We find 82 long-period and 23 short-period oscillations in these loops. We do not obtain a significant correlation between loop length and period. We discuss the possibility of different wave modes in short loops, although standing waves cannot be excluded from possible wave modes. Furthermore, a different branch exists for active region short loops in the loop length versus period relation, similar to decayless waves in short loops in the quiet Sun and coronal holes. The magnetic fields derived from MHD seismology, based on standing kink modes, show lower values for multiple oscillations compared to previous estimates for long loops in active regions. Additionally, the comparison of period distributions in short loops across different coronal regions indicates that different excitation mechanisms may trigger short-period kink oscillations in active regions compared to the quiet Sun and coronal holes.

<title>A uGMRT and MeerKAT Study of Radio Relics in the Low-mass Merging Cluster PSZ2 G200.95−28.16</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Diffuse radio sources known as radio relics are direct tracers of shocks in the outskirts of merging galaxy clusters. PSZ2 G200.95–28.16, a low-mass merging cluster (M500 = (2.7 ± 0.2) × 1014M⊙), features a prominent radio relic, first identified by R. Kale et al. We name this relic as the Seahorse. The MeerKAT Galaxy Cluster Legacy Survey has confirmed two additional radio relics, R2 and R3, in this cluster. We present new observations of this cluster with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) at 400 and 650 MHz, paired with Chandra X-ray data. The largest linear sizes for the three relics are 1.53 Mpc, 1.12 kpc, and 340 kpc. All three radio relics are polarized at 1283 MHz. Assuming the diffusive shock acceleration model, the spectral indices of the relics imply shock Mach Numbers of 3.1 ± 0.8 and 2.8 ± 0.9 for the Seahorse and R2, respectively. The Chandra X-ray surface brightness map shows two prominent subclusters, but the relics are not perpendicular to the likely merger axis, as typically observed; no shocks are detected at the locations of the relics. We discuss possible merger scenarios in light of the low mass of the cluster and the radio and X-ray properties of the relics. The relic R2 follows the correlation known in the radio relic power and cluster-mass plane, but the Seahorse and R3 relics are outliers. We have also discovered a radio ring in our 650 MHz uGMRT image that could be an Odd Radio Circle candidate.

<title>Probing Cosmic Isotropy with the FAST All Sky H i Survey</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9922</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This paper leverages the first released catalog from the FAST All Sky H i Survey (FASHI) to examine the hypothesis of cosmic isotropy in the local Universe. Given the design of the overall FAST survey, the inhomogeneous detection sensitivity of FASHI is likely to introduce significant biases in the statistical properties of the catalog. To mitigate the potential influence of spurious clustering effects due to these sensitivity variations, we focus on extragalactic H i sources within the sensitivity range of [0.65, 1.0]. This refined subsample is divided into 10 distinct sky regions, for which we compute the two-point angular correlation functions (2PACF) over angular scales of 0 5 < θ < 10°. We apply the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to fit these 2PACFs with a power-law model and assess the statistical significance of the best-fit parameters for the 10 FASHI sky regions by comparing them against results from mock catalogs generated under the assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy. Our findings indicate that the local Universe, as traced by the H i sources in the FASHI survey, aligns with the cosmic isotropy hypothesis within a 2σ confidence level. We do not detect any statistically significant deviations from cosmic isotropy in the FASHI survey data.

<title>PKS 2332–017 and PMN J1916–1519: Candidate Blazar Counterparts to Two High-energy Neutrino Events</title>

We report our counterpart identification study for two high-energy neutrino events IC-130127A and IC-131204A listed in the IceCube Event Catalog of Alert Tracks. These two events belong to Gold alerts, which have a significant probability of being of astrophysical origin. Within the events’ 90% positional uncertainty regions, we, respectively, find PKS 2332–017 and PMN J1916–1519. The first source is a flat-spectrum radio quasar at redshift z = 1.18, and the second is a blazar of an uncertain type with photometric z = 0.968. As they correspondingly had a γ-ray flare temporally coincident with the arrival times of IC-130127A and IC-131204A, we identify them as the respective neutrino emitters. Detailed analysis of the γ-ray data for the two blazars, obtained with the Large Area Telescope onboard the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, is conducted. The two flares, respectively, from PKS 2332–017 and PMN J1916–1519 lasted ~4 yr and ~4 months and showed possible emission hardening by containing high-energy ~2–10 GeV photons in the emissions. Accompanying the flare of PKS 2332–017, optical and mid-infrared brightening variations were also observed. We discuss the properties of the two sources and compare the properties with those of the previously reported (candidate) neutrino-emitting blazars.

<title>Determining the Nature of IC 10 X-2: A Comprehensive Study of the Optical/IR Emission from an Extragalactic BeHMXB</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad82df</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad82df</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a comprehensive analysis of the optical and infrared (IR) properties of high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) IC 10 X-2, classified as a supergiant HMXB and superfast X-ray transient by previous work. Our analysis of regular (daily and weekly) observations by both the Zwicky Transient Facility and Las Cumbres Observatory over a 5 yr period indicates both periodic flares and variations in the apparent magnitude and color with a period of ∼26.5 days—likely the orbital period of this binary system. The periodic flaring suggests the stellar companion is a Be star, with flares resulting from increased accretion onto the neutron star (NS) when it enters the stellar decretion disk. The periodic variations in the optical/IR brightness and color likely result from orbital variations in the hydrogen column density along the line of sight or a transient accretion disk around the NS. Lastly, the numerous short-duration episodes where IC 10 X-2 is significantly “redder” or “bluer” than normal likely result from clumps within this system—which can accrete onto the NS (causing IC 10 X-2 to appear bluer) or pass through the line of sight (causing IC 10 X-2 to appear redder). These results substantially increase our understanding of the evolution of this source, which is a significant source of ionizing photons in its host galaxy IC 10, a low-mass, metal-poor starburst galaxy similar in many respects to those thought to be common in the early Universe.

<title>The Deuterium Fractionation of NH3 in Massive Star-forming Regions</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8444</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Deuteration is sensitive to environmental conditions in star-forming regions. To investigate NH2D chemistry, we compared the spatial distribution of ortho-NH2D , NH3(1,1), and NH3(2,2) in 12 late-stage massive star-forming regions. By averaging several pixels along the spatial slices of ortho-NH2D , we obtained the deuterium fractionation of NH3. In seven targets, the deuterium fractionation of NH3 shows a decreasing trend with increasing rotational temperature. This trend is less clear in the remaining five sources, likely due to limited spatial resolution. However, when considering all 12 sources together, the anticorrelation between NH3 deuterium fractionation and rotational temperature becomes less significant, suggesting that other physical parameters may influence the fractionation. Additionally, we found that the region of highest deuterium fractionation of NH3 is offset from the NH3 peak in each source, likely because the temperature is higher near the NH3 peaks and NH2D may be depleted from the gas phase as the molecular cloud core evolves, as well as the increased release of CO from grains into the gas phase.

<title>The NANOGrav 15 Yr Data Set: Removing Pulsars One by One from the Pulsar Timing Array</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Evidence has emerged for a stochastic signal correlated among 67 pulsars within the 15 yr pulsar-timing data set compiled by the NANOGrav collaboration. Similar signals have been found in data from the European, Indian, Parkes, and Chinese pulsar timing arrays. This signal has been interpreted as indicative of the presence of a nanohertz stochastic gravitational-wave background (GWB). To explore the internal consistency of this result, we investigate how the recovered signal strength changes as we remove the pulsars one by one from the data set. We calculate the signal strength using the (noise-marginalized) optimal statistic, a frequentist metric designed to measure the correlated excess power in the residuals of the arrival times of the radio pulses. We identify several features emerging from this analysis that were initially unexpected. The significance of these features, however, can only be assessed by comparing the real data to synthetic data sets. After conducting identical analyses on simulated data sets, we do not find anything inconsistent with the presence of a stochastic GWB in the NANOGrav 15 yr data. The methodologies developed here can offer additional tools for application to future, more sensitive data sets. While this analysis provides an internal consistency check of the NANOGrav results, it does not eliminate the necessity for additional investigations that could identify potential systematics or uncover unmodeled physical phenomena in the data.

<title>The Long-term Evolution of the Solar Transition Region</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Long-term evolution characteristics of the solar transition region have been unclear. In this study, daily images of the solar full disk derived from the observations by the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly at 304 Å wavelength from 2011 January 1 to 2022 December 31 are used to investigate the long-term evolution of the solar transition region. It is found that long-term variation in the transition region of the full disk is in phase with the solar activity cycle, and thus the polar brightening should occur in the maximum epoch of the solar cycle. Long-term variation of the background transition region is found to be likely in antiphase with the solar activity cycle at middle and low latitudes. The entire transition region, especially the active transition region is inferred to be mainly heated by the active-region magnetic fields and the ephemeral-region magnetic fields, while the quieter transition region is believed to be mainly heated by network magnetic fields. Long-term evolution characteristics of various types of the magnetic fields at the solar surface are highly consistent with these findings, and thus provide an explanation for them.

<title>Comparison of the Origin of Short Gamma-Ray Bursts with or without Extended Emission</title>

The merger of compact binary stars produces short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs), involving channels such as neutron star–neutron star (BNS) and neutron star–black hole (NS–BH). The association between sGRB 170817A and gravitational wave GW170817 provides reliable evidence for the BNS channel. Some speculations suggest that sGRBs with extended emission (EE) may represent another distinct population. The offset is the distance between the GRB sky localization and the host galaxy center. We compared the offset distributions of these two types of samples (46 sGRBs with EE and 9 without EE samples) and found that they follow the same distribution. Utilizing nonparametric methods, we examined the luminosity function and formation rate of sGRBs without any assumptions. The luminosity function can be described as for ( and for ) for sGRBs without EE and for ( and for ) for sGRBs with EE. The formation rate is characterized as ρ(z) ∝ (1 + z)−3.04±0.10 for z < 1 and as ρ(z) ∝ (1 + z)−0.29±0.38 for 1 < z < 3 for sGRBs without EE, while for sGRBs with EE, it is ρ(z) ∝ (1 + z)−3.85±0.15 for z < 1 and ρ(z) ∝ (1 + z)−0.40±1.11 for 1 < z < 3. Our findings suggest no significant difference in the progenitors of sGRBs with and without EE when considered in terms of spatial offsets, formation rates, and luminosity function.

<title>Detectability of Self-lensing Flares of White Dwarfs with Compact Companions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Binaries containing compact objects, viewed nearly edge on, can produce periodic brightening events under certain conditions on the masses, radii, and binary separation. Such flares are caused by one object gravitationally lensing another, in what is known as self-lensing flares. We present a simulation tool that efficiently reproduces the main features of self-lensing flares and facilitates a detection sensitivity analysis for various sky surveys. We estimate the detection prospects for a handful of representative surveys when searching for systems of either two white dwarfs or a white dwarf with other compact objects, i.e., neutron stars and black holes. We find only a marginal ability to detect such systems in existing surveys. However, we estimate many such systems could be detectable by surveys in the near future, including the Vera Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We provide a quantitative analysis of the detectability of double-compact object self-lensing flares across the landscape of system parameters, and a qualitative discussion of survey and follow-up approaches to distinguish such flares from confounding events, such as stellar flares, satellite glints, and cosmic rays. We estimate 0.3, 3 and 247 double white dwarf systems could be detected by Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, Zwicky Transient Facility, and LSST, respectively. A similar number of systems with a neutron star or black hole companion could be detected, but we caution that the number densities of such binaries is model dependent and so are our detection estimates. Such binaries can be used to constrain models of the end states of binary evolution.

<title>The Size of Accretion Disks from Self-consistent X-Ray Spectra and UV/Optical/NIR Photometry Fitting: Applications to ASASSN–14li and HLX–1</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We implement a standard thin disk model with the outer disk radius (Rout) as a free parameter, integrating it into a standard X-ray fitting package to enable self-consistent and simultaneous fitting of X-ray spectra and Ultraviolet (UV), Optical, and Near-infrared (NIR) photometry. We apply the model to the late-time data (Δt ≈ 350–1300 days) of the tidal disruption event (TDE) ASASSN–14li. We show that at these late times, the multiwavelength emission of the source can be fully described by a bare compact accretion disk. We obtain a black hole mass (MBH) of , consistent with host-galaxy scaling relations, and an Rout of 45 ± 13 Rg, consistent with the circularization radius, with possible expansion at the latest epoch. We discuss how simplistic models, such as a single-temperature blackbody fitted to either X-ray spectra or UV/optical photometry, lead to erroneous interpretations of the scale/energetics of TDE emission. We also apply the model to the soft/high state of the intermediate-mass black hole candidate HLX–1. The model fits the full spectral energy distribution (from X-rays to NIR) without needing an additional stellar population component. We investigate how relativistic effects improve our results by implementing a version of the model with full ray tracing calculations in the Kerr metric. For HLX–1, we find and Rout ≈ few × 103Rg, in agreement with previous findings. The relativistic model can constrain the inclination (i) of HLX–1 to be 10° ≤ i ≤70°.

<title>Characterizing Stellar and Gas Properties in NGC 628: Spatial Distributions, Radial Gradients, and Resolved Scaling Relations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Building on our previous research involving multiwavelength data from UV to IR, we employ spectroscopic observations of ionized gas, as well as neutral hydrogen gas obtained from the Five-hundred Meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST), to explore the intrinsic processes of star formation and chemical enrichment within NGC 628. Our analysis focuses on several key properties, including gas-phase extinction, star formation rate (SFR) surface density, oxygen abundance, and H i mass surface density. The azimuthal distributions of these parameters in relation to the morphological and kinematic features revealed by FAST H i reveal that NGC 628 is an isolated galaxy that has not undergone recent interactions. We observe a mild radial extinction gradient accompanied by a notable dispersion. The SFR surface density also shows a gentle radial gradient, characteristic of typical spiral galaxies. Additionally, we find a negative radial metallicity gradient of −0.44 dex , supporting the “inside-out” scenario of galaxy formation. We investigate the resolved mass–metallicity relation (MZR) and the resolved star formation main sequence (SFMS) alongside their dependences on the physical properties of both ionized and neutral hydrogen gas. Our findings indicate no secondary dependence of the resolved MZR on SFR surface density or H i mass surface density. Furthermore, we observe that gas-phase extinction and the equivalent width of Hα both increase with SFR surface density in the resolved SFMS.

We present JWST NIRCam imaging targeting 13 z ~ 3 infrared-luminous (LIR ∼ 5 × 1012L⊙) galaxies from the ALESS survey with uniquely deep, high-resolution (0 08–0 16) Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array 870 μm imaging. The 2.0–4.4 μm (observed frame) NIRCam imaging reveals the rest-frame near-infrared stellar emission in these submillimeter-selected galaxies at the same (sub)kiloparsec resolution as the 870 μm dust continuum. The newly revealed stellar morphologies show striking similarities with the dust continuum morphologies at 870 μm, with the centers and position angles agreeing for most sources, clearly illustrating that the spatial offsets reported previously between the 870 μm and Hubble Space Telescope morphologies were due to strong differential dust obscuration. The F444W sizes are 78% ± 21% larger than those measured at 870 μm, in contrast to recent results from hydrodynamical simulations that predict larger 870 μm sizes. We report evidence for significant dust obscuration in F444W for the highest-redshift sources, emphasizing the importance of longer-wavelength MIRI imaging. The majority of the sources show evidence that they are undergoing mergers/interactions, including tidal tails/plumes—some of which are also detected at 870 μm. We find a clear correlation between NIRCam colors and 870 μm surface brightness on ∼1 kpc scales, indicating that the galaxies are primarily red due to dust—not stellar age—and we show that the dust structure on ∼kpc scales is broadly similar to that in nearby galaxies. Finally, we find no strong stellar bars in the rest-frame near-infrared, suggesting the extended bar-like features seen at 870 μm are highly obscured and/or gas-dominated structures that are likely early precursors to significant bulge growth.

<title>A New Approach to Constraining Properties of Active Galactic Nucleus Host Galaxies by Combining Image and Spectral Energy Distribution Decomposition: Testing upon the M BH–M ⋆ Relation</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9aa3</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The outshining light from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) poses significant challenges in studying the properties of AGN host galaxies. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach that combines image decomposition and spectral energy distribution (SED) decomposition to constrain the properties of AGN host galaxies. Image decomposition allows us to disentangle optical flux into AGN and stellar components, thereby providing additional constraints on the SED models to derive a more refined stellar mass. To test the viability of this approach, we obtained a sample of 24 X-ray-selected type I AGNs with redshifts ranging from 0.73 to 2.47. We estimated the stellar masses for our sample and found that our results are generally consistent with earlier estimates based on different methods. Through examining the posterior distribution of stellar masses, we find that our method could derive better-constrained results compared to previous SED decomposition methods. With the derived stellar masses, we further studied the MBH–M⋆ relation of our sample, finding a higher intrinsic scatter in the correlation for our entire sample compared to the local quiescent correlation, which could be caused by a few “black hole monsters” in our sample. We propose that, based on our method, future works could extend to larger samples of high-redshift AGN host galaxies, thereby enhancing our understanding of their properties.

<title>SN 2014C: A Metamorphic Supernova Exploded in the Intricate and Hydrogen-rich Surroundings</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9c76</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of supernova (SN) SN 2014C, primarily emphasizing the initial month after the explosion at approximately daily intervals. During this time, it was classified as a Type Ib SN exhibiting a notably higher peak luminosity (Lpeak ≈ 4.3 × 1042 erg s−1), a faster rise to brightness (trise ≈ 11.6 days), and a more gradual dimming ( mag) compared to typical Type Ib SNe. Analysis of the velocity evolution over the first ~20 days after the explosion supports the view that the absorption near 6200 Å is due to high-velocity Hα in the outer layers of the ejecta, indicating the presence of a small amount of hydrogen in the envelope of the progenitor before the explosion. Assuming that the peak luminosity is entirely attributed to radioactive decay, we estimate that 0.14 M⊙ of 56Ni was synthesized in the explosion. However, this amount of nickel could no longer maintain observed brightness approximately 10 days after peak luminosity, suggesting additional energy sources beyond radioactive decay. This supplementary energy likely originates from interaction with the circumstellar medium (CSM). Consequently, the timing of the SN−CSM interaction in SN 2014C may occur much earlier than the emergence of Type IIn−like features during the nebular phase.

<title>Constraining Anisotropic Diffusion between Geminga and Earth with the Cosmic-Ray Electron and Positron Spectrum</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The gamma-ray halo around Geminga indicates significant suppression of cosmic-ray diffusion. One possible explanation for this phenomenon is the projection effect of slow diffusion perpendicular to the mean magnetic field (characterized by the diffusion coefficient D⊥) within an anisotropic diffusion framework. In this scenario, the diffusion coefficient parallel to the mean field (D∥) can still be large, enabling electrons and positrons (e±) produced by Geminga to efficiently travel to Earth along the magnetic field lines, possibly resulting in a detectable e± flux. In this work, we first determine the basic parameters of the anisotropic model using the morphology and spectral measurements of the Geminga halo and then predict the flux of e± produced by Geminga at the location of Earth. We find that the e− + e+ spectrum of DAMPE can give crucial constraint on the anisotropic diffusion model: to ensure that the predicted spectrum does not exceed the measurements, the Alfvén Mach number of the turbulent magnetic field (MA) should not be less than 0.75, corresponding to D∥/D⊥ ≲ 3 given that . This implies that a significant suppression of D∥ relative to the average value in the Galaxy may still be necessary. Furthermore, we find that under the anisotropic diffusion model, Geminga can produce a very sharp feature around 1 TeV in the e− + e+ spectrum, which could naturally explain the peculiar 1.4 TeV excess tentatively observed by DAMPE.

<title>H i Intensity Mapping Cross-correlation with Thermal Sunyaev–Zel’dovich Fluctuations: Forecasted Cosmological Parameter Estimation for FAST and Planck</title>

The 21 cm emission from neutral hydrogen surveys holds great potential as a valuable method for exploring the large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe. In this paper, we forecast for the cross-correlation between the thermal Sunyaev–Zel’dovich (SZ) fluctuations as probed by the Planck satellite and fluctuations in the H i brightness temperature as probed by the ground-based Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope to trace the connection between galaxy clusters and the H i LSS. Assuming that the measurement is limited by instrumental noise rather than by foreground, we estimate the potential detectability of the cross-correlation signal and the improvement in the measurement of the H i cosmic density, the hydrostatic mass bias parameter, and the universal pressure profile parameters. We obtain a constraint on the cosmic neutral hydrogen density parameter significantly to σ(ΩH I) = 1.0 × 10−6. We also find that the average halo masses contributing to the H i − y cross-power spectrum in the one-halo regime is ∼1.5 × 1014M⊙. Our results also show that the H i–SZ cross-correlation has great potential to probe the distribution of neutral hydrogen (H i) within halos at low redshift.

<title>Dwarf Galaxies with Radio-excess Active Galactic Nuclei in the Very Large Array Sky Survey</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a systematic search for radio active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in dwarf galaxies using recent observations taken by the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS). To select these objects, we first establish a criterion to identify radio-excess AGNs using the infrared-radio correlation parameter, q, that describes the tight relation between radio and IR emission in star-forming galaxies. We find a 2σ threshold of q < 1.94 to select radio-excess AGNs, which is derived from a sample of ∼7000 galaxies across the full mass range in the NASA-Sloan Atlas that have radio and IR detections from VLASS and the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer, respectively. We create catalogs of radio-excess AGNs and star-forming galaxies and make these available to the community. Applying our criterion to dwarf galaxies with stellar masses M⋆ ≲ 3 × 109 M⊙ and redshifts z ≤ 0.15, and carefully removing interlopers, we find 10 radio-excess AGNs with radio-optical positional offsets between ∼0″ and 2.′3 (0–2.7 kpc). Based on statistical arguments and emission line diagnostics, we expect the majority of these radio-excess AGNs to be associated with the dwarf host galaxies rather than background AGNs. Five of the objects have evidence for hosting AGNs at other wavelengths, and five objects are identified as AGNs in dwarf galaxies for the first time. We also identify eight variable radio sources in dwarf galaxies by comparing the VLASS epoch 1 and epoch 2 observations to Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-centimeters detections presented in A. E. Reines et al. (2020).

<title>Dependence of SYMH Change Rate on Dynamic Pressure during the Main Phases of Storms: A Comparative Analysis of the 2024 May and 2003 November Superstorms</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We denote the variation in the SYMH index during the main phase of a geomagnetic storm as ΔSYMH and the duration of the storm's main phase as Δt. The ratio ΔSYMH/Δt represents the averaged rate of change of the ring current throughout the main phase of the storm. We analyzed the ΔSYMH/Δt ratios during the main phases of the 2024 May superstorm (referred to as storm1) and the 2003 November superstorm (referred to as storm2), followed by a comparison of the solar wind parameters that significantly influenced the main phases of these two events. We discovered that the ΔSYMH/Δt ratio for storm1 exceeded that of storm2. Additionally, the time integral of the solar wind electric field during the main phase of storm1 was less than that of storm2, which suggests that ΔSYMH/Δt is not solely determined by the solar wind electric field. Our findings also indicated that the average dynamic pressure during the main phase of storm1 was larger than that of storm2, highlighting the significance of dynamic pressure as a key parameter in influencing the variation of the ring current during the main phase of a geomagnetic storm.

<title>Radio Follow-up Observations of SN 2023ixf by Japanese and Korean Very Long Baseline Interferometers</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report on radio follow-up observations of the nearby Type II supernova SN 2023ixf, spanning from 1.7 to 269.9 days after the explosion, conducted using three very long baseline interferometers (VLBIs), which are the Japanese VLBI Network, the VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry, and the Korean VLBI Network. In three observation epochs (152.3, 206.1, and 269.9 days), we detected emission at the 6.9 and 8.4 GHz bands, with a flux density of ~5 mJy. The flux density reached a peak at around 206.1 days, which is longer than the timescale to reach the peak observed in typical Type II supernovae. Based on an analytical model of radio emission, our late-time detections were inferred to be due to decreasing optical depth. In this case, the mass-loss rate of the progenitor is estimated to have increased from ~10−6–10−5M⊙ yr−1 to ~10−4M⊙ yr−1 between 28 and 6 yr before the explosion. Our radio constraints are also consistent with the mass-loss rate needed to produce a confined circumstellar medium proposed by previous studies, which suggest that the mass-loss rate increased from ~10−4M⊙ yr−1 to ≳10−2M⊙ yr−1 in the last few years before the explosion.

<title>Spherical Accretion in the Schwarzschild Spacetime in the Newtonian Analogous Construct</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The velocity-dependent Newtonian analogous potentials (NAPs) corresponding to general relativistic (GR) spacetimes accurately capture most of the relativistic features, including all classical tests of GR, effectively representing spacetime geometries in Newtonian terms. The NAP formulated by Tejeda & Rosswog (TR13) for Schwarzschild spacetime has been applied to the standard thin accretion disk around a black hole (BH) as well as in the context of streamlines of noninteracting particles accreting onto a Schwarzschild BH, showing good agreement with the exact relativistic solutions. As a further application, here we explore the extent to which TR13 NAP could describe a transonic hydrodynamical spherical accretion flow in Schwarzschild spacetime within the framework of standard Newtonian hydrodynamics. Instead of obtaining a typical single “saddle-type” sonic transition, a “saddle–spiral pair” is produced, with the inner sonic point being an (unphysical) “spiral type” and the outer being a usual “saddle type.” The Bondi accretion rate at outer sonic radii, however, remains consistent with that of the GR case. The primary reason for the deviation of our findings from the classical Bondi solution is likely due to the inconsistency between the Euler-type equation in the presence of velocity-dependent TR13 NAP within the standard Newtonian hydrodynamics framework, and the corresponding GR Euler equation, regardless of the fluid’s energy. Our study suggests that a (modified) hydrodynamical formalism is needed to effectively implement such potentials in transonic accretion studies that align with the spirit of TR13 like NAP, while remaining consistent with the GR hydrodynamics. This could then essentially circumvent GR hydrodynamics or GR magnetohydrodynamics equations

<title>Chemical Fingerprints of M Dwarfs: High-resolution Spectroscopy on 31 M Dwarfs with SPIRou</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We extend the methodology introduced by F. Jahandar et al. to determine the effective temperature and chemical abundances of 31 slowly rotating solar neighborhood M dwarfs (M1–M5) using high-resolution spectra from CFHT/SPIRou. This group includes 10 M dwarfs in binary systems with FGK primaries of known metallicity from optical measurements. By testing our Teff method on various synthetic models, we find a consistent inherent synthetic uncertainty of ∼10 K at a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 100. Additionally, we find that our results align with interferometric measurements, showing a consistent residual of −29 ± 31 K. Taking the inherent uncertainties into account, we infer the Teff values of our targets and find an excellent agreement with previous optical and near-infrared studies. Our high-resolution chemical analysis examines hundreds of absorption lines using χ2 minimization using PHOENIX-ACES stellar atmosphere models. We present elemental abundances for up to 10 different elements, including refractory elements such as Si, Mg, and Fe, which are important for modeling the interior structure of exoplanets. In binary systems, we find an average [Fe/H] of −0.15 ± 0.08 for M dwarfs, marginally lower than the reported metallicity of −0.06 ± 0.18 for the FGK primaries from A. W. Mann et al. We also observe slightly subsolar chemistry for various elements in our nonbinary M dwarfs, most notably for O, C, and K abundances. In particular, we find an average metallicity of −0.11 ± 0.16, lower but still consistent with the typical solar metallicity of FGK stars (e.g., [Fe/H] = 0.04 ± 0.20 from J. M. Brewer et al. 2016). This study highlights significant discrepancies in various major M dwarf surveys likely related to differences in the methodologies employed.

Gravitational waves (GWs) from merging compact objects encode direct information about the luminosity distance to the binary. When paired with a redshift measurement, this enables standard-siren cosmology: a Hubble diagram can be constructed to directly probe the Universe’s expansion. This can be done in the absence of electromagnetic measurements, as features in the mass distribution of GW sources provide self-calibrating redshift measurements without the need for a definite or probabilistic host galaxy association. This “spectral siren” technique has thus far only been applied with simple parametric representations of the mass distribution, and theoretical predictions for features in the mass distribution are commonly presumed to be fundamental to the measurement. However, the use of an inaccurate representation leads to biases in the cosmological inference, an acute problem given the current uncertainties in true source population. Furthermore, it is commonly presumed that the form of the mass distribution must be known a priori to obtain unbiased measurements of cosmological parameters in this fashion. Here, we demonstrate that spectral sirens can accurately infer cosmological parameters without such prior assumptions. We apply a flexible, nonparametric model for the mass distribution of compact binaries to a simulated catalog of 1000 GW signals, consistent with expectations for the next LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA observing run. We find that, despite our model’s flexibility, both the source mass model and cosmological parameters are correctly reconstructed. We predict a 11.2%✎ measurement of H0, keeping all other cosmological parameters fixed, and a 6.4%✎ measurement of H(z = 0.9)✎ when fitting for multiple cosmological parameters (1σ uncertainties). This astrophysically agnostic spectral siren technique will be essential to arrive at precise and unbiased cosmological constraints from GW source populations.

<title>The Rapid Formation of the Metal-poor Milky Way</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Our understanding of the assembly timeline of the Milky Way has been transforming along with the dramatic increase in astrometric and spectroscopic data available over the past several years. Many substructures in chemo-dynamical space have been discovered and identified as the remnants of various galactic mergers. To investigate the timeline of these mergers, we select main-sequence turnoff and subgiant stars (MSTOs) from the H3 survey, finding members in seven metal-poor components of the halo: Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus (GSE), the Helmi Streams, Thamnos, Sequoia, Wukong/LMS-1, Arjuna, and I’itoi. We also select out a metal-poor in situ population to facilitate comparison to the evolution of the Milky Way itself at these early epochs. We fit individual isochrone ages to the MSTOs in each of these substructures and use the resulting age distributions to infer simple star formation histories (SFHs). For GSE, we resolve an extended SFH that truncates ≈10 Gyr ago, as well as a clear age–metallicity relation. From this age distribution and measured SFH we infer that GSE merged with the Milky Way at a time 9.5–10.2 Gyr ago, in agreement with previous estimates. We infer that the other mergers occurred at various times ranging from 9 to 13 Gyr ago, and that the metal-poor in situ Galaxy built up within only a few billion years. These results reinforce the emerging picture that both the disk and halo of the Milky Way experienced a rapid assembly.

The identification of strong gravitational lenses is essential to facilitate many studies in astronomy. The search for strong gravitational lenses has become more challenging because of their scientific value and their rarity. In this paper, we construct a data set for strong gravitational lensing searches that consist of known lenses and lens candidates from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Legacy Imaging Surveys (the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys) and the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and non-lenses from the Legacy Surveys Data Release 9 (DR9). We apply the YOLOX algorithm as the basic framework and improve it by selecting the optimal optimizer, activation function, attention mechanism, and loss function. The improved YOLOX-LS algorithm achieves 97.87%, 97.51%, 0.97, 96.8%, and 53.1% in the evaluation metrics of precision, recall, F1 score, mean average precision (mAP)@0.5, and mAP@0.5:0.95, respectively. Compared with the YOLOX model, it improves by 0.63%, 0.26%, and 0.6% in the three metrics of precision, recall, and mAP@0.5, respectively. This paper presents the results of the trained YOLOX-LS algorithm applied to 4.75 million cutout images. These images are centered on the central source with magz ≤ 20 in the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey footprint from DESI DR9. Finally, we find 1697 lenses, including 303 known lenses or candidates, and 1394 new candidates, among which there are 102 high-quality candidates. This further verifies that the YOLOX-LS algorithm proposed in this paper can be effectively applied to the search for strong gravitational lenses.

<title>Derivation and Application of a Scaling between Hinode/SP and SDO/HMI Vector Magnetic Fields to Improve Magnetic Field Extrapolations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Full-disk measurements of the solar magnetic field by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) are often used for magnetic field extrapolations, but its limited spatial and spectral resolution can lead to significant errors. We compare HMI data with observations of NOAA 12104 by the Hinode Spectropolarimeter (SP) to derive a scaling curve for the magnetic field strength, B. The SP data in the Fe i lines at 630 nm were inverted with the SIR code. We find that the Milne–Eddington inversion of HMI underestimates B and the line-of-sight flux, Φ, in all granulation surroundings by an average factor of 4.5 in plage and 9.2 in the quiet Sun in comparison to the SP. The deviation is inversely proportional to the magnetic fill factor, f, in the SP results. We derived a correction curve to match the HMI B with the effective flux Bf in the SP data that scaled HMI B up by 1.3 on average. A comparison of non-force-free field extrapolations over a larger field of view without and with the correction revealed minor changes in connectivity and a proportional scaling of electric currents and Lorentz force (∝B ∼ 1.3) and free energy (∝B2 ∼ 2). Magnetic field extrapolations of HMI vector data with large areas of plage and quiet Sun will underestimate the photospheric magnetic field strength by a factor of 5–10 and the coronal magnetic flux by at least a factor of 2. An HMI inversion including a fill factor would mitigate the problem.

<title>Hot Spot Offset Variability from Magnetohydrodynamical Thermoresistive Instability in Hot Jupiters</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Hot Jupiter (HJ) atmospheres are possibly subject to a thermoresistive instability (TRI). Such an instability may develop as the ohmic heating increases the electrical conductivity in a positive feedback loop, which ultimately leads to a runaway of the atmospheric temperature. We extend our previous axisymmetric one-dimensional radial model, by representing the temperature and magnetic diffusivity as a first-order Fourier expansion in longitude. This allows us to predict the hot spot offset during the rapid unfolding of the TRI and following Alfvénic oscillations. The instability is periodically triggered and damped within ≈10–40 days, depending on the magnetic field strength, with months of slow buildup between recurring bursts. We show a few representative simulations undergoing TRI, in which the peak flux offset varies between approximately ±60∘ on a timescale of a few days with potentially observable brightness variations. Therefore, this TRI could be an observable feature of HJs, given the right timing of observation and transit and the right planetary parameters.

<title>Strongly Magnetized Accretion with Low Angular Momentum Produces a Weak Jet</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9926</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We study the spherical accretion of magnetized plasma with low angular momentum onto a supermassive black hole, utilizing global general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations. Black hole-driven feedback in the form of magnetic eruptions and jets triggers magnetized turbulence in the surrounding medium. We find that when the Bondi radius exceeds a certain value relative to the black hole’s gravitational radius, this turbulence restricts the subsequent inflow of magnetic flux, strongly suppressing the strength of the jet. Consequently, magnetically arrested disks and powerful jets are not a generic outcome of the accretion of magnetized plasma, even if there is an abundance of magnetic flux available in the system. However, if there is significant angular momentum in the inflowing gas, the eruption-driven turbulence is suppressed (sheared out), allowing for the presence of a powerful jet. Both the initially rotating and nonrotating flows go through periods of low and high gas angular momentum, showing that the angular momentum content of the inflowing gas is not just a feature of the ambient medium, but is strongly modified by the eruption and jet-driven black hole feedback. In the lower-angular-momentum states, our results predict that there should be dynamically strong magnetic fields on horizon scales, but no powerful jet; this state may be consistent with Sgr A* in the Galactic center.

<title>Latitude Quenching Nonlinearity in the Solar Dynamo</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad99d0</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We compare two candidate nonlinearities for regulating the solar cycle within the Babcock–Leighton paradigm: tilt quenching (whereby the tilt of active regions is reduced in stronger cycles) and latitude quenching (whereby flux emerges at higher latitudes in stronger solar cycles). Digitized historical observations are used to build a database of individual magnetic plage regions from 1923 to 1985. The regions are selected by thresholding in Ca ii K synoptic maps, with polarities constrained using Mount Wilson Observatory sunspot measurements. The resulting data show weak evidence for tilt quenching, but much stronger evidence for latitude quenching. Further, we use proxy observations of the polar field from faculae to construct a best-fit surface flux transport model driven by our database of emerging regions. A better fit is obtained when the sunspot measurements are used, compared to a reference model where all polarities are filled using Hale's Law. The optimization suggests clearly that the “dynamo effectivity range” of the Sun during this period should be less than 10°; this is also consistent with latitude quenching being dominant over tilt quenching.

<title>Can Alfvénic Fluctuations Affect the Correlation and Complexity of Magnetic Field of Magnetic Ejecta? A Case Study Based on Multi-spacecraft Measurements at 1 au</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9a55</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9a55</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We investigate whether Alfvénic fluctuations (AFs) can affect the structure of magnetic ejecta (ME) within interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs). We study an ICME observed on 2001 December 29 at 1 au by the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) and Wind, at a total angular separation of ~0 8 (~ 0.014 au). We focus on the correlation and complexity of its magnetic structure measured between two spacecraft in association with large-amplitude AFs. The Alfvénicity of the ME is investigated in terms of the residual energy and cross helicity of fluctuations. We find that as for the event of interest, large-amplitude AFs occur in the rear region of the ME at both Wind and ACE with a duration of about 6 hr. We compare the correlation of the magnetic field strength and vector components measured between Wind and ACE, and investigate complexity in terms of the magnetic hodograms. The region showing AFs is found to be associated with a decreased correlation of the magnetic field components and an increased complexity of the ME magnetic configuration detected at ACE and Wind, which may be due to the fact that the two spacecraft crossing the same ME along different trajectories likely sampled AFs in different oscillation phases. Combining multipoint in situ measurements and remote-sensing observations of the ICME source region, we further discuss different potential sources of the AFs.

<title>Prospects for Observing High-redshift Radio-loud Quasars in the SKA Era: Paving the Way for 21 cm Forest Observations</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9b97</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The 21 cm forest is a sensitive probe for the early heating process and small-scale structures during the epoch of reionization (EOR), to be realized with the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Its detection relies on the availability of radio-bright background sources, among which the radio-loud quasars are very promising, but their abundance during the EOR is still poorly constrained due to limited observations. In this work, we use a physics-driven model to forecast future radio-loud quasar observations. We fit the parameters of the model using observational data of high-redshift quasars. Assuming Eddington accretion, the model yields an average lifetime of tq ~ 105.5 yr for quasars at z ~ 6, consistent with recent results obtained from quasar proximity zone observation. We show that if the radio-loud fraction of quasars evolves with redshift, it will significantly reduce the abundance of observable radio-loud quasars in the SKA era, making 21 cm forest studies challenging. With a constant radio-loud fraction, our model suggests that a 1 yr sky survey conducted with SKA-LOW has the capability to detect approximately 20 radio-loud quasars at z ~ 9, with sufficient sensitivity to resolve individual 21 cm forest lines.

Unusual explosive activity occasionally occurs from the Sun, releasing large amounts of solar energetic particles. Extreme solar particle ejection events in the past 11,000 yr have been detected by sharp increases of cosmogenic isotopes in annual tree rings and ice cores. However, quantitative estimation of the event magnitudes is not straightforward, as the cosmogenic isotopes are indirect records of solar particles. Similar solar particle ejection events may also accumulate records in surface materials of airless bodies such as the Moon and asteroids. Samples from the asteroid 25143 Itokawa have been irradiated by solar winds for tens to hundreds of years at some points in the last few million years. Here, we report implantation profiles of solar particle He from an Itokawa regolith grain that trace an extreme solar particle ejection event. The implantation profiles indicate that the fluences of suprathermal solar particles were 250–1300 times larger than that expected from the current normal solar activity. Since the degrees of excesses are inversely related to the solar wind irradiation periods, the high-energy particle fluence would have been derived from a single event. The event was approximately 40 times larger than the 2003 Halloween solar storms, which is one of the largest solar particle ejection events observed since the space-based measurement of solar activity began. The event magnitude is similar to the largest events inferred from the cosmogenic isotope records in terrestrial samples. Our result provides direct evidence of an extreme solar particle ejection event in the last few million years.

<title>Detection of a Magnetic Discontinuity in the Upper Solar Chromosphere Associated with a Coronal Loop Brightening Observed by CLASP2.1</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report the first detection of a magnetic discontinuity in the upper solar chromosphere associated with a coronal loop brightening. Our findings are based on novel observations obtained by the Chromospheric LAyer SpectroPolarimeter (CLASP2.1) suborbital space experiment. During its short 6 minute flight, CLASP2.1 successfully obtained spectropolarimetric data across the Mg ii h and k lines, which allowed us to map the longitudinal magnetic field at multiple heights in the chromosphere of a solar active region. During our observation, we found a coronal loop brightening that was intermittently and recurrently heated. The temperature of the brightening plasma is above 2.5 MK, which is higher than the ambient temperature, and no corresponding brightening is detected in the images of the photosphere and lower chromosphere. The notable finding of our study is that the coronal loop brightening of interest is observed across a region where the magnetic field polarity changes abruptly in the upper chromosphere. Our results provide observational evidence that the heating mechanism of the coronal loop brightening is consistent with magnetic reconnection in the upper solar chromosphere.

The plausibility of an unseen planet in the outer solar system, and the expected orbit and mass of such a planet, have long been a topic of inquiry and debate. We calculate the long-term orbital stability of distant trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs), which allows us to expand the sample of objects that would carry dynamical information about a hypothetical unseen planet in the solar system. Using this expanded sample, we find statistically significant clustering at the ∼3σ level for TNOs with semimajor axes > 170 au in the longitude of perihelion (ϖ), but not in inclination (i), argument of perihelion (ω), or longitude of node (Ω). Since a natural explanation for clustering in ϖ is an unseen planet, we run 300 N-body simulations with the giant planets, a disk of test particles representing Kuiper Belt objects, and an additional planet with varied initial conditions for its mass, semimajor axis, eccentricity, and inclination. Based on the distribution of test particles after 1–2 Gyr, we compute relative likelihoods given the actual distribution of ϖ as a function of semimajor axis for distant TNOs on stable orbits using a significantly larger sample than previous work. We find the best-fit unseen planet parameters to have mass mp = 4.4 ± 1.1 M⊕, semimajor axis ap = 290 ± 30 au, eccentricity ep = 0.29 ± 0.13, and inclination ip = 6 8 ± 5 0. Only 0.06% of the M. E. Brown & K. Batygin Planet Nine reference population produce probabilities within 1σ of the maximum within our quadrivariate model, indicating that our work identifies a distinct preferred region of parameter space for an unseen planet in the solar system.

<title>A Catalog of Stellar and Dust Properties for 500,000 Stars in the Southwest Bar of the Small Magellanic Cloud</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8eb7</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a catalog of individual stellar and dust extinction properties along close to 500,000 sight lines in the southwest bar of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). The catalog is based on multiband Hubble Space Telescope photometric data spanning near-ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths from the Small Magellanic Cloud Investigation of Dust and Gas Evolution survey (SMIDGE) covering a 100 × 200 pc area. We use the probabilistic technique of the Bayesian Extinction And Stellar Tool (BEAST) to model the spectral energy distributions of individual stars in SMIDGE and include the effects of observational uncertainties in the data. We compare BEAST-derived dust extinction properties with tracers of the interstellar medium, such as the emission from the 12CO (2–1) transition (I(CO)), the dust mass surface density (Σdust) from far-IR emission, the H i column density (N(H i)) from the 21 cm transition, and the mass fraction of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs; qPAH, derived from IR emission). We find that the dust extinction (A(V)) in the SMIDGE field is strongly correlated with Σdust and I(CO), and less so with N(H i) and qPAH, and suggest potential explanations. Our extinction measurements are also sensitive to the presence of the 2175 Å bump in the extinction curve toward UV bright stars. While most do not show evidence for the bump, we identify ∼200 lines of sight that are 2175 Å bump candidates. Furthermore, we find distinct structures in the dust extinction–distance distributions that provide insights into the 3D geometry of the SMC.

<title>Modeling Energetic Proton Transport from a Stream Interaction Region to Compound Streams</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad96ae</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad96ae</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Energetic proton events associated with a stream interaction region (SIR) were observed by two Solar-Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) and WIND spacecraft from 2007 September 19 to September 25. Different from the measurements of STEREO-A and WIND, the observational data of STEREO-B show additional particle intensity increases when the spacecraft is immersed into the compound stream region with poor compression signatures after the passage of the SIR. In order to investigate this particular event, we simulated proton transport with a solar wind pattern obtained from the two-dimensional analytical model driven by plasma and magnetic field data of the spacecraft. We find that the additional energetic proton event is not an autonomous event created by the compound streams and is closely associated with the accelerated particles in the preceding SIR structure. We highlight the variation in particle distribution as a function of radial distance within the SIR. The magnetic field configuration in the compound stream region observed by STEREO-B provides a more direct connection to the source particle region, which presents a view to explain the differences between the energetic proton observations of the three spacecraft.

<title>Observed Steep and Shallow Spectra, Narrow and Broadband Spectra, Multifrequency Simultaneous Spectra, and Statistical Fringe Spectra in Fast Radio Bursts: Various Faces of Intrinsic Quasi-periodic Spectra?</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad98f8</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad98f8</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Through analysis, modelings, and simulations, we show that if the spectra of fast radio bursts (FRBs) are intrinsically quasi-periodic, and likely produced by coherent curvature radiation from quasi-periodic structured bunches, then the observed steep and shallow spectra, narrow and broadband spectra, multifrequency simultaneous spectra, as well as possible statistical fringe spectra in FRBs, could all be various manifestations of them. If so, the period properties of the structured bunches, as inferred from the observed multifrequency simultaneous spectra and potential statistical fringe spectra, may provide valuable insights into the mechanisms behind the formation of such structured bunches.

<title>PHANGS-ML: The Universal Relation between PAH Band and Optical Line Ratios across Nearby Star-forming Galaxies</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad972a</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad972a</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The structure and chemistry of the dusty interstellar medium (ISM) are shaped by complex processes that depend on the local radiation field, gas composition, and dust grain properties. Of particular importance are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which emit strong vibrational bands in the mid-infrared, and play a key role in the ISM energy balance. We recently identified global correlations between PAH band and optical line ratios across three nearby galaxies, suggesting a connection between PAH heating and gas ionization throughout the ISM. In this work, we perform a census of the PAH heating–gas ionization connection using ∼700,000 independent pixels that probe scales of 40–150 pc in 19 nearby star-forming galaxies from the PHANGS survey. We find a universal relation between PAH(11.3 μm/7.7 μm) and ([S ii]/Hα) with a slope of ∼0.2 and a scatter of ∼0.025 dex. The only exception is a group of anomalous pixels that show unusually high (11.3 μm/7.7 μm) PAH ratios in regions with old stellar populations and high starlight-to-dust emission ratios. Their mid-infrared spectra resemble those of elliptical galaxies. Active galactic nucleus hosts show modestly steeper slopes, with a ∼10% increase in PAH(11.3 μm/7.7 μm) in the diffuse gas on kiloparsec scales. This universal relation implies an emerging simplicity in the complex ISM, with a sequence that is driven by a single varying property: the spectral shape of the interstellar radiation field. This suggests that other properties, such as gas-phase abundances, gas ionization parameter, and grain charge distribution, are relatively uniform in all but specific cases.

<title>Emission Characteristics of Energetic Electrons with Crescent-shaped Velocity Distributions</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9905</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9905</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Solar flares release magnetic energy through reconnection, accelerating electrons into nonthermal velocity distributions, including crescent-shaped electron populations. These energetic electron distributions are crucial in driving instabilities that can lead to distinct electromagnetic emissions. This study investigates the emission properties of crescent-shaped electron velocity distribution functions under different frequency ratios (ωpe/Ωce), critical for understanding plasma conditions in various astrophysical environments, by comparing the emissions and intensities of waves among different cases. Here, we study and analyze three distinct frequency ratio conditions (2.2, 10, and 1, designated as cases A, B, and C, respectively). We find that the beam-Langmuir and upper-hybrid modes can be efficiently excited, leading to further plasma emissions in different cases. Our study reveals that the fundamental (O/F) emission can reach a maximum value of ∼10−4Ek0, while the harmonics (H) can extend to ∼1.5 × 10−5Ek0, depending on the frequency ratio of the environment. The intensity of the fundamental mode exceeds previous findings for pure-ring, pure-beam, and ring–beam distributions, highlighting the impact of crescent-shaped electron velocity distributions on wave excitation and emission processes. This effect is notably influenced by different frequency ratios, offering new insights into the way that nonthermal electron distributions affect the plasma emission process.

<title>In Search of Extraterrestrial Artificial Intelligence Through Dyson Sphere–like Structures around Primordial Black Holes</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Are we alone? It is a compelling question that human beings have confronted for centuries. The search for extraterrestrial life is a broad range of quests for finding simple forms of life up to intelligent beings in the Universe. The plausible assumption is that there is a chance that intelligent life will be followed by advanced civilization equipped or even dominated by artificial intelligence (AI). In this work, we categorize advanced civilizations (on an equal footing, an AI-dominated civilization) on the Kardashev scale. We propose a new scale known as the space exploration distance to measure civilization advancement. We propose a relation between this length and the Kardashev scale. Then, we suggest the idea that advanced civilizations will use primordial black holes (PBHs) as sources of harvesting energy. We calculate the energy harvested by calculating the space exploration distance. Finally, we propose an observational method to detect the possibility of extraterrestrial AI using Dyson sphere–like structures around PBHs in the Milky Way and other galaxies.

<title>Ejective Feedback as a Quenching Mechanism in the First 1.5 Billion Years of the Universe: Detection of Neutral Gas Outflow in a z = 4 Recently Quenched Galaxy</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The confirmation of massive quiescent galaxies emerging within the first billion years of the Universe poses intriguing questions about the mechanisms of galaxy formation. There must be highly efficient processes at work to shut down star formation in galaxies at cosmic dawn. I present the detection of neutral outflowing gas in a massive recently quenched galaxy at z = 4, showing ejective back as a quenching mechanism. Based on James Webb Space Telescope spectrum, the star formation rate (SFR) of this has been declining with a rapid e-folding timescale of ∼50 Myr. The current specific SFR is 5 × 10−11 yr−1, roughly 40 times lower than that of the star-forming main sequence at comparable redshifts. Emission-line ratios of [Ne iii]/[O ii] and [O iii]/Hβ are similar to active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at comparable redshifts. A series of Fe ii and Mg ii absorption lines appear blueshifted by ∼250 km s−1 relative to the stellar continuum, suggesting an outflow of neutral gas. The estimated mass outflow rate is approximately 7 times greater than the SFR derived from the stellar continuum, implying that the suppression of star formation is likely due to gas being depleted by the outflow. If the emission lines are AGN-driven, the AGN can also provide sufficient energy to launch the outflow observed. This galaxy represents the most distant example of its kind known to date. This study offers a compelling explanation for the existence of massive quiescent galaxies in the first billion years of the Universe.

<title>Automated Detection of Galactic Rings from Sloan Digital Sky Survey Images</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Morphological features in galaxies—like spiral arms, bars, rings, and tidal tails, etc.—carry information about their structure, origin, and evolution. It is therefore important to catalog and study such features and to correlate them with other basic galaxy properties, the environments in which the galaxies are located, and their interactions with other galaxies. The volume of present and future data on galaxies is so large that traditional methods, which involve expert astronomers identifying morphological features through visual inspection, are no longer sufficient. It is therefore necessary to use AI-based techniques like machine learning and deep learning to find morphological structures quickly and efficiently. We report in this study the application of deep learning for finding ring-like structures in galaxy images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR18. We use a catalog by R. J. Buta of ringed galaxies from SDSS to train the network, reaching good accuracy and recall, and generate a catalog of 29,420 galaxies, of which 4855 have ring-like structures with prediction confidence exceeding 90%. Using a catalog of barred galaxy images identified by S. Abraham et. al. with deep-learning techniques, we identify a set of 2087 galaxies with bars as well as rings. The catalog should be very useful in understanding the origin of these important morphological structures. As an example of the usefulness of the catalog, we explore the environments and star formation characteristics of the ring galaxies in our sample.

<title>Unveiling the Cosmic Chemistry: Revisiting the Mass–Metallicity Relation with JWST/NIRSpec at 4 < z < 10</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present star formation rates (SFRs), the mass–metallicity relation (MZR), and the SFR-dependent MZR across redshifts 4–10 using 81 star-forming galaxies observed by the JWST NIRSpec employing both low-resolution PRISM and medium-resolution gratings, including galaxies from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) GOODS-N and GOODS-S fields, the JWST-PRIMAL Legacy Survey, and additional galaxies from the literature in the A2744, SMACS-0723, RXJ2129, BDF, COSMOS, and MACS1149 fields. These galaxies span a 3 dex stellar mass range of 107 < M*/M⊙ < 1010, with an average SFR of 7.2 ± 1.2M⊙ yr−1 and an average metallicity of . Our findings align with previous observations up to z = 8 for the MZR and indicate no deviation from the local Universe fundamental metallicity relation (FMR) up to this redshift. Beyond z = 8, we observe a significant deviation (∼0.27 dex) in FMR, consistent with recent JWST findings. We also integrate Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (135 galaxies) and JADES (47 galaxies) samples with our data to study the metallicity evolution with redshift in a combined sample of 263 galaxies, revealing a decreasing metallicity trend with a slope of 0.067 ± 0.013, consistent with IllustrisTNG and EAGLE but contradicting the FIRE simulations. We introduce an empirical mass–metallicity–redshift relation: × , which accurately reproduces the observed trends in metallicity with both redshift and stellar mass. This trend underscores the “Grand Challenge” in understanding the factors driving high-redshift galactic metallicity trends, such as inflow, outflow, and active galactic nucleus/stellar feedback—and emphasizes the need for further investigations with larger samples and enhanced simulations.

<title>Shock Breakouts from Compact Circumstellar Medium Surrounding Core-collapse Supernova Progenitors May Contribute Significantly to the Observed ≳10 TeV Neutrino Background</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9a6b</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9a6b</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Growing observational evidence suggests that enhanced mass loss from the progenitors of core-collapse supernovae (SNe) is common during ~1 yr preceding the explosion, creating an optically thick circumstellar medium (CSM) shell at ~1014.5 cm radii. We show that if such mass loss is indeed common, then the breakout of the SN shock through the dense CSM shell produces a neutrino flux that may account for a significant fraction of the observed ≳10 TeV neutrino background. The neutrinos are created within a few days from the explosion, during and shortly after the shock breakout, which produces also large UV (and later X-ray) luminosity. The compact size and large UV luminosity imply a pair production optical depth of ~104 for > 100 GeV photons, naturally accounting for the lack of a high-energy gamma-ray background accompanying the neutrino background. SNe producing >1 neutrino event in a 1 km2 detector are expected at a rate of ≲0.1 yr−1. A quantitative theory describing the evolution of the electromagnetic spectrum during a breakout, as the radiation-mediated shock is transformed into a collisionless one, is required to enable (i) using data from upcoming surveys that will systematically detect large numbers of young, <1 day old SNe to determine the preexplosion mass-loss history of the SN progenitor population, and (ii) a quantitative determination of the neutrino luminosity and spectrum.

<title>EDGE-INFERNO: Simulating Every Observable Star in Faint Dwarf Galaxies and Their Consequences for Resolved-star Photometric Surveys</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Interpretation of data from faint dwarf galaxies is made challenging by observations limited to only the brightest stars. We present a major improvement to tackle this challenge by undertaking zoomed cosmological simulations that resolve the evolution of all individual stars more massive than 0.5 M⊙, thereby explicitly tracking all observable stars for the Hubble time. For the first time, we predict observable color–magnitude diagrams and the spatial distribution of ≈100,000 stars within four faint (M⋆ ≈ 105M⊙) dwarf galaxies directly from their cosmological initial conditions. In all cases, simulations predict complex light profiles with multiple components, implying that typical observational measures of structural parameters can make the total V-band magnitudes appear up to 0.5 mag dimmer compared to estimates from simulations. Furthermore, when only small (⪅100) numbers of stars are observable, shot noise from realizations of the color–magnitude diagram introduces uncertainties comparable to the population scatter in, e.g., the total magnitude, half-light radius, and mean iron abundance measurements. Estimating these uncertainties with fully self-consistent mass growth, star formation, and chemical enrichment histories paves the way for more robust interpretation of dwarf galaxy data.

<title>Identifying the Coronal Holes in Open Magnetic Field Regions Using Deep Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Open magnetic field (OMF) regions are the foot points of the field lines extending to infinity. While they are often considered to coincide with coronal holes (CHs), many studies have reported non-negligible inconsistency between the two. The objective of this study is to develop a deep learning model to predict the OMF regions that coincide with CHs, and to examine the importance of different physical quantities on the prediction. The CHs and OMF regions are both identified from the coronal data computed by a magnetohydrodynamic model developed by Predictive Science. Eight physical quantities, colatitude, magnetic flux expansion factor, magnetic field strength, thermal pressure, electron temperature, electron number density, mass density, and local coronal heating rate, at the OMF footpoints are used as the input to the deep learning model. The results of the test set indicate that the model improves the consistency between CHs and OMF regions from 0.33 to 0.81, and that all eight quantities are similarly important when they are all included in the model although the prediction accuracy would be most affected by excluding the colatitude and/or magnetic field strength. Comparison between the histograms of CH and non-CH open field regions indicates that each quantity alone can be used to distinguish the two within the ranges of values where one histogram is much higher than the other.

<title>Mass Transfer in Eccentric Black Hole–Neutron Star Mergers</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9b87</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Black hole–neutron star binaries are of interest in many ways: they are intrinsically transient, radiate gravitational waves detectable by LIGO, and may produce γ-ray bursts. Although it has long been assumed that their late-stage orbital evolution is driven entirely by gravitational wave emission, we show here that in certain circumstances, mass transfer from the neutron star onto the black hole can both alter the binary's orbital evolution and significantly reduce the neutron star's mass: when the fraction of its mass transferred per orbit is ≳10−2, the neutron star's mass diminishes by order unity, leading to mergers in which the neutron star mass is exceptionally small. The mass transfer creates a gas disk around the black hole before merger that can be comparable in mass to the debris remaining after merger, i.e., ~0.1 M⊙. These processes are most important when the initial neutron star–black hole mass ratio q is in the range ≈0.2–0.8, the orbital semimajor axis is 40 ≲ a0/rg ≲ 300 (rg ≡ GMBH/c2), and the eccentricity is large at e0 ≳ 0.8. Systems of this sort may be generated through the dynamical evolution of a triple system, as well as by other means.

<title>Analysis of Polarized Dust Emission Using Data from the First Flight of SPIDER</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Using data from the first flight of Spider and from the Planck High Frequency Instrument, we probe the properties of polarized emission from interstellar dust in the Spider observing region. Component-separation algorithms operating in both the spatial and harmonic domains are applied to probe their consistency and to quantify modeling errors associated with their assumptions. Analyses of diffuse Galactic dust emission spanning the full Spider region demonstrate (i) a spectral energy distribution that is broadly consistent with a modified-blackbody (MBB) model with a spectral index of βd = 1.45 ± 0.05 (1.47 ± 0.06) for E (B)-mode polarization, slightly lower than that reported by Planck for the full sky; (ii) an angular power spectrum broadly consistent with a power law; and (iii) no significant detection of line-of-sight polarization decorrelation. Tests of several modeling uncertainties find only a modest impact (∼10% in σr) on Spider’s sensitivity to the cosmological tensor-to-scalar ratio. The size of the Spider region further allows for a statistically meaningful analysis of the variation in foreground properties within it. Assuming a fixed dust temperature Td = 19.6 K, an analysis of two independent subregions of that field results in inferred values of βd = 1.52 ± 0.06 and βd = 1.09 ± 0.09, which are inconsistent at the 3.9σ level. Furthermore, a joint analysis of Spider and Planck 217 and 353 GHz data within one subregion is inconsistent with a simple MBB at more than 3σ, assuming a common morphology of polarized dust emission over the full range of frequencies. This evidence of variation may inform the component-separation approaches of future cosmic microwave background polarization experiments.

We analyze the radio emission from the β Cep star V2187 Cyg using archive data from the Jansky Very Large Array. The observations were made in ten epochs at 1.39 and 4.96 GHz in the highest angular resolution A configuration. We determine a spectral index of of α = 0.6 ± 0.2 (Sν ∝ να), consistent with an ionized wind or a partially optically thick synchrotron or gyrosynchrotron source. The emission is spatially unresolved at both frequencies. The 4.96 GHz data show a radio pulse with a duration of about one month that can be modeled in terms of an internal shock in the stellar wind produced by a sudden increase in the mass-loss rate and the terminal velocity. The quiescent radio emission of V2187 Cyg at 4.96 GHz (with a flux density of ≃150 μJy) cannot be explained in terms of an internally (by V2187 Cyg) or externally (by a nearby O star) photoionized wind. We conclude that, despite the spectral index suggestive of free–free emission from an ionized wind, the radio emission of V2187 Cyg most likely has a magnetic origin, a possibility that can be tested with a sensitive search for circular polarization in the radio, as expected from gyrosynchrotron radiation and also by trying to measure the stellar magnetic field, which is expected to be in the range of several kilogauss.

<title>Observational Evidence for a Correlation between the Magnetic Field of Jets and Star Formation Rate in Host Galaxies</title>

Accretion supermassive black holes in the center of active galaxies usually produce “jet”-collimated bipolar outflows of relativistic particles. Magnetic fields near the black hole event horizon may play a crucial role in the formation of jets/outflows. Both theory and observation indicate that jets/outflows driven by centrally active supermassive black holes have a feedback effect on the overall properties of the host galaxies. Therefore, the magnetic field is a key ingredient for the formation and evolution of galaxies. Here, we report a clear correlation between the magnetic field of jets and star formation rate for a large sample of 96 galaxies hosting supermassive black holes, which suggests that the star formation of active galactic nuclei host galaxies may be powered by the jets.

<title>CO Observations of the Type Ia Supernova Remnant 3C 397 by the Nobeyama 45 m Radio Telescope: Possible Evidence for the Single-degenerated Explosion</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a new CO observation toward the Type Ia supernova remnant 3C 397 using the Nobeyama 45 m radio telescope at an unprecedented angular resolution of ∼18″. We newly found that the CO cloud at VLSR = 55.7–62.2 km s−1 (60 km s−1 cloud) shows a good spatial correspondence with the radio continuum shell. We also found an expanding gas motion of the 60 km s−1 cloud with an expansion velocity of ∼3 km s−1, which is thought to be formed by the pre- and/or postsupernova feedback. By considering the positions of Galactic spiral arms and the X-ray/H i absorption studies, we concluded that 3C 397 is physically associated with the 60 km s−1 cloud rather than the previously known CO cloud at VLSR ∼ 30 km s−1. Given that the previously measured preshock density is ∼2–5 cm−3, the expanding motion of the 60 km s−1 cloud was likely formed by the presupernova feedback known as optically thick wind. The scenario is consistent with the fact that 3C 397 exploded inside a wind-blown bubble as a single degenerate system.

<title>Detecting Solar Flare Precursors Using DEFT</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The Detection and EUV Flare Tracking (DEFT) tool automatically identifies flare precursors in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) observations in a fast and consistent manner, with minimal computational overhead. DEFT currently uses GOES/SUVI 304 Å observations to detect, group, and flag sudden impulses that could be precursors to flares. In this study, we analyzed precursor signatures before 351 flares (150 C, 150 M, and 51 X class flares) that occurred from 2017 to date. Across these magnitudes, precursors were detected for 93% of the flares when using a 6 hr window before the flare start times. Using superposed epoch analysis, we found that elevated precursor activity tends to occur across all magnitude flares in the last 2 hr before the flares. The frequency of precursors gradually increases before M class flares but decreases for C class flares. We also found that in the last 20 minutes there is a significantly higher precursor frequency, pixel count, and power associated with M class flares than C class flares. We suggest that the observed EUV precursors are the observable signatures of small-scale magnetic reconnection events, and the consistently increasing frequency of precursor activity could indicate that the region is becoming increasingly unstable and reaching a critical stage that could result in flare initiation. Continuing research on EUV precursors is essential to better understand preflare processes that build and reduce magnetic instability prior to main-stage flares. The consistent and reliable detection and differentiation of EUV precursors could also complement and significantly improve current flare forecasting efforts.

<title>Polarization of Gamma-Ray Burst Afterglows in the Context of Non-axisymmetric Structured Jets</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9004</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
As the most energetic explosion in the Universe, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are usually believed to be generated by relativistic jets. Some mechanisms (e.g., internal nonuniform magnetic dissipation processes or the precession of the central engine) may generate asymmetric jet structures, which are characterized by multiple fluctuations in the light curve of the afterglow. Since the jet’s structure introduces asymmetry in radiation around the line of sight (LOS), it is naturally expected that polarization will be observable. In this work, we reveal the polarization characteristics of GRB afterglows with a non-axisymmetric structured jet. Our results show that the afterglow signal generally exhibits polarization, with the degree and evolution influenced by the specific jet structure, observing frequency, and the LOS. The polarization degree is notably higher when the LOS is outside the jet. This degree fluctuates over time as different regions of radiation alternate in their dominance, which is accompanied by the rotation of the polarization angle and further reflects the intricate nature of the jet. Regarding its evolution over frequency, the polarization degree displays significant fluctuations at spectral breaks, with the polarization angle possibly undergoing abrupt changes. These features may provide strong evidence for the future identification of potential GRBs with asymmetric jet structures.

<title>Distinguishability of a Naked Singularity from a Black Hole in Dynamics and Radiative Signatures</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Can a naked singularity (NkS) be distinguished from a black hole (BH)? We have investigated it with cutting-edge general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations, followed by general relativistic radiation transfer calculation for magnetized accretion flow around NkS and BHs. Based on our simulations, the accreting matter close enough to the singularity repels due to effective potential. This prevents matter from reaching an NkS and forms a quasi-spherical symmetric density distribution around it, unlike the accretion flows around a BH. We observe 1 order of magnitude higher mass flux through the jet and much stronger wind from an NkS than a BH. We found that the jet launching mechanism in an NkS differs significantly from that in a BH. In the horizon-scale images, an NkS shows a photon arc instead of a photon ring that is shown around a BH. In summary, the flow dynamics and radiative properties around an NkS are distinctly different from a BH. These properties would be useful to either confirm or rule out such exotic compact objects through future observations.

<title>Morphology and Mach Number Distribution of Merger Shock Surfaces in Merging Galaxy Clusters</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In a binary merger of two subclusters with comparable masses, a pair of merger shocks are typically generated, often manifesting as double radio relics. Using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, we identify major merger events with mass ratio and impact parameter b/rvir,1 ≲ 1, where rvir,1 is the virial radius of the heavier subcluster. We analyze merger shock surfaces approximately 1 Gyr after the pericenter passage, focusing on their morphology and the distribution of the Mach number, Ms, of their constituent shock zones. The shock surfaces exhibit an elongated shape with a minor-to-major axis ratio of ∼0.6–0.9 and cover the area of ∼5%−20% of the enclosed sphere. The area ratio of the two shock surfaces roughly scales as , typically positioning the larger shock ahead of the lighter subcluster. The axis connecting the two subclusters generally does not pass through the centers of the shock surfaces, due to the nonzero impact parameter and ambient turbulent flows. The distribution of Ms of shock zones on each surface can be approximated by a log-normal function, peaking at Ms,peak ≈ 2−4.5 and extending up to ∼10. The surface-area-weighted and X-ray- emissivity-weighted average Mach numbers are comparable, with and . In contrast, the cosmic-ray energy flux-weighted average Mach numbers are higher with . This discrepancy aligns with the differences between Mach numbers derived from X-ray and radio observations of radio relic shocks. On the other hand, we find that mostly for simulated merger shocks, although shocks with MX-ray ≲ 2 are often reported in observations.

<title>B2 1308+326: A Changing-look Blazar or Not?</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9b7c</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9b7c</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In our previous study, we identified a shift in the synchrotron peak frequency of the blazar B2 1308+326 from 1012.9 to 1014.8 Hz during a flare, suggesting it could be a changing-look blazar (CLB). In this work, we investigate the changing-look behaviour of B2 1308+326 by analysing a newly acquired optical spectrum and comparing it with an archival spectrum. We find that between the two epochs, the continuum flux increased by a factor of ~4.4, while the Mg ii emission line flux decreased by a factor of 1.4 ± 0.2. Additionally, the equivalent width of the Mg ii line reduced from ~20 to ~3 Å, indicating an apparent shift from a flat-spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) class to a BL Lacertae (BL Lac) class. Despite this apparent change, the ratio of accretion disk luminosity to Eddington luminosity remains >10−2 during both epochs, indicating efficient accretion persists in B2 1308+326. The measured black hole mass remains consistent with an average M⊙. Our findings suggest that B2 1308+326 is not a genuine CLB but rather an intrinsic FSRQ that emerges as a BL Lac during high-flux states due to enhanced nonthermal emission.

<title>The NuSTAR Local AGN N H Distribution Survey (NuLANDS). I. Toward a Truly Representative Column Density Distribution in the Local Universe</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Hard X-ray-selected samples of active galactic nuclei (AGN) provide one of the cleanest views of supermassive black hole accretion but are biased against objects obscured by Compton-thick gas column densities of NH > 1024 cm−2. To tackle this issue, we present the NuSTAR Local AGN NH Distribution Survey (NuLANDS)—a legacy sample of 122 nearby (z < 0.044) AGN primarily selected to have warm infrared colors from IRAS between 25 and 60 μm. We show that optically classified Type 1 and 2 AGN in NuLANDS are indistinguishable in terms of optical [O iii] line flux and mid-to-far-infrared AGN continuum bolometric indicators, as expected from an isotropically selected AGN sample, while Type 2 AGN are deficient in terms of their observed hard X-ray flux. By testing many X-ray spectroscopic models, we show the measured line-of-sight column density varies on average by ∼1.4 orders of magnitude depending on the obscurer geometry. To circumvent such issues, we propagate the uncertainties per source into the parent column density distribution, finding a directly measured Compton-thick fraction of 35% ± 9%. By construction, our sample will miss sources affected by severe narrow-line reddening, and thus segregates sources dominated by small-scale nuclear obscuration from large-scale host-galaxy obscuration. This bias implies an even higher intrinsic obscured AGN fraction may be possible, although tests for additional biases arising from our infrared selection find no strong effects on the measured column density distribution. NuLANDS thus holds potential as an optimized sample for future follow-up with current and next-generation instruments aiming to study the local AGN population in an isotropic manner.

<title>Extending the ALMA Census of Circumstellar Disks in the Upper Scorpius OB Association</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 7 continuum (340 GHz) and carbon monoxide (CO) J = 3–2 observations for an extended sample of disks in the Upper Scorpius OB Association (Upper Sco, age ∼10 Myr). The targets were selected from previous studies that identified new members of Upper Sco using photometry and astrometry from the Gaia mission, and the presence of a disk has been inferred from mid-infrared excess emission. The new ALMA observations are combined with previous ALMA data to define a sample of 202 Upper Sco members with disks that have spectral types between G0 and M5.5. Among these sources, 120 (59%) have been detected in the continuum with a signal-to-noise ratio ≥3, and 83 (41%) have been detected in CO J = 3–2. Both the continuum and CO J = 3–2 fluxes show a strong correlation with the spectral type of the central star and the type of disk inferred from the shape of the infrared spectral energy distribution, where disks around earlier-type stars and full disks are more luminous than disks around later-type stars and evolved and debris disks. The median dust continuum luminosity is lower for disks in Upper Sco than in younger regions, as found in previous studies, where the differences are more pronounced in later spectral types (M4–M5) than in earlier spectral types.

<title>Multiple Rebrightenings in the Optical Afterglow of GRB 210731A: Evidence for an Asymmetric Jet</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The broadband afterglow of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is usually believed to originate from the synchrotron radiation of electrons accelerated by the external shock of relativistic jets. Therefore, the jet structure should have a significant impact on the GRB afterglow features. The latest observations indicate that the GRB jets may possess intricate structures, such as Gaussian structure, power-law structure, or jet-cocoon structure. Most recently, an abnormal afterglow of GRB 210731A has raised extensive attention, whose optical afterglow exhibits multiple rebrightening phenomena within 4 hr, posing a serious challenge to the standard afterglow model. Here we intend to interpret the characteristics of GRB 210731A afterglows within the framework of nonaxisymmetric structured jets, where multiple distinct peaks in the afterglow light curve are caused by the uneven distribution of energy and velocity within the jet in the azimuth angle direction. Through Markov Chain Monte Carlo fitting, we show that a three-component asymmetric structured jet can well explain the multiband afterglow data. The energy difference among the three components is about 2.3 orders of magnitude, with higher-energy components exhibiting faster speeds. The radiation contribution of each component has sequentially dominated the light curve of the afterglow, resulting in multiple peaks, with the highest peak occurring at the latest time. We suggest that in the future, polarization observations should be conducted on afterglows with multiple brightening signatures, which will help to effectively distinguish the structured jet model from other alternative models, such as energy injection, and ultimately help to determine the true configuration of jets.

<title>Combining Direct Black Hole Mass Measurements and Spatially Resolved Stellar Kinematics to Calibrate the M BH–σ ⋆ Relation of Active Galaxies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The origin of the tight scaling relation between the mass of supermassive black holes (SMBHs; MBH) and their host-galaxy properties remains unclear. Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) probe phases of ongoing SMBH growth and offer the only opportunity to measure MBH beyond the local Universe. However, determining an AGN's host galaxy's stellar velocity dispersion, σ⋆, and its galaxy dynamical mass, Mdyn, is complicated by AGN contamination, aperture effects, and different host-galaxy morphologies. We select a sample of AGNs for which MBH has been independently determined to high accuracy by state-of-the-art techniques: dynamical modeling of the reverberation signal and spatially resolving the broad-line region with the Very Large Telescope Interferometer/GRAVITY. Using integral-field spectroscopic observations, we spatially map the host-galaxy stellar kinematics across the galaxy and bulge effective radii. We find that the dynamically hot component of galaxy disks correlates with MBH; however, the correlations are tightest for aperture-integrated σ⋆ measured across the bulge. Accounting for the different MBH distributions, we demonstrate—for the first time—that AGNs follow the same MBH–σ⋆ and MBH–Mbulge,dyn relations as quiescent galaxies. We confirm that the classical approach of determining the virial factor as a sample average, yielding , is consistent with the average f from individual measurements. The similarity between the underlying scaling relations of AGNs and quiescent galaxies implies that the current AGN phase is too short to have altered black hole masses on a population level. These results strengthen the local calibration of f for measuring single-epoch MBH in the distant Universe.

<title>A Search for Asymmetric Kinematic Components in Circumstellar Envelopes Using OH Main Line Masers</title>

Circumstellar OH maser lines are useful for studying the dynamics of the circumstellar envelope (CSE) around evolved stars. This study aims to identify CSEs around cold stars, which exhibit deviations from the spherical expansion, by comparing the velocity ranges of the OH main lines (1665/1667 MHz) with those of the satellite line (1612 MHz), using a database of circumstellar OH maser sources. We performed this comparison for 377 circumstellar OH maser sources. In addition, using infrared two-color diagrams, we examined the evolutionary stages and infrared properties of objects showing velocity excess (velocity excess means the detection of the main lines outside the velocity range of the satellite line). A periodicity analysis of the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) light curves was also carried out. As a result of the velocity range comparison, eight circumstellar OH maser sources were found to exhibit velocity excess. The infrared colors of these objects match those of postasymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. Periodic variations were observed in the WISE light curves of five of these eight objects. The results suggest that examining the velocity excess of the main lines relative to the satellite line is scientifically significant because mainline masers probe the CSE dynamics over a broader range of evolutionary stages compared to the 22.235 GHz H2O maser line. Additionally, during the post-AGB phase, the emission regions of the mainline and 22.235 GHz H2O masers may overlap in a CSE, whereas they originate from different regions during the AGB phase.

<title>Virgo Filaments. IV. Using WISE to Measure the Modification of Star-forming Disks in the Extended Regions Around the Virgo Cluster</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Recent theoretical work and targeted observational studies suggest that filaments are sites of galaxy preprocessing. The aim of the WISESize project is to directly probe galaxies over the full range of environments to quantify and characterize extrinsic galaxy quenching in the local universe. In this paper, we use GALFIT to measure the IR 12 μm (R12) and 3.4 μm (R3.4) effective radii of 603 late-type galaxies in and surrounding the Virgo cluster. We find that Virgo cluster galaxies show smaller star-forming disks relative to their field counterparts at the 2.5σ level, while filament galaxies show smaller star-forming disks to almost 1.5σ. Our data, therefore, show that cluster galaxies experience significant effects on their star-forming disks prior to their final quenching period. There is also tentative support for the hypothesis that galaxies are preprocessed in filamentary regions surrounding clusters. On the other hand, galaxies belonging to rich groups and poor groups do not differ significantly from those in the field. We additionally find hints of a positive correlation between stellar mass and size ratio for both rich group and filament galaxies, though the uncertainties on these data are consistent with no correlation. We compare our size measurements with the predictions from two variants of a state-of-the-art semi-analytic model (SAM), one which includes starvation and the other incorporating both starvation and ram pressure stripping (RPS). Our data appear to disfavor the SAM, which includes RPS for the rich group, filament, and cluster samples, which contributes to improved constraints for general models of galaxy quenching.

<title>Spectroscopic Modeling of Luminous Transients Powered by H-rich and He-rich Circumstellar Interaction</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this study, we perform detailed spectroscopic modeling to analyze the interaction of circumstellar material (CSM) with ejecta in both hydrogen-rich and hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), by systematically varying properties such as the CSM density, composition, and geometry to explore their effects on spectral lines and light-curve evolution. Using advanced radiative transfer simulations with the new, open-source SuperLite code to generate synthetic spectra, we identify key spectroscopic indicators of CSM characteristics. Our findings demonstrate that spectral lines of hydrogen and helium exhibit significant variations due to differences in CSM mass and composition. In hydrogen-rich Type II SLSNe, we observe pronounced hydrogen emission lines that correlate strongly with a dense, extended CSM, suggesting massive, eruptive mass-loss histories. Conversely, in hydrogen-poor SLSNe, we recover mostly featureless spectra at early times, with weak hydrogen lines appearing only in the very early phases of the explosion, highlighting the quick ionization of traces of hydrogen present in the CSM. We analyze the properties of the resulting emission lines, particularly Hα and Hβ, for our models using sophisticated statistical methods. This analysis reveals how variations in the SN progenitor and CSM properties can lead to distinct spectroscopic evolutions over time. These temporal changes provide crucial insights into the underlying physics driving the explosion and the subsequent interaction with the CSM. By linking these spectroscopic observations to the initial properties of the progenitor and its surrounding material, our study offers a useful tool for probing the pre-explosion histories of these explosive events.

We present the large-scale distribution and kinematics of cold molecular gas across the compact galaxy group Stephan’s Quintet, based on CO(2–1) observations performed with the Atacama Compact Array (ACA) and CO(1–0) data from the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA). We find coherent structures of molecular gas associated with the galaxies and intragroup medium, which follow the distribution of warm H2 previously seen with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). CO is associated with a ridge of shocked gas that crosses the galaxy group, and with a spiral arm of the intruding galaxy NGC 7318b, which interacts with the intragroup medium along the ridge. Although the ridge contains widespread shocks, turbulent gas, and warm H2, the CO lines are narrower than elsewhere in Stephan’s Quintet (FWHM ∼ 25–65 km s−1), indicative of settled cold gas. At a distinctly different velocity, CO is found in the active galaxy NGC 7319 and northern star-forming region SQ-A. A bridge of turbulent molecular gas connects NGC 7319 with the ridge, covering a gap of ∼700 km s−1 between these structures. The gas excitation ranges from / ∼ 0.3 in the bridge and SQ-A, to ∼0.5 along the ridge, to near unity in the center of NGC 7319. We also detect either a molecular outflow or turbulent molecular gas associated with the radio source in NGC 7319. These ACA data are part of a program with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and JWST to study the physics of molecular gas from the largest to the smallest scales across the intragroup medium of Stephan’s Quintet.

Enhanced emission in the months to years preceding explosion has been detected for several core-collapse supernovae (SNe). Though the physical mechanisms driving the emission remain hotly debated, the light curves of detected events show long-lived (≥50 days), plateau-like behavior, suggesting hydrogen recombination may significantly contribute to the total energy budget. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory’s Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will provide a decade-long photometric baseline to search for this emission, both in binned pre-explosion observations after an SN is detected and in single-visit observations prior to the SN explosion. In anticipation of these searches, we simulate a range of eruptive precursor models to core-collapse SNe and forecast the discovery rates of these phenomena in LSST data. We find a detection rate of ∼40–130 yr−1 for SN IIP/IIL precursors and ∼110 yr−1 for SN IIn precursors in single-epoch photometry. Considering the first three years of observations with the effects of rolling and observing triplets included, this number grows to a total of 150–400 in binned photometry, with the highest number recovered when binning in 100 day bins for 2020tlf-like precursors and in 20 day bins for other recombination-driven models from the literature. We quantify the impact of using templates contaminated by residual light (from either long-lived or separate precursor emission) on these detection rates, and explore strategies for estimating baseline flux to mitigate these issues. Spectroscopic follow-up of the eruptions preceding core-collapse SNe and detected with LSST will offer important clues to the underlying drivers of terminal-stage mass loss in massive stars.

<title>Electrostatic Transport Characteristics of Olivine Particles under Electron Irradiation in Vacuum</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Electrostatic dust transport on airless planetary bodies, such as the Moon, plays a crucial role in shaping their surface environment and influencing the evolution of surface materials. To investigate the effects of electron irradiation on the transport characteristics of micron-sized dust particles under simulated lunar conditions, we measured the diameters and velocities of moving olivine particles using a laser Doppler system. Experiments were conducted under electron irradiation with energies up to 500 eV and currents ranging from 1 to 500 μA. The results demonstrate a strong dependence of electrostatic dust migration on the incident electrons’ energy and current, with more pronounced effects observed at higher energies. This offers insights into the mechanisms behind localized dust migration during magnetic tail crossings and in the lunar terminal/polar plasma wakes, where electrostatic charging likely plays a key role. However, further observations are necessary to verify these phenomena fully. Olivine particles exhibited significantly higher transport rates than anorthite particles under the same conditions, confirming the distinct transport characteristics of various dust components. Furthermore, based on the patched charge model, we examined the driving force and initial vertical velocity distribution to better understand the mechanisms behind dust lofting. These findings provide valuable insights into dust transport mechanisms on airless planetary surfaces, with implications for future space exploration missions and environmental modeling.

<title>Thorium in Kilonova Spectra: Exploring the Heaviest Detectable Element</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Kilonova spectra provide us with direct information about rapid neutron-capture nucleosynthesis (r-process) in neutron star (NS) mergers. In this paper, we study the signatures of elements beyond the third r-process peak expected to be produced in neutron-rich ejecta in the photospheric spectra of kilonova. We select Ra ii, Ac iii, and Th iii as our candidates because they have a small number of valence electrons and low-lying energy levels, which tend to result in strong absorption features. We systematically calculate the strength of bound–bound transitions of these candidates by constructing a line list based on the available atomic database. We find that Th iii is the most promising species, showing strong transitions at near-infrared wavelengths. By performing radiative transfer simulations, we find that Th iii produces broad absorption features at ∼18000 Å in the spectra when the mass ratio of actinides to lanthanides is larger than the solar r-process ratio and the mass fraction of lanthanides is ≲6 × 10−4. Our models demonstrate that the Th feature may be detectable if the bulk of the ejecta in the line-forming region is dominated by relatively light r-process elements with the mixture of a small fraction of very neutron-rich material. Such conditions may be realized in the mergers of unequal-mass NSs or black hole–NS binaries. To detect the Th absorption features, observations from space (such as with the JWST) or high-altitude sites are important as the wavelength region of the Th features overlaps with that affected by strong telluric absorption.

<title>RAMSES-yOMP: Performance Optimizations for the Astrophysical Hydrodynamic Simulation Code RAMSES</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Developing an efficient code for large, multiscale astrophysical simulations is crucial in preparing for the upcoming era of exascale computing. RAMSES is an astrophysical simulation code that employs parallel processing based on the message-passing interface (MPI). However, it has limitations in computational and memory efficiency when using a large number of CPU cores. The problem stems from inefficiencies in workload distribution and memory allocation that inevitably occur when a volume is simply decomposed into domains equal to the number of working processors. We present RAMSES-yOMP, which is a modified version of RAMSES designed to improve parallel scalability. Major updates include the incorporation of open multiprocessing into the MPI parallelization to take advantage of both the shared and distributed memory models. Utilizing this hybrid parallelism in high-resolution benchmark simulations with full prescriptions for baryonic physics, we achieved an increase in performance by a factor of 2 in the total run-time, while using 75% less memory and 30% less storage than the original code, when using the same number of processors. These improvements allow us to perform larger or higher-resolution simulations than what was feasible previously.

<title>Marginal Role of the Electrostatic Instability in the GeV-scale Cascade Flux from 1ES 0229+200</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Relativistic pair beams produced in the intergalactic medium by TeV gamma rays from blazars are expected to generate a detectable GeV-scale electromagnetic cascade, yet this cascade is absent in the observed spectra of hard-spectrum TeV emitting blazars. This suppression is often attributed to weak intergalactic magnetic fields (IGMF) deflecting electron-positron pairs out of the line of sight. Alternatively, it has been proposed that beam-plasma instabilities could drain the energy of the beam before they produce the secondary cascades. Recent studies suggest that the modification of beam distribution due to these instabilities is primarily driven by particle scattering, rather than energy loss. In this paper, we quantitatively assess, for the blazar 1ES 0229+200, the arrival time of secondary gamma rays at Earth from the beam scattering by the electrostatic instability. We first computed the production rates of electron-positron pairs at various distances using the Monte Carlo simulation CRPropa. We then simulated the feedback of the plasma instability on the beam, incorporating production rates and inverse Compton cooling, to determine the steady-state distribution function. Our findings reveal that the time delay of the GeV secondary cascade arrival due to instability broadening is on the order of a few months. This delay is insufficient to account for the missing cascade emission in blazar spectra, suggesting that plasma instabilities do not significantly affect IGMF constraints.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This paper gives an overview of Targeting Extremely Magnified Panchromatic Lensed Arcs and Their Extended Star formation (TEMPLATES), a JWST Early Release Science program that targeted four extremely bright, gravitationally lensed galaxies, two extremely dusty and two with low attenuation, as templates for galaxy evolution studies with JWST. TEMPLATES obtains a common set of spectral diagnostics for these 1.3 ≤ z ≤ 4.2 galaxies, in particular Hα, Paschen α, and the rest-frame optical and near-infrared continua. In addition, two of the four targets have JWST coverage of [O iii] 5007 Å and Hβ; the other two targets have JWST coverage of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon 3.3 μm and complementary Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array data covering the [C ii] 158 μm emission line. The science goals of TEMPLATES are to demonstrate attenuation-robust diagnostics of star formation, map the distribution of star formation, compare the young and old stellar populations, and measure the physical conditions of star formation and their spatial variation across the galaxies. In addition, TEMPLATES has the technical goal to establish best practices for the integral field units within the NIRSpec and MIRI instruments, both in terms of observing strategy and in terms of data reduction. The paper describes TEMPLATES’s observing program, scientific and technical goals, data reduction methods, and deliverables, including high-level data products and data reduction cookbooks.

<title>C3PO. III. On the Lithium Signatures following Planet Engulfment by Stars</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Planet engulfment has been identified as one of the mechanisms for enhancing lithium abundance in stars. However, comprehensive investigations into lithium signatures following such events remain limited. Stars born together, sharing a common origin and stellar characteristics, provide a unique opportunity to study these signatures and compare lithium abundances. We demonstrate that the distinctive signature of planet engulfment in lithium abundance is only discernible among highly similar stellar twins. We present lithium abundance measurements for 125 comoving pairs of stars, representing the largest sample to date with a single, homogeneous assessment of high-precision lithium abundance. While lithium abundance enhancements in pairs showing planet engulfment signatures are within 0.35 dex, we find that even at fixed stellar parameters (temperature and age), the intrinsic scatter in lithium abundance is typically 0.35 dex for G/F dwarfs and can be as large as 0.6 dex for older and cooler stars due to internal stellar evolution processes. Since the planet engulfment signature from lithium can be masked by stellar intrinsic scatter, our findings raise questions about relying solely on lithium as an indicator for planet engulfment or attributing lithium-richness in stars primarily to planet engulfment events.

Spider pulsars represent a unique subclass of radio millisecond pulsars in binaries, and are further categorized into black widows and redbacks according to the mass of the low-mass companion. These pulsars, observable across multiple wavelengths, exhibit periodic variability in optical. The discovery and study of additional spider-type pulsars are crucial for a fuller understanding the evolution of binary stars in close orbits and the recycling theory of millisecond pulsars. In this work, we systematically searched for spider pulsar binary systems using time-domain variability data from the Zwicky Transient Facility and unassociated gamma-ray sources from the Fermi 4FGL-DR3 catalog. We developed a time-domain data processing pipeline that employs the Lomb–Scargle periodogram algorithm. As a result, we identified a total of 194 ellipsoidal variables and irradiation-type binary stars. Further refinement using the Gaia Hertzsprung–Russell diagram resulted in a selection of 24 spider pulsar candidates. Incorporating the 4FGL 95% confidence error ellipse reduced the sample to 19 candidates. An additional filter using the Gaia color-reduced proper motion diagram yielded nine “gold sample” candidates. These newly identified spider pulsar candidates will guide future observational campaigns in radio, X-ray, and optical spectroscopy, aiding in the comprehensive validation of their nature.

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad944e</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We investigated the temporal and spectral features of γ Cassiopeiae’s X-ray emission within the context of the white dwarf (WD) accretion hypothesis. We find that the variabilities present in the X-ray data show two different signals, one primarily due to absorption and the other due to flickering like in nonmagnetic cataclysmic variables. We then use this two-component insight to investigate previously unreported simultaneous XMM and NuSTAR data. The results of model fitting find WD properties consistent with optical studies alongside a significant secondary, thermal source. We propose a secondary shock between the Be decretion disk and WD accretion disk as the source. Finally, we analyzed a unique, low-count-rate event of the XMM light curve as potential evidence for the WD encountering Be decretion disk structures.

<title>Constraining the Binarity of Massive Black Holes in the Galactic Center and Some Nearby Galaxies via Pulsar Timing Array Observations of Gravitational Waves</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Massive black holes (MBHs) exist in the Galactic center (GC) and other nearby galactic nuclei. As a natural outcome of galaxy mergers, some MBHs may have a black hole (BH) companion. In this paper, assuming that the MBHs in the GC and some nearby galaxies are in binaries with orbital periods ranging from months to years (gravitational-wave frequency ∼1–100 nHz), we investigate the detectability of gravitational waves from these binary MBHs (BBHs) and constraints on the parameter space for the existence of BBHs in the GC, Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), M31, M32, and M87 that may be obtained by current/future pulsar timing array (PTA) observations. We find that a BBH in the GC, if any, can be revealed by the Square Kilometre Array PTA (SKA-PTA) if it has mass ratio q ≳ 10−4–10−3 and semimajor axis a ∼ 20–103 au. The existence of a BH companion of the MBH can be revealed by SKA-PTA with ∼20 yr observations in M31 if q ≳ 10−4 and a ∼ 102–104 au or in M87 if q ≳ 10−5 and a ∼ 103–2 × 104 au, but not in the LMC and M32 if q ≪ 1. If a number of millisecond stable pulsars with distances ≲0.1–1 pc away from the central MBH in the GC, the LMC, M32, or M31 can be detected in future and applied to PTAs, a BH companion with mass even down to ∼100 M⊙, close to stellar masses, can be revealed by such PTAs. Future PTAs are expected to provide an independent way to reveal BBHs and low-mass MBH companions in the GC and nearby galaxies, improving our understandings of the formation and evolution of MBHs and galaxies.

<title>Warped Accretion Disks and Quasars with Episodic Periodicity of Long-term Variations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
It has been found from long-term monitoring campaigns that some quasars are undergoing quasiperiodic variations (most of them with damped amplitudes) in optical bands, but how to explain the origin of such light-curve variations still remains an open question. In this paper, we use the warped accretion disks model to explain the quasiperiodical variations. This model employs a free-bending wave traveling in an accretion disk, which causes the orientation of the central part of the disk to oscillate from the line of sight, resulting in a quasiperiodical variation. We numerically solve the governing equation of warp propagation and calculate the simulated R-band light curves, finding that the periodical light curves generated by this model have damped amplitudes. To compare with observations, we select SDSSJ134820.42+194831.5 as a preliminary example from a sample of periodic quasar candidates by combining CRTS with other public survey data and fitting its light curve with different observational angles. Our result gives a reduced χ2 ≃ 2.4, implying that the model might give insights into the future application of the warped disk model.

High-z radio galaxies (HzRGs) are considered important objects for understanding the formation and evolution of massive galaxies in the early Universe. However, until to date, detailed studies of the stellar population of HzRGs, such as the star formation history, have been scarce. Therefore, this study conducted a new survey to establish a less-biased sample of HzRGs and consequently investigate their properties. We utilized a sample of g-dropout Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) obtained from an optical wide and deep imaging survey made by Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam. Based on the cross matching of this LBG sample with the Very Large Array Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty cm radio survey data, we constructed a photometric sample of HzRGs at z ∼ 4 for a ∼560 deg2 survey field. Consequently, we identified 146 HzRG candidates. To analyze the characteristics of these candidates, we focus on objects exhibiting the near-infrared photometry of VIKING or UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey and the mid-infrared photometry of unWISE (28 objects). The results indicate that seven objects exhibit spectral energy distributions (SEDs) consistent with galaxies at z ∼ 4. The HzRG candidates have very large stellar masses with ∼4.2 × 1011M⊙ on average. This stellar mass is similar to that of previously discovered ultra-steep-spectrum HzRGs at z ∼ 4, though our sample is affected by a sample selection bias that selects only HzRGs with M⋆ > 1011M⊙. Further, the SEDs of those HzRG candidates suggest a past fast quenching with a rough timescale of ∼0.1 Gyr, as evidenced from the rest-frame UVJ diagram.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We combine the power of blind integral field spectroscopy from the Hobby–Eberly Telescope (HET) Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX) with sources detected by the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) to construct the HETDEX-LOFAR Spectroscopic Redshift Catalog. Starting from the first data release of the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey, including a value-added catalog with photometric redshifts, we extracted 28,705 HETDEX spectra. Using an automatic classifying algorithm, we assigned each object a star, galaxy, or quasar label along with a velocity/redshift, with supplemental classifications coming from the continuum and emission-line catalogs of the internal, fourth data release from HETDEX (HDR4). We measured 9087 new redshifts; in combination with the value-added catalog, our final spectroscopic redshift sample is 9710 sources. This new catalog contains the highest substantial fraction of LOFAR galaxies with spectroscopic redshift information; it improves archival spectroscopic redshifts and facilitates research to determine the [O ii] emission properties of radio galaxies from 0.0 < z < 0.5, and the Lyα emission characteristics of both radio galaxies and quasars from 1.9 < z < 3.5. Additionally, by combining the unique properties of LOFAR and HETDEX, we are able to measure star formation rates (SFRs) and stellar masses. Using the Visible Integral-field Replicable Unit Spectrograph, we measure the emission lines of [O iii], [Ne iii], and [O ii] and evaluate line-ratio diagnostics to determine whether the emission from these galaxies is dominated by active galactic nuclei or star formation and fit a new SFR–L150MHz relationship.

<title>Multiwavelength Properties of Infrared-faint Radio Sources Based on Analysis of Their Spectral Energy Distribution</title>

Infrared-faint radio sources (IFRSs) are believed to be a rare class of radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGNs) characterized by their high radio-to-infrared flux density ratios of up to several thousand. Previous studies have shown that a fraction of IFRSs are likely to be hosted in dust-obscured galaxies. In this paper, our aim is to probe the dust properties, star formation rate (SFR), and AGN activity of IFRSs by modeling the UV-to-infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) of 20 IFRSs with spectroscopic redshifts ranging from 1.2 to 3.7. We compare the Bayesian evidence of a three-component model (stellar, AGN, and cold dust) with that of a two-component model (stellar and cold dust) for six IFRSs in our sample with far-infrared photometry and find that the three-component model has significantly higher Bayesian evidence, suggesting that IFRSs are most likely to be AGNs. The median SED of our IFRS sample shows similarities to an AGN–starburst composite in the IR regime. The derived IR luminosities of IFRSs indicate that they are low-luminosity counterparts of high-redshift radio galaxies. We disentangle the contributions of AGN-heated and star formation-heated dust to the IR luminosity of IFRSs and find that our sample is likely AGN-dominated. However, despite the evidence for significant impact of an AGN on the host galaxy, the AGN luminosity of our sample does not show correlation with the SFR of the sources.

<title>No Evidence for a Significant Evolution of M •–M. Relation in Massive Galaxies up to z ∼ 4</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Over the past two decades, tight correlations between black hole masses (M•) and their host galaxy properties have been firmly established for massive galaxies (with stellar mass ) at low-z (z < 1), indicating coevolution of supermassive black holes and galaxies. However, the situation at high-z, especially beyond cosmic noon (z ≳ 2.5), is controversial. With a combination of JWST Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam)/wide field slitless spectroscopy (WFSS) from FRESCO, CONGRESS and deep multiband NIRCam/image data from JADES in the GOODS fields, we study the black-hole-to-galaxy mass relation at z ∼ 1–4. After identifying 18 broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at 1 < z < 4 (with 8 at z > 2.5) from the WFSS data, we measure their black hole masses based on broad near-infrared lines (Paα, Paβ, and He iλ10833 Å), and constrain their stellar masses from AGN-galaxy image decomposition or spectral energy distribution decomposition. Taking account of the observational biases, the intrinsic scatter of the M•−M* relation, and the errors in mass measurements, we find no significant difference in the M•/M* ratio for 2.5 < z < 4 compared to that at lower redshifts (1 < z < 2.5), suggesting no evolution of the M•−M* relation at up to z ∼ 4.

<title>Transiting Jupiters around M Dwarfs Have Similar Masses to FGK Warm Jupiters</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This paper presents a comparative analysis of the bulk properties (mass and radius) of transiting giant planets (≳8R⊕) orbiting FGKM stars. Our findings suggest that the average mass of M-dwarf Jupiters is lower than that of their solar-type counterparts, primarily due to the scarcity of super-Jupiters (≳2 MJ) around M dwarfs. However, when super-Jupiters are excluded from the analysis, we observe a striking similarity in the average masses of M-dwarf and FGK warm-Jupiters. We propose that these trends can be explained by a minimum disk dust mass threshold required for Jovian formation through core accretion, which is likely to be satisfied more often around higher-mass stars. This simplistic explanation suggests that the disk mass has more of an influence on giant planet formation than other factors, such as the host star mass, formation location, metallicity, radiation environment, etc., and also accounts for the lower occurrence of giant planets around M-dwarf stars. Additionally, we explore the possibility of an abrupt transition in the ratio of super-Jupiters to Jupiters around F-type stars at the Kraft break, which could be a product of vsini-related detection biases, but requires additional data from an unbiased sample with published nondetections to confirm. Overall, our results provide valuable insights into the formation and evolution of giant exoplanets across a diverse range of stellar environments.

<title>Conditions for Solar Prominence Formation Triggered by Single Localized Heating</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9908</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We performed numerical simulations to study mechanisms of solar prominence formation triggered by a single heating event. In the widely accepted “chromospheric-evaporation condensation” model, localized heating at footpoints of a coronal loop drives plasma evaporation and eventually triggers condensation. The occurrence of condensation is strongly influenced by the characteristics of the heating. Various theoretical studies have been conducted along one-dimensional field lines with quasi-steady localized heating. The quasi-steady heating is regarded as the collection of multiple heating events among multiple strands constituting a coronal loop. However, it is reasonable to consider a single heating event along a single field line as an elemental unit. We investigated the condensation phenomenon triggered by a single heating event using 1.5-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations. By varying the magnitude of the localized heating rate, we explored the conditions necessary for condensation. We found that, when a heating rate approximately ~104 times greater than that of steady heating was applied, condensation occurred. Condensation was observed when the thermal conduction efficiency in the loop became lower than the cooling efficiency, with the cooling rate significantly exceeding the heating rate. Using the loop length L and the Field length λF, the condition for condensation is expressed as λF ≲ L/2 under conditions where cooling exceeds heating. We extended the analytically derived condition for thermal nonequilibrium to a formulation based on heating amount.

We use Hubble Space Telescope imaging to study the globular cluster system of the Virgo Cluster ultradiffuse galaxy (UDG) VCC 615. We select globular cluster candidates through a combination of size and color, while simultaneously rejecting contamination from background galaxies that would be unresolved in ground-based imaging. Our sample of globular cluster candidates is essentially complete down to a limiting magnitude of F814W = 24.0, ≈90% down the globular cluster luminosity function (GCLF). We estimate a total globular cluster population for VCC 615 of , resulting in a specific frequency of , quite high compared to normal galaxies of similar luminosity, but consistent with the large specific frequencies found in some other UDGs. The abundant cluster population suggests the galaxy is enshrouded by a massive dark halo, consistent with previous dynamical mass estimates using globular cluster kinematics. While the peak of the GCLF appears slightly brighter than expected (by ≈0.3–0.5 mag), this difference is comparable to the 0.3 mag uncertainty in the measurement, and we see no sign of an extremely luminous population of clusters similar to those detected in the UDGs NGC1054-DF2 and -DF4. However, we do find a relatively high fraction ( %) of large clusters with half-light radii Rh > 9 pc. The galaxy's offset nucleus appears photometrically distinct from the globular clusters, and is more akin to ultracompact dwarfs (UCDs) in Virgo. Over time, VCC615’s already diffuse stellar body may be further stripped by cluster tides, leaving the nucleus intact to form a new Virgo UCD.

<title>UNCOVER: Candidate Red Active Galactic Nuclei at 3 < z < 7 with JWST and ALMA</title>

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is revolutionizing our knowledge of z > 5 galaxies and their actively accreting black holes. Using the JWST Cycle 1 Treasury program Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam Observations before the Epoch of Reionization (UNCOVER) in the lensing field A2744, we report the identification of a sample of little red dots at 3 < zphot < 7 that likely contain highly reddened accreting supermassive black holes. Using a NIRCam-only selection to F444W < 27.7 mag, we find 26 sources over the ∼45 arcmin2 field that are blue in F115W − F200W ∼ 0 (or βUV ∼ –2.0 for fλ ∝ λβ), red in F200W − F444W = 1−4 (βopt ∼ +2.0), and are dominated by a point-source-like central component. Of the 20 sources with deep Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) 1.2 mm coverage, none are detected individually or in a stack. For the majority of the sample, spectral energy distribution fits to the JWST+ALMA observations prefer models with hot dust rather than obscured star formation to reproduce the red NIRCam colors and ALMA 1.2 mm nondetections. While compact dusty star formation cannot be ruled out, the combination of extremely small sizes (〈re〉 ≈ 50 pc after correction for magnification), red rest-frame optical slopes, and hot dust can be explained by reddened broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Our targets have faint M1450 ≈ −14 to −18 mag but inferred bolometric luminosities of Lbol = 1043–1046 erg s−1, reflecting their obscured nature. If the candidates are confirmed as AGNs with upcoming UNCOVER spectroscopy, then we have found an abundant population of reddened luminous AGNs that are at least ten times more numerous than UV-luminous AGNs at the same intrinsic bolometric luminosity.

<title>Stellar Metallicities from DECam u-band Photometry: A Study of Milky Way Ultra-faint Dwarf Galaxies</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9820</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We conducted an in-depth analysis of candidate member stars located in the peripheries of three ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxy satellites of the Milky Way (MW): Boötes I (Boo1), Boötes II (Boo2), and Segue I (Seg1). Studying these peripheral stars has previously been difficult due to contamination from the MW foreground. We used u-band photometry from the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) to derive metallicities to efficiently select UFD candidate member stars. This approach was validated on Boo1, where we identified both previously known and new candidate member stars beyond five half-light radii. We then applied a similar procedure to Boo2 and Seg1. Our findings hinted at evidence for tidal features in Boo1 and Seg1, with Boo1 having an elongation consistent with its proper motion and Seg1 showing some distant candidate stars, a few of which are along its elongation and proper motion. We find two Boo2 stars at large distances consistent with being candidate member stars. Using a foreground contamination rate derived from the Besançon Galaxy model, we ascribed purity estimates to each candidate member star. We recommend further spectroscopic studies on the newly identified high-purity members. Our technique offers promise for future endeavors to detect candidate member stars at large radii in other systems, leveraging metallicity-sensitive filters with the Legacy Survey of Space and Time and the new, narrowband Ca HK filter on DECam.

<title>Star−Disk Collisions: Implications for Quasi-periodic Eruptions and Other Transients near Supermassive Black Holes</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8911</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8911</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We use Athena++ to study the hydrodynamics of repeated star−accretion disk collisions close to supermassive black holes, and we discuss their implications for the origin of quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) and other repeating nuclear transients. We quantify the impact of the collisions on the stellar structure, the amount of stripped stellar debris, and the orbital properties of the debris. We provide simple fitting functions for the stellar mass loss per collision; the mass loss is much larger after repeated collisions, due to the dilute stellar atmosphere shock-heated in earlier collisions. The lifetime of the QPE-emitting phase set by stellar mass loss in star−disk collision models for QPEs is thus at most ∼1000 yr; it is shortest for eRO-QPE2, of order a few decades. The mass of the stripped stellar debris per collision and its orbital properties imply that currently observed QPEs are not powered by direct star−disk collisions but rather by collisions between the stellar debris liberated in previous collisions and the accretion disk (“circularization shocks”). We discuss how the hydrodynamics of this interaction can explain the diverse timing properties of QPEs, including the regular timing of GSN 069 and eRO-QPE2 and the large flare-to-flare timing variations observed in eRO-QPE1. QPEs with recurrence times of many days, if observed, may have more regular timing.

<title>The FENIKS Survey: Spectroscopic Confirmation of Massive Quiescent Galaxies at z ∼ 3–5</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8b30</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8b30</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The measured ages of massive, quiescent galaxies at z ∼ 3–4 imply that massive galaxies quench as early as z ∼ 6. While the number of spectroscopic confirmations of quiescent galaxies at z < 3 has increased over the years, there are only a handful at z > 3.5. We report spectroscopic redshifts of one secure (z = 3.757) and two tentative (z = 3.336 and z = 4.673) massive ( ) quiescent galaxies with 11 hr of Keck/MOSFIRE K-band observations. Our candidates were selected from the FLAMINGOS-2 Extragalactic Near-Infrared K-band Split (FENIKS) survey, which uses deep Gemini/Flamingos-2 KbKr imaging optimized for increased sensitivity to the characteristic red colors of galaxies at z > 3 with a strong Balmer/4000 Å break. The rest-frame UVJ and (ugi)s colors of three out of four quiescent candidates are consistent with 1–2 Gyr old stellar populations. This places these galaxies as the oldest objects at these redshifts, and challenges the notion that quiescent galaxies at z > 3 are all recently quenched, post-starburst galaxies. Our spectroscopy shows that the other quiescent-galaxy candidate is a broad-line active galactic nucleus (z = 3.594) with strong, redshifted Hβ + [O III] emission with a velocity offset > 1000 km s−1, indicative of a powerful outflow. The star formation history of our highest redshift candidate suggests that its progenitor was already in place by z ∼ 7–11, reaching ∼1011 M⊙ by z ≃ 8. These observations reveal the limit of what is possible with deep near-infrared photometry and targeted spectroscopy from the ground and demonstrate that secure spectroscopic confirmation of quiescent galaxies at z > 4 is feasible only with JWST.

<title>EPOCHS. IV. SED Modeling Assumptions and Their Impact on the Stellar Mass Function at 6.5 ≤ z ≤ 13.5 Using PEARLS and Public JWST Observations</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8c29</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8c29</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We utilize deep JWST Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) observations for the first direct constraints on the Galaxy Stellar Mass Function (GSMF) at z > 10. Our EPOCHS v1 sample includes 1120 galaxy candidates at 6.5 < z < 13.5 taken from a consistent reduction and analysis of publicly available deep JWST NIRCam data covering the Prime Extragalactic Areas for Reionization Science, CEERS, GLASS, JADES GOOD-S, NGDEEP, and SMACS0723 surveys, totaling 187 arcmin2. We investigate the impact of spectral energy distribution fitting methods, assumed star formation histories (SFHs), dust laws, and priors on galaxy masses and the resultant GSMF. While our fiducial GSMF agrees with the literature at z < 13.5, we find that the assumed SFH model has a large impact on the GSMF and stellar mass density (SMD), finding a 0.75 dex increase in the SMD at z = 10.5 between a flexible nonparametric and standard parametric SFH. Overall, we find a flatter SMD evolution at z ≥ 9 than some studies predict, suggesting a rapid buildup of stellar mass in the early Universe. We find no incompatibility between our results and those of standard cosmological models, as suggested previously, although the most massive galaxies may require a high star formation efficiency. We find that the “little red dot” galaxies dominate the z = 7 GSMF at high masses, necessitating a better understanding of the relative contributions of active galactic nucleus and stellar emission. We show that assuming a theoretically motivated top-heavy initial mass function (IMF) reduces stellar mass by 0.5 dex without affecting fit quality, but our results remain consistent with existing cosmological models with a standard IMF.

<title>Sub-Alfvénic Turbulence: Magnetic-to-kinetic Energy Ratio, Modification of Weak Cascade, and Implications for Magnetic Field Strength Measurements</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8d49</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8d49</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We study the properties of sub-Alfvénic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, i.e., turbulence with Alfvén mach number MA = VL/VA < 1, where VL is the velocity at the injection scale and VA is the Alfvén velocity. We demonstrate that MHD turbulence can have different properties, depending on whether it is driven by velocity or magnetic fluctuations. If the turbulence is driven by isotropic bulk forces acting upon the fluid, i.e., is velocity driven, in an incompressible conducting fluid we predict that the kinetic energy is times larger than the energy of magnetic fluctuations. This effect arises from the long parallel wavelength tail of the forcing, which excites modes with k∥/k⊥ < MA. We also predict that as the MHD turbulent cascade reaches the strong regime, the energy of slow modes exceeds the energy of Alfvén modes by a factor . These effects are absent if the turbulence is driven through magnetic fluctuations at the injection scale. We confirm our predictions with numerical simulations. Since the assumption of magnetic and kinetic energy equipartition is at the core of the Davis–Chandrasekhar–Fermi (DCF) approach to measuring magnetic field strength in sub-Alfvénic turbulence, we conclude that the DCF technique is not universally applicable. In particular, we suggest that the dynamical excitation of long azimuthal wavelength modes in the galactic disk may compromise the use of the DCF technique. We discuss alternative expressions that can be used to obtain magnetic field strength from observations and consider ways of distinguishing the cases of velocity and magnetically driven turbulence using observational data.

<title>Open Cluster Dynamics under the Influence of Outflow–Ambient Interactions</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad91a9</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Stars with outflows impinging on ambient gas experience accelerations due to the gravitational feedback from the interaction morphology between the outflow and the ambient gas. Such “negative dynamical friction” (NDF), in contrast to the conventional “dynamical friction” (DF), is studied for its impact on the dynamics of open clusters (OCs) immersed in a uniform ambient gas. We modify the N-body integration code REBOUND with both NDF and DF implemented according to the outflow conditions of each star in a consistently constructed OC. The evolution of stars is also involved in determining the gas–star interactions throughout their stellar lives. Compared to DF-only and gas-free models with identical initial conditions, the NDF-affected cluster is puffier and evaporates faster, as indicated by various diagnostics, including lower velocity dispersions and larger half-mass and half-light radii. Neutron stars with fast winds are expelled from the cluster due to their intensive NDF effect, even without the “kicks” by asymmetric supernovae. Exploration of parameter space confirms that the NDF effect is generally enhanced with higher ambient gas densities, in qualitative agreement with the expression of acceleration. Outflow–ambient interactions should be considered for the proper interpretation of the stellar dynamics evolution in clusters.

<title>A Systematic Search for Candidate Supermassive Black Hole Binaries Using Periodic Mid-infrared Light Curves of Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9245</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Periodic variability in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is a promising method for studying subparsec supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), which are a challenging detection target. While extensive searches have been made in the optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray bands, systematic infrared (IR) studies remain limited. Using data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), which provides unique decade-long mid-IR light curves with a six-month cadence, we have conducted the first systematic search for SMBHB candidates based on IR periodicity. Analyzing a parent sample of 48,932 objects selected from about half a million AGNs, we have identified 28 candidate periodic AGNs with periods ranging from 1268 to 2437 days (in the observer frame), by fitting their WISE light curves with sinusoidal functions. However, our mock simulation of the parent sample indicates that stochastic variability can actually produce a similar number of periodic sources, underscoring the difficulty in robustly identifying real periodic signals with WISE light curves, given their current sampling. Notably, we find no overlap between our sample and optical periodic sources, which can be explained by a distinct preference for certain periods due to selection bias. By combining archived data from different surveys, we have identified a candidate exhibiting periodic behavior in both the optical and IR bands, a phenomenon that warrants further validation through observational tests. Our results highlight the potential of IR time-domain surveys, including future missions such as the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, for identifying periodic AGNs, but complementary tests are still needed to determine their physical origins, such as SMBHBs.

<title>The Mega-MUSCLES Treasury Survey: X-Ray to Infrared Spectral Energy Distributions of a Representative Sample of M Dwarfs</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9251</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present 5–1 × 107 Å spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for 12 M dwarf stars covering spectral types M0–M8. Our SEDs are provided for community use as a sequel to the Measurements of the Ultraviolet Spectral Characteristics of Low-mass Exoplanetary Systems (MUSCLES) survey. The 12 stars include eight known exoplanet hosts and four stars chosen to fill out key parameter space in spectral type and rotation period. The SEDs are constructed from Hubble Space Telescope ultraviolet spectroscopy and XMM Newton, Chandra, and/or Swift X-ray observations, and completed with various model data, including Lyα reconstructions, PHOENIX optical models, APEC coronal models, and differential emission measure models in the currently-unobservable extreme ultraviolet. We provide a complete overview of the Mega-MUSCLES program, including a description of the observations, models, and SED construction. The SEDs are available as MAST high-level science products and we describe the various data products here. We also present ensemble measurements from our sample that are of particular relevance to exoplanet science, including the high-energy fluxes in the habitable zone and the far-ultraviolet to near-ultraviolet ratio. Combined with MUSCLES, Mega-MUSCLES provides SEDs covering a wide range of M dwarf spectral types and ages such that suitable proxies for any M dwarf planet host of interest may be found in our sample. However, we find that ultraviolet and X-ray fluxes can vary even between stars with similar parameters, such that observations of each exoplanet host star will remain the gold standard for interpreting exoplanet atmosphere observations.

<title>Young Stellar Object Jets Magnetocentrifugally Driven by Reconnecting Atmospheric Avalanche Accretion Streams above Inner Circumstellar Disks</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad927b</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad927b</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Fast, collimated jets are ubiquitous features of young stellar objects. They are generally thought to be powered by disk accretion, but the details are debated. Through 2D (axisymmetric) MHD simulations, we find that a fast (>100 km s−1) collimated bipolar jet is continuously driven along the north and south poles of a circumstellar disk that is initially magnetized by a large-scale open poloidal field and contains a thermally ionized inner magnetically active zone surrounded by a dead zone. The fast jet is primarily driven magnetocentrifugally by the release of the gravitational binding energy of the so-called “avalanche accretion streams” near the boundary of an evacuated poloidal field dominated polar region and a thick disk atmosphere raised by a toroidal magnetic field. Specifically, the fast outflow is driven along the upper (open) branch of the highly pinched poloidal field lines threading the (strongly magnetically braked) accretion streams, where the density is relatively low so that the lightly loaded material can be accelerated magnetocentrifugally along the open field line to a high speed. The highly pinched poloidal magnetic fields threading the avalanche accretion streams tend to reconnect, enabling mass to accrete to the center without dragging along the poloidal magnetic flux with it. The reconnection provides a potential heating source for producing chondrules and calcium- and aluminum-rich inclusions.

<title>Mapping the Dense Molecular Gas toward 13 Supernova Remnants</title>

Supernova remnants (SNRs) can exert strong influence on molecular clouds (MCs) through interaction by shock wave and cosmic rays. In this paper, we present our mapping observation of HCO+ and 1–0 lines toward 13 SNRs interacting with MCs, together with archival data of CO isotopes. Strong HCO+ emission is found in the fields of view of SNRs W30, G9.7−0.0, Kes 69, 3C 391, 3C 396, W51C, HC 40, and CTB109 in the local-standard-of-rest velocity intervals in which they are suggested to show evidence of SNR–MC interaction. We find an incomplete 12CO shell surrounding G9.7−0.0 with an expanding motion. This shell may be driven by the stellar wind of the SNR progenitor. We also find an arc of 12CO gas spatially coincident with the northwestern radio shell of Kes 69. As for the HCO+ line emission, SNRs 3C 391 and W51C exhibit significant line profile broadening indicative of shock perturbation, and CTB109 exhibits a possible blueshifted line wing brought by shock interaction. We do not find significant variation of the line ratio between broad-line and narrow-line regions, among different SNRs, and between MCs associated with SNRs and typical Galactic MCs. Therefore, we caution on using the line ratio as a diagnostic of SNR feedback and cosmic-ray (CR) ionization. We also estimate the N(HCO+)/N(CO) abundance ratio in 11 regions toward the observed SNRs, but they show little difference from the typical values in quiescent MCs, possibly because N(HCO+)/N(CO) is not an effective tracer of CR ionization.

<title>Radiatively Active Clouds and Magnetic Effects Explored in a Grid of Hot Jupiter GCMs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Cloud formation and magnetic effects are both expected to significantly impact the structures and observable properties of hot Jupiter atmospheres. For some hot Jupiters, thermal ionization and condensation can coexist in a single atmosphere, and both processes are important. We present a grid of general circulation models across a wide range of irradiation temperatures with and without incorporating the effects of magnetism and cloud formation to investigate how these processes work in tandem. We find that clouds are present in the atmosphere at all modeled irradiation temperatures, while magnetic effects are negligible for planets with irradiation temperatures cooler than 2000 K. At and above this threshold, clouds and magnetic fields shape atmospheres together, with mutual feedback. Models that include magnetism, through their influence on the temperature structure, produce more longitudinally symmetric dayside cloud coverage and more equatorially concentrated clouds on the nightside and morning terminator. To indicate how these processes would affect observables, we generate bolometric thermal and reflected phase curves from these models. The combination of clouds and magnetic effects increases thermal phase-curve amplitudes and decreases peak offsets more than either process does individually.

<title>Rising Near-ultraviolet Spectra in Stellar Megaflares</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9395</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Flares from M dwarf stars can attain energies up to 104 times larger than solar flares but are generally thought to result from similar processes of magnetic energy release and particle acceleration. Larger heating rates in the low atmosphere are needed to reproduce the shape and strength of the observed continua in stellar flares, which are often simplified to a blackbody model from the optical to the far-ultraviolet (FUV). The near-ultraviolet (NUV) has been woefully undersampled in spectral observations despite this being where the blackbody radiation should peak. We present Hubble Space Telescope NUV spectra in the impulsive phase of a flare with ETESS ≈ 7.5 × 1033 erg and a flare with ETESS ≈ 1035 erg and the largest NUV flare luminosity observed to date from an M star. The composite NUV spectra are not well represented by a single blackbody that is commonly assumed in the literature. Rather, continuum flux rises toward shorter wavelengths into the FUV, and we calculate that an optical T = 104 K blackbody underestimates the short-wavelength NUV flux by a factor of ≈6. We show that rising NUV continuum spectra can be reproduced by collisionally heating the lower atmosphere with beams of E ≳ 10 MeV protons or E ≳ 500 keV electrons and flux densities of 1013 erg cm−2 s−1. These are much larger than the canonical values describing accelerated particles in solar flares.

<title>Pulse-profile Modeling and Spin–Orbit Alignment in a Suzaku Sample of Accreting X-Ray Binary Pulsars</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9399</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9399</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report pulse-profile modeling of a sample of 23 X-ray binary pulsars observed with the Suzaku X-ray satellite. These pulsars have spin periods ranging from 0.7 to 9400 s, and their X-ray emission is powered by the accretion from their stellar companions. We fitted each individual pulse profile with the Polestar geometric model, which accounts for X-ray emission from two hot spots modeled as a simple combination of fan+pencil beam components, including an approximation for gravitational light bending. In 14 of 21 cases, our measurements of the inclinations of the pulsar spin axes broadly agree with the corresponding inclinations of the orbital planes of the binary systems determined by various other means, a striking outcome with a mere 6 × 10−7 probability of occurring by chance. The implications of our study are as follows: (a) apparently, accretion torques have had time to erase spin–orbit misalignment caused by supernova kicks in two-thirds of the systems; (b) many X-ray binary pulsars have dominant dipolar surface magnetic fields, in contrast to the recently reported exotic configurations in millisecond pulsars; and (c) if the binary inclinations can be determined by pulse-profile modeling, even for a subset of the ∼200 known X-ray binary pulsars, most of which orbital inclinations are as yet poorly constrained, it raises the prospect of tightening dramatically ongoing neutron-star mass determinations. This is because masses in binary systems overwhelmingly come from an orbital-mechanics formulation (Kepler’s third law), in which the dominant source of uncertainty is the inclination of the orbital plane.

<title>LMC Calls, Milky Way Halo Answers: Disentangling the Effects of the MW–LMC Interaction on Stellar Stream Populations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The infall of the LMC into the Milky Way (MW) has dynamical implications throughout the MW’s dark matter halo. We study the impact of this merger on the statistical properties of populations of simulated stellar streams. Specifically, we investigate the radial and on-sky angular dependence of stream perturbations caused by the direct effect of stream–LMC interactions and/or the response of the MW dark matter halo. We use a time-evolving MW–LMC simulation described by basis function expansions to simulate streams. We quantify the degree of perturbation using a set of stream property statistics including the misalignment of proper motions with the stream track. In the outer halo, direct stream–LMC interactions produce a statistically significant effect, boosting the fraction of misaligned proper motions by ∼25% relative to the model with no LMC. Moreover, there is on-sky angular dependence of stream perturbations: the highest fractions of perturbed streams coincide with the same on-sky quadrant as the present-day LMC location. In the inner halo, the MW halo dipole response primarily drives stream perturbations, but it remains uncertain whether this is a detectable signature distinct from the LMC’s influence. For the fiducial MW–LMC model, we find agreement between the predicted fraction of streams with significantly misaligned proper motions, , and Dark Energy Survey data. Finally, we predict this fraction for the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) footprint. Using LSST data will improve our constraints on dark matter models and LMC properties, as it is sensitive to both.

<title>Modeling the Center-to-limb Systematic in Normal-mode Coupling Measurements</title>

Solar meridional circulation (MC), which manifests as poleward flow near the surface, is a relatively weak flow. While MC has been measured through various local helioseismic techniques, there is a lack of consensus about the nature of the depth profile and location of return flow, owing to its small amplitude and poor signal-to-noise ratio in observations. The measurements are strongly hampered by systematic effects whose amplitudes are comparable to the signal induced by the flow, and modeling them is therefore crucial. The removal of the center-to-limb (C2L) systematic, which is the largest known feature hampering the inference of meridional flow, has been heuristically performed in helioseismic analyses, but its effect on global modes is not fully understood or modeled. Here, we propose both a way to model the C2L systematic and a method for estimation of meridional flow using global helioseismic cross-spectral analysis. We demonstrate that the systematic cannot be ignored while modeling the mode-coupling cross-spectral measurement, and thus is critical for the inference of MC. We also show that inclusion of a model for the C2L systematic improves shallow MC estimates from cross-spectral analysis.

<title>Multiwavelength Constraints on the Local Black Hole Occupation Fraction</title>

The fraction of dwarf galaxies hosting central, intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) at low redshifts is an important observational probe of black hole seeding at high redshift. Detections of nuclear accretion signatures in dwarf galaxies provides strong evidence for the presence of these IMBHs. We develop a Bayesian model to infer the black hole occupation fraction assuming a broken power-law Eddington ratio distribution function. Our approach accounts for nondetections, incompleteness, and contamination from star-forming-related emission. We apply this model to galaxies with X-ray data from the Chandra Source Catalog at distances <50 Mpc, radio data from the Very Large Array Sky Survey at <50 Mpc, and optical variability data from the Palomar Transient Factory at z < 0.055. We find a black hole occupation fraction of at least 90% at stellar masses of M⋆ = 108M⊙ and at least 39% at M⋆ = 107M⊙ (95% confidence intervals). We show the resulting black hole mass function. These constraints on the IMBH population have implications for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna mission and for cosmological models of black hole seeding and growth. We also constrain the extremely low-luminosity end (Lbol ≲ 1040 erg s−1) of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) luminosity functions at z = 0. Our AGN luminosity functions are broadly consistent with an extrapolation of the shallow slope of the AGN luminosity functions from previous work.

<title>Microlensing Events in Five Years of Photometry from the Zwicky Transient Facility</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad94e7</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad94e7</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Microlensing has a unique advantage for detecting dark objects in the Milky Way, such as free-floating planets, neutron stars, and stellar-mass black holes. Most microlensing surveys focus on the Galactic bulge, where higher stellar density leads to a higher event rate. However, microlensing events in the Galactic plane have closer lenses and longer timescales, which leads to a greater chance of measuring microlens parallax, providing an additional constraint on the mass of the lens. This work searches for microlensing events in Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) Data Release 17 from 2018 to 2023 in the Galactic plane region. We find 124 high-confidence microlensing events and 54 possible events, all available online (see footnote 11). Thus, with 2 yr of additional ZTF data in DR17, we have more than doubled the number of microlensing events (60) found in the previous 3 yr DR5 search. In the event selection, we use the efficient EventFinder algorithm to detect microlensing signals, which could be used for large data sets such as future ZTF data releases or data from the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time. Using detection efficiencies of ZTF fields obtained from catalog-level simulations, we calculate the mean Einstein timescale to be 〈tE〉 = 51.7 ± 3.3 days, smaller than previous results of the Galactic plane but within 1.5σ. We also calculate optical depths and event rates, although some caution is needed due to the use of visual inspection when creating our final sample. Spectroscopy of three possible candidates confirms their microlensing nature.

<title>A Spectro-temporal View of Normal Branch Oscillations in Cygnus X-2 as Seen by NICER and NuSTAR</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9588</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9588</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report the spectro-temporal study of the neutron star low mass X-ray binary Cygnus X-2 using NICER and NuSTAR data while the source was in the normal branch (NB). We detect a normal branch oscillation (NBO) feature at ∼5.41 Hz that appears in the middle portion of the NB branch. We note that the NBO appeared only in the 0.5–3 keV energy range, with maximum strength in the 1–2 keV energy band, but was absent in the 3–10 keV energy band of NuSTAR and NICER data. The energy spectrum of the source exhibits an emission feature at ∼1 keV, previously identified as the Fe L transition in the outer region of the accretion disk. Upon considering both the Fe L and NBO features, we suggest that the originating location of the Fe L line and the NBOs may coincide and perhaps be due to the same underlying mechanism. Therefore, lags seen in the frequency-/energy-dependent lag spectra of Cygnus X-2 could be considered to be arising from a region of photoionized material far from the central source. We study the frequency and energy-dependent lag spectra of the source, which exhibited a few millisecond hard lag at the NBO frequency (12–15 ms) and a switch from hard to soft lags at 1 keV. The rms spectrum peaks at 1 keV, and the covariance spectrum clearly resembles a thermal spectrum. We discuss the spectro-temporal behavior of the NBO and attempt to constrain its location of origin.

<title>The Relation between AGN and Host-galaxy Properties in the JWST Era. I. Seyferts at Cosmic Noon are Obscured and Disturbed</title>

The morphology of a galaxy reflects the mix of physical processes occurring within and around it, offering indirect clues to its formation and evolution. We apply both visual classification and computer vision to test the suspected connection between galaxy mergers and active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, as evidenced by a close/merging galaxy pair, or tidal features surrounding an apparently singular system. We use JADES JWST/NIRCam imagery of a complete, multiwavelength AGN sample recently expanded with JWST/Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) photometry. This 0.9–25 μm data set enables constraints on the host-galaxy morphologies of a broad range of AGN beyond z ∼ 1, including heavily obscured examples missing from previous studies. Our primary AGN sample consists of 243 lightly to highly obscured X-ray-selected AGN and 138 presumed Compton-thick, mid-infrared-bright/X-ray-faint AGN revealed by MIRI. Utilizing the shape asymmetry morphology indicator, AS, as the metric for disturbance, we find that 88% of the Seyferts sampled are strongly spatially disturbed (AS > 0.2). The experimental design we employ reveals a ≳3σ obscuration–merger (NH–AS) correlation at 0.6 < z < 2.4, and also recovers a physical distinction between the X-ray- and mid-IR-detected AGN suggestive of their link to a common evolutionary scenario. Placing the observed pattern of disturbances in the context of the other average host-galaxy properties, we conclude that mergers are common among obscured AGN. This finding presents tension with the leading model on AGN fueling that requires Seyfert AGN with subquasar luminosities (Lbol < 1045 erg s−1) to evolve only through nonmerger mechanisms.

<title>Magnetic Field Geometry and Anisotropic Scattering Effects on Solar Radio Burst Observations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The fine structures of solar radio bursts reveal complex dynamics in the corona, yet the observed characteristics of these subsecond bursts are additionally complicated by radio wave scattering in the turbulent solar corona. We examine the impact of anisotropic turbulence in radio wave propagation simulations with nonradial magnetic field structures in shaping the morphology, time characteristics, and source positions of fine structures. The apparent sources are found to move along the direction of the magnetic field lines and not along the density gradient, whereas the major axis of the scattered source is perpendicular to the local magnetic field (the scattering anisotropy axis). Using a dipolar magnetic field structure of an active region, we reproduce observed radio fine-structure source motion parallel to the solar limb associated with a coronal loop and provide a natural explanation for puzzling observations of solar radio burst position motions with the Low Frequency Array. Furthermore, the anisotropy aligned with a dipolar magnetic field causes the apparent-source images to bifurcate into two distinct components, with characteristic sizes smaller than in unmagnetized media. The temporal broadening induced by scattering reduces the observed frequency drift rate of fine structures, depending on the contribution of scattering to the time profile. The findings underscore the role of magnetic field geometry and anisotropic scattering for the interpretation of solar radio bursts and highlight that anisotropic scattering produces more than a single source.

<title>Frozen-field Modeling of Coronal Condensations with MPI-AMRVAC. II. Optimization and Application in 3D Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The frozen-field hydrodynamic (ffHD) model is a simplification of the full magnetohydrodynamical equations under the assumption of a rigid magnetic field, which significantly reduces computational complexity and enhances efficiency. In this work, we combine the ffHD prescription with hyperbolic thermal conduction (TC) and the Transition Region Adaptive Conduction (TRAC) method to achieve further optimization. A series of 2D tests are done to evaluate the performance of the hyperbolic TC and the TRAC method. The results indicate that hyperbolic TC, while showing limiter-affected numerical dissipation, delivers outcomes comparable to classic parabolic TC. The TRAC method effectively compensates for the underestimation of enthalpy flux in low-resolution simulations, as evaluated on tests that demonstrate prominence formation. We present an application of the ffHD model that forms a 3D prominence embedded in a magnetic flux rope, which develops into a stable slab-like filament. The simulation reveals a prominence with an elongated spine and a width consistent with observations, highlighting the potential of the ffHD model in capturing the dynamics of solar prominences. Forward modeling of the simulation data produces synthetic images at various wavelengths, providing insights into the appearance of prominences and filaments in different observational contexts. The ffHD model, with its computational efficiency and the demonstrated capability to simulate complex solar phenomena, offers a valuable tool for solar physicists, and is implemented in the open-source MPI-AMRVAC framework.

<title>Detecting Dark Objects with Plasma Microlensing by Their Gravitational Wakes</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A moving mass makes a gravitational wake in the partially ionized interstellar medium, which acts as a lens for radio-frequency light. Consequently, plasma microlensing could complement gravitational microlensing in the search for invisible massive objects, such as stellar remnants or compact dark matter. This work explores the spatial structure of the plasma lens associated with a gravitational wake. Far away from the moving mass, the characteristic lensing signal is the steady demagnification or magnification of a radio source as the wake passes in front of it at the speed of sound. Sources can be plasma-lensed at a much greater angular distance than they could be gravitationally lensed to the same degree by the same object. However, only the wakes of objects greatly exceeding stellar mass are expected to dominate over the random turbulence in the interstellar medium.

<title>NGC 628 in SIGNALS: Explaining the Abundance-ionization Correlation in H ii Regions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The variations of oxygen abundance and ionization parameter in H ii regions are usually thought to be the dominant factors that produced variations seen in observed emission-line spectra. However, if and how these two quantities are physically related is hotly debated in the literature. Using emission line data of NGC 628 observed with SITELLE as part of the Star formation, Ionized Gas, and Nebular Abundances Legacy Survey (SIGNALS), we use a suite of photoionization models to constrain the abundance and ionization parameters for over 1500 H ii regions throughout its disk. We measure an anticorrelation between these two properties, consistent with expectations, although with considerable scatter. Secondary trends with dust extinction and star formation rate surface density potentially explain the large scatter observed. We raise concerns throughout regarding various modeling assumptions and their impact on the observed correlations presented in the literature.

<title>Hierarchical Searches for Subsolar-mass Binaries and the Third-generation Gravitational Wave Detector Era</title>

Detecting gravitational waves (GWs) from coalescing compact binaries has become routine with ground-based detectors like Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. However, beyond standard sources such as binary black holes and neutron stars and neutron star black holes, no exotic sources revealing new physics have been discovered. Detecting ultracompact objects, such as subsolar mass (SSM), offers a promising opportunity to explore diverse astrophysical populations. However, searching for these objects using standard matched-filtering techniques is computationally intensive due to the dense parameter space involved. This increasing computational demand not only challenges current search methodologies but also poses a significant obstacle for third-generation (3G) ground-based GW detectors. In the 3G detectors, signals are expected to be observed for tens of minutes and detection rates to reach one per minute. This requires efficient search strategies to manage the computational load of long-duration signal search. In this paper, we demonstrate how hierarchical search strategies can address the computational challenges associated with detecting long-duration signals in current detectors and the 3G era. Using SSM searches as an example, we show that optimizing data sampling rates and adjusting the number of templates in matched filtering at each stage of low-frequency searches can improve the signal-to-noise ratio by 6% and detection volume by 10%–20%. This sensitivity improvement is achieved with a 2.5-fold reduction in computational time compared to standard PyCBC searches. We also discuss how this approach could be adapted and refined for searches involving eccentric and precessing binaries with future detectors.

<title>Magnetic Flux Transport in Advection-dominated Accretion Flow toward the Formation of a Magnetically Arrested Disk</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9742</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Magnetically arrested disks (MADs) have attracted much attention in recent years. The formation of MADs is usually attributed to the accumulation of a sufficient amount of dynamically significant poloidal magnetic flux. In this work, the magnetic flux transport within an advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) and the formation of an MAD are investigated. The structure and dynamics of an inner MAD connected with an outer ADAF are derived by solving a set of differential equations with suitable boundary conditions. We find that an inner MAD is eventually formed at a region about several 10 RS outside the horizon. Due to the presence of a strong large-scale magnetic field, the radial velocity of the accretion flow is significantly decreased. The angular velocity of the MAD region is highly sub-Keplerian with Ω ∼ (0.4–0.5)ΩK, and the corresponding ratio of gas to magnetic pressure is about β ≲ 1. Also, we find that an MAD is unlikely to be formed through the inward flux advection process when the external magnetic field strength is weak enough with βout ≳ 100 around Rout ∼ 1000 Rs. Based on a rough estimate, we find that the jet power of a black hole, with mass MBH and spin a*, surrounded by an ADAF with an inner MAD region is about 2 orders of magnitude larger than that of a black hole surrounded by a normal ADAF. This may account for the powerful jets observed in some Fanaroff–Riley type I galaxies with a very low Eddington ratio.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present radial profiles of luminosity-weighted age (ageL) and ΔΣSFR for various populations of high- and low-mass central and satellite galaxies in the TNG100 cosmological simulation. Using these profiles, we investigate the impact of intrinsic and environmental factors on the radial distribution of star formation. For both central galaxies and satellites, we investigate the effects of black hole mass, cumulative active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback energy, morphology, halo mass, and local galaxy overdensity on the profiles. In addition, we investigate the dependence of radial profiles of the satellite galaxies as a function of the redshifts at which they joined their hosts, as well as the net change in star-forming gas mass since the satellites joined their host. We find that high-mass (M* > 1010.5M⊙) central and satellite galaxies show evidence of inside-out quenching driven by AGN feedback. Effects from environmental processes only become apparent in averaged profiles at extreme halo masses and local overdensities. We find that the dominant quenching process for low-mass galaxies (M* < 1010M⊙) is environmental, generally occurring at low halo mass and high local galaxy overdensity for low-mass central galaxies and at high host halo masses for low-mass satellite galaxies. Overall, we find that environmental processes generally drive quenching from the outside-in.

<title>An Improved Halo Coronal Mass Ejection Geoeffectiveness Prediction Model Using Multiple Coronal Mass Ejection Features Based on the DC-PCA-KNN Method</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Coronal mass ejections (CME) are regarded as the main drivers of geomagnetic storms (GSs). In the prediction of geoeffectiveness, various CME features have been introduced without adequately considering the geoeffectiveness of CMEs and strong correlations among the features. In this study, a feature dimension reduction method combining distance correlation (DC) and principal component analysis (PCA) was employed for the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) model to predict the geoeffectiveness of halo CME by using the multiple CME features. First, based on CME features and the Disturbance Storm Time index, there are 169 CME-related GS (CME-GS) pairs that were defined as positive samples during the entire phases of solar cycles 23 and 24. Next, DC was used to screen the eight original CME features. It was found that the three CME features, such as acceleration, kinetic energy, and measurement position angle, were weakly correlated with CME-GS pairs according to the performance of KNN prediction models and then were discarded. In order to further reduce the dimension of the input features for the KNN prediction model, PCA was subsequently applied. And the above remaining five principal components were reduced to one. Finally, the DC-PCA-KNN prediction model, achieving a mean true positive rate of 0.6519 and an accuracy of 0.6494, performed well in the prediction of halo CME geoeffectiveness and was superior to the DC or PCA model alone.

<title>Constraining the Galactic Structure Using Time Domain Gravitational Wave Signal from Double White Dwarfs Detected by Space Gravitational Wave Detectors</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The gravitational wave (GW) signals from a large number of double white dwarfs (DWDs) in the Galaxy are expected to be detected by space GW detectors, e.g., the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), Taiji, and Tianqin in the millihertz band. In this paper, we present an alternative method by directly using the time-domain GW signal detected by space GW detectors to constrain the anisotropic structure of the Galaxy. The information of anisotropic distribution of DWDs is naturally encoded in the time-domain GW signal because of the variation of the detectors’ directions and consequently the pattern functions due to their annual motion around the Sun. The direct use of the time-domain GW signal enables simple calculations, such as utilizing an analytical method to assess the noise arising from the superposition of random phases of DWDs and using appropriate weights to improve the constraints. We investigate the possible constraints on the scale of the Galactic thin disk and bulge that may be obtained from LISA and Taiji by using this method with mock signals obtained from population synthesis models. We further show the different constraining capabilities of the low-frequency signal (foreground) and the high-frequency signal (resolvable sources) via the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, and find that the scale height and length of the Galactic thin disk and the scale radius of the bulge can be constrained to a fractional accuracy of ∼30%, 30%, 40% (or 20%, 10%, 40%) by using the low-frequency (or high-frequency) signal detected by LISA or Taiji.

<title>New Insight of Time-transformed Symplectic Integrator. I. Hybrid Methods for Hierarchical Triples</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Accurate N-body simulations of multiple systems such as binaries and triples are essential for understanding the formation and evolution of interacting binaries and binary mergers, including gravitational wave sources, blue stragglers, and X-ray binaries. The logarithmic time-transformed explicit symplectic integrator (LogH), also known as algorithmic regularization, is a state-of-the-art method for this purpose. However, we show that this method is accurate for isolated Kepler orbits because of its ability to trace Keplerian trajectories, but much less accurate for hierarchical triple systems. The method can lead to an unphysical secular evolution of inner eccentricity in Kozal–Lidov triples, despite a small energy error. We demonstrate that hybrid methods, which apply LogH to the inner binary and alternative methods to the outer bodies, are significantly more effective, though not symplectic. Additionally, we introduce a more efficient hybrid method, BlogH, which eliminates the need for time synchronization and is time symmetric. The method is implemented in the few-body code SDAR. We explore suitable criteria for switching between the LogH and BlogH methods for general triple systems. These hybrid methods have the potential to enhance the integration performance of hierarchical triples.

<title>Low Injection Rate of Cosmic-Ray Protons in the Turbulent Reacceleration Model of Radio Halos in Galaxy Clusters</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A giant radio halo (RH) is a diffuse synchrotron emission observed on the scale of megaparsecs, typically found in the central region of merging galaxy clusters. Its large size and steep spectrum suggest that it originates from the reenergization of an aged population of cosmic-ray electrons (CREs), while the secondary leptons produced in the pp hadronic collision of cosmic-ray protons (CRPs) may contribute to the emission. In this study, we investigate the reacceleration model including both primary and secondary CREs, assuming that the primary cosmic rays (CRs) originate from internal galaxies. In our new method, we follow the cosmological evolution of each cluster and calculate the energy spectra and 1D spatial distributions of CRs. The primary CRE model with a ∼3 Gyr duration of reacceleration successfully reproduces the statistical properties of the RHs observed in the recent LOFAR survey, as well as the spectrum and profile of the Coma cluster. The gamma-ray and neutrino emissions produced by reaccelerated CRPs are consistent with the upper limits. However, if the CRP injection rate is high and the secondary CREs become significant, the model with the required ∼3 Gyr reacceleration overproduces the number of RHs. The limit on the CRP injection rate, Lp ≲ 1041 erg s−1, is significantly lower than that expected from the early starburst activity or jets from active galactic nuclei. This discrepancy requires a revision of either the model of CR supply from galaxies or the turbulent reacceleration model.

<title>Analysis of Gamma-Ray Burst Closure Relationship in Multiple Wavelengths</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are intense pulses of high-energy emission associated with the death of massive stars or compact objects’ coalescence. Their multiwavelength observations help verify the reliability of the standard fireball model. We analyze 14 GRBs observed contemporaneously in gamma rays by the Fermi Large Area Telescope, in X-rays by the Swift Telescope, and in the optical bands by Swift and many ground-based telescopes. We study the correlation between the spectral and temporal indices using closure relations according to the synchrotron forward-shock model in a stratified medium (n ∝ r−k) with k ranging from 0 to 2.5. We find that the model without energy injection is preferred over the one with energy injection in all the investigated wavelengths. In gamma rays, we only explored the ν > max{νc, νm} (slow cooling, SC/fast cooling, FC) cooling condition (where νc and νm are the cooling and characteristic frequencies, namely the frequencies at the spectral break). In the X-ray and optical bands, we explored all the cooling conditions, including νm < ν < νc (SC), νc < ν < νm (FC), and SC/FC, and found a clear preference for SC for X-rays and SC/FC for optical. Within these cooling conditions, X-rays exhibit the highest rate of occurrence for the density profile with k = 0, while the optical band has the highest occurrence for k = 2.5 when considering no energy injection. Although we can pinpoint a definite environment for some GRBs, we find degeneracies in other GRBs.

<title>Milky Way Dark Matter Distribution or MOND Test from Vertical Stellar Kinematics with Gaia DR3</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad94f5</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Vertical stellar kinematics+density can be used to trace the dark matter distribution (or the equivalent phantom mass in a Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) scenario) through the Jeans equations. In this paper, we want to improve this type of analysis by making use of the recent data of the 6D information from the Gaia DR3 survey in the anticenter and the Galactic poles to obtain the dynamical mass distribution near plane regions, including extended kinematics over a wide region of 8 kpc < R < 22 kpc, ∣z∣ < 3 kpc. Our conclusions are as follows: (i) the model of the spherical dark matter halos and the MOND model are compatible with the data; (ii) the model of the disky matter (with density proportional to the gas density) is excluded; (iii) the total lack of dark matter (there is only visible matter) within Newtonian gravity is compatible with the data; for instance, at solar Galactocentric radius, we obtained Σ = 39 ± 18 M⊙ pc−2 for z = 1.05 kpc, compatible with the expected value for visible matter alone of 44 M⊙ pc−2, thus allowing zero dark matter. Similarly, for R > R⊙, z = 1.05 kpc, Σ = 28.7 ± 9.6, 23.0 ± 5.7, 16.9 ± 5.8, and 11.4 ± 6.6 M⊙ pc−2, respectively, for R = 10, 13, 16, and 19 kpc, compatible with visible matter alone. Larger error bars in comparison with previous works are not due to worse data or a more awkward technique but to a stricter modeling of the stellar distribution.

<title>Bar Formation and Destruction in the FIRE-2 Simulations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The physical mechanisms responsible for bar formation and destruction in galaxies remain a subject of debate. While we have gained valuable insight into how bars form and evolve from isolated idealized simulations, in the cosmological domain, galactic bars evolve in complex environments, with mergers and gas accretion events occurring in the presence of the turbulent interstellar medium with multiple star formation episodes, in addition to coupling with their host galaxies’ dark matter halos. We investigate the bar formation in 13 Milky Way–mass galaxies from the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE-2) cosmological zoom-in simulations. 8 of the 13 simulated galaxies form bars at some point during their history: three from tidal interactions and five from internal evolution of the disk. The bars in FIRE-2 are generally shorter than the corotation radius (mean bar radius ∼1.53 kpc), have a wide range of pattern speeds (36–97 km s−1 kpc−1), and live for a wide range of dynamical times (2–160 bar rotations). We find that the bar formation in FIRE-2 galaxies is influenced by satellite interactions and the stellar-to-dark-matter mass ratio in the inner galaxy, but neither is a sufficient condition for bar formation. Bar formation is more likely to occur, with the bars formed being stronger and longer-lived, if the disks are kinematically cold; galaxies with high central gas fractions and/or vigorous star formation, on the other hand, tend to form weaker bars. In the case of the FIRE-2 galaxies, these properties combine to produce ellipsoidal bars with strengths A2/A0 ∼ 0.1–0.2.

To address the discrepancy where disk sizes exceed those predicted by standard models, we explore two extensions to disk size estimates within the UV/optical wavelength range: disk winds and color correction. We provide detailed, self-consistent derivations and analytical formulas, including those based on a power-law temperature approximation, offering efficient tools for analyzing observational data. Applying our model to four type I active galactic nuclei with intensive reverberation mapping observations, we find a shallower temperature slope (T ∝ R−0.66, compared to R−3/4 traditionally) and a color-correction factor (fcol ≈ 1.6), consistent with previous studies. We observe a positive correlation between accretion rate and color correction with black hole mass. However, the small sample size limits our conclusions. The strong degeneracy between the temperature slope and accretion rate suggests that incorporating flux spectra or spectral energy distributions could improve fitting accuracy. Our simulation approach rapidly generates quasar light curves while accommodating various observational scenarios for reverberation mapping, making it well-suited for training machine learning algorithms.

<title>Analysis of Solar Eruptions Deflecting in the Low Corona: Influence of the Magnetic Environment</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) can exhibit nonradial evolution. The background magnetic field is considered the main driver for the trajectory deviation relative to the source region. The influence of the magnetic environment has been largely attributed to the gradient of the magnetic pressure. In this work, we propose a new approach for investigating the role of topology on CME deflection and for quantifying and comparing the action between the magnetic field gradient (“gradient” path) and the topology (“topological” path). We investigate eight events simultaneously observed by the Solar Orbiter, STEREO-A, and the Solar Dynamics Observatory; and, with a new tracking technique, we reconstruct the 3D evolution of the eruptions. Then, we compare their propagation with the predictions from the two magnetic drivers. We find that the “topological” path describes the CME actual trajectory much better than the more traditional “gradient path.” Our results strongly indicate that the ambient topology may be the dominant driver for deflections in the low corona, and that this presents a promising method for estimating the direction of propagation of CMEs early in their evolution.

<title>Self-interacting Dark Matter, Core Collapse, and the Galaxy–Galaxy Strong-lensing Discrepancy</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters has emerged as a powerful tool to probe the standard cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm of structure formation in the Universe. Despite the remarkable explanatory power of CDM on large scales, tensions with observations on small scales have been reported. Recent studies find that the observational cross section for galaxy–galaxy strong lensing (GGSL) in clusters exceeds the CDM prediction by more than an order of magnitude and persists even after rigorous examination of various possible systematics. We investigate the impact of modifying the internal structure of cluster dark matter subhalos on GGSL and report that altering the inner density profile, given by rγ, to steeper slopes with γ > 2.5 can alleviate the GGSL discrepancy. This is steeper than slopes obtained with the inclusion of the contribution of baryons to the inner regions of these subhalos. Deviating from the γ ~ 1.0 cusps that CDM predicts, these steeper slopes could arise in models of self-interacting dark matter undergoing core collapse. Our results motivate additional study of subhalo core collapse in dense cluster environments.

<title>Diffusion-HMC: Parameter Inference with Diffusion-model-driven Hamiltonian Monte Carlo</title>

Diffusion generative models have excelled at diverse image generation and reconstruction tasks across fields. A less explored avenue is their application to discriminative tasks involving regression or classification problems. The cornerstone of modern cosmology is the ability to generate predictions for observed astrophysical fields from theory and constrain physical models from observations using these predictions. This work uses a single diffusion generative model to address these interlinked objectives—as a surrogate model or emulator for cold dark matter density fields conditional on input cosmological parameters, and as a parameter inference model that solves the inverse problem of constraining the cosmological parameters of an input field. The model is able to emulate fields with summary statistics consistent with those of the simulated target distribution. We then leverage the approximate likelihood of the diffusion generative model to derive tight constraints on cosmology by using the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method to sample the posterior on cosmological parameters for a given test image. Finally, we demonstrate that this parameter inference approach is more robust to small perturbations of noise to the field than baseline parameter inference networks.

<title>On the Nature of the Dark Cavity of Solar Coronal Mass Ejections</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad98e9</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad98e9</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Earlier studies have shown that less than one-third of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) possess the archetypical three-part (bright core, dark cavity, and bright front) structure in the outer corona (e.g., 2–6 R⊙). In the traditional opinion, the core, cavity, and front correspond to the erupted filament, magnetic flux rope (MFR), and plasma pileup along the MFR border, respectively. Recent studies have demonstrated that nearly 100% of normal CMEs have a three-part structure in the inner corona (<2 R⊙), agreeing with the prediction of a new explanation of the nature of the three-part structure. In the new opinion, the core and front correspond to the MFR plasma and plasma pileup along the coronal loops, respectively. The cavity is either a part of the MFR, or a low-density zone between the front and the MFR. In this paper, we revisit a textbook case of an eruption that occurred on 2017 September 10. In the inner corona, the CME exhibited a clear three-part appearance in the extreme-ultraviolet images and had a smooth-curved front, while, in the outer corona, the CME loses the three-part feature as the core expands and the cavity disappears. Meanwhile, a bulge appears at the CME front as the core moves faster than the front and protrudes from its bottom. It is difficult to understand the disappearance of the cavity and the appearance of the bulge if assuming the cavity as being a part of the MFR. Therefore, we suggest that the dark cavity represents a low-density zone between the front and MFR in the early eruption stage.

<title>The Intrinsic Flattening of Galaxy Disks</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Highly inclined (edge-on) disk galaxies offer the unique perspective to constrain their intrinsic flattening, c/a, where c and a are, respectively, the vertical and long radial axes of the disk measured at suitable stellar densities. The ratio c/a is a necessary quantity in the assessment of galaxy inclinations, three-dimensional structural reconstructions, and total masses, as well as a constraint to galaxy formation models. The 3.6 μm maps of 133 edge-on spiral galaxies from the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S4G) and its early-type galaxy extension are used to revisit the assessment of c/a free from dust extinction and away from the influence of a stellar bulge. We present a simple definition of c/a and explore trends with other galactic physical parameters: total stellar mass, concentration index, total H i mass, mass of the central mass concentration, circular velocity, model-dependent scales, and Hubble type. Other than a dependence on early/late Hubble types and a related trend with light concentration, no other parameters were found to correlate with the intrinsic flattening of spiral galaxies. The latter is mostly constant with 〈c/a〉 = 0.124 ± 0.001 (stat) ± 0.033 (intrinsic/systematic) and greater for earlier types.

<title>Grain Size in the Class I Protostellar System TMC-1A Constrained with ALMA and Very Large Array Observations</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad938e</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The disk mass and substructure in young stellar objects suggest that planet formation may start at the protostellar stage, through the growth of dust grains. To accurately estimate the grain size at the protostellar stage, we have observed the Class I protostar TMC-1A using the Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) at the Q (7 mm) and Ka (9 mm) bands at a resolution of ∼0.″2 and analyzed archival data of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at Bands 6 (1.3 mm) and 7 (0.9 mm) that cover the same spatial scale. The VLA images show a compact structure with a size of ∼25 au and a spectral index of ∼2.5. The ALMA images show compact and extended structures with a spectral index of ∼2 at the central ∼40 au region and another index of ∼3.3 in the outer region. Our spectral energy distribution analysis using the observed fluxes at the four bands suggests one branch with a small grain size of ∼0.12 mm and another with a grown grain size of ∼4 mm. We also model polarized dust continuum emission adopting the two grain sizes and compare them with an observational result of TMC-1A, suggesting that the small grain size is preferable to the grown grain size. The small grain size implies gravitational instability in the TMC-1A disk, which is consistent with a spiral-like component recently identified.

<title>Toward Understanding the Evolutionary Role of Star-forming Lenticular Galaxies: New H i Detections and Comparison with Quiescent S0s and Red Spirals</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
As one type of blue early-type galaxy, the evolutionary history and fate of star-forming lenticular galaxies (S0s) remain elusive. We selected 134 star-forming S0s from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV MaNGA survey and found that they have steep and warped size–mass relations, similar to quiescent S0s and red spirals, indicating that they may have similar gas dissipation scenarios. These galaxies have a higher central stellar mass surface density than normal blue spirals. The radial profiles of Dn4000 and [Mgb/Fe] show that red spirals and quiescent S0s have similar old central populations and high [Mgb/Fe] values, suggesting rapid bulge formation, though red spirals exhibit a steeper gradient possibly due to residual star formation (SF) in outer regions. In contrast, star-forming S0s exhibit profiles between quiescent S0s/red spirals and normal blue spirals, with relatively flat Dn4000 and [Mgb/Fe] gradients. More long-term SF history causes normal blue spirals to have very flat Dn4000 and [Mgb/Fe] profiles, and the majority of them (79% ± 5%) have a Sérsic index of <2. We also found that the halo mass of star-forming S0s resembles that of quiescent S0s/red spirals, with 82% ± 5% exceeding the critical mass (Mhalo = 1012M⊙h−1). To supplement previous H i detection of star-forming S0s covered by H iMaNGA, we obtained new observations for H i emission from 41 star-forming S0s in our sample using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope. We found that the H i mass distribution of star-forming S0s matches that of normal blue spirals, although both star-forming S0s and red spirals are relatively gas-poor, resulting in varying atomic gas depletion times due to different SF levels. Based on these observational results, we discuss the possible evolutionary scenarios of star-forming S0s.

<title>Threshold Mass of the General-relativistic Instability for Supermassive Star Cores</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The dependence of the final fate of supermassive star (SMS) cores on their mass and angular momentum is studied with simple modeling. SMS cores in the hydrogen-burning phase encounter the general-relativistic instability during stellar evolution if the mass is larger than ∼3 × 104M⊙. Spherical SMS cores in the helium-burning phase encounter the general-relativistic instability prior to the onset of the electron–positron pair instability if the mass is larger than ∼1 × 104M⊙. For rapidly rotating SMS cores, these values for the threshold mass are enhanced by up to a factor of ∼5, and thus, for SMSs with mass smaller than ∼104M⊙, the collapse is triggered by the pair instability, irrespective of the rotation. After the onset of the general-relativistic instability, SMS cores in the hydrogen-burning phase with reasonable metallicity are likely to collapse to a black hole irrespective of the degree of rotation, whereas SMS cores in the helium-burning phase could explode via nuclear burning with no black hole formation, as previous works demonstrate.

<title>Instabilities along the Axis of the Heliospheric Jets</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad93a5</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The heliosphere is influenced by the interaction of neutral hydrogen atoms from the interstellar medium with protons in the heliosheath (HS). The confinement by the solar magnetic field of the HS plasma forms distinct north and south heliospheric jets. Previous global MHD simulations of the heliosphere reveal that instabilities can develop in the heliospheric jets and make them become unstable, giving rise to large-scale turbulence. In this study, we show that there is a low-speed region of solar wind in the HS that provides a precondition for instabilities to develop. The low-speed region is formed due to charge exchange and magnetic tension. This region allows sufficient time for the instabilities to develop and induces a shear flow inside the HS leading to the development of a Kelvin–Helmholtz (K-H) instability. The estimated growth timescale of the K-H instability based on the simulation results is around 5–7 yr. Understanding the development of the instabilities in the HS is crucial for comprehending the dynamic processes within the HS and the structure of the heliosphere.

<title>Long Plateau Doth So: How Internal Heating Sources Affect Hydrogen-rich Supernova Light Curves</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Some hydrogen-rich core-collapse supernovae (SNeIIP) exhibit evidence of a sustained energy source powering their light curves, resulting in a brighter and/or longer-lasting hydrogen recombination plateau phase. We present a semi-analytic SNIIP light-curve model that accounts for the effects of an arbitrary internal heating source, considering as special cases 56Ni/56Co decay, a central engine (magnetar or accreting compact object), and shock interaction with a dense circumstellar disk. While a sustained internal power source can boost the plateau luminosity commensurate with the magnitude of the power, the duration of the recombination plateau can typically be increased by at most a factor of ∼2–3 compared to the zero-heating case. For a given ejecta mass and initial kinetic energy, the longest plateau duration is achieved for a constant heating rate at the highest magnitude that does not appreciably accelerate the ejecta. This finding has implications for the minimum ejecta mass required to explain particularly long-lasting SNe, such as iPTF14hls, and for confidently identifying rare explosions of the most massive hydrogen-rich (e.g., Population III) stars. We present a number of analytic estimates that elucidate the key features of the detailed model.

<title>Precise Measurements of the LMC Bar’s Geometry with Gaia DR3 and a Novel Solution to Crowding-induced Incompleteness in Star Counting</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present new measurements of the 2D geometry of the LMC’s stellar bar with precise astrometric observations of red clump stars in Gaia DR3. We develop a novel solution to tackle crowding-induced incompleteness in Gaia data sets with the Gaia BP-RP color excess. Utilizing the color excess information, we derive a 2D completeness map of the LMC’s disk. We find that incompleteness biases the bar measurements and induces large uncertainties. With the completeness-corrected 2D red clump map, we precisely measure the LMC bar’s properties using Fourier decomposition. The bar radius (semimajor axis) is kpc, and its position angle is 121.°26 ± 0.°21. The bar’s strength as quantified by the Fourier bi-symmetric amplitude is Sbar = 0.27, indicating that the LMC has a significant bar perturbation. We find the bar has an axis ratio of 0.54 ± 0.03, and is offset with respect to the center of the outer disk isophote at R ≈ 5 kpc by 0.76 ± 0.01 kpc. These LMC bar properties agree with a hydrodynamic model where the SMC has undergone a recent direct collision with the LMC. We compare the LMC’s bar properties with other barred galaxies in the local Universe, and discover that the LMC is similar to other barred galaxies in terms of bar-galaxy scaling relations. We discuss how our completeness correction framework can be applied to other systems in the Local Group.

<title>Diversity in Hydrogen-rich Envelope Mass of Type II Supernovae. II. SN 2023ixf as Explosion of Partially Stripped Intermediate Massive Star</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8d5a</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8d5a</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
SN 2023ixf is one of the most well-observed core-collapse supernovae in recent decades, yet there is inconsistency in the inferred zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) mass MZAMS of its progenitor. Direct observations of the pre-supernova (SN) red supergiant (RSG) estimate MZAMS spanning widely from 11 to 18 M⊙. Additional constraints, including the host environment and the pulsation of its progenitor RSG, suggest a massive progenitor with MZAMS > 17 M⊙. However, the analysis of the SN properties, from light-curve modeling to late-phase spectroscopy, favors a relatively low-mass scenario (MZAMS < 15 M⊙). In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis of SN 2023ixf, from the RSG progenitor, plateau phase light curve to late-phase spectroscopy. Using MESA+STELLA to simulate the RSG progenitor and their explosions, we find that a range of the RSG models having MZAMS that vary from 12 to 17.5 M⊙ can reproduce its multiband light curves if the hydrogen-rich envelope mass and the explosion energy are allowed to vary. Using late-phase spectroscopy as an independent measurement, the oxygen line [O i] indicates an intermediate-massive progenitor (MZAMS ∼ 16.0 M⊙). By incorporating the velocity structure derived from the light-curve modeling into an axisymmetric model, we generated [O i] line profiles that are consistent with the [O i] line observed in late-phase spectroscopy of SN 2023ixf. Bringing these analyses together, we conclude that SN 2023ixf is the aspherical explosion of an intermediate-massive star (MZAMS = 15–16 M⊙), with the hydrogen envelope being stripped to 4–5 M⊙ prior to its explosion.

<title>The Rotation Properties of δ Sct and γ Dor Stars</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Based on the LAMOST spectroscopy and TESS time-series photometry, we have obtained a main-sequence star sample of δ Scuti and γ Doradus stars. The sample includes 1534 δ Sct stars, 367 γ Dor stars, 1703 δ Sct ∣γ Dor stars, 270 γ Dor ∣δ Sct stars, along with 105 “dsct candidates” and 32 “gdor candidates”. After correcting for projection effects, we derived the equatorial rotational velocity distribution for δ Sct and γ Dor stars and compared it with that of normal stars. The rotational velocity distributions of δ Sct and γ Dor stars are extremely similar, with the only difference potentially due to the rotational variable stars that have not been completely removed. In contrast, the rotational velocity distribution of normal stars is more dispersed compared to pulsating stars. Additionally, the peak rotational velocity of the pulsating stars is about 10 km s−1 higher than that of normal stars. Unlike the normal stars, which show a monotonic increase in peak velocity with mass between 1.8 and 2.5 M⊙, the rotational velocity distribution of δ Sct stars does not exhibit a strong mass dependence. We also found that normal stars accelerate during the late main-sequence evolutionary phase, while δ Sct stars decelerate. Furthermore, there may still be unclassified stars with diverse rotational properties in the normal star sample compared to the δ Sct stars, which is likely to be an important contributor to the broader dispersion observed in its rotational velocity distribution. The photometric amplitude in δ Sct stars is modulated with rotational velocity, with high-amplitude stars typically rotating slowly and low-amplitude stars showing a broad distribution of rotational velocities.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The radioactive power generated by materials within the ejecta of a binary-neutron-star (BNS) merger powers an optical transient known as a kilonova. When the central remnant of a BNS merger is a long-lived magnetar, it continuously produces a highly magnetized wind, altering both the dynamics and temperature of the ejecta, leading to the expected emergence of an engine-fed kilonova. In the first paper of this series, we conducted a detailed study of the dynamics of wind-ejecta interaction and the efficiency of energy injection through shocks. In this work, we combine this dynamical evolution with both shock-heating and additional X-ray irradiation to model photon diffusion within a constant-opacity ejecta. By calculating the radiation, we obtain the light curve and spectral energy distribution (SED). Our findings reveal that, with energy injection, a blue bump typically appears in the early stages (≲1 day). Furthermore, if the magnetar has not spun down by that time, a brightening in the later stages occurs. Despite this, in a large parameter space, the expected luminosity of the engine-fed kilonova is not significantly higher than the typical r-process kilonova due to limited heating efficiency. The SED of engine-fed kilonovae peaks in the relatively blue band in the early stages and evolves toward the red, but at a slower rate compared to the typical r-process kilonova.

<title>Radial Velocity and Astrometric Evidence for a Close Companion to Betelgeuse</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad93c8</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We examine a century of radial velocity, visual magnitude, and astrometric observations of the nearest red supergiant, Betelgeuse, in order to reexamine the century-old assertion that Betelgeuse might be a spectroscopic binary. These data reveal Betelgeuse varying stochastically over years and decades due to its boiling, convective envelope, periodically with a 5.78 yr long secondary period (LSP), and quasiperiodically from pulsations with periods of several hundred days. We show that the LSP is consistent between astrometric and radial velocity data sets, and argue that it indicates a low-mass companion to Betelgeuse, less than a solar mass, orbiting in a 2110 day period at a separation of just over twice Betelgeuse’s radius. The companion star would be nearly 20 times less massive and a million times fainter than Betelgeuse, with similar effective temperature, effectively hiding it in plain sight near one of the best-studied stars in the night sky. The astrometric data favor an edge-on binary with orbital plane aligned with Betelgeuse’s measured spin axis. Tidal spin–orbit interaction drains angular momentum from the orbit and spins up Betelgeuse, explaining the spin–orbit alignment and Betelgeuse’s anomalously rapid spin. In the future, the orbit will decay until the companion is swallowed by Betelgeuse in the next 10,000 yr.

<title>Glitches and Glitching Clusters in Rotation-powered Pulsars</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The study of pulsar glitch phenomena serves as a valuable probe into the dynamic properties of matter under extreme high-density conditions, offering insights into the physics within neutron stars. Providing theoretical explanations for the diverse manifestations observed in different pulsars has proven to be a formidable challenge. By analyzing the distribution of glitch sizes and waiting times, along with the evolution of cumulative glitch sizes over time, we have uncovered a long-term clustering phenomenon for pulsar glitches. This perspective allows us to approach the distinct glitch representations in various pulsars from a unified standpoint, connecting the same periodicity of observational data to the randomness. Without relying on specific physical models, we utilized the coefficient of variation to numerically determine optimal clustering numbers and clustering periods for sample pulsars. Our analysis involving 27 pulsars has revealed a clear linear relationship between the glitch cluster period and characteristic age. Of interest, the cumulative distribution of functions of cluster sizes and interval times have the same patterns, which can be synchronously fitted by Gaussian processes. These results may indicate novel understandings of glitches and the resulting processes.

<title>A Novel Approach to Understanding the Link between Supermassive Black Holes and Host Galaxies</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad93d4</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad93d4</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The strongest and most universal scaling relation between a supermassive black hole (BH) and its host galaxy is known as the M•–σ relation, where M• is the mass of the central BH, and σ is the stellar velocity dispersion of the host galaxy. This relation has been studied for decades and is crucial for estimating BH masses of distant galaxies. However, recent studies suggest the potential absence of central BHs in some galaxies, and a significant portion of current data only provides upper limits for the mass. Here, we introduce a novel approach using a Bayesian hurdle model to analyze the M•–σ relation across 244 galaxies. This model integrates upper mass limits and the likelihood of hosting a central BH, combining logistic regression for BH hosting probability with a linear regression of mass on σ. From the logistic regression, we find that galaxies with a velocity dispersion of 11, 34, and 126 km s−1 have a 50%, 90%, and 99% probability of hosting a central BH, respectively. Furthermore, from the linear regression portion of the model, we find that M• ∝ σ5.8, which is significantly steeper than the slope reported in earlier studies. Our model also predicts a population of undermassive BHs (M• = 10–105M⊙) in galaxies with σ ≲ 127 km s−1 and overmassive BHs (M• ≥ 1.8 × 107) above this threshold. This reveals an unexpected abundance of galaxies with intermediate-mass and ultramassive BHs, accessible to next-generation telescopes like the Extremely Large Telescope.

<title>Decoding the Future of Exoplanets: Asteroseismic Confirmation of Subgiant and Red Giant Hosts</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Asteroseismology has emerged as a powerful tool to unravel the intricate relationships between evolved stars and their planetary systems. In this study, we leverage this technique to investigate the evolutionary stages of five exoplanet host stars, each exhibiting solar-like oscillations. Building on our previous work that identified two host stars as red clump and red giant branch (RGB) stars, this study focuses on a new and broader sample. By precisely measuring asteroseismic parameters such as the period spacing of dipole gravity modes (ΔΠ1), we provide definitive confirmation of these stars’ evolutionary states as subgiants or RGB stars. These results are not only crucial for understanding the internal structures of evolved stars but also for predicting the eventual fate of their planetary companions, which may face engulfment as their host stars expand. This research highlights the profound role of asteroseismology in advancing our knowledge of planetary system evolution and opens new pathways for exploring how stellar evolution impacts planetary survival. Our findings set the stage for future studies on the dynamic fates of exoplanets, providing key insights into the intricate processes of stellar and planetary evolution.

<title>Diversity in Hydrogen-rich Envelope Mass of Type II Supernovae. I. Plateau Phase Light-curve Modeling</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8b19</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8b19</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a systematic study of Type II supernovae (SNe II) originating from progenitors with effective temperatures (Teff) and luminosities closely resembling red supergiants (RSGs) observed in pre-supernova (SN) images and in the Galaxy. Using Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics, we compute a large grid of massive stars with Teff ranging from 3200 to 3800 K at their RSG phases, with hydrogen envelopes artificially stripped to varying extents (3–10 M⊙). The light curves of SNe IIP resulting from the explosions of these Galactic-RSG–like progenitors are modeled using STELLA. Our survey of the light curves reveals that partial stripping of the hydrogen envelope creates diversity in the magnitude and duration of SNe IIP light curves, without affecting the position of the RSG progenitor on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram. For these Galactic-RSG-like progenitor models, we establish an indicator based on the light-curve properties to estimate the hydrogen envelope mass. Additionally, we discuss the effects of material mixing and 56Ni heating. Applying our model grid to a large sample of approximately 100 observed SNe IIP reveals a considerably broader range of hydrogen-rich envelope masses than predicted by standard stellar wind models. This finding suggests that if SNe IIP are explosions of Galactic-like RSGs to explain the diversity in the observed light curves, a significant fraction of them must have experienced substantial mass loss beyond the standard mass-loss prescription prior to their explosions. This finding highlights the uncertainties involved in massive star evolution and the pre-SN mass-loss mechanism.

<title>Once a Triple, Not Always a Triple: The Evolution of Hierarchical Triples That Yield Merged Inner Binaries</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad944a</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad944a</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
More than half of all main-sequence (MS) stars have one or more companions, and many of those with initial masses <8 M⊙ are born in hierarchical triples. These systems feature two stars in a close orbit (the inner binary) while a tertiary star orbits them on a wider orbit (the outer binary). In hierarchical triples, three-body dynamics combined with stellar evolution drives interactions and, in many cases, merges the inner binary entirely to create a renovated “post-merger binary” (PMB). By leveraging dynamical simulations and tracking binary interactions, we explore the outcomes of merged triples and investigate whether PMBs preserve signatures of their three-body history. Our findings indicate that in 26%–54% of wide double white dwarf (DWD) binaries (s ≳ 100 au), the more massive white dwarf (WD) is a merger product, implying that these DWD binaries were previously triples. Overall, we estimate that 44% ± 14% of observed wide DWDs originated in triple star systems and thereby have rich dynamical histories. We also examine MS+MS and MS+red giant mergers manifesting as blue straggler stars (BSSs). These PMBs have orbital configurations and ages similar to most observed BSS binaries. While the triple+merger formation channel can explain the observed chemical abundances, moderate eccentricities, and companion masses in BSS binaries, it likely only accounts for ∼20%–25% of BSSs. Meanwhile, we predict that the majority of observed single BSSs formed as collisions in triples and harbor long-period (>10 yr) companions. Furthermore, both BSS binaries and DWDs exhibit signatures of WD birth kicks.

<title>Separating Super-puffs versus Hot Jupiters among Young Puffy Planets</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad946c</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad946c</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Discoveries of close-in young puffy (Rp ≳ 6 R⊕) planets raise the question of whether they are bona fide hot Jupiters or puffed-up Neptunes, potentially placing constraints on the formation location and timescale of hot Jupiters. Obtaining mass measurements for these planets is challenging due to stellar activity and noisy spectra. Therefore, we aim to provide independent theoretical constraints on the masses of these young planets based on their radii, incident fluxes, and ages, benchmarking to the planets of age <1 Gyr detected by Kepler, K2, and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. Through a combination of interior structure models, considerations of photoevaporative mass loss, and empirical mass–metallicity trends, we present the range of possible masses for 22 planets with an age of ∼10–900 Myr and radii of ∼6–16 R⊕. We generally find that our mass estimates are in agreement with the measured masses and upper limits where applicable. There exist some outliers including super-puffs Kepler-51 b, c and V1298 Tau d, b, e, for which we outline their likely formation conditions. Our analyses demonstrate that most of the youngest planets (≲100 Myr) tend to be puffed-up, Neptune-mass planets, while the true hot Jupiters are typically found around stars aged at least a few hundred Myr, suggesting the dominant origin of hot Jupiters to be late-stage high-eccentricity migration.

<title>Spectral Energy Distribution Modeling of BL Lacertae during a Large Submillimeter Outburst and Low X-Ray Polarization State</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In 2023 October–November, the blazar BL Lacertae underwent a very large-amplitude submillimeter outburst. The usual single-zone leptonic model with the lower-energy peak of the spectral energy distribution (SED) fit by the synchrotron emission from one distribution of relativistic electrons in the jet and inverse-Compton (IC) scattering of lower-energy photons from the synchrotron radiation in the jet itself (synchrotron self-Compton or SSC) or those from the broad-line region and torus by the same distribution of electrons cannot satisfactorily fit the broadband SED with simultaneous data at submillimeter, optical, X-ray, and GeV energies. Furthermore, simultaneous observations with IXPE indicate the X-ray polarization is undetected. We consider two different synchrotron components, one for the high flux in the submillimeter wavelengths and another for the data at the optical band, which are supposedly due to two separate distributions of electrons. In that case, the optical emission is dominated by the synchrotron radiation from one electron distribution, while the X-rays are mostly due to SSC process by another, which may result in low polarization fraction due to the IC scattering. We show that such a model can fit the broadband SED satisfactorily as well as explain the low polarization fraction at the X-rays.

<title>Chemical Links between a Young M-type T Tauri Star and Its Substellar Companion: Spectral Analysis and C/O Measurement of DH Tau A</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The chemical abundance measurements of host stars and their substellar companions provide a powerful tool to trace the formation mechanism of the planetary systems. We present a detailed high-resolution spectroscopic analysis of a young M-type star, DH Tau A, which is located in the Taurus molecular cloud belonging to the Taurus-Auriga star-forming region. This star is host to a low-mass companion, DH Tau b, and both the star and the companion are still in their accreting phase. We apply our technique to measure the abundances of carbon and oxygen using carbon- and oxygen-bearing molecules, such as CO and OH, respectively. We determine a near-solar carbon-to-oxygen abundance ratio of C/O = 0.555 ± 0.063 for the host star DH Tau A. We compare this stellar abundance ratio with that of the companion from our previous study ( ), which also has a near-solar value. This confirms the chemical homogeneity in the DH Tau system, which suggests a formation scenario for the companion consistent with a direct and relatively fast gravitational collapse rather than a slow core accretion process.

<title>Central versus Global Quenching Traced by the APEX-CALIFA Survey</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad85d1</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad85d1</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The quest for the mechanisms that halt star formation in galaxies is essential to understand their evolution. Here, we use the APEX-CALIFA survey, which includes 560 galaxies (0.005 < z < 0.08), so far the largest sample of galaxies in the nearby universe with both Integral Field Spectroscopic, Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area (CALIFA) and single-aperture millimeter observations, as well as the extended CALIFA sample (823 targets). Using these observations we derive (i) the deficit or excess of star formation for a given stellar mass with respect to the star formation main sequence (ΔSFMS), (ii) the gas fraction, and (iii) the star formation efficiency (SFE) for two apertures (central and global apertures using the APEX-CALIFA and CALIFA samples, respectively). We confirm the so-called “inside-out” quenching, that is, for quiescent galaxies the central values of ΔSFMS are usually smaller than those values derived from global measurements. However, for a given ΔSFMS we find that for retired galaxies the central gas fraction is larger in comparison to global measurements. Furthermore, the central SFE is significantly smaller in comparison to global counterparts. In general, in comparison to the global measurements, the deficit of star formation at the center of retired galaxies is primarily caused by the inefficiency to form new stars rather than the lack of molecular gas. We suggest that even though at the center of retired galaxies the gas fraction is larger, morphological structures could prevent that the molecular gas is transformed into new stars. Even more so in the outskirts of some retired galaxies with small gas fractions, star formation activity is still occurring.

<title>JWST Captures a Sudden Stellar Outburst and Inner Disk Wall Destruction</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We analyze JWST/MIRI observations of T Cha, a highly variable (ΔV ∼ 3–5 mag) accreting Sun-like star surrounded by a disk with a large (∼15 au) dust gap. We find that the JWST mid-IR spectrum is significantly different from the Spitzer spectrum obtained 17 yr before—the emission at short wavelengths (5–10 μm) has decreased by ∼2/3 while that at longer wavelengths (15–25 μm) has increased by up to a factor of ∼3. The JWST spectrum is contemporaneous with a fairly constant higher optical emission captured by the All Sky Automated Survey. After analyzing and modeling both spectral energy distributions, we propose that JWST caught the star during an outburst that partly destroyed and significantly reduced the height of the asymmetric inner disk wall responsible for the high optical variability and lower 15–25 μm emission during the Spitzer period. The dust mass lost during this outburst is estimated to be comparable (∼1/5) to the upper limit of the total micron-sized dust mass in the inner disk of T Cha now. Monitoring this system during possible future outbursts and more observations of its quiescent state will reveal if the inner disk can be replenished or will continue to be depleted and vanish.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Empirically, the total number (or total mass) of globular clusters (GCs) bound in a single galactic system correlates with the virial mass of the system. The form of this relation and its intrinsic scatter are potentially valuable constraints on theories of GC formation and galaxy evolution. In this work, we use the DESI Legacy Imaging Survey (DESI-LS) to make a large-scale, homogeneous estimate of GC abundance around 707 galaxies at distances ≲30 Mpc with luminosities . The combination of depth and sky coverage in DESI-LS allow us to extend the techniques used by previous ground-based photometric GC surveys to a larger and potentially more representative sample of galaxies. We find average GC counts and radial profiles that are broadly consistent with the literature on individual galaxies, including good agreement with the distribution of GCs in the Milky Way, demonstrating the viability of DESI-LS images for this purpose. We find a relation between GC counts and virial mass in agreement with previous estimates based on heterogenous data sets, except at the lowest masses we probe, where we find a larger scatter in the number of cluster candidates and a slightly higher average count.

<title>Starspots as an Explanation for the Mysterious IYJ Continuum Excess Emission in Classical T Tauri Stars</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad93c6</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An accurate estimation of the continuum excess emission from accretion spots and inner circumstellar disk regions is crucial for a proper derivation of fundamental stellar parameters in accreting systems. However, the presence of starspots can make disentangling the complicated multicomponent emission in these systems challenging. Subtraction of a single-temperature spectral template is insufficient to account for the composite stellar emission, as we demonstrated in a recent campaign involving weak-lined T Tauri stars. Here, we model the moderate-resolution near-infrared spectra of classical T Tauri stars, presenting new spectral models that incorporate spotted stars plus emission from accretion hot spots and a warm inner disk, allowing us to simultaneously reconstruct the entire 0.8–2.4 μm spectrum of our 16 targets. Using these models, we re-derive the continuum excess emission. Our results indicate that accounting for starspots resolves the need to include a previously proposed intermediate-temperature component in the IYJ excess and highlights the importance of a proper treatment of starspots in studies of accreting low-mass stars.

<title>The NANOGrav 15 yr Data Set: Looking for Signs of Discreteness in the Gravitational-wave Background</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The cosmic merger history of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) is expected to produce a low-frequency gravitational wave background (GWB). Here we investigate how signs of the discrete nature of this GWB can manifest in pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) through excursions from, and breaks in, the expected power law of the GWB strain spectrum. To do this, we create a semianalytic SMBHB population model, fit to North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav’s) 15 yr GWB amplitude, and with 1000 realizations, we study the populations’ characteristic strain and residual spectra. Comparing our models to the NANOGrav 15 yr spectrum, we find two interesting excursions from the power law. The first, at 2 nHz, is below our GWB realizations with a p-value significance p = 0.05–0.06 (≈1.8σ–1.9σ). The second, at 16 nHz, is above our GWB realizations with p = 0.04–0.15 (≈1.4σ–2.1σ). We explore the properties of a loud SMBHB that could cause such an excursion. Our simulations also show that the expected number of SMBHBs decreases by 3 orders of magnitude, from ∼106 to ∼103, between 2 and 20 nHz. This causes a break in the strain spectrum as the stochasticity of the background breaks down at , consistent with predictions pre-dating GWB measurements. The diminished GWB signal from SMBHBs at frequencies above the 26 nHz break opens a window for PTAs to detect continuous GWs from individual SMBHBs or GWs from the early Universe.

<title>Self-excited Pulsations and the Instability Strip of Long-period Variables: The Transition from Small-amplitude Red Giants to Semi-regular Variables</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9475</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9475</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We use one-dimensional hydrodynamic calculations combined with synthetic stellar population models of the Magellanic Clouds to study the onset of self-excited pulsation in luminous red giants. By comparing the results with Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment observations in the period–luminosity (PL) diagram, we are able to link the transition from small-amplitude red giants to semi-regular variables with a shift from stochastic driving to self-excited pulsations. This is consistent with previous studies relating this transition with an increase in mass-loss rate, dust formation, and the appearance of long secondary periods. The luminosity and effective temperature at the onset of pulsation are found to depend on metallicity, hydrogen content, and the adopted mixing length parameter. This confirms the role of partial hydrogen ionization in driving the pulsation, supporting the idea of a heat mechanism similar to that of classical pulsators. We examine the impact of turbulent viscosity, and find clear evidence that it must be adjusted according to the stellar chemical and physical parameters to fully match observations. In order to improve the predictive power of pulsation models, the turbulent viscosity and the temperature scale of pulsating red giants must be jointly calibrated. This is critical for model-based studies of the PL relations of evolved stars and to exploit their potential as distance and age indicators, in particular given the sensitivity of the onset of pulsation to the envelope composition. The grid of models is made publicly available with a companion interpolation routine.

<title>Multiwavelength Afterglow Analysis of GRB 221009A: Unveiling the Evolution of a Cooling Break in a Wind-like Medium</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most energetic explosions in the Universe, and their afterglow emission provides an opportunity to probe the physics of relativistic shock waves in an extreme environment. Several key pieces for completing the picture of GRB afterglow physics are still missing, including jet properties, the emission mechanism, and particle acceleration. Here, we present a study of the afterglow emission of GRB 221009A, the most energetic GRB ever observed. Using optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray data up to approximately 2 days after the trigger, we trace the evolution of the multiwavelength spectrum and the physical parameters behind the emission process. The broadband spectrum is consistent with the synchrotron emission emitted by relativistic electrons with its index of p = 2.29 ± 0.02. We identify a break energy at keV and an exponential cutoff at GeV in the observed multiwavelength spectrum. The break energy increases in time from keV at 0.65 days to keV at 1.68 days, favoring a stellar-wind-like profile of the circumburst medium with k = 2.4 ± 0.1 as in ρ(r) ∝ r−k. The high-energy attenuation at around 0.4 to 4 GeV is attributed to the maximum of the particle acceleration in the relativistic shock wave. This study confirms that the synchrotron process can explain the multiwavelength afterglow emission and its evolution.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The nature of the magnetic field structure throughout the Galactic Center (GC) has long been of interest. The recent Far-InfraREd Polarimetric Large-Area Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) Exploration (FIREPLACE) Survey reveals preliminary connections between the seemingly distinct vertical and horizontal magnetic field distributions previously observed in the GC. We use the statistical techniques of the Histogram of Relative Orientation and the Projected Rayleigh Statistic to assess whether the CMZ magnetic field preferentially aligns with the structure of the CMZ molecular clouds or the morphology of the nonthermal emission of the GC nonthermal filament (NTF) population. We find that there is a range of magnetic field orientations throughout the population of CMZ molecular clouds, ranging from parallel to perpendicular orientation. We posit these orientations depend on the prevalence of gravitational shear in the GC, in contrast with what is observed in Galactic Disk star-forming regions. We also compare the magnetic field orientation from dust polarimetry with individual prominent NTFs, finding a preferred perpendicular relative orientation. This perpendicular orientation indicates that the vertical field component found in the FIREPLACE observations is not spatially confined to the NTFs, providing evidence for a more pervasive vertical field in the GC. From dynamical arguments, we estimate an upper limit on the magnetic field strength for this vertical field, finding B ≤ 4 mG. A field close to this upper limit would indicate that the NTFs are not local enhancements of a weaker background field and that the locations of the NTFs depend on proximity to sites of cosmic-ray production.

<title>The Impact of the Angle-average Approximation in the Partial Frequency Redistribution Modeling of the Mg ii h–k Doublet Stokes Profiles</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In recent years, the Mg ii h and k lines have become increasingly important for the diagnostics of magnetic fields in the solar chromosphere, motivated both by the advances in the modeling capabilities of their polarization and by the unprecedented spectropolarimetric observations provided by the CLASP missions. In this paper, we investigate the impact of the angular and frequency coupling in coherent scattering processes in the radiative transfer modeling of the Mg ii doublet polarization profiles. In particular, we aim to assess how the widely used angle-average approximation affects the predicted polarization. By solving the radiative transfer problem in 1D semiempirical atmospheric models, we find that this approximation is suitable in the absence of magnetic fields, but there can be measurable differences in magnetized models, mainly in the linear polarization profiles close to the core of the Mg ii k line. We then test the suitability of the approximation in more realistic scenarios, solving the radiative transfer problem pixel-by-pixel in a 3D atmospheric model resulting from a magnetohydrodynamic simulation and mimicking the degradation of the CLASP2 instrument, as well as in several 1D atmospheric models resulting from the Stokes inversion of the CLASP2 data. We find that the impact of the angle-average approximation is greatly diminished at the resolution of the CLASP2 observations. We also find that to suitably include angle-dependent effects in 1D radiative transfer modeling, it is sufficient to initialize the problem with the angle-average solution and then perform a few (angle-dependent) iterations, dramatically reducing the computational cost.

<title>Stability of f(Q, B) Gravity via Dynamical System Approach: A Comprehensive Bayesian Statistical Analysis</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this work, we explore the cosmological stability of f(Q, B) gravity using a dynamical system approach, where Q denotes the nonmetricity scalar and B represents the boundary term. We determine the model parameters of f(Q, B) through Bayesian statistical analysis, employing Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. This analysis incorporates numerical solutions and observational data from cosmic chronometers, the extended Pantheon+ data set, and baryonic acoustic oscillation measurements. Our findings reveal a stable critical point within the dynamical system of the model, corresponding to the de Sitter phase, which is consistent with current observations of the Universe dominated by dark energy and undergoing late-time accelerated expansion. Additionally, we utilize center manifold theory to examine the stability of this critical point, providing deeper insights into the behavior of the model. The cosmological implications of f(Q, B) gravity indicate a smooth transition in the deceleration parameters from deceleration to the acceleration phase, underscoring the potential of the model to describe the evolution of the Universe. Our results suggests that the f(Q, B) model presents a viable alternative to the standard ΛCDM model, effectively capturing the observed acceleration of the Universe and offering a robust framework for explaining the dynamics of cosmic expansion.

<title>Depolarization by Jet Precession in Early Optical Afterglows of Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Polarization observations provide a unique way to probe the nature of jet magnetic fields in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Recently, some GRBs have been detected to be polarized in their early optical afterglows. However, the measured polarization degrees (PDs) of these GRBs are much lower than those predicted by theoretical models. In this work, we investigate the depolarization induced by jet precession in combination with the measured PDs of the GRB early optical afterglows in the reverse shock (RS) dominated phase (∼102–103 s). We calculate the PDs of RS emissions with and without jet precession in both magnetic field configurations, i.e., aligned and toroidal magnetic fields, and meanwhile explore the effects of different parameters on the PDs. We find that the PDs are slightly affected by the configurations of the ordered magnetic fields and are positively related to the precession period. Moreover, the PDs are sensitive to the observed angle, and the measured low PDs favor a small one. Thus, as one of the plausible origins of the structured jets, jet precession could be considered as an alternative mechanism for the low PDs observed in GRB early optical afterglows.

<title>MAGAZ3NE: Evidence for Galactic Conformity in z ≳ 3 Protoclusters*</title>

We examine the quiescent fractions of massive galaxies in six z ≳ 3 spectroscopically confirmed protoclusters in the COSMOS field, one of which is newly confirmed and presented here. We report the spectroscopic confirmation of MAGAZ3NE J100143+023021 at by the Massive Ancient Galaxies At z > 3 NEar-infrared (MAGAZ3NE) survey. MAGAZ3NE J100143+023021 contains a total of 79 protocluster members (28 spectroscopic and 51 photometric). Three spectroscopically confirmed members are star-forming ultramassive galaxies (UMGs; > 11), the most massive of which has . Combining Keck/MOSFIRE spectroscopy and the COSMOS2020 photometric catalog, we use a weighted Gaussian kernel density estimator to map the protocluster and measure its total mass in the dense “core” region. For each of the six COSMOS protoclusters, we compare the quiescent fraction to the status of the central UMG as star-forming or quiescent. We observe that galaxies in these protoclusters appear to obey galactic conformity: Elevated quiescent fractions are found in protoclusters with UVJ-quiescent UMGs and low quiescent fractions are found in protoclusters containing UVJ star-frming UMGs. This correlation of star formation/quiescence in UMGs and the massive galaxies nearby in these protoclusters is the first evidence for the existence of galactic conformity at z > 3. Despite disagreements over mechanisms behind conformity at low redshifts, its presence at these early cosmic times would provide strong constraints on the physics proposed to drive galactic conformity.

In this study, we test whether the power law slopes (αF) for fluxes (F), and (αE) for energies (E) are universal in their size distributions, and , in astrophysical observations of galactic, extragalactic, and black hole systems. This is a test of fundamental importance for self-organized criticality (SOC) systems. The test decides whether (i) power laws are a natural consequence of the scale-freeness and inherent universality of SOC systems, or (ii) if they depend on more complex physical scaling laws. The former criterion allows quantitative predictions of the power-law-like size distributions, while the latter criterion requires individual physical modeling for each SOC variable and data set. Our statistical test, carried out with 61 published data sets, is consistent with the former option, which implies that observed power laws can simply be derived from the scale-freeness and do not require specific physical models to understand their statistical distributions. The observations show a mean and standard deviation of αF = 1.78 ± 0.29 for SOC fluxes and αE = 1.66 ± 0.22 for SOC fluences, and thus are consistent with the prediction of the fractal-diffusive SOC model, with αF = 1.80 and αE = 1.67.

<title>The Redshift-space Momentum Power Spectrum. III. Measuring the Growth Rate from the SDSSv Survey Using the Auto- and Cross-power Spectrum of the Galaxy Density and Momentum Fields</title>

The large-scale structure of the Universe and its evolution over time contains an abundance of cosmological information. One way to unlock this is by measuring the density and momentum power spectrum from the positions and peculiar velocities of galaxies and fitting the cosmological parameters from these power spectra. In this paper, we will explore the cross-power spectrum between the density and momentum fields of galaxies. We derive the estimator of the density–momentum cross-power spectrum multipoles. The growth rate of the large-scale structure, fσ8, is measured from fitting the combined density monopole, momentum monopole, and cross-dipole power spectrum. The estimators and models of the power spectrum as well as our fitting method have been tested using mock catalogs; we find that they perform well in recovering the fiducial values of the cosmological parameters of the simulations, and we also find that the errors of the parameters can be largely reduced by including the cross-power spectrum in the fit. We measure the autodensity, automomentum, and cross-power spectrum using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 14 peculiar velocity catalog. The fit result of the growth rate fσ8 is at effective redshift zeff = 0.073, and our measurement is consistent with the prediction of the Lambda cold dark matter cosmological model, assuming general relativity.

<title>Multiwavelength Study of Five Distant Transient Gamma-Ray AGNs with z > 1</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The multiwavelength emissions, especially gamma-rays, of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are essential for studying the physical properties of jets emanating from supermassive black holes at galaxy centers. However, for high-redshift AGNs, it is challenging to identify their gamma-ray emissions due to limited angular resolution of gamma-ray instruments. In this work, using the infrared light curves of the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and spectral measurements through Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR16 quasar observations, we assemble 64 mid-infrared flares with redshift z > 1 as the sample. Based on the Fermi-Large Area Telescope survey data, we search for gamma-ray emission from the 64 WISE sources. New quasi-simultaneous gamma-ray emissions are detected for five sample sources when their infrared emissions are at a flare state, and the infrared positions fall into the error bars of their best-fit gamma-ray positions, as well. We collect the optical data and historical data to perform a spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis. To investigate the multiband characteristics of these five gamma-ray AGNs at flare and quiescent states, a one-zone leptonic model is applied to reproduce their averaged SEDs.

<title>Combined Fit of Spectrum and Composition for FR0 Radio-galaxy-emitted Ultra–high energy Cosmic Rays with Resulting Secondary Photons and Neutrinos</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study comprehensively investigates the gamma-ray dim population of Fanaroff–Riley Type 0 (FR0) radio galaxies as potentially significant sources of ultra–high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs, E > 1018 eV) detected on Earth. While individual FR0 luminosities are relatively low compared to the more powerful Fanaroff–Riley Type 1 and Type 2 galaxies, FR0s are substantially more prevalent in the local universe, outnumbering the more energetic galaxies by a factor of ∼5 within a redshift of z ≤ 0.05. Employing CRPropa3 simulations, we estimate the mass composition and energy spectra of UHECRs originating from FR0 galaxies for energies above 1018.6 eV. This estimation fits data from the Pierre Auger Observatory (Auger) using three extensive air shower models; both constant and energy-dependent observed elemental fractions are considered. The simulation integrates an approximately isotropic distribution of FR0 galaxies, extrapolated from observed characteristics, with UHECR propagation in the intergalactic medium, incorporating various plausible configurations of extragalactic magnetic fields, both random and structured. We then compare the resulting emission spectral indices, rigidity cutoffs, and elemental fractions with recent Auger results. In total, 25 combined energy-spectrum and mass-composition fits are considered. Beyond the cosmic-ray fluxes emitted by FR0 galaxies, this study predicts the secondary photon and neutrino fluxes from UHECR interactions with intergalactic cosmic photon backgrounds. The multimessenger approach, encompassing observational data and theoretical models, helps elucidate the contribution of low-luminosity FR0 radio galaxies to the total cosmic-ray energy density.

Gravitational waves (GWs) from primordial black holes (PBHs) inspiraling within neutron stars (NSs)—should they exist—are detectable by ground-based detectors and offer a unique insight into the internal structure of NSs. To provide accurate templates for GW searches, we solve Einstein’s equations within NSs and calculate the orbital motion of the captured PBH by considering dynamical friction, accretion, and gravitational radiation. Equipped with precise GW waveforms for PBHs inspiraling inside NSs, we find that the Einstein Telescope can differentiate between various equations of state for NSs. As PBHs inspiral deeper into NSs, the GW frequency rises near the surface, then decreases to a constant value deeper within NSs. The distinctive characteristics of GW frequency serve as the smoking gun for GW signals emitted by PBHs inspiraling inside NSs and can be used to probe the nuclear matter in the crust and core of NSs.

We present 22 GHz imaging of regions of massive star formation within the Local Wolf–Rayet Galaxy Sample, a NSF Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array survey of 30 local galaxies showing spectral features of Wolf–Rayet (WR) stars. These spectral features are present in galaxies with young super star clusters (SSCs), and are an indicator of large concentrations of massive stars. We present a catalog of 92 individually identified regions of likely free–free emission associated with potential young SSCs located in these WR galaxies. The free–free fluxes from these maps allow extinction-free estimates of the Lyman continuum rates, masses, and luminosities of the emission regions. Thirty-nine of these regions meet the minimum Lyman continuum rate to contain at least once SSC, and 29 of these regions could contain individual SSCs massive enough to test specific theories on star formation and feedback inhibition in SSCs, requiring follow-up observations at higher spatial resolution. The resulting catalog provides sources for future molecular line and IR studies into the properties of SSC formation.

<title>Investigating the Star Formation Characteristics of Radio Active Galactic Nuclei</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The coevolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies represents a fundamental question in astrophysics. One approach to investigating this question involves comparing the star formation rates (SFRs) of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with those of typical star-forming galaxies. At relatively low redshifts (z ≲ 1), radio AGNs manifest diminished SFRs, indicating suppressed star formation, but their behavior at higher redshifts is unclear. To examine this, we leveraged galaxy and radio-AGN data from the well-characterized W-CDF-S, ELAIS-S1, and XMM-LSS fields. We established two mass-complete reference star-forming galaxy samples and two radio-AGN samples, consisting of 1763 and 6766 radio AGNs, the former being higher in purity and the latter more complete. We subsequently computed star-forming fractions (fSF; the fraction of star-forming galaxies to all galaxies) for galaxies and radio-AGN host galaxies and conducted a robust comparison between them up to z ≈ 3. We found that the tendency for radio AGNs to reside in massive galaxies primarily accounts for their low fSF, which also shows a strong negative dependence upon M⋆ and a strong positive evolution with z. To investigate further the star formation characteristics of those star-forming radio AGNs, we constructed the star-forming main sequence (MS) and investigated the behavior of the position of AGNs relative to the MS at z ≈ 0–3. Our results reveal that radio AGNs display lower SFRs than star-forming galaxies in the low-z and high-M⋆ regime and, conversely, exhibit comparable or higher SFRs than MS star-forming galaxies at higher redshifts or lower M⋆.

<title>Can the Central Compact Object in HESS J1731–347 Be Indeed the Lightest Neutron Star Observed?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The exceptionally low mass of for the central compact object (CCO) XMMU J173203.3–344518 (XMMU J1732) in the supernova remnant (SNR) HESS J1731–347 challenges standard neutron star (NS) formation models. The nearby post–asymptotic giant branch star IRAS 17287–3443 (≈0.6M⊙), also within the SNR, enriches the scenario. To address this puzzle, we advance the possibility that the gravitational collapse of a rotating presupernova (SN) iron core (≈1.2M⊙) could result in a low-mass NS. We show that angular momentum conservation during the collapse of an iron core rotating at ≈45% of the Keplerian limit results in a mass loss of ≈0.3M⊙, producing a stable newborn NS of ≈0.9M⊙. Considering the possible spin-down, this indicates that the NS is now slowly rotating, thus fulfilling the observed mass–radius relation. Additionally, the NS's surface temperature (≈2 × 106 K) aligns with canonical thermal evolution for its ≈4.5 kyr age. We propose the pre-SN star, likely an ultrastripped core of ≈4.2M⊙, formed a tidally locked binary with IRAS 17287–3443, with a 1.43 day orbital period. The SN led to a ≈3M⊙ mass loss, imparting a kick velocity ≲670 km s−1, which disrupted the binary. This scenario explains the observed 0.3 pc offset between XMMU J1732 and IRAS 17287–3443 and supports the possibility of CCOs forming in binaries, with rotation playing a key role in core collapse, and the CCO XMMU J1732 being the lightest NS ever observed.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
NGC 1052-DF2 and -DF4 are two ultradiffuse galaxies that have been reported as deficient in dark matter and associated with the same galaxy group. Recent findings suggest that DF2 and DF4 are part of a large linear substructure of dwarf galaxies that could have been formed from a high-velocity head-on encounter of two gas-rich galaxies, known as a “bullet dwarf” collision. Based on new observations from the Hubble Space Telescope, combined with existing imaging from the u band to mid-infrared, we test the bullet dwarf scenario by studying the morphologies and stellar populations of the trail dwarfs. We find no significant morphological differences between the trail dwarfs and other dwarfs in the group, while for both populations, their photometric major axes unexpectedly align parallel with the trail. We find that the trail dwarfs have significantly older ages and higher metallicities than the comparison sample, supporting the distinctiveness of the trail. These observations provide key constraints for any formation model, and we argue that they are currently best explained by the bullet dwarf collision scenario, with additional strong tests anticipated with future observations.

<title>More Likely Than You Think: Inclination-driving Secular Resonances Are Common in Known Exoplanet Systems</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Multiplanet systems face significant challenges to detection. For example, farther-orbiting planets have a reduced signal-to-noise ratio in radial velocity detection methods, and small mutual inclinations between planets can prevent them from all transiting. One mechanism for exciting mutual inclination between planets is secular resonance, where the nodal precession frequencies of the planets align so as to greatly increase the efficiency of the angular momentum transport between planets. These resonances can significantly misalign planets from one another, hindering detection, and typically can only occur when there are three or more planets in the system. Naively, systems can only be in resonance for particular combinations of planet semimajor axes and masses; however, effects that alter the nodal precession frequencies of the planets, such as the decay of stellar oblateness, can significantly expand the region of parameter space where resonances occur. In this work, we explore known three-planet systems, determine whether they are in (or were in) secular resonance due to evolving stellar oblateness, and demonstrate the implications of resonance on their detectability and stability. We show that about 20% of a sample of three-planet transiting systems seem to undergo these resonances early in their lives.

Gigahertz peaked spectrum (GPS) and compact steep spectrum (CSS) sources are compact radio galaxies (RGs), with jets extending up to 20 kpc and ages <103 yr. They are considered to evolve to Fanaroff–Riley RGs, but the real scenario to explain the compact sources remains unsolved. The young compact jets make GPS/CSS ideal for studying feedback in the nuclear region of active galactic nuclei because the jets are just starting to leave this region. Numerical simulations and jet power estimates suggest that compact sources can drive outflows on scales several times larger than the radio source itself, but the lack of suitable data limits comparisons between theory and observation. We carried out an optical spectroscopic study of 82 CSS/GPS with Sloan Digital Sky Survey-DR12 data to investigate the influence of compact jets in the gas. We found outflowing gas components in the [O iii] λ5007 emission lines in half of our sample. The kinetic energy of the outflowing gas in compact sources is comparable to that observed in extended RGs, indicating that the compact jets can drive powerful outflows similar to those in FR RGs. The observed anticorrelation between the kinetic power of the outflow and the radio luminosity suggests an interaction between the young jet and the interstellar medium (ISM). This finding provides significant observational support for previous simulations of jet–ISM interactions and supports the evolutionary scenario for RGs. However, the lack of sources with high kinetic efficiency indicates that some compact galaxies may be frustrated sources.

Stellar clusters are critical constituents within galaxies: They are the result of highest-density star formation, and through their spatially and temporally correlated feedback, they regulate their host galaxy evolution. We present a novel numerical method to model star clusters as individual units of star formation using sink particles. In our method, star clusters grow via gas accretion and via merging with less massive clusters. We describe the implementation in the radiation hydrodynamics code GIZMO and run a large grid of marginally bound, turbulent clouds of 107M⊙ to explore the effect of modeling ingredients on the evolution of the clouds and the star clusters. We find both gas accretion and mergers to be critical processes to form star clusters of masses up to ∼105–106M⊙, while ionizing radiation is the main feedback mechanism regulating the growth of star clusters. The majority of our star clusters assemble their mass in 0.3–2.6 Myr, and the most massive ones take ∼10 Myr. By removing high-density gas by accretion, our sink-based cluster formation prescription allows the newly formed star clusters to inject their stellar feedback in less dense environments. This makes feedback more efficient at ionizing and disrupting the cloud than if we were to use a standard star formation approach, indicating that our numerical method is the missing critical step to model the interplay between star clusters and their host galaxies.

Spatially resolved emission-line kinematics are invaluable for investigating fundamental galaxy properties and have become increasingly accessible for galaxies at z ≳0.5 through sensitive near-infrared imaging spectroscopy and millimeter interferometry. Kinematic modeling is at the core of the analysis and interpretation of such data sets, which at high z present challenges due to the lower signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) and resolution compared to the data of local galaxies. We present and test the 3D fitting functionality of DysmalPy, examining how well it recovers the intrinsic disk rotation velocity and velocity dispersion, using a large suite of axisymmetric models, covering a range of galaxy properties and observational parameters typical of z ∼ 1−3 star-forming galaxies. We also compare DysmalPy’s recovery performance to that of two other commonly used codes, GalPak3D and 3DBarolo, which we use in turn to create additional sets of models to benchmark DysmalPy. Over the ranges of S/N, resolution, mass, and velocity dispersion explored, the rotation velocity is accurately recovered by all tools. The velocity dispersion is recovered well at high S/N, but the impact of methodology differences is more apparent. In particular, template differences for parametric tools and S/N sensitivity for the nonparametric tool can lead to differences of up to a factor of 2. Our tests highlight and the importance of deep, high-resolution data and the need for careful consideration of (i) the choice of priors (parametric approaches); and (ii) the masking (all approaches); and (iii), more generally, the evaluating of the suitability of each approach to the specific data at hand. This paper accompanies the public release of DysmalPy.

<title>A Framework to Calibrate a Semianalytic Model of the First Stars and Galaxies to the Renaissance Simulations</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad919e</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a method that calibrates a semianalytic model to the Renaissance Simulations, a suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations with high-redshift galaxy formation. This approach combines the strengths of semianalytic techniques and hydrodynamical simulations, enabling the extension to larger volumes and lower redshifts that are inaccessible to simulations due to computational expense. Using a sample of Renaissance star formation histories from an average density region of the Universe, we construct a four-parameter prescription for metal-enriched star formation characterized by an initial bursty stage followed by a steady stage where stars are formed at constant efficiencies. Our model also includes a treatment of Pop III star formation where a minimum halo mass and log-normal distribution of stellar mass are adopted to match the numerical simulations. Star formation is generally well reproduced for halos with masses ≲109M⊙. Between 11 < z < 25 our model produces metal-enriched star formation rate densities (SFRDs) that typically agree with Renaissance within a factor of ∼2 for the average density region. Additionally, the total metal-enriched stellar mass only differs from Renaissance by about 10% at z ∼ 11. For regions that are either more overdense or rarefied and not included in the calibration, we produce metal-enriched SFRDs that agree with Renaissance within a factor of ∼2 at high-z but eventually differ by higher factors for later times. This is likely due to environmental dependencies not included in the model. Our star formation prescriptions can easily be adopted in other analytic or semianalytic works to match our calibration to Renaissance.

<title>Evolution of the Accretion Disk and Corona during the Outburst of the Neutron Star Transient MAXI J1807+132</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Low-mass X-ray binaries with a neutron star as the primary object show a complex array of phenomenology during outbursts. The observed variability in X-ray emission primarily arises from changes in the innermost regions of the accretion disk, neutron star surface, and corona. In this work, we present the results of a comprehensive X-ray spectral and timing analysis of the neutron star transient MAXI J1807+132 during its 2023 outburst using data from the NICER observatory. The outburst is marked by a very rapid rise in the count rate by about a factor of 20 in a day. The source undergoes full state transitions and displays the hysteresis effect in the hardness and rms intensity diagrams. Spectral analysis with a three-component model is consistent with disk truncation during the hard states and reaching the last stable orbit during the intermediate and soft states. We discuss the different values of the last stable radius in the context of the possible distance of the source and magnetic field strength. The characteristic frequencies throughout the hard and intermediate states are found to be strongly correlated with the inner radius of the disk. Together with the spectral and fast variability properties, we attempt to trace the evolution of the size of the corona along the outburst. Following the main outburst, the source undergoes a high-amplitude reflare, wherein it shows a complex behavior with relatively high variability (10%), but low hardness.

<title>A Systematic Survey of Moon-forming Giant Impacts. II. Rotating Bodies</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9248</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9248</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In the leading theory of lunar formation, known as the giant impact hypothesis, a collision between two planet-sized objects resulted in a young Earth surrounded by a circumplanetary debris disk from which the Moon later accreted. The range of giant impacts that could conceivably explain the Earth–Moon system is limited by the set of known physical and geochemical constraints. However, while several distinct Moon-forming impact scenarios have been proposed—from small, high-velocity impactors to low-velocity mergers between equal-mass objects—none of these scenarios have been successful at explaining the full set of known constraints, especially without invoking one or more controversial post-impact processes. Allowing for pre-impact rotation of the colliding bodies has been suggested as an avenue that may produce more promising collision outcomes. However, to date, only limited studies of pre-impact rotation have been conducted. Therefore, in this second paper of the series, we focus on pairwise impacts between rotating bodies. Using nonrotating collisions as a baseline, we systematically study the effects of rotation on collision outcomes. We consider nine distinct rotation configurations and a range of rotation rates up to the rotational stability limit. Notably, we identify a population of collisions that can produce low post-impact angular momentum (AM) budgets and massive, iron-poor protolunar disks. Furthermore, even when pre-impact rotation is included, we demonstrate that the canonical Moon-forming impact can only generate sufficiently massive protolunar disks in the presence of excessive post-impact AM budgets; this casts doubt on the canonical impact scenario.

<title>Detection of a Highly Ionized Outflow in the Quasiperiodically Erupting Source GSN 069</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9249</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Quasiperiodic eruptions (QPEs) are high-amplitude, soft X-ray bursts recurring every few hours, associated with supermassive black holes. Many interpretations for QPEs were proposed since their recent discovery in 2019, including extreme mass ratio inspirals and accretion disk instabilities. But, as of today, their nature still remains debated. We perform the first high-resolution X-ray spectral study of a QPE source using the Reflection Grating Spectrometers' gratings on board XMM-Newton, leveraging nearly 2 Ms of exposure on GSN 069, the first discovered source of this class. We resolve several absorption and emission lines including a strong line pair near the N vii rest-frame energy, resembling the P-Cygni profile. We apply photoionization spectral models and identify the absorption lines as an outflow blueshifted by 1700−2900 km s−1, with a column density of about 1022 cm−2 and an ionization parameter /erg cm s−1) of 3.9−4.6. The emission lines are instead redshifted by up to 2900 km s−1, and likely originate from the same outflow that imprints the absorption features, and covers the full 4π sky from the point of view of GSN 069. The column density and ionization are comparable to the outflows detected in some tidal disruption events, but this outflow is significantly faster and has a strong emission component. The outflow is more highly ionized when the system is in the phase during which QPEs are present, and from the limits, we derive on its location, we conclude that the outflow is connected to the recent complex, transient activity of GSN 069, which began around 2010.

<title>Laboratory Studies on Absolute n-resolved Charge-exchange Cross Sections and Modeling X-Ray Emissions for Ne8+ Colliding with H2 and He</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Charge exchange is a predominant process in inelastic collisions in astronomical plasmas, influencing the charge state balance and leading to X-ray emissions when solar wind ions interact with neutral gas in astrophysical environments. Accurate analysis of these dynamic properties to diagnose the solar wind composition and velocities, as well as the spatial distribution of the heliospheric neutral gas, can be hindered by the limited availability of relevant electron capture studies in the corresponding energy range. The absolute total and -resolved state-selective cross sections of single electron capture have been measured in the collisional energy range from 2.8 to 40 keV u−1, covering velocities corresponding to fast solar wind and coronal mass ejections. In comparison with existing atomic data, we observe good agreement with other results at overlapping energies. Based on the absolute -state electron capture cross sections, the absolute cross sections of photon emissions following charge exchange between Ne8+ and H2, as well as He gas, were determined for the potential applications in high-resolution X-ray spectra studies of solar wind charge exchange. This work serves as a benchmark for validating the theoretical calculations of charge exchange cross sections and astronomical plasma models, providing valuable insights into the investigation of soft X-ray emissions in solar wind plasma environments.

<title>CHANG-ES. XXXV. Cosmic Ray Transport and Magnetic Field Structure of NGC 3556 at 3 GHz</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Radio halos of edge-on galaxies are crucial for investigating cosmic ray propagation and magnetic field structures in galactic environments. We present VLA C-configuration S-band (2–4 GHz) observations of the spiral galaxy NGC 3556, a target from the Continuum Halos in Nearby Galaxies—an EVLA Survey. We estimate the thermal contribution to the radio emission from a combination of the Hα and mid-IR data, and employ rotation measure synthesis to reveal the magnetic field structures. In our data, NGC 3556 exhibits a box-like radio halo extending nearly 7 kpc from the galactic plane. The scale height of the total S-band intensity in the halo is 1.68 ± 0.29 kpc, while that of the nonthermal intensity is 1.93 ± 0.28 kpc. Fitting the data to a 1D cosmic-ray transport model, we find advection to describe the cosmic-ray propagation within the halo better than diffusion, with advection speeds of 245 ± 15 km s−1 and 205 ± 25 km s−1 above and below the disk, respectively. The magnetic field is detected patchily across the galaxy, displaying a toroidal configuration in the rotation measure map. The mean equipartition magnetic field strength is approximately 8.3 μG in the disk and 4.5 μG in the halo. In addition, a bubble-like structure extends nearly 3 kpc into the southern halo, aligned with the polarized intensity and Hα image, suggestive of superwinds generated by recent star formation feedback in the nuclear region.

<title>Irradiated Atmospheres. I. Heating by Vertical-mixing-induced Energy Transport</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Observations have revealed unique temperature profiles in hot Jupiter atmospheres. We propose that the energy transport by vertical mixing could lead to such thermal features. In our new scenario, strong absorbers, TiO, and VO are not necessary. Vertical mixing could be naturally excited by atmospheric circulation or internal gravity wave breaking. We perform radiative transfer calculations by taking into account the vertical-mixing-driven energy transport. The radiative equilibrium is replaced by the radiative-mixing equilibrium. We investigate how the mixing strength, Kzz, affects the atmospheric temperature–pressure profile. Strong mixing can heat the lower atmosphere and cool the upper atmosphere. This effect has important effects on the atmosphere's thermal features that would form without mixing. In certain circumstances, it can induce temperature inversions in scenarios where the temperature monotonically increases with increasing pressure under conditions of lower thermal band opacity. Temperature inversions show up as Kzz increases with altitude due to shear interaction with the convection layer. The atmospheric thermal structure of HD 209458b can be well fitted with Kzz ∝ (P/1 bar)−1/2 cm2 s−1. Our findings suggest vertical mixing promotes temperature inversions and lowers Kzz estimates compared to prior studies. Incorporating chemical species into vertical mixing will significantly affect the thermal profile due to their temperature sensitivity.

<title>The Impact of Void-finding Algorithms on Galaxy Classification</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9585</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We explore how the definition of a void influences the conclusions drawn about the impact of the void environment on galactic properties using two void-finding algorithms in the Void Analysis Software Toolkit: Voronoi Voids (V2), a Python implementation of ZOnes Bordering On Voidness (ZOBOV); and VoidFinder, an algorithm that grows and merges spherical void regions. Using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7, we find that galaxies found in VoidFinder voids tend to be bluer and fainter and to have higher (specific) star formation rates than galaxies in denser regions. Conversely, galaxies found in V2 voids show less significant differences when compared to galaxies in denser regions, less consistent with the large-scale environmental effects on galaxy properties expected from both simulations and previous observations. These results align with previous simulation results that show V2-identified voids “leak” into the dense walls between voids because their boundaries extend up to the density maxima in the walls. As a result, when using ZOBOV-based void-finders, galaxies likely to be part of wall regions are instead classified as void galaxies, a misclassification that can be critical to our understanding of galaxy evolution.

<title>A High-resolution Simulation of Protoplanetary Disk Turbulence Driven by the Vertical Shear Instability</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad90a5</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad90a5</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A high-resolution fourth-order Padé scheme is used to simulate locally isothermal 3D disk turbulence driven by the vertical shear instability (VSI) using 268.4 M points. In the early nonlinear period of axisymmetric VSI, angular momentum transport by vertical jets creates correlated N-shaped radial profiles of perturbation vertical and azimuthal velocity. This implies dominance of positive perturbation vertical vorticity layers and a recently discovered angular momentum staircase with respect to radius (r). These features are present in 3D in a weaker form. The 3D flow consists of vertically and azimuthally coherent turbulent shear layers containing small vortices with all three vorticity components active. Previously observed large persistent vortices in the interior of the domain driven by the Rossby wave instability are absent. We speculate that this is due to a weaker angular momentum staircase in 3D in the present simulations compared to a previous simulation. The turbulent viscosity parameter α(r) increases linearly with r. At intermediate resolution, the value of α(r) at midradius is close to that of a previous simulation. The specific kinetic energy spectrum with respect to radial wavenumber has a power-law region with exponent −1.84, close to the value −2 expected for shear layers. The spectrum with respect to azimuthal wavenumber has a −5/3 region and lacks a −5 region reported in an earlier study. Finally, it is found that axisymmetric VSI has artifacts at late times, including a very strong angular momentum staircase, which in 3D is present weakly in the disk’s upper layers.

<title>Evolutionary Dynamics of Counterhelical Magnetic Flux Ropes</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Upon interaction, a pair of magnetic flux ropes can merge to form a new pair, each consisting of opposite helicity along their axis. Magnetic helicity along such new structures may annihilate and release the energy of the azimuthal magnetic field. In this study, we model the deformation dynamics of such structures within the solar wind at 1 au. The perturbation front of deformation propagates along the rope axis at approximately the Alfvén speed. However, the process of annihilating 90% of the azimuthal components is much slower and is affected by the screw pitch of the magnetic field. Such a deformation process causes the plasma in the transition region between the two opposite chiralities to spin about the rope axis. The resulting plasma heating is discussed accordingly. Our results provide insights for estimating the lifetimes of such flux ropes, facilitating observational efforts to identify them. This process may also apply to the behavior of magnetic flux ropes in other space and astronomical plasma environments.

<title>Expanding the Ultracompacts: Gravitational-wave-driven Mass Transfer in the Shortest-period Binaries with Accretion Disks</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9563</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report the discovery of three ultracompact binary white dwarf systems hosting accretion disks, with orbital periods of 7.95, 8.68, and 13.15 minutes. This significantly augments the population of mass-transferring binaries at the shortest periods, and provides the first evidence that accretors in ultracompacts can be dense enough to host accretion disks even below 10 minutes (where previously only direct-impact accretors were known). In the two shortest-period systems, we measured changes in the orbital periods driven by the combined effect of gravitational-wave emission and mass transfer. We find is negative in one case, and positive in the other. This is only the second system measured with a positive , and it is the most compact binary known that has survived a period minimum. Using these systems as examples, we show how the measurement of is a powerful tool in constraining the physical properties of binaries, e.g., the mass and mass–radius relation of the donor stars. We find that the chirp masses of ultracompact binaries at these periods seem to cluster around , perhaps suggesting a common origin for these systems or a selection bias in electromagnetic discoveries. Our new systems are among the highest-amplitude known gravitational-wave sources in the millihertz regime, providing an exquisite opportunity for multimessenger study with future space-based observatories such as LISA and TianQin. We discuss how such systems provide fascinating laboratories to study the unique regime where the accretion process is mediated by gravitational waves.

<title>Switchback Patches Evolve into Microstreams via Magnetic Relaxation</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad94da</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Switchbacks, defined as Alfvénic reversals in magnetic field polarity, can dissipate their magnetic energy with heliocentric distance. To further investigate this, two distinct solar wind parcels tracing back to a similar solar source region were examined during a radial alignment between Parker Solar Probe (@25.8RS) and Solar Orbiter (@152RS). The one caveat was that the two probes were located on opposite sides of the heliospheric current sheet during the alignment. The two parcels contained a multitude of switchbacks—the parcel closer to the Sun was characterized as a switchback patch (SBP), where background proton velocity (vp) is comparable to the pristine solar wind (vsw), while the parcel farther from the Sun showed characteristics attributable to a microstream (MS; vp > vsw). It was found that (1) MS contains, on average, 30% fewer switchbacks than SBP, and (2) dynamic and thermal pressures decreased by up to 20% across switchback boundaries in SBP and relatively unchanged in MS. Magnetic relaxation can explain the lower number of switchbacks in MS compared to SBP. Switchback relaxation inside SBP can, in turn, accelerate plasma inside SBP over time and heliocentric distance, thus resulting in vp > vsw in MS. Therefore, it is hypothesized that magnetic relaxation of switchbacks may cause SBPs to evolve into MSs over time and heliocentric distance.

<title>Leptohadronic Scenarios for TeV Extensions of Gamma-Ray Burst Afterglow Spectra</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Recent multiwavelength observations of gamma-ray burst afterglows observed in the TeV energy range challenge the simplest synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) interpretation of this emission and are consistent with a single power-law component spanning over 8 orders of magnitude in energy. To interpret this generic behavior in the single-zone approximation without adding further free parameters, we perform an exhaustive parameter space study using the public, time-dependent, multimessenger transport software AM3. This description accounts for the radiation from nonthermal protons and the leptohadronic cascade induced by pp and pγ interactions. We summarise the main scenarios that we have found (SSC, Extended-syn, Proton-syn, pp-cascade, and pγ-cascade) and discuss their advantages and limitations. We find that possible high-density environments, as may be typical for surrounding molecular cloud material, offer an alternative explanation for producing flat hard (source) spectra up to and beyond energies of 10 TeV.

<title>Are Long Gamma-Ray Bursts Progenitors to Merging Binary Black Holes?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The distribution of delay times between the formation of binary black hole (BBH) progenitors and their gravitational-wave (GW) merger provides important clues about their unknown formation histories. When inferring the delay time distribution, it is typically assumed that BBH progenitor formation traces the star formation rate (SFR). In this work, we consider the rate of long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) instead of the SFR. LGRBs are thought to correspond to the formation of (possibly spinning) black holes, and may therefore be related to the BBH progenitor population. By comparing the redshift evolution of the LGRB rate as inferred by G. Ghirlanda & R. Salvaterra and the BBH merger rate inferred by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observations, we find that the delay time distribution between LGRBs and BBH mergers is well described by a power law with minimum delay time 10 Myr and slope (90% credibility). This matches theoretical expectations for the BBH delay time distribution, which in turn lends support to the hypothesis that LGRBs trace BBH progenitor formation. However, comparing the absolute rates of these two populations, we find that at most of LGRBs may evolve into merging BBHs. We also consider the possibility that LGRBs only produce BBH systems with large aligned spins (with effective inspiral spin χeff > 0.2). In this case, we find and the delay time distribution favors the steepest power-law slopes we consider (α = −2). We argue that asynchronous observations of LGRBs and GWs provide a powerful multimessenger probe of black hole life cycles across cosmic history.

<title>Icarus Revisited: An Ancient, Metal-poor Accreted Stellar Stream in the Disk of the Milky Way</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The search for accreted satellites in the Galactic disk is a challenging task, to which Gaia plays a crucial role in synergy with ground-based spectroscopic surveys. In 2021, P. Re Fiorentin et al. discovered five substructures with disk kinematics including Icarus. To gain more insight into the origin of Icarus as a remnant of a dwarf galaxy rather than a signature of secular processes of disk formation, we complement astrometric Gaia DR3 data with spectroscopy from APOGEE DR17 and GALAH DR3, and explore the chemodynamical distributions within 3 kpc of the Sun. We select 622 stars in the accreted/unevolved regions of [Mg/Mn]–[Al/Fe] and [Mg/Fe]–[Fe/H], where we identify 81 and 376 stars with −2 < [Fe/H] < −0.7 belonging to Icarus and Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE), respectively. The revised properties of Icarus are: 〈V + VLSR〉 ≃ 171 km s−1, σV ≃ 37 km s−1, 〈e〉 ≃ 0.36, 〈[Fe/H]〉 ≃ −1.35, 〈[Mg/Fe]〉 ≃ +0.27, 〈[Al/Fe]〉 ≃ −0.13, and 〈[Mn/Fe]〉 ≃ −0.39. From the color–magnitude diagram of its members, Icarus appears older than 12 Gyr. Such age and dynamical properties are reminiscent of the metal-weak thick disk. However, detailed chemical analysis in the diagnostic spaces [Ni/Fe]–[(C+N)/O], [Y/Eu]–[Fe/H], [Eu/Mg]–[Fe/H], [Ba/Y]–[Fe/H], and [Ba/Mg]–[Mg/H] evidences that Icarus and GSE occupy the accreted region, well separated from the bulk of in situ disk stars. Updated comparisons with N-body simulations confirm that Icarus’s stars are consistent with the debris of a dwarf galaxy with a stellar mass of ∼109M☉ accreted onto a primordial disk on an initial prograde low-inclination orbit.

We present a noteworthy transient AT 2021aeuk exhibiting three distinct optical flares between 2018 and 2023. It is hosted in a radio-loud narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy, with an optical image showing a minor tidal morphology and a red mid-infrared color (W1 − W2 = 1.1). Flares II and III exhibit rapid rises, and long-term decays (≳1000 days) with recurring after-peak bumps. The g − r color after subtracting the reference magnitude exhibited a rapid drop and recovery during Flare II, followed by a minor after-peak evolution in blue colors. We applied a canonical tidal disruption event (TDE) fitting on the light curves, which gives a decay index p of for Flare II and for Flare III. The blackbody fitting shows lower temperatures (∼103.8 K) with minor after-peak evolution. The blackbody radius (≳1016 cm) and luminosity (∼1045 erg s−1) are larger than the typical TDE sample’s. The time lag (in rest frame) between the ZTF g and r bands ( days) significantly exceeds the prediction from the standard accretion disk. Pre-burst spectra reveal prominent Bowen fluorescence lines, indicating a vigorous or potentially long-lasting process that enriches the local metallicity. Additionally, we derived black hole masses of and using Hβ and Hα emission lines. The variation and recurring features of AT 2021aeuk are not likely induced by the radio-beaming effect or Type II superluminous supernova; however, we cannot rule out the possibility of TDE or enhanced active galactic nuclei accretion process. The unusually high occurrence of three flares within 5 yr may also induced by the complex local environment.

<title>Imaging of the Vega Debris System Using JWST/MIRI</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present images of the Vega planetary debris disk obtained at 15.5, 23, and 25.5 μm with the Mid-Infrared Instrument on JWST. The debris system is remarkably symmetric, smooth, and centered accurately on the star. There is a broad Kuiper-belt-analog ring at ∼80–170 au that coincides with the planetesimal belt detected with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array at 1.34 mm. The interior of the broad belt is filled with warm debris that shines most efficiently at mid-infrared, along with a shallow flux dip/gap at 60 au from the star. These qualitative characteristics argue against any Saturn-mass planets orbiting the star outside of about 10 au, assuming the unseen planet would be embedded in the very broad planetesimal disk from a few to hundreds of astronomical units. We find that the distribution of dust detected interior to the broad outer belt is consistent with grains being dragged inward by the Poynting–Robertson effect. Under the drag-dominated disk assumption, tighter constraints can be derived for planets in specific locations; for example, any planet shepherding the inner edge of the outer belt is likely to be less than six Earth masses. The disk surface brightness profile along with the available infrared photometry suggest a disk inner edge near ∼3−5 au, disconnected from the sub-astronomical-unit region that gives rise to the hot near-infrared excess. The gap between the hot, sub-astronomical-unit zone and the inner edge of the warm debris might be shepherded by a modest-mass, Neptune-size planet.

<title>Interpolation Techniques for Reconstructing Galactic Faraday Rotation</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8ddf</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The line-of-sight structure of the Galactic magnetic field (GMF) can be studied using Faraday rotation measure (RM) grids. We analyze how the choice of interpolation kernel can affect the accuracy and reliability of reconstructed RM maps. We test the following kernels: inverse distance weighting (IDW), natural neighbor interpolation (NNI), inverse multiquadric interpolation (IM), thin-plate spline interpolation (TPS), and a Bayesian rotation measure sky (BRMS); all techniques were tested on two simulated Galactic foreground RMs (one assuming the GMF has patchy structures and the other assuming it has filamentary structures) using magnetohydrodynamic simulations. Both foregrounds were sampled to form RM grids with densities of ∼40 sources deg−2 and area ∼144 deg2. The techniques were tested on data sets with different noise levels and Gaussian random extragalactic RM contributions. The data set that most closely emulates expected data from current surveys, such as the POlarization Sky Survey of the Universe’s Magnetism (POSSUM), had extragalactic contributions and a noise standard deviation of ∼1.5 rad m−2. For this data set, the accuracy of the techniques for the patchy structures is ranked from best to worst as BRMS, NNI, TPS, IDW, and IM; in the filamentary simulated foreground, the ordering is BRMS, NNI, TPS, and IDW. IDW is the most computationally expensive technique, while TPS and IM are the least expensive. BRMS and NNI have the same, intermediate computational cost. This analysis lays the groundwork for Galactic RM studies with large radio polarization sky surveys, such as POSSUM.

<title>Deep Chandra Observations of NGC 5728. III. Probing the High-resolution X-Ray Morphology and Multiphase Interstellar Medium Interactions in the Circumnuclear Region</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a detailed imaging analysis of 260 ks of subarcsecond resolution Chandra (ACIS-S) observations of the nearby Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 5728. Our study focuses on the bright and diffuse soft X-ray emission within the galaxy's inner ∼1 kpc. By comparing the X-ray emission across different energy bands, we identify localized variations in the absorbing column and emission processes. We observe more X-ray absorption in the direction perpendicular to the bicone, which is co-located with an inner warped CO disk in the galaxy. The innermost region, which shows the strongest excess of hard X-ray emission, is spatially coincident with the CO (2–1) emission from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and dusty spirals we find in a Hubble Space Telescope V − H color map. We detect soft extended emission associated with the circumnuclear star-forming ring at ∼1 kpc, suggestive of hot gas with kT = 0.44 keV. We derive measurements for the hot gas mass, M = 7.9 × 105M⊙, pressure, p = 2.0 × 10−10 dyne cm−2, and cooling times, τc = 193.2 Myr. In the vicinity of the star-forming ring, we detect two X-ray point sources, with soft X-ray spectra, and 0.3–7 keV luminosities L ∼ 8 × 1038 erg s−1. These properties suggest X-ray binaries.

<title>Cloud Crushing and Dissipation of Uniformly Driven Adiabatic Turbulence in Circumgalactic Media</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The circumgalactic medium (CGM) is responsive to kinetic disruptions generated by nearby astrophysical events. In this work, we study the saturation and dissipation of turbulent hydrodynamics within the CGM through an extensive array of 252 numerical simulations with proper cooling mechanisms and a large parameter space spanning average gas density, metallicity, and turbulence driving strength. A dichotomy emerges in the dynamics dissipation behaviors upon turbulence driving turnoff. Hot and subsonic disturbances are characterized by weak compression and slow dissipation, while warm and supersonic turbulences are marked by significant compression shocks and subsequent rapid cooling. In the supersonic cases, the kinetic energy decay is divided into a rate-limiting phase of shock dissipation and a comparatively swift phase of thermal dissipation, predominantly occurring within the overdense regions. Dense clouds are crushed on relatively brief timescales of ∼30–100 Myr, depending on turbulence driving strength but independent from average gas density. This independence is in spite of the complex interplay between the kinetics and thermodynamics of dissipation. The brevity of such timescales relative to typical dynamical timescales within the CGM suggests turbulent clouds must be cotemporal with turbulence driving sources such as cool accretion flows or feedback from the interstellar medium. Quantitative results from this work contribute a novel data set of dissipation timescales that incorporates thermodynamics and radiative cooling in an area of study typically focused on kinematics, which may serve as a valuable asset for forthcoming simulations that aim to explore gas dynamics on galactic and cosmological scales.

<title>Separating Repeating Fast Radio Bursts Using the Minimum Spanning Tree as an Unsupervised Methodology</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Fast radio bursts (FRBs) represent one of the most intriguing phenomena in modern astrophysics. However, their classification into repeaters and nonrepeaters is challenging. Here, we present the application of the graph theory minimum spanning tree (MST) methodology as an unsupervised classifier of repeater and nonrepeater FRBs. By constructing MSTs based on various combinations of variables, we identify those that lead to MSTs that exhibit a localized high density of repeaters at each side of the node with the largest betweenness centrality. Comparing the separation power of this methodology against known machine learning methods, and with the random expectation results, we assess the efficiency of the MST-based approach to unravel the physical implications behind the graph pattern. We finally propose a list of potential repeater candidates derived from the analysis using the MST.

<title>New Radio Observations of the Supernova Remnant CTA 1</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad90bb</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present new radio images of the supernova remnant (SNR) CTA 1 at 1420 and 408 MHz, and in the 21 cm line of H i observed with the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory Synthesis Telescope and at 1420 MHz observed with the Effelsberg 100 m telescope. We confirm previously described continuum features and elaborate further on filamentary features identified using the high-resolution (1′) maps from these new observations. We investigate the abrupt change in sign of rotation measure (RM) across the SNR, using the linear polarization observations in the four bands around 1420 MHz. Following X. H. Sun et al.’s (2011) investigation, we both confirm that the distribution of signs of the RMs for extragalactic sources in the area appears to match that of the shell, as well as combine the data from the four bands to estimate the relative depolarization and the intrinsic rotation measure of the SNR. We do not conclusively reject X. H. Sun et al.’s (2011) claim of a Faraday screen in the foreground causing the distribution of RMs that we observe; however, we do suggest an alternative explanation of a swept-up stellar wind from the progenitor star with a toroidal magnetic field. Finally, we expand on the analysis of the H i observations by applying the Rolling Hough Transform to isolate filamentary structure and better identify H i emission with the SNR. Further constraining the H i velocity channels associated with CTA 1, we use more recent Galactic rotation curves to calculate an updated kinematic distance of 1.09 ± 0.2 kpc.

<title>Rotational Velocities and Radii Estimates of Low-mass Pre-main-sequence Stars in NGC 2264</title>

Investigating the angular momentum evolution of pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars provides important insight into the interactions between Sun-like stars and their protoplanetary disks, and the timescales that govern disk dissipation and planet formation. We present projected rotational velocities (v sin i values) of 254 T Tauri stars (TTSs) in the ∼3 Myr old open cluster NGC 2264, measured using high-dispersion spectra from the WIYN 3.5 m telescope’s Hydra instrument. We combine these with literature values of temperature, rotation period, luminosity, disk classification, and binarity. We find some evidence that weak-lined TTSs may rotate faster than their classical TTS counterparts and that stars in binary systems may rotate faster than single stars. We also combine our v sin i measurements with rotation period to estimate the projected stellar radii of our sample stars, and then use a maximum likelihood modeling technique to compare our radii estimates to predicted values from stellar evolution models. We find that starspot-free models tend to underestimate the radii of the PMS stars at the age of the cluster, while models that incorporate starspots are more successful. We also observe a mass dependence in the degree of radius inflation, which may be a result of differences in the birth-line location on the HR diagram. Our study of NGC 2264 serves as a pilot study for analysis methods to be applied to four other clusters ranging in age from 1−14 Myr, which is the timescale over which protoplanetary disks dissipate and planetary systems begin to form.

<title>Metal-strong Inflows at the Outer-galactic-scale of a Quasar</title>

We present an analysis of the absorption-line system in the Very Large Telescope/Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph spectrum at a redshift of za = 3.1448 associated with the quasar SDSS J122040.23+092326.96, whose systematic redshift is ze = 3.1380 ± 0.0007, measured from the Hβ+[O iii] emission lines in our newly acquired NIR P200/TripleSpec data. This absorbing system, detected in numerous absorption lines, including the N v, N iii, C iv, C iii, Si iv, Si iii, and H i Lyman series, can be resolved into seven kinematic components with redshifted velocities ranging from 200 to 900 km s−1. The high-ionization N v doublet detected and the rather narrow Lyman series measured (b ≈ 14 km s−1) suggest that the absorption gas is photoionized, possibly by the quasar. A low density is inferred by the fact that N iiiλ989.80 is significantly detected while N iii*λ991.57 ( ) is undetectably weak. A firm lower limit of a solar value to the abundance of the gas can be set based on the measurements of Si iv and H i column densities, as first proposed by F. Hamann. Detailed photoionization simulations indicate that T1, and possibly the absorber as a whole, has metallicities of Z ∼ 1.5 − 6.0 Z☉, and is located at ∼15 kpc from the quasar nucleus. The metal-strong absorption inflows at the outskirt of the quasar host galaxy most likely originated in situ and were driven by stellar processes, such as stellar winds and/or supernova explosions. Such a relatively rare system may hold important clues to understanding the baryonic cycling of galaxies, and more cases could be picked out using relatively strong Si iv and weak Lyman absorption lines.

<title>Binary Stars Approaching Supermassive Black Holes: Tidal Breakup, Double Stellar Disruptions, and Stellar Collision</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In galactic centers, stars and binaries can be injected into low-angular-momentum orbits, resulting in close encounters with the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). Previous works have shown that under different conditions, such close encounters can lead to the breakup of the binary, disruptions of both stars, and collision between the stars. We use three-body scattering experiments to characterize these different outcomes for a range of system parameters, such as βb, the ratio of the binary tidal radius to the pericenter distance rp to the SMBH, and the compactness of the binary. We focus on stellar collisions, which occur for a range of βbs, with a few to tens of percent probabilities (depending on the compactness of the binary). In gentle encounters (βb ≲ 1), stellar collisions occur after the pericenter passage, and the merger remnants are typically ejected from the SMBH at a small velocity. In deep encounters (βb ≳ 1), collisions occur near the pericenter, with the impact velocity a few times the escape velocity of the star, and the merger remnants are typically bound to the SMBH. We suggest that stellar collisions induced by binary–SMBH encounters may produce exotic stars in galactic centers, trigger accretion flares onto the SMBH due to the mass loss, and result in bound merger remnants causing repeated partial tidal disruption events.

<title>Solar Wind–Magnetosphere Coupling by the Kelvin–Helmholtz Instability at Mercury</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad944b</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The Kelvin–Helmholtz instability (KHI) has been considered important in the energy transfer and momentum coupling between the solar wind and planetary magnetospheres. To explore this issue, we employ a two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulation to study the nonlinear evolution of the KHI at Mercury’s magnetopause using the parameters derived from a global hybrid simulation of MESSENGER’s first flyby of Mercury. Due to the absence of comprehensive plasma observations of Mercury’s magnetosphere, two scenarios are considered: one with a heavily loaded magnetosphere and the other with a weakly loaded magnetosphere, to demonstrate the development of the KHI under distinct levels of magnetospheric plasma density. Our results indicate that the KHI with a heavily loaded magnetosphere leads to a significantly more turbulent magnetopause and grows into the nonlinear fast-mode plane waves expanding away from the magnetopause. The momentum and energy flux quantified from our simulations reveal that the KHI with a heavily loaded magnetosphere can efficiently transport momentum and energy away from the magnetopause in the presence of the fast-mode plane waves. In the cases with a heavily loaded magnetosphere, observed in the inner magnetosphere, the momentum flux can reach 10−3 nPa, i.e., about 0.5% of the initial solar-wind dynamic pressure; the energy flux can be and the energy density is about 1.5%–3.0% of the initial solar-wind energy. In the cases with a very thin magnetosphere, observed away from the magnetopause, the momentum flux is negligible and the energy flux is smaller without the presence of the fast-mode plane waves in the magnetosphere.

<title>Signatures of Massive Black Hole Merger Host Galaxies from Cosmological Simulations. II. Unique Stellar Kinematics in Integral Field Unit Spectroscopy</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Secure methods for identifying the host galaxies of individual massive black hole (MBH) binaries and mergers detected by gravitational-wave experiments such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna and pulsar timing arrays are currently lacking, but will be critical to a variety of science goals. Recently, in Bardati et al., we used the Romulus25 cosmological simulation to show that MBH merger host galaxies have unique morphologies in imaging, due to their stronger bulges. Here, we use the same sample of simulated MBH merger host galaxies to investigate their stellar kinematics, as probed by optical integral field unit (IFU) spectroscopy. We perform stellar population synthesis and dust radiative transfer to generate synthetic 3D optical spectral data cubes of each simulated galaxy, and produce mock stellar kinematic maps. Based on a linear discriminant analysis of a combination of kinematic parameters derived from these maps, we show that this approach can identify MBH binary and merger host galaxies with accuracies that increase with chirp mass and mass ratio. For mergers with high chirp masses (≳108.2M⊙) and high mass ratios (≳0.5), the accuracies reach ≳85%, and their host galaxies are uniquely characterized by slower rotation and stronger stellar kinematic misalignments. These kinematic properties are commonly associated with massive early-type galaxies that have experienced major mergers, and naturally act as signposts for MBH binaries and mergers with high chirp masses and mass ratios. These results suggest that IFU spectroscopy should also play a role in telescope follow-up of future MBH binaries and mergers detected in gravitational waves.

<title>COSMOS2020: Disentangling the Role of Mass and Environment in Star Formation Activity of Galaxies at 0.4 < z < 4</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The role of internal and environmental factors in the star formation activity of galaxies is still a matter of debate, in particular at higher redshifts. Leveraging the most recent release of the COSMOS catalog, COSMOS2020, as well as density measurements from our previous study, we disentangle the impact of environment and stellar mass on the star formation rate (SFR) and specific SFR (sSFR) of a sample of ∼210,000 galaxies within a redshift range of 0.4 < z < 4, and present our findings in three cosmic epochs: (1) out to z ∼ 1, the average SFR and sSFR decline in extremely dense environments and at the high-mass end of the distribution, which is mostly due to the presence of the massive quiescent population; (2) at 1 < z < 2, the environmental dependence diminishes, while mass is still the dominant factor in star formation activity; and (3) beyond z ∼ 2, our sample is dominated by star-forming galaxies and we observe a reversal of the trends seen in the local Universe—the average SFR increases with increasing environmental density. Our analysis shows that both environmental and mass quenching efficiencies increase with stellar mass at all redshifts, with mass being the dominant quenching factor in massive galaxies compared to environmental effects. At 2 < z < 4, negative values of environmental quenching efficiency suggest that the fraction of star-forming galaxies in dense environments exceeds that in less-dense regions, likely due to the greater availability of cold gas, higher merger rates, and tidal effects that trigger star formation activity.
