<div> Hα emission, stellar continuum, morphological analysis, specific star formation rate (sSFR), Merian Survey <br>
总结:<br>
本研究利用Merian Survey的中等波段成像，对处于0.064 < z < 0.1红移范围内的一组星系进行了非参数形态学分析。我们提出了一种新方法，通过Merian Survey的N708中等波段滤光片来估计恒星连续发射，用于测量Hα发射并为我们的样本星系生成Hα图。我们测量了Hα和恒星连续图像的非参数形态统计量，探讨了Hα的形态与连续图像的差异，并研究了这些参数随星系物理特性的演变。与先前针对更质量较大星系的结果一致，我们发现恒星连续的不对称性随特定星形成率（sSFR）增加而增加，并将这一趋势扩展到质量较低的星系，同时也表明这一趋势适用于Hα发射的不对称性。我们发现具有最高sSFR的质量最低的星系的Hα发射一致地表现出不均匀和紧凑，而在此质量范围内不太活跃的星系的Hα发射似乎 diffus。在更高质量的星系中，我们的数据范围不足以评估类似的趋势是否适用。我们得出结论，低质量星系中的高sSFR可能是由于动力学不稳定性导致星系的分子气体被压缩到中心附近的密集区域。 <div>
Using medium-band imaging from the newly released Merian Survey, we conduct a nonparametric morphological analysis of Hα emission maps and stellar continua for a sample of galaxies with at 0.064 < z < 0.1. We present a novel method for estimating the stellar continuum emission through the Merian Survey’s N708 medium-band filter, which we use to measure Hα emission and produce Hα maps for our sample of galaxies with seven-band Merian photometry and available spectroscopy. We measure nonparametric morphological statistics for the Hα and stellar continuum images, explore how the morphology of the Hα differs from the continuum, and investigate how the parameters evolve with the galaxies’ physical properties. In agreement with previous results for more massive galaxies, we find that the asymmetry of the stellar continuum increases with specific star formation rate (sSFR), and we extend the trend to lower masses, also showing that it holds for the asymmetry of the Hα emission. We find that the lowest-mass galaxies with the highest sSFR have Hα emission that is consistently heterogeneous and compact, while the less active galaxies in this mass range have Hα emission that appears diffuse. At higher masses, our data do not span a sufficient range in sSFR to evaluate whether similar trends apply. We conclude that high sSFRs in low-mass galaxies likely result from dynamical instabilities that compress a galaxy’s molecular gas to a dense region near the center.

<div> 关键词: Σ–D relation, supernova remnants, clumpy medium, hydrodynamic simulations, synchrotron emission model

解析模型用于解释星系中超新星遗迹的亮度和直径之间关系，在低密度气泡和多密度的环境中进行了模拟和分析。模型表明，超新星遗迹与多密度介质碰撞会导致亮度的增加，然后随着距离增加呈现更陡峭的下降趋势。模型分析还表明，多密度介质的影响在直径约为14 pc时开始显著，并会导致散射的观测数据。然而，还需要进一步分析选择效应，并改进模型以考虑辐射损失和热传导。

总结:<br>
1. 模型解释超新星遗迹亮度和直径关系，模拟多密度介质环境。
2. 多密度介质碰撞导致亮度增加和陡峭的下降趋势。
3. 多密度介质的影响从直径约14 pc开始，导致散射的观测数据。
4. 需要进一步分析选择效应。
5. 需要改进模型以考虑辐射损失和热传导。 <div>
We present an analytical model of the Σ–D relation for supernova remnants (SNRs) evolving in a clumpy medium. The model and its approximations were developed using the hydrodynamic simulations of SNRs in environments of low-density bubbles and clumpy media with different densities and volume filling factors. For calculation of SNR luminosities we developed the synchrotron emission model, implying the test-particle approximation. The goal of this work is to explain the flattened part of the Σ–D relation for Galactic SNRs at D ≈ 14–50 pc. Our model shows that the shock collision with the clumpy medium initially enhances the brightness of individual SNRs, which is followed by a steeper fall of their Σ–D curve. We used the analytical model to generate large SNR samples on the Σ–D plane, within a span of different densities and distances to the clumpy medium, keeping the observed distribution of diameters. After comparison with the Galactic sample, we conclude that the observed Σ–D flattening and scatter originate in sporadic emission jumps of individual SNRs while colliding with the dense clumps. Statistically, the significant impact of the clumps starts at diameters of ≈14 pc, up to ∼70 pc, with the average density jump at the clumpy medium of ∼220 times, roughly depending on the low density of the circumstellar region. However, additional analysis considering the selection effects is needed, as well as improvement of the model, considering radiation losses and thermal conduction.

这篇论文分析了WIND/STICS观测到的太阳风中质子在超热能区域的3D速度分布函数（VDFs），并选择了经过星际震荡的时间段内的数据进行研究。研究结果显示，与DSA（diffusive shock acceleration）模型推测的值相比，上游和下游的谱指数、折叠能量和标准化常数之间存在较小的一致性。此外，还比较了拟合参数与两个函数形式给出的值之间的差异。总的来说，研究发现与DSA给出的数值存在较小的一致性。 <br><br>总结: <br>这篇论文分析了WIND/STICS观测到的太阳风中质子在超热能区域的3D速度分布函数（VDFs），并比较了研究结果与DSA模型的预测值。研究发现，实际观测结果与DSA模型的预测存在较小的一致性，这表明DSA模型在描述这一现象上可能存在局限。 <div>
Here are analyzed 3D velocity distribution functions (VDFs) of protons in the suprathermal energy-per-charge (E/Q) domain of 6.2 to 223.1 keV/e, as observed by the WIND Suprathermal Ion Composition Spectrometer (WIND/STICS) between 1995 and 2019, upon passage of interplanetary (IP) shocks. “Suprathermal” designates energies above the bulk, “thermal” solar wind, including inner-source pickup ions, cometary ions, solar energetic particles, and suprathermal tail particles. Within the WIND/STICS measurements, here treated as a standalone data set, only 3D VDFs within 9 hr prior to and following the shock passage are selected, as identified by the Center for Astrophysics (CfA) Harvard Interplanetary Shock Database. These are subsequently averaged, first over the STICS field of view, then over 3 hr intervals in the 9 hr about the shock. The averages, with errors assuming Poisson statistics, are then fitted using the Levenburg–Marquardt nonlinear least squares technique to two simple, observationally suggested functions arising from diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) formalism: a power law in E/Q with spectral index (model I), and a power-law with exponential rollover having a cutoff in E/Q (model II). The first result is a comparison of upstream spectral indices, e-folding energies, and normalization constants with corresponding downstream values. The second is a comparison of fitted spectral indices against those given by measured CfA shock compression ratios and a comparison of fitted e-folding energies with those given by measured ratios and shock normal angles, per DSA-derived predictions. There is additionally a comparison between fitted parameters given by the two functional forms. Little agreement is found with values given by DSA.

本文利用HAWC望远镜收集的2398天的>1TeV数据，对脉冲星Geminga和PSR B0656+14（Monogem）周围的γ射线HALO空间延展和能谱进行了精确测量。通过使用物理模型对来自脉冲星风星云注入的正电子和电子(e±)生成的扩散γ射线辐射以及与星际辐射场的逆康普顿散射数据进行解释，发现这些HALO区域的形态特征受到抑制扩散的影响，大约比银河平均值小了三个数量级。此外，还得出了Geminga和Monogem的e±发射效率分别为6.6%和5.1%的结论。这些结果对于研究脉冲星风星云与星际介质之间的粒子扩散以及对AMS-02实验在10GeV以上测量到的正电子流的解释具有重要意义。<br><br>总结: 本文利用HAWC望远镜对脉冲星Geminga和PSR B0656+14（Monogem）周围的γ射线HALO空间延展和能谱进行了精确测量，发现HALO区域的形态特征受到抑制扩散的影响，e±发射效率分别为6.6%和5.1%的结论对研究粒子扩散和对AMS-02实验的解释具有重要意义。 <div>
We present the most precise measurements to date for the spatial extension and energy spectrum of the γ-ray region between a pulsar’s wind nebula and the interstellar medium, better known as the halo, present around Geminga and PSR B0656+14 (Monogem) using ∼2398 days of >1 TeV data collected by the HAWC observatory. We interpret the data using a physically motivated model for the diffuse γ-ray emission generated from positrons and electrons (e±) injected by the pulsar wind nebula and inverse Compton scattering with interstellar radiation fields. We find the morphologies of the regions inside these halos are characterized by an inhibited diffusion that are approximately three orders of magnitudes smaller than the Galactic average. We also obtain the e± emission efficiencies of 6.6% and 5.1%, respectively, for Geminga and Monogem. These results have remarkable consequences for the study of the particle diffusion in the region between the pulsar wind nebulae and the interstellar medium, and for the interpretation of the flux of positrons measured by the AMS-02 experiment above 10 GeV.

<div> geomagnetic storm, interplanetary data, magnetosonic shock, magnetic cloud, ionospheric current

总结:<br><br>2024年5月10日至11日的超级风暴是太空时代第二大的地磁风暴，也是唯一一个有同时的行星间数据的风暴。风暴的特征是一个+88 nT的突发冲击（SI+），随后是一个持续约9小时的三步风暴主相发展。造成第一个风暴主相的原因是快速前进的行星间冲击和一个南向的行星间磁场成分。第二个风暴主相的原因是太空剪切的加深和磁声波的压缩。第三个也是最强烈的风暴主相是由磁场强度增强引起的。风暴期间的一些效应包括地磁暴引起的极区电流流动、高能电子和宇宙射线通量的变化以及强烈的电离层电流流动。 <div>
The recent superstorm of 2024 May 10–11 is the second largest geomagnetic storm in the space age and the only one that has simultaneous interplanetary data (there were no interplanetary data for the 1989 March storm). The May superstorm was characterized by a sudden impulse (SI+) amplitude of +88 nT, followed by a three-step storm main-phase development, which had a total duration of ∼9 hr. The cause of the first storm main phase with a peak SYM-H intensity of −183 nT was a fast-forward interplanetary shock (magnetosonic Mach number Mms ∼ 7.2) and an interplanetary sheath with a southward interplanetary magnetic field component Bs of ∼40 nT. The cause of the second storm's main phase with an SYM-H intensity of −354 nT was a deepening of the sheath Bs to ∼43 nT. A magnetosonic wave (Mms ∼ 0.6) compressed the sheath to a high magnetic field strength of ∼71 nT. Intensified Bs of ∼48 nT were the cause of the third and most intense storm main phase, with an SYM-H intensity of −518 nT. Three magnetic cloud events with Bs fields of ∼25–40 nT occurred in the storm recovery phase, lengthening the recovery to ∼2.8 days. At geosynchronous orbit, ∼76 keV to ∼1.5 MeV electrons exhibited ∼1–3 orders of magnitude flux decreases following the shock/sheath impingement onto the magnetosphere. The cosmic-ray decreases at Dome C, Antarctica (effective vertical cutoff rigidity <0.01 GV) and Oulu, Finland (rigidity ∼0.8 GV) were ∼17% and ∼11%, respectively, relative to quiet-time values. Strong ionospheric current flows resulted in extreme geomagnetically induced currents of ∼30–40 A in the subauroral region. The storm period is characterized by strong polar-region field-aligned currents, with ∼10 times intensification during the main phase and equatorward expansion down to ∼50° geomagnetic (altitude-adjusted) latitude.

<title>A Break in the Size–Stellar Mass Relation: Evidence for Quenching and Feedback in Dwarf Galaxies</title>

<div> 关键词: 星体，气体，星系，形成，环境  
总结:  
本研究通过比较星体边缘和气体分布来研究星系的生长和环境影响。我们发现一些矮星系在围绕簇和场区域的Dstellar ≫ DHI的情况下，平均H i表面密度约为0.3 M⊙ pc−2，显示出压制和外部气体去除的影响。与之相比，在矮星系中Dstellar/DHI在0.5和2之间，与星体反馈的预期一致。我们还发现了Dstellar–M⋆关系在mbreak ∼ 4 × 108M⊙处发生了突变，这可能区分了低质量星系的影响。这些结果突显了结合深度光学和H i成像对理解星系演化的重要性。 <br><br> <div>
Mapping stars and gas in nearby galaxies is fundamental for understanding their growth and the impact of their environment. This issue is addressed by comparing the stellar “edges” of galaxies Dstellar, defined as the outermost diameter where in situ star formation significantly drops, with the gaseous distribution parameterized by the neutral atomic hydrogen diameter measured at 1 M⊙ pc−2, DHI. By sampling a broad H i mass range 105M⊙ < MHI < 1011M⊙, we find several dwarf galaxies with MHI < 109M⊙ from the field and Fornax Cluster that are distinguished by Dstellar ≫ DHI. For the cluster dwarfs, the average H i surface density near Dstellar is ∼0.3 M⊙ pc−2, reflecting the impact of quenching and outside-in gas removal from ram pressure and tidal interactions. In comparison, Dstellar/DHI ranges between 0.5 and 2 in dwarf field galaxies, consistent with the expectations from stellar feedback. Only more massive disk galaxies in the field can thus be characterized by the common assumption that Dstellar ≲ DHI. We discover a break in the Dstellar–M⋆ relation at mbreak ∼ 4 × 108M⊙ that potentially differentiates the low-mass regime, where the influence of stellar feedback and environmental processes more prominently regulates the sizes of nearby galaxies. Our results highlight the importance of combining deep optical and H i imaging for understanding galaxy evolution.

<div> CHIME, fast radio burst, drifting, microstructure, polarization<br />
总结:<br />
加拿大氢强度制图实验（CHIME）望远镜发现了12个非重复的快速射电暴（FRB）源。这些源被选自CHIME/FRB全阵列原始电压数据记录的数据库，其信噪比大且形态复杂。这些事件显示出各种独特的漂移现象，并具有微观结构特征。此外，报道了这些事件的极化特征，包括极化分数和法拉第旋转度量。这些爆发的形态特性与FRB辐射的相对论冲击和磁层模型以及通过离散电离等离子体结构的传播预测大致一致。我们还讨论了如何利用我们对形态学原型的改进理解来测试这些模型。 <div>
We present the discovery of 12 apparently nonrepeating fast radio burst (FRB) sources, detected by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) telescope. These sources, only one of which has been presented previously in the first CHIME/FRB catalog, were selected from a database comprising CHIME/FRB full-array raw voltage data recordings, based on their large signal-to-noise ratios and complex morphologies. Our study examines the time-frequency characteristics of these bursts, including drifting, microstructure, and periodicities. The events in this sample display a variety of unique drifting phenomenologies that deviate from the linear negative drifting phenomenon seen in many repeating FRBs, and motivate a possible new framework for classifying drifting archetypes. Additionally, we detect microstructure features of duration ≲50 μs in seven events, with some as narrow as ≃7 μs. We find no evidence of significant periodicities between subburst components. Furthermore, we report the polarization characteristics of seven events, including their polarization fractions and Faraday rotation measures (RMs). The observed ∣RM∣ values span a wide range of 17.24(2)–328.06(2) rad m−2, with apparent linear polarization fractions between 0.340(1) and 0.946(3). The morphological properties of the bursts in our sample appear broadly consistent with predictions from both relativistic shock and magnetospheric models of FRB emission, as well as propagation through discrete ionized plasma structures. We address these models and discuss how they can be tested using our improved understanding of morphological archetypes.

ALMA进行了1.2毫米波段的观测，发现IRAS16547-E和IRAS16547-W周围存在具有双锥结构的尘埃包层，受到热射电喷流的影响。观测还显示磁场向量与双锥包层的结构密切相关，极化分数约为2.0%。同时，分子线H13CO+和HN13C的速度梯度与磁场有很好的对应关系，可能追踪了分子流的空腔或在某些部分存在向内运动。研究还发现一些区域的磁场强度在2到6.1 mG之间。此外，CS(5−4)分子线的发射显示出多个流出空腔或驶向不同方向的弓形冲击波，其中一些似乎沿着西北-东南方向的热射电喷流运动。
<br /><br />总结: 本文利用ALMA进行了高角分辨率观测，揭示了大质量原恒星周围的尘埃包层结构和磁场特征。研究发现磁场与尘埃包层紧密相关，速度梯度与磁场对应，揭示了磁场在大质量星形成早期进化阶段的重要作用。 <div>
The formation of the massive stars, and in particular, the role that the magnetic fields play in their early evolutionary phase is still far from being completely understood. Here, we present the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array 1.2 mm full polarized continuum and H13CO+(3−2), CS(5−4), and HN13C(3−2) line observations with a high angular resolution (∼0.″4 or 1100 au). In the 1.2 mm continuum emission, we reveal a dusty envelope surrounding the massive protostars, IRAS16547-E and IRAS16547-W, with dimensions of ∼10,000 au. This envelope has a biconical structure likely carved by the powerful thermal radio jet present in region. The magnetic field vectors follow very well the biconical envelope. The polarization fraction is ∼2.0% in this region. Some of these vectors seem to converge to IRAS 16547-E and IRAS 16547-W, the most massive protostars. Moreover, the velocity fields revealed from the spectral lines H13CO+(3−2) and HN13C(3−2) show velocity gradients with a good correspondence with the magnetic fields, which maybe are tracing the cavities of molecular outflows or maybe infalling in some parts. We derived a magnetic field strength in some filamentary regions that goes from 2 to 6.1 mG. We also find that the CS(5−4) molecular line emission reveals multiple outflow cavities or bow shocks with different orientations, some of which seem to follow the NW–SE radio thermal jet.

<br /><br />总结:
本研究利用AKARI/红外相机研究了多环芳烃（PAH）尘埃排放对宇宙星系中的星形成率的指标作用。通过观测443个星系的光谱并使用光谱诊断方法推断星系的星形成率。研究发现，PAH与24μm的Hα发射光度呈线性关系，但仅限于正常的星形“主序”星系。此外，研究还发现PAH星形成率密度（SFRD）与远红外的SFRD一致，在z∼1时比未校正的UV观测高一个数量级。在z∼1时，星爆星系对总SFRD的贡献超过主序星系，达到总SFRD的0.7以上。 <div>
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) dust emission has been proposed as an effective extinction-independent star formation rate (SFR) indicator in the mid-infrared, but this may depend on conditions in the interstellar medium. The coverage of the AKARI/Infrared Camera (IRC) allows us to study the effects of metallicity, starburst intensity, and active galactic nuclei on PAH emission in galaxies with fν (L18W) ≲ 19 AB mag. Observations include follow-up, rest-frame optical spectra of 443 galaxies within the AKARI North Ecliptic Pole survey that have IRC detections from 7 to 24 μm. We use optical emission line diagnostics to infer SFR based on Hα and [O ii]λλ3726, 3729 emission line luminosities. The PAH 6.2 μm and PAH 7.7 μm luminosities (L(PAH 6.2 μm) and L(PAH 7.7 μm), respectively) derived using multiwavelength model fits are consistent with those derived from slitless spectroscopy within 0.2 dex. L(PAH 6.2 μm) and L(PAH 7.7 μm) correlate linearly with the 24 μm dust-corrected Hα luminosity only for normal, star-forming “main-sequence” galaxies. Assuming multilinear correlations, we quantify the additional dependencies on metallicity and starburst intensity, which we use to correct our PAH SFR calibrations at 0 < z < 1.2 for the first time. We derive the cosmic star formation rate density (SFRD) per comoving volume from 0.15 ≲ z ≲ 1. The PAH SFRD is consistent with that of the far-infrared and reaches an order of magnitude higher than that of uncorrected UV observations at z ∼ 1. Starburst galaxies contribute ≳0.7 of the total SFRD at z ∼ 1 compared to main-sequence galaxies.

总结:
本研究使用GALEX的近紫外线和远紫外线图像对551个近距离（D < 100 Mpc）的边缘盘星系进行了搜索，发现了广泛存在的星系外发射，其尺度高度为1-2.3千秒差距，大约有10%的（泛红的）流量在μB = 25等视星等/角秒²的B带等视等级之外。额外的发射在7%的个别星系中被探测到，另外三分之一的星系至少有5%的总流量在μB = 25等视等级/角秒²的B带等视星等之外在一个盘组件。额外的发射光度和颜色与反射星云一致，而不是恒星晕，并且表明平均而言，盘状星系的星系外尘埃质量为其星际介质质量的5%-15%。这表明，回收材料至少占了∼L*星系内部星系环境介质（R < 10 kpc）的三分之一。 <div>
Circumgalactic dust grains trace the circulation of mass and metals between star-forming regions and gaseous galactic halos, giving insight into feedback and tidal stripping processes. We perform a search for ultraviolet (UV) reflection nebulae produced by extraplanar dust around 551 nearby (D < 100 Mpc), edge-on disk galaxies using archival near-ultraviolet and far-ultraviolet images from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX), accounting for the point-spread function (FWHM = 4″–5″). We detect extraplanar emission ubiquitously in stacks of galaxies binned by morphology and star formation rate, with scale heights of hh = 1–2.3 kpc and ≈10% of the total (reddened) flux in the galaxy found beyond the B-band isophotal level of μB = 25 mag arcsec−2. This emission is detected in 7% of the individual galaxies, and an additional one-third have at least 5% of their total flux found beyond μB = 25 mag arcsec−2 in a disk component. The extraplanar luminosities and colors are consistent with reflection nebulae rather than stellar halos and indicate that, on average, disk galaxies have an extraplanar dust mass of 5%–15% of that in their interstellar medium. This suggests that recycled material composes at least a third of the inner circumgalactic medium (R < 10 kpc) in ∼L* galaxies.

<br />总结:<br />本研究使用高频监测数据和XMM-Newton观测结果，首次检测到了源自内部吸积流的软滞后现象。此外，同时测量了X射线回波和UVOIR盘吸收的时间滞后，有效地绘制了黑洞周围整个吸积盘的图像。研究发现低时间频率产生的UVOIR时间滞后要比标准吸积盘吸收预期的时间滞后长2-3倍。模拟滞后需额外约束的再处理，与Hβ滞后测量结果一致。当将光曲线分成不同部分时，UVOIR滞后表现出明显的变化，当离子化流的遮挡最严重时，滞后最大，我们推测此时BLR的再处理会显著延长滞后。随着风的减弱，滞后会受到较短的吸积盘滞后的主导。 <div>
X-ray reverberation mapping is a powerful technique for probing the innermost accretion disk, whereas continuum reverberation mapping in the UV, optical, and infrared (UVOIR) reveals reprocessing by the rest of the accretion disk and broad-line region (BLR). We present the time lags of Mrk 817 as a function of temporal frequency measured from 14 months of high-cadence monitoring from Swift and ground-based telescopes, in addition to an XMM-Newton observation, as part of the AGN STORM 2 campaign. The XMM-Newton lags reveal the first detection of a soft lag in this source, consistent with reverberation from the innermost accretion flow. These results mark the first simultaneous measurement of X-ray reverberation and UVOIR disk reprocessing lags—effectively allowing us to map the entire accretion disk surrounding the black hole. Similar to previous continuum reverberation mapping campaigns, the UVOIR time lags arising at low temporal frequencies are longer than those expected from standard disk reprocessing by a factor of 2–3. The lags agree with the anticipated disk reverberation lags when isolating short-timescale variability, namely timescales shorter than the Hβ lag. Modeling the lags requires additional reprocessing constrained at a radius consistent with the BLR size scale inferred from contemporaneous Hβ-lag measurements. When we divide the campaign light curves, the UVOIR lags show substantial variations, with longer lags measured when obscuration from an ionized outflow is greatest. We suggest that, when the obscurer is strongest, reprocessing by the BLR elongates the lags most significantly. As the wind weakens, the lags are dominated by shorter accretion disk lags.

<div> 超巨星，质量损失，MESA，赤色超巨星，蓝色超巨星
总结:
这篇文章讨论了大质量恒星中可能存在的喷发性质量损失机制，该机制与恒星外层的超Eddington光度相关。研究者在MESA星演化模拟中实现了这个1D模型，并发现质量损失可达每年约10^-2太阳质量。研究指出，这种喷发性质量损失可能导致质量大于20太阳质量的恒星不再演化为红超巨星，而是变成蓝超巨星，从而解释了观测到的这一质量范围内红超巨星的缺失。 <div>
Eruptive mass loss in massive stars is known to occur, but the mechanism(s) are not yet well understood. One proposed physical explanation appeals to opacity-driven super-Eddington luminosities in stellar envelopes. Here, we present a 1D model for eruptive mass loss and implement this model in the MESA stellar evolution code. The model identifies regions in the star where the energy associated with a local super-Eddington luminosity exceeds the binding energy of the overlaying envelope. The material above such regions is ejected from the star. Stars with initial masses of 10−100 M⊙ at solar and SMC metallicities are evolved through core helium burning, with and without this new eruptive mass-loss scheme. We find that eruptive mass loss of up to ∼10−2M⊙yr−1 can be driven by this mechanism, and occurs in a vertical band on the H-R diagram between . This predicted eruptive mass loss prevents stars of initial masses ≳20 M⊙ from evolving to become red supergiants (RSGs), with the stars instead ending their lives as blue supergiants, and offers a possible explanation for the observed lack of RSGs in that mass regime.

<div> 关键词: Odd radio circles, cosmic-ray simulations, AGN jet-inflated bubbles, CRp-dominated jets, galaxy evolution

总结:
本研究使用FLASH代码进行三维宇宙射线磁流体动力学模拟，预测了端对端活跃星系核喷流充气泡的射电形态，考虑了强子发射。我们发现，强大且持续时间较长的CRp主导喷流可以在质量较低的暗物质团中产生类似大小（∼300–600 kpc）和射电形态（圆形和边缘增亮）的ORCs气泡。在相同输入喷流能量的情况下，持续时间较长（因此功率较低）的喷流往往会产生较大的气泡，因为高功率喷流会产生强大的激波，带走了喷流能量的相当部分。由于效率高的强子碰撞在气泡和环境介质的界面上，自然产生了ORCs的边缘增亮特征。我们进一步讨论了射电亮度、X射线可检测性以及在星系演化背景下此类强AGN喷流的可能起源。我们得出结论，端对端CR主导的AGN气泡可能是ORCs形成的合理情景。 <br /><br /> <div>
Odd radio circles (ORCs) are newly discovered extragalactic radio objects with an unknown origin. In this work, we carry out three-dimensional cosmic-ray (CR) magnetohydrodynamic simulations using the FLASH code and predict the radio morphology of end-on active galactic nucleus (AGN) jet-inflated bubbles considering hadronic emission. We consider CR proton (CRp)-dominated jets as they tend to inflate oblate bubbles, promising to reproduce the large inferred sizes of the ORCs when viewed end-on. We find that powerful and long-duration CRp-dominated jets can create bubbles with similar sizes (∼300–600 kpc) and radio morphology (circular and edge-brightened) to the observed ORCs in low-mass (Mvir ∼ 8 × 1012 − 8 × 1013M⊙) halos. Given the same amount of input jet energy, longer-duration (thus lower-power) jets tend to create larger bubbles since high-power jets generate strong shocks that carry away a significant portion of the jet energy. The edge-brightened feature of the observed ORCs is naturally reproduced due to efficient hadronic collisions at the interface between the bubbles and the ambient medium. We further discuss the radio luminosity, X-ray detectability, and the possible origin of such strong AGN jets in the context of galaxy evolution. We conclude that end-on CR-dominated AGN bubbles could be a plausible scenario for the formation of ORCs.

<br />总结:<br />文章通过对科代坦纳勒和威尔逊山天文台的数据进行分析，研究了太阳黑子群的倾斜角度与下一个太阳周期参数之间的关系。主要发现可以总结为三点：（1）在衰减阶段，平均倾斜角与倾斜角散射之间的相关性统计上不显著；（2）在衰减阶段，六个测量量与下一个太阳周期的强度、振幅和上升阶段的持续时间呈显著负相关，并且与倾斜角散射有正相关：包括倾斜角的标准差、均方根倾斜角、倾斜角的绝对值的平均值、面积加权倾斜角的绝对值、纬度加权倾斜角的绝对值和面积和纬度加权倾斜角的绝对值；（3）衰减阶段的平均倾斜角、面积加权倾斜角、纬度加权倾斜角以及面积和纬度加权倾斜角与下一个太阳周期的强度、振幅和上升阶段的持续时间的相关性统计上不显著。这些发现表明，在衰减阶段倾斜角散射对太阳周期变化的调节起着至关重要的作用。 <div>
Based on the data from the Kodaikanal and Mount Wilson observatories, we investigate the relationships of the tilt angles of sunspot groups, including the mean tilt angle and the tilt-angle scatter, during the declining phase with the parameters of the next solar cycle (SC). The main findings are summarized in the following three points. (1) During the declining phase, the correlation between the mean tilt angle and the tilt-angle scatter is statistically insignificant. (2) Six quantities measured during the declining phase show significant anticorrelations with the strength and amplitude of the next SC and positive correlations with the duration of the ascending phase of the next SC: the standard deviation of the tilt angles, the rms tilt angle, the mean absolute value of the tilt angles, the area-weighted absolute value of the tilt angles, the latitude-weighted absolute value of the tilt angles, and the area- and latitude-weighted absolute value of the tilt angles. (3) The correlations of the mean tilt angle, the area-weighted tilt angle, the latitude-weighted tilt angle, and the area- and latitude-weighted tilt angle during the declining phase with the strength, amplitude, and duration of the ascending phase of the next SC are statistically insignificant. These findings demonstrate that the modulation of the parameters of the next SC by the tilt-angle scatter during the declining phase plays a vital role in regulating SC variability.

<div> 关键词: 主序序列，脉冲星，电子回旋激射辐射，磁层密度，星磁层结构
总结:
主序序列脉冲星是一种产生相干射电脉冲的磁早型恒星，其辐射机制为电子回旋激射辐射。这种辐射具有高指向性和窄带宽的特点，且极化度极高。本文通过对一颗后B型主序序列脉冲星HD 133880进行超宽带观测，并通过不同频率下脉冲到达时间的差异来提取等离子体分布信息，发现恒星磁层具有倾斜的盘状过密度，且密度主要集中在中等频率范围。这些结果支持了最近对于热恒星离心支撑磁层的密度模型，为早型恒星磁层操作提供了进一步的动机，并提供了对大尺度恒星磁层中电子回旋激射辐射现象的全面描述。 <div>
Main-sequence radio pulse emitters (MRPs) are magnetic early-type stars that produce coherent radio emission observed in the form of periodic radio pulses. The emission mechanism behind this is the electron-cyclotron maser emission (ECME). Among all kinds of magnetospheric emission, ECME is unique due to its high directivity and intrinsically narrow bandwidth. The emission is also highly circularly polarized and the sign of polarization is opposite for the two magnetic hemispheres. This combination of properties makes ECME highly sensitive to the three-dimensional structures in the stellar magnetospheres. This is especially significant for late-B and A-type magnetic stars that do not emit other types of magnetospheric emission such as Hα, the key probe used to trace magnetospheric densities. In this paper, we use an ultra-wideband observation (0.4–2 GHz) of a late B-type MRP HD 133880 to demonstrate how we can extract information on plasma distribution from ECME. We achieve this by examining the differences in pulse arrival times (“lags”) as a function of frequencies and qualitatively comparing those with lags obtained by simulating ECME ray paths in hot stars’ magnetospheres. This reveals that the stellar magnetosphere has a disk-like overdensity inclined to the magnetic equator with a centrally concentrated density that primarily affects the intermediate frequencies (400–800 MHz). This result, which is consistent with the recent density model proposed for hotter centrifugally supported magnetospheres, lends support to the idea of a unifying model for magnetospheric operations in early-type stars, and also provides further motivation to fully characterize the ECME phenomenon in large-scale stellar magnetospheres.

<div> 高红移星系、He/H比率、局部矮星系、He过量、电子密度
总结:<br /><br />本文研究了三个红移较高的星系中He i/Hβ flux和He/H丰度比率，发现这些高红移星系表现出强烈的He i发射，He i/Hβ flux比率一般大于局部矮星系。对于高红移星系，He/H值大于0.10或电子密度ne ∼ 103−4 cm−3，远高于局部星系的值。作者发现He/H和N/O或ne–N/O平面间存在正相关关系。这表明高红移星系中的氦过量和氮过量无法用标准恒星爆炸的化学丰度来解释，而可能是由CNO循环产物和平衡比例所导致，或者是由于过多碰撞激发造成的。 <div>
We present He i/Hβ flux and He/H abundance ratios in three James Webb Space Telescope galaxies with significant constraints on N/O abundance ratios, GS-NDG-9422, RXCJ2248-ID, and GLASS150008 at z ∼ 6 mostly with the spectroscopic coverage from He iλ4471 and He iiλ4686 to He iλ7065, and comparing with 68 local dwarf galaxies. We find that these high-z galaxies present strong He i emission with He i/Hβ flux ratios generally larger than those of local dwarf galaxies. We derive He/H with all of the detected Hei, He ii, and 2−3 hydrogen Balmer lines in the same manner as the local He/H determination conducted for cosmology studies. These high-z galaxies show He overabundance He/H ≳0.10 or high electron density of ne ∼ 103−4 cm−3 much larger than local values at low O/H, . In contrast, we obtain low He/H and ne values for our local dwarf galaxies by the same technique with the same helium and hydrogen lines, and confirm that the difference between the high-z and local dwarf galaxies is not mimicked by systematics. While two scenarios of (1) He overabundance and (2) high electron density are not clearly concluded, we find that there is a positive correlation between the He/H–N/O or ne–N/O plane by the comparison of the high-z and local dwarf galaxies. Scenario (1) suggests that the overabundant helium and nitrogen are not explained by the standard chemical enrichment of core-collapse supernovae, but by the CNO-cycle products and equilibrium ratios, respectively. Scenario (2) indicates that the strong helium lines originated from the central dense clouds of the high-z galaxies by excessive collisional excitation.

本研究利用高分辨率的Magellan/MIKE观测了Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus(GSE)潮汐破碎星系中43颗金属贫瘠星。这是首次在一个星系中发现了随着[Mg/H]增加，[Eu/Mg]明显上升的现象。研究使用了简单的化学演化模型，研究表明这种上升可以由即时和延迟的r过程丰富事件相互作用而产生。在这个破碎的星系中，延迟的r过程来源是必需的，才能解释[Eu/Mg]的上升和后来的平稳。然而，这种上升可能由具有短（约10百万年）或长（约500百万年）最小延迟时间的延迟r过程来源来解释。未来关于GSE中r过程来源及其丰富过程的研究将需要更低金属丰度的GSE中其他星体的研究。 
<br /><br />总结: neutron star mergers产生r过程元素，GSE中出现了与[Mg/H]增加相关的[Eu/Mg]上升现象，化学演化模型表明这可能是由即时和延迟的r过程丰富事件相互作用造成的，未来需要更低金属贫瘠星的研究来了解GSE中r过程来源及其丰富过程。 <div>
Neutron star mergers (NSMs) produce r-process elements after a time-delayed inspiral process. Once a significant number of NSMs are present in a galaxy, r-process elements, such as Eu, are expected to significantly increase with time. Yet, there have been limited observational data in support of Eu increasing within Local Group galaxies. We have obtained high-resolution Magellan/MIKE observations of 43 metal-poor stars in the Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus (GSE) tidally disrupted galaxy with −2.5 < [Fe/H] < −1. For the first time, we find a clear rise in [Eu/Mg] with increasing [Mg/H] within one galaxy. We use a simple chemical evolution model to study how such a rise can result from the interplay of prompt and delayed r-process enrichment events. Delayed r-process sources are required to explain the rise and subsequent leveling off of [Eu/Mg] in this disrupted galaxy. However, the rise may be explained by delayed r-process sources with either short (∼10 Myr) or long (∼500 Myr) minimum delay times. Future studies on the nature of r-process sources and their enrichment processes in the GSE will require additional stars in the GSE at even lower metallicities than the present study.

总结: 本文研究了R值变化与X级耀斑在太阳活动区的可能关系，采用Solar Dynamic Observatory的磁场数据进行推算，并在光球以上的区域计算R值。研究表明，在低太阳大气中存在潜在高度范围，即最佳高度范围（OHR），其中R值急剧增加。此外，对于新出现的AR，X级耀斑前的R值演变与非爆发性AR明显不同。对于非新出现的AR，无法找到OHR。这些发现有助于改进耀斑预测方法。 <br /><br /> <div>
The R-value is a measure of the strength of photospheric magnetic polarity inversion lines in active regions (ARs). This work investigates the possibility of a relation between R-value variations and the occurrence of X-class flares in ARs, not in the solar photosphere, as usual, but above it in regions closer to where flares occur. The modus operandi is to extrapolate the Solar Dynamic Observatory’s Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager magnetogram data up to a height of 3.24 Mm above the photosphere and then compute the R-value based on the extrapolated magnetic field. Recent studies have shown that certain flare-predictive parameters such as the horizontal gradient of the vertical magnetic field and magnetic helicity may improve flare prediction lead times significantly if studied at a specific height range above the photosphere, called the optimal height range (OHR). Here, we define the OHR as a collection of heights where a sudden but sustained increase in R-value is found. For the eight case studies discussed in this paper, our results indicate that it is possible for OHRs to exist in the low solar atmosphere (between 0.36 and 3.24 Mm), where R-value spikes occur 48–68 hr before the first X-class flare of an emerging AR. The temporal evolution of R-value before the first X-class flare for an emerging AR is also found to be distinct from that of nonflaring ARs. For X-class flares associated with nonemerging ARs, an OHR could not be found.

The first public 0.9–4.4 μm NIRCam images of the North Ecliptic Pole Time Domain Field uncovered galaxies displaying point-source features in their cores as seen in the longer-wavelength filters. We visually identified a sample of 66 galaxies (∼1 galaxy arcmin–2) with pointlike cores and have modeled their two-dimensional light profiles with GalFit, identifying 16 galactic nuclei with measurable point-source components. GalFit suggests that the visual sample is a mix of both compact stellar bulge and point-source galaxy cores. This core classification is complemented by spectral energy distribution modeling to infer the sample’s active galactic nucleus (AGN) and host-galaxy parameters. For galaxies with measurable point-source components, the median fractional AGN contribution to their 0.1–30.0 μm flux is 0.44, and 14/16 are color-classified AGN. We conclude that near-infrared point-source galaxy cores are signatures of AGN. In addition, we define an automated sample-selection criterion to identify these point-source features. This criterion can be used in other extant and future NIRCam images to streamline the search for galaxies with unresolved IR-luminous AGN. The James Webb Space Telescope’s superb angular resolution and sensitivity at infrared wavelengths are resurrecting the morphological identification of AGN.

We present initial results associating galaxies in the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) Ultra Deep Field (MUDF) with gas seen in absorption along the line of sight to two bright quasars in this field to explore the dependence of metals in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) on galaxy properties. The MUDF includes ∼140 hr of Very Large Telescope (VLT)/MUSE data and 90 orbits of Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/G141M grism observations alongside VLT/Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph spectroscopy of the two quasars and several bands of HST imaging. We compare the metal absorption around galaxies in this field as a function of impact parameter, azimuthal angle, and galaxy metallicity across redshifts 0.5 < z < 3.2. Due to the depth of our data and a large field of view, our analysis extends to low stellar masses (<107M⊙) and high impact parameters (>600 kpc). We find a correlation between the absorber equivalent width and the number of nearby galaxies, but do not detect a significant anticorrelation with the impact parameter. Our full sample does not show any significant change in absorber incidence as a function of azimuthal angle. However, we do find a bimodality in the azimuthal angle distribution of absorption at small impact parameters (<2 rvir) and around highly star-forming galaxies, possibly indicating disk-like accretion and biconical outflows. Finally, we do not detect any systematic deviation from the fundamental metallicity relation among galaxies with detected absorption. This work is limited by gaps in the wavelength coverage of our current data; broader-wavelength observations with the James Webb Space Telescope will allow us to unlock the full potential of the MUDF for studying the CGM.

<div> 关键词: 线偏振, 脉冲星, 磁化等离子体, 频率演变, 弯曲辐射<br />
总结: 
本文研究了来自PSR J0332+5434的高线偏振信号的频谱特性，使用了Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope对300至750 MHz的频率范围进行了观测。研究发现，高线偏振时间样本在很大程度上呈现出宽带的特性，在轮廓明显的区域有时呈现出窄而尖锐的特征。这些尖锐特征在整个频率范围内都局限在一个窄的脉冲经度内，并且它们的光谱形状有时呈倒置抛物线形状。在所有这些情况下，位置角偏振（PPA）仅沿着一个正交的RVM轨迹，可能对应于X模式。从理论上讲，倒置的光谱形状可以通过大量带电孤立子（电荷团）的相干加成引起的X模式的弯曲辐射来解释。 <div>
The polarization position angles (PPA) of time samples with high linear polarization often show two parallel tracks across the pulsar profile that follow the rotating vector model (RVM). This feature supports coherent curvature radiation (CCR) as the underlying mechanism of radio emission from pulsars, where the parallel tracks of the PPA represent the orthogonal extraordinary (X) and ordinary (O) eigenmodes of strongly magnetized pair plasma. However, the frequency evolution of these high linearly polarized signals remains unexplored. In this work, we explore the flux density spectral nature of high linearly polarized signals by studying the emission from PSR J0332+5434 over a frequency range between 300 and 750 MHz, using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope. The pulsar average profile comprises a central core and a pair of conal components. We find the high linearly polarized time samples to be broadband in nature, and in many cases, they resemble a narrow spiky feature in the conal regions. These spiky features are localized within a narrow pulse longitude over the entire frequency range, and their spectral shapes sometimes resemble an inverted parabolic shape. In all such cases, the PPA is exclusively along one of the orthogonal RVM tracks, likely corresponding to the X-mode. The inverted spectral shape can, in principle, be explained if the high linearly polarized emission in these time samples is formed due to the incoherent addition of CCR from a large number of charged solitons (charge bunches) exciting the X-mode.

<div> 关键词: 模拟星系团、IllustrisTNG、MGS算法、星系超密度、halo identification

总结:
本文介绍了基于IllustrisTNG模拟的新型模拟星系团目录，使用MGS算法识别星系超密度。与以往的友邻法集群识别不同，本文的集群识别考虑了星系亚暗物质而非不可观测的暗物质粒子，并且采用MGS算法，能够有效分离由大质量星系托管的星系超密度。MGS目录列出了303个M200 > 1014M⊙的halos，比FoF目录多约10％。MGS目录的独立性能够识别出更多独立的大质量星系团halos，这有助于更好地评估MGS星系团对星系演化的影响，并且能够有效识别出合并星系团。因此，MGS星系团目录是研究宇宙学模拟中星系团及与观测星系团样本比较的有用工具。 <div>
We present a new simulated galaxy cluster catalog based on the IllustrisTNG simulation. We use the Mulguisin (MGS) algorithm to identify galaxy overdensities. Our cluster identification differs from the previous friends-of-friends (FoF) cluster identification in two aspects: (1) we identify cluster halos based on the galaxy subhalos instead of unobservable dark matter particles, and (2) we use the MGS algorithm, which separates galaxy overdensities hosted by massive galaxies. Our approach provides a cluster catalog constructed in a way similar to the construction of observed cluster catalogs using spectroscopic surveys. The MGS cluster catalog lists 303 halos with M200 > 1014M⊙, including ∼10% more than the FoF catalog. The MGS catalog includes more systems because we separate some independent massive MGS cluster halos that are bundled into a single FoF halo. These independent MGS halos are apparently distinguishable in the galaxy spatial distribution and the phase-space diagram. Because we construct a refined cluster catalog that identifies local galaxy overdensities, we evaluate the effect of MGS clusters on the evolution of galaxies better than when using the FoF cluster catalog. The MGS halo identification also enables effective identifications of merging clusters by selecting systems with neighboring galaxy overdensities. We thus highlight the fact that the MGS cluster catalog is a useful tool for studying clusters in cosmological simulations and for comparing with observed cluster samples.

本研究对3C391:NML分子云进行了详细的化学研究，发现它受宇宙射线影响较大。通过对18种分子进行观测和分析，发现了N(HCO+)/N(HOC+)比值较低，N(HCS+)/N(CS)比值较高，X(l-C3H+)更高。通过化学模型的研究发现，需要增强的宇宙射线电离率才能解释这些观测结果，这表明3C391:NML的宇宙射线电离率要比典型的分子云高2-3个数量级。作者指出分子云化学平衡并不一定已经达到，因此需要谨慎对待ζ的取值。 
<br /><br />总结: 通过对3C391:NML分子云进行分子观测和化学模型研究，发现它受到了强烈的宇宙射线影响，需要比典型分子云更高的宇宙射线电离率才能解释观测结果。 <div>
Cosmic rays (CRs) have strong influences on the chemistry of dense molecular clouds (MCs). To study the detailed chemistry induced by CRs, we conducted a Yebes W-band line survey towards an unshocked MC (which we named 3C391:NML) associated with supernova remnant 3C 391. We detected emission lines of 18 molecular species in total and estimated their column densities with local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and non-LTE analysis. Using the abundance ratio N(HCO+)/N(CO) and an upper limit of N(DCO+)/N(HCO+), we estimated that the CR ionization rate of 3C391:NML is ζ ≳ 2.7 × 10−14 s−1 with an analytic method. However, we caution against adopting this value because chemical equilibrium, which is a prerequisite of using the equations, is not necessarily reached in 3C391:NML. We observed lower N(HCO+)/N(HOC+), higher N(HCS+)/N(CS), and higher X(l-C3H+) by an order of magnitude in 3C391:NML than the typical values in quiescent dense MCs. We found that an enhanced CR ionization rate (of order ∼10−15 or ∼10−14 s−1) is needed to reproduce the observation with a chemical model. This is higher than the values found in typical MCs by 2–3 orders of magnitude.

<title>Constraining the Origin of the Nanohertz Gravitational-wave Background by Pulsar Timing Array Observations of Both the Background and Individual Supermassive Binary Black Holes</title>

<div> gravitational waves, supermassive binary black holes, pulsar timing array, detection probability, GWB origin

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章探讨了超大质量双黑洞在脉冲星定时阵列实验中的引力波信号检测，以及对引力波背景和个体源的来源进行了研究。研究发现，如果检测到的引力波信号完全源自双黑洞，那么质量与宿主星系的红移演化需呈现显著正向趋势。同时，中国脉冲星定时阵列观测数据具有较高的个体双黑洞检测概率，并且即使双黑洞对引力波背景信号的贡献仅为10％，也有望在约10年的观测期内获得积极的检测结果。在未来数年内未能检测到个体双黑洞信号的情况下，结合已检测的引力波背景信号，可以对双黑洞对引力波背景信号的上限提出严格限制，并有助于确定/否定其宇宙起源。 <div>
The gravitational waves (GWs) from supermassive binary black holes (BBHs) have long been sought by pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments, in the forms of both a stochastic GW background (GWB) and individual sources. Evidence for a GWB was reported recently by several PTAs with origins to be determined. Here we use a BBH population synthesis model to investigate the detection probability of individual BBHs by the Chinese PTA (CPTA) and the constraint on the GWB origin that may be obtained by PTA observations of both GWB and individual BBHs. If the detected GWB signal is entirely due to BBHs, a significantly positive redshift evolution (∝ (1 + z)2.07) of the mass scaling relation between supermassive black holes and their host galaxies is required. In this case, we find that the detection probability of individual BBHs is ∼85% or 64% if using a period of 3.4 yr of CPTA observation data, with an expectation of ∼1.9 or 1.0 BBHs detectable with a signal-to-noise ratio ≥3 or 5, and it is expected to increase to >95% if the observation period is extended to 5 yr or longer. Even if the contribution from BBHs to the GWB power signal is as small as ∼10%, a positive detection of individual BBHs can still be expected within an observation period of ∼10 yr. A nondetection of individual BBHs within several years from now jointly with the detected GWB signal can put a strong constraint on the upper limit of the BBH contribution to the GWB signal and help identify/falsify a cosmological origin.

<br /><br />在这项工作中，我们使用完全相对论多配置Dirac-Hartree-Fock和相对论构型相互作用方法对N ii的最低102个态的能级、电偶极辐射跃迁参数和寿命进行了精确计算。这些数据对于模拟天体谱线非常有用，例如用于确定早期B型恒星中的氮丰度，以及用于研究H ii区和行星状星云的成分和等离子体性质。我们计算得到的跃迁参数与现有的实验和理论数据进行了比较。我们还通过对巴布什金和库仑规范的跃迁速率之间的差异进行统计分析，并考虑了抵消因子，来评估计算的准确性。因此，我们估计在这项工作中计算的1656个跃迁中有201个的准确度高于3%，属于A类准确度。 <div>
Nitrogen lines are widely observed in astrophysical spectra and provide important diagnostics for plasma properties. In this work, we present extended calculations for accurate energy levels, electric dipole radiative transition parameters, and lifetimes for the lowest 102 states of the 2s22p2, 2s2p3, 2s2p23s, 2s22p{n1l, n2d, 4f}(n1 = 3–5, l = s, p, n2 = 3, 4), and 2p4 configurations of N ii within the framework of the fully relativistic multiconfiguration Dirac–Hartree–Fock and relativistic configuration interaction methods. These data are useful for modeling astrophysical spectra, for example, for nitrogen abundance determinations in early B-type stars, and for studying the compositions and plasma properties of H ii regions and planetary nebulae. Our computed transition parameters are compared with available experimental and theoretical data. The accuracy of the calculations is also assessed via a statistical analysis of the differences between the transition rates in the Babushkin and Coulomb gauges and by consideration of cancellation factors. In this way, 201 of the 1656 transitions computed in this work are estimated to be from accurate to better than 3%, corresponding to an accuracy class of A.

The hydrogen recombination lines H30α, H40α, H42α, H50β, and H57γ and the underlying bremsstrahlung continuum emission were detected with ALMA in the bipolar nebula Mz3. The source was not spatially resolved, but the velocity profile of the H30α line shows clear indication of maser amplification, confirming previous reports of laser amplification in the far-infrared H recombination lines observed with Herschel Space Observatory. Comparison between the flux densities of the H50β, H40α, and H42α lines show overcooling, or darkness amplification by stimulated absorption (dasar effect) at the LSR velocity of about −25 km s−1, which constrains the density of the absorbing region to about 103 cm−3. The H30α line, on the other hand, presents maser lines at LSR velocities of −69 and −98 km s−1, which indicates ionized gas with densities close to 107 cm−3. Although the source of emission was not resolved, it was possible to find the central position of the images for each velocity interval, which resulted in a well defined position–velocity distribution.

<div> 关键词: 中间质量黑洞、NGC 1399、球状星团、射电探测、质量估计
总结: 
这项研究调查了NGC 1399球状星团中质量在102M⊙至105M⊙范围内的中间质量黑洞（IMBHs）的可检测性。研究使用了理论的邦迪吸积模型和黑洞吸积的经验基本平面（FP）来估计IMBH的质量，发现IMBH在射电频率300.00 MHz下是可探测的。通过对77个球状星团候选对象进行3小时观测，利用方阵平方公里阵列（Square Kilometre Array），成功识别出了表明IMBH吸积的射电探测基准。研究发现，NGC 1399中的球状星团内的IMBH是可检测到的，并且邦迪吸积模型提供IMBH质量估计为2.93 × 103.0±0.39M⊙至7.43 × 104.0±0.39M⊙，而经验FP关系则指出IMBH质量估计为3.41 × 105.0±0.96M⊙。这些发现强调了球状星团中IMBH的存在和可检测性，为IMBH作为超大质量黑洞的先导体的角色以及黑洞在天体物理环境中形成和演化的认识提供了新的见解。 <br /><br /> <div>
This study investigates the detectability of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) within the mass range 102M⊙ ≤ MBH ≤ 105M⊙ in the globular star clusters of NGC 1399 at a frequency of 300.00 MHz. Employing the theoretical Bondi accretion model and the empirical fundamental plane (FP) of black hole accretion, we estimate IMBH masses based on bolometric luminosity and X-ray/radio luminosities, respectively. By simulating a 3 hr observation of 77 globular cluster (GC) candidates using the Square Kilometre Array, we identify radio detection benchmarks indicative of accretion onto IMBHs. Our results show that IMBHs inside the globular star clusters located in NGC 1399 are indeed detectable, with the Bondi accretion model providing IMBH mass estimates ranging from 2.93 × 103.0±0.39M⊙ to 7.43 × 104.0±0.39M⊙ and the empirical FP relation suggesting IMBH mass estimation with 3.41 × 105.0±0.96M⊙. These findings highlight the presence and detectability of IMBHs in GCs, offering insights into their role as precursors to supermassive black holes and enriching our understanding of black hole formation and evolution in astrophysical environments.

<title>Anisotropic Heating and Cooling within Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejection Sheath Plasma</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study presents the first comprehensive investigation of the relationship between heating and cooling, temperature anisotropy, turbulence level, and collisional age within interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) sheaths, which are highly compressed, heated, and turbulent. Using Wind spacecraft data, we analyze 333 ICME sheaths observed at 1 au from 1995 to 2015. The proton temperature within the ICME sheaths has a log-normal probability distribution. Irrespective of instability growth rates, plasma unstable to proton-cyclotron (PC) and firehose instabilities appear to be statistically hotter, at least by a factor of 5 to 10, compared to stable plasma. We also observe relatively enhanced magnetic fluctuations and low collisional age, especially in regimes unstable to PC and firehose instabilities at low proton betas βp ≤ 2. In the case of high beta βp ≥ 2, we observe high magnetic fluctuations close to the instabilities and less collisional age to the plasma unstable to firehose instability rather than near the mirror mode and PC threshold. Our findings suggest that heating processes dominate over cooling processes in producing proton temperature anisotropy in the ICME sheath region. Moreover, collisional age and magnetic fluctuations are critical in maintaining anisotropic and isotropic conditions.

A small fraction of fast radio bursts (FRBs) have been observed with multiple bursts, whereas most Galactic sources emitting radio pulses are known to repeat. Here we present the results of follow-up observations of two FRBs and four rotating radio transients (RRATs). Among these, only one RRAT has been observed with repeating pulses, with an estimated period of around 1.297047 s. For comparison, we reanalysed the Parkes archival follow-up observations in CSIRO’s data archive for all apparently one-off sources discovered by the Parkes telescopes, including 13 RRATs and 29 FRBs. In total, 3 RRATs are suggested to be repeaters, but no repeating signals were detected from the other sources. Reporting details of the nondetection observations for the apparently one-off sources would help investigate their origins, and catastrophic scenarios are worth proposing for both extragalactic and Galactic sources.

<div> 黑洞，相对论，磁化等离子体，吸积速率，光度曲线
总结：<br /><br />该研究使用相对论计算模拟了两个质量相等、不自旋的黑洞从20M初始距离几乎合并。研究结果表明，黑洞的吸积速率先下降，然后趋于稳定，在快速螺旋中仅下降了大约3倍。估计的全波光度曲线遵循相同的特征，这表明一些螺旋合并的超大质量双黑洞在预期的周围盘脱耦后可能具有显着的亮度。小盘是非标准的，雷诺应力主导，而不是麦克斯韦应力，并且在两种状态之间振荡。在循环的某个部分，“晃动”流会在小盘之间传输质量，以最大小盘全波光度的速率携带动能。我们还发现，周期性吸积驱动时间变化的小盘倾斜。这些复杂的动态都导致了螺旋合并超大质量双黑洞光度曲线的独特周期性行为。黑洞的极轴磁通大致上保持在ϕ∼2-3的无量纲水平上，但在合并前突然增加一倍；对于有显著自旋的黑洞来说，这样的磁通预测了由二元动力学驱动的具有变化性的强喷流，这是另一个潜在独特的电磁特征。这项模拟是第一个使用多块基础设施PatchworkMHD的，降低了计算成本，约为传统单网格方法的3％。 <div>
While supermassive binary black holes (SMBBHs) inspiral toward merger they may also accrete matter from a surrounding disk. To study the dynamics of this system requires simultaneously describing the evolving spacetime and the magnetized plasma. We present the first relativistic calculation simulating two equal-mass, nonspinning black holes as they inspiral from a 20 M (G = c = 1) initial separation almost to merger. Our results imply important observational consequences: for instance, the accretion rate onto the black holes first decreases and then plateaus, dropping by only a factor of ∼3 despite the rapid inspiral. An estimated bolometric light curve follows the same profile, suggesting some merging SMBBHs may be significantly luminous past the predicted circumbinary disk decoupling. The minidisks are nonstandard: Reynolds, not Maxwell, stresses dominate, and they oscillate between two states. In one part of the cycle, “sloshing” streams transfer mass between minidisks, carrying kinetic energy at a rate sometimes as high as the peak minidisk bolometric luminosity. We also discover that episodic accretion drives time-varying minidisk tilts. These complex dynamics all contribute to unique cyclical behavior in the light curves of late-time inspiraling SMBBHs. The poloidal magnetic flux on the black holes is roughly constant at a dimensionless level ϕ ∼ 2–3, but doubles just before merger; for significant black hole spin, this flux predicts powerful jets with variability driven by binary dynamics, another potentially unique electromagnetic signature. This simulation is the first to employ our multipatch infrastructure PatchworkMHD, decreasing the computational expense to ∼3% of conventional single-grid methods’ cost.

总结:<br /><br />王等人的最新研究调查了大于10MeV的太阳质子事件，通过STEREO-A、STEREO-B和SOHO航天器进行观测。研究识别了每次事件中与源区最佳磁场连接的航天器，并通过拟合分析了航天器观测到的高能质子强度。拟合过程产生了两个参数b和c，用于每次事件的四个能量通道。统计分析揭示了b和c之间的幂律相关性。研究中还对在星际空间中的粒子扩散系数进行了深入探讨，模拟表明径向平均自由程与径向距离呈幂律关系。因此，观测表明了径向平均自由程随着径向距离呈幂律变化。这个模型在未来的研究中有望用于确定高能质子的平均自由程。 <div>
A recent study by Wang et al. investigated gradual solar proton events with energies >10 MeV, as observed by STEREO-A, STEREO-B, and the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory spacecraft. For each event, the spacecraft with the best magnetic connection to the source region among the three spacecraft was identified, and energetic proton intensities observed by the spacecraft were analyzed through fitting. The fitting process produced two parameters, b and c, for four energy channels (13–16 MeV, 20–25 MeV, 32–40 MeV, and 40–64 MeV) in each event. Parameters b and c govern the rise and decay of particle intensities, respectively. Statistical analysis revealed a power-law correlation between b and c, expressed as c ∼ b−γ. In this study, in order to explain the relation between the two parameters, we investigate the model of particle diffusion coefficients in the interplanetary space. In our simulations, the radial mean free path is modeled as a power function of radial distance, successfully reproducing the b–c relation. Consequently, the observations demonstrate that the radial mean free path varies with radial distance in a power law. In future research, the model of diffusion coefficients holds promise in determining the mean free path of energetic protons.

总结:<br />
本研究使用多时段最大似然估计（MLE）方法分析了附近超新星遗迹（SNR）的十年变化。通过整合运动特征和点扩散函数效应到MLE框架中，提高了捕捉SNR动态的准确性。利用卡西奥佩拉A作为代表性示例，使用Chandra X射线天文台在2000年、2009年和2019年获取的数据。该方法定性和定量地证明了对所有区域的冲击波和微弱特征等各种运动提供了准确估计。为了研究不对称结构，MLE方法扩展到结合多个计算域，并使用k-means算法对运动属性进行分类。这种方法允许将不同的物理状态映射到图像上，并通过与James Webb太空望远镜的红外观测进行比较，推测出一个分类的组分与星周物质相互作用。因此，这项技术将有助于量化SNR的动态并发现它们独特的演变。 <div>
Decadal changes in a nearby supernova remnant (SNR) were analyzed using a multiepoch maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) approach. To achieve greater accuracy in capturing the dynamics of SNRs, kinematic features and point-spread function effects were integrated into the MLE framework. Using Cassiopeia A as a representative example, data obtained by the Chandra X-ray Observatory in 2000, 2009, and 2019 were utilized. The proposed multiepoch MLE was qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrated to provide accurate estimates of various motions, including shock waves and faint features, across all regions. To investigate asymmetric structures, such as singular components that deviate from the direction of expansion, the MLE method was extended to combine multiple computational domains and classify kinematic properties using the k-means algorithm. This approach allowed for the mapping of different physical states onto the image, and one classified component was suggested to interact with circumstellar material by comparison with infrared observations from the James Webb Space Telescope. Thus, this technique will help quantify the dynamics of SNRs and discover their unique evolution.

We present the third catalog release of the wide-area (31.3 deg2) Stripe 82 X-ray survey. This catalog combines previously published X-ray source properties with multiwavelength counterparts and photometric redshifts, presents 343 new spectroscopic redshifts, and provides black hole masses for 1297 Type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGN). With spectroscopic redshifts for 3457 out of 6181 Stripe 82X sources, the survey has a spectroscopic completeness of 56%. This completeness rises to 90% when considering the contiguous portions of the Stripe 82X survey with homogeneous X-ray coverage at an optical magnitude limit of r < 22. Within that portion of the survey, 23% of AGN can be considered obscured by being either a Type 2 AGN, reddened (R − K > 4, Vega), or X-ray obscured with a column density of NH > 1022 cm−2. Unlike other surveys, there is only an 18% overlap between Type 2 and X-ray obscured AGN. We calculated black hole masses for Type 1 AGN that have Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectra using virial mass estimators calibrated on the Hβ, Mg ii, Hα, and C iv emission lines. We find wide scatter in these black hole mass estimates, indicating that statistical analyses should use black hole masses calculated from the same formula to minimize bias. We find that the AGN with the highest X-ray luminosities are accreting at the highest Eddington ratios, consistent with the picture that most black hole mass accretion happens in the phase when the AGN is luminous (L2−10keV > 1045 erg s−1).

<title>Upper Limit of Sound Speed in Nuclear Matter: A Harmonious Interplay of Transport Calculation and Perturbative Quantum Chromodynamic Constraint</title>

<div> 关键词: 声速上限, 核物质, 方程状态, 中子星, 松弛时间<br />
总结: 
声速上限是核物质的平方声速的最大值，本研究通过多信使观测和非参数方法重构的方程状态证实了这一上限。观测数据表明，声速上限与中子星质心附近物质的性质一致，这与pQCD驱动的因果约束相符。另外，结果显示声速上限与核物质密度之间存在明显相关性，而当密度达到临界值时，这种相关性被违反。最新的联合约束结果显示中子星的半径和质量的范围。这些研究结果通过两个独立约束的一致性，进一步证实了它们的有效性。 <br /><br /> <div>
Very recently, it has been shown that there is an upper bound on the squared sound speed of nuclear matter from the transport, which reads . In this work, we demonstrate that this upper bound is corroborated by the reconstructed equation of state (EOS; modeled with a nonparametric method) for ultradense matter. The reconstruction integrates multimessenger observation for neutron stars, in particular, the latest radius measurements for PSR J0437–4715 ( km), PSR J0030+0451 ( km, in the ST+PDT model), and PSR J0740+6620 ( km) by NICER have been adopted. The result shows in all cases, the upper limit for EOS will naturally yield the properties of matter near the center of the massive neutron star consistent with the causality-driven constraint from pQCD, where, in practice, the density in implementing the pQCD likelihood (nL) is applied at (where is the nuclear saturation density). We also note that there is a strong correlation for the maximum cs2 with nL, and is somehow violated when nL = nc,TOV. The result indicates that a higher nL, even considering the uncertainties from statistics, is more natural. Moreover, the remarkable agreement between the outcomes derived from these two distinct and independent constraints (i.e., the transport calculation and pQCD boundary) lends strong support to their validity. In addition, the latest joint constraint for R1.4, R2.0, R1.4 − R2.0, and MTOV are km, km, km, and (at 90% credible level), respectively.

<div> 关键词: 星体形成率，NGC 1068，分子气体盘，H ii 区域，数值模拟

总结: 
本研究针对近邻塞费尔特星系NGC 1068，利用新的高灵敏度Atacama大型毫米/亚毫米阵列100 GHz连续数据，结合哈勃空间望远镜Paα线数据，提出了NGC 1068分子气体盘的星体形成率（SFR）校准。校准过程中考虑了尘埃消光、H ii 区域的电子温度、AGN污染和扩散电离气体（DIG）的空间变化。经过修正后，NGC 1068盘的总SFR估计为3.2 ± 0.5 M⊙ yr−1。研究还发现南部条状结束和共转半径周围存在高SFR，与先前的SFR测量结果相一致。此外，研究指出基于8μm尘埃发射的总SFR与实际SFR存在差异，这是由于不同追踪器追踪到不同阶段演化的年轻恒星和各自的时间尺度。这项研究提供了一个案例，来解决传统SFR测量中的各种不确定性及其可能导致重大SFR误差的潜在问题。 <div>
The star formation rate (SFR) is a fundamental parameter for describing galaxies and inferring their evolutionary course. H ii regions yield the best measure of instantaneous SFR in galaxies, although the derived SFR can have large uncertainties depending on tracers and assumptions. We present an SFR calibration for the entire molecular gas disk of the nearby Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068, based on our new high-sensitivity Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array 100 GHz continuum data at 55 pc (= 0.″8) resolution in combination with the Hubble Space Telescope Paα line data. In this calibration, we account for the spatial variations of dust extinction, electron temperature of H ii regions, AGN contamination, and diffuse ionized gas (DIG) based on publicly available multiwavelength data. Especially, given the extended nature and the possible nonnegligible contribution to the total SFR, a careful consideration of DIG is essential. With a cross-calibration between two corrected ionized gas tracers (free–free continuum and Paα), the total SFR of the NGC 1068 disk is estimated to be 3.2 ± 0.5 M⊙ yr−1, one-third of the SFR without accounting for DIG (9.1 ± 1.4 M⊙ yr−1). We confirmed a high SFR around the southern bar end and the corotation radius, which is consistent with the previous SFR measurements. In addition, our total SFR exceeds the total SFR based on 8 μm dust emission by a factor of 1.5. We attribute this discrepancy to the differences in the young stars at different stages of evolution traced by each tracer and their respective timescales. This study provides an example to address the various uncertainties in conventional SFR measurements and their potential to lead to significant SFR miscalculations.

<div> TDEs, radio follow-up, ASKAP, late-time emission, optical discovery
Summary:
Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are increasingly being detected at radio wavelengths, challenging existing models for radio emission. A study using data from the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) detected late-time emission in five TDEs, including the independent discovery of radio emission from TDE AT 2019ahk. The study finds that at least a portion of optically discovered TDEs has detectable radio emission, and projects that the ongoing ASKAP Variable and Slow Transients survey can detect approximately 20 TDEs in its operational span. This suggests that late-time radio activity is common to a broad class of TDEs. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
Late-time (∼a year) radio follow-up of optically discovered tidal disruption events (TDEs) is increasingly resulting in detections at radio wavelengths, and there is growing evidence for this late-time radio activity to be common to the broad class of subrelativistic TDEs. Detailed studies of some of these TDEs at radio wavelengths are also challenging the existing models for radio emission. Using all-sky multiepoch data from the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), taken as a part of the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS), we searched for radio counterparts to a sample of optically discovered TDEs. We detected late-time emission at RACS frequencies (742–1032 MHz) in five TDEs, reporting the independent discovery of radio emission from TDE AT 2019ahk and extending the time baseline out to almost 3000 days for some events. Overall, we find that at least of the population of optically discovered TDEs has detectable radio emission in the RACS survey, while also noting that the true fraction can be higher given the limited cadence (two epochs separated by ∼3 yr) of the survey. Finally, we project that the ongoing higher-cadence (∼2 months) ASKAP Variable and Slow Transients survey can detect ∼20 TDEs in its operational span (4 yr), given the current rate from optical surveys.

总结:
星际物质的形成是一个高度动态的过程，连接了从星系尺度的千秒巨泡到百帕尔赛克尺度的巨型分子云和星团的丝状层次结构，并受到超新星的反馈影响。通过多尺度的MHD模拟，可以追踪从星系尺度到亚秒尺度的结构形成过程。模拟表明，气体的吸积与压缩最终驱动了丝状结构形成巨型分子云和星团。在安静的区域，星系剪切可以产生扁平的旋转盘状结构内的丝状巨型分子云。模拟结果还展示了与这些盘状结构形成相关的螺旋磁场的形成。 <br /><br /> <div>
There is now abundant observational evidence that star formation is a highly dynamical process that connects filament hierarchies and supernova feedback from galaxy-scale kiloparsec filaments and superbubbles to giant molecular clouds (GMCs) on 100 pc scales and star clusters (1 pc). Here we present galactic multiscale MHD simulations that track the formation of structure from galactic down to subparsec scales in a magnetized, Milky Way–like galaxy undergoing supernova-driven feedback processes. We do this by adopting a novel zoom-in technique that follows the evolution of typical 3 kpc subregions without cutting out the surrounding galactic environment, allowing us to reach 0.28 pc resolution in the individual zoom-in regions. We find a wide range of morphologies and hierarchical structures, including superbubbles, turbulence, and kiloparsec atomic gas filaments hosting multiple GMC condensations that are often associated with superbubble compression, down to smaller-scale filamentary GMCs and star cluster regions within them. Gas accretion and compression ultimately drive filaments over a critical, scale-dependent line mass leading to gravitational instabilities that produce GMCs and clusters. In quieter regions, galactic shear can produce filamentary GMCs within flattened, rotating disklike structures on 100 pc scales. Strikingly, our simulations demonstrate the formation of helical magnetic fields associated with the formation of these disklike structures.

<div> 关键词: Filaments, Clumps, High-mass star formation, G35 molecular complex, SCUBA-2 850 μm continuum data

总结: 
这项研究利用James Clerk Maxwell Telescope SCUBA-2 850 μm连续波数据对G35分子复合体中的细丝和宿主团进行了系统研究。研究发现复合体内有五个云，其中包含91条细丝，其中一些形成了10个枢纽-细丝系统，每个系统至少有三条枢纽组成的细丝。此外，研究编制了一个包含350个密集团的目录，其中183个与细丝相关。   进一步调查了细丝和团的物理特性，如质量、密度和大小，以及它们与恒星形成的关系。研究发现，细丝的全局质量-长度趋势与湍流起源一致，而HFSs中线质量高（ml > 230 M⊙ pc−1）的枢纽组成细丝偏离了这一关系，可能是由于大质量恒星形成的反馈作用。同时发现，在细丝和HFSs的枢纽中，最大质量和最密集的团（R > 0.2 pc，M > 35 M⊙，Σ > 0.05 g cm−2）出现频率更高，突出了HFSs对于高质量恒星形成的优先地点。研究还发现，在云的不同进化环境中团的质量表面密度变化不大，这可能反映了质量吸积和恒星反馈之间的平衡。 <div>
Filaments are believed to play a key role in high-mass star formation. We present a systematic study of the filaments and their hosting clumps in the G35 molecular complex using James Clerk Maxwell Telescope SCUBA-2 850 μm continuum data. We identified five clouds in the complex and 91 filaments within them, some of which form 10 hub–filament systems (HFSs), each with at least three hub-composing filaments. We also compiled a catalog of 350 dense clumps, 183 of which are associated with the filaments. We investigated the physical properties of the filaments and clumps, such as mass, density, and size, and their relation to star formation. We find that the global mass–length trend of the filaments is consistent with a turbulent origin, while the hub-composing filaments of high line masses (ml > 230 M⊙ pc−1) in HFSs deviate from this relation, possibly due to feedback from massive star formation. We also find that the most massive and densest clumps (R > 0.2 pc, M > 35 M⊙, Σ > 0.05 g cm−2) are located in the filaments and in the hubs of HFSs, with the latter bearing a higher probability of the occurrence of high-mass star-forming signatures, highlighting the preferential sites of HFSs for high-mass star formation. We do not find significant variation in the clump mass surface density across different evolutionary environments of the clouds, which may reflect the balance between mass accretion and stellar feedback.

<div> sBDEs, H i gas, properties, star-forming, metallicity

这项研究分析了一个稀有群体，即具有显著H i气体的强凸显型早型星系（sBDEs）的特性，使用了FAST全天H i巡天（FASHI）和阿雷西博遗产快速ALFA（ALFALFA）巡天的数据库。通过从斯隆数字化天空巡天中选择sBDEs，并与FASHI-ALFALFA组合的H i样本进行交叉匹配，得到了104个H i丰富的sBDEs。这些sBDEs倾向于具有极高的H i储库，这在以前的研究中很少见，比如ATLAS3D。选择的sBDEs中总共70%被分类为平静的星系，尽管它们具有大量的H i储库。我们从四个主要方面研究了这些sBDEs的特性：恒星群，气相金属丰度，堆积的H i光谱和环境。绝大多数H i丰富的sBDEs似乎显示出较低的气相金属丰度，并且位于明显较低密度的环境中，这表明它们的H i气体具有外部起源。我们发现，有星形成的sBDEs表现出统计上更高的星形成效率，稍微较老的恒星群，相比于正常的有星形成的星系，这表明在数十亿年的时间尺度上有最近的星形成。与对照有星形成的星系相比，它们也显示出更窄和更集中的H i轮廓，这可能解释了它们更高的星形成效率。

<br /><br />总结:
1. sBDEs具有极高的H i储库
2. 70%的sBDEs被分类为平静的星系
3. H i丰富的sBDEs表现出较低的气相金属丰度
4. 大多数的H i丰富的sBDEs位于较低密度的环境中

We analyze the properties of a rare population, the strongly bulge-dominated early-type galaxies (sBDEs) with significant H i gas, using the databases from the FAST All Sky H i survey (FASHI) and the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA (ALFALFA) survey. We select the sBDEs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and crossmatch with the FASHI-ALFALFA combined H i sample, resulting in 104 H i-rich sBDEs. These sBDEs tend to have extremely high H i reservoirs, which is rare in previous studies such as ATLAS3D. A total of 70% of the selected sBDEs are classified as quiescent galaxies, even though they have a large H i reservoir. We study the properties of these sBDEs from four main aspects: stellar population, gas-phase metallicity, stacked H i spectra, and environment. The majority of H i-rich sBDEs appear to show lower gas-phase metallicity and are located in significantly lower-density environments, suggesting an external origin for their H i gas. We find that star-forming sBDEs exhibit statistically higher star formation efficiency and slightly older stellar populations compared to normal star-forming galaxies, suggesting a recent star formation on the Gyr timescale. They also show narrower and more concentrated H i profiles compared to control star-forming galaxies, which may explain their higher star formation efficiency.

The gradient technique is a promising tool with theoretical foundations based on the fundamental properties of MHD turbulence and turbulent reconnection. Its various incarnations use spectroscopic, synchrotron, and intensity data to trace the magnetic field and measure the media magnetization in terms of Alfvén Mach number. We provide an analytical theory of gradient measurements and quantify the effects of averaging gradients along the line of sight and over the plane of the sky. We derive analytical expressions that relate the properties of gradient distribution with the Alfvén Mach number MA. We show that these measurements can be combined with measures of sonic Mach number or line broadening to obtain the magnetic field strength. The corresponding technique has advantages to the Davis–Chandrasekhar–Fermi way of obtaining the magnetic field strength.

总结:<br />
文章介绍了Perseus Cluster中冷前沿的形成模拟研究。研究发现，低质量的亚团不能产生能够传播到如此大半径的冷前沿，而小的冲击参数会引起太多湍流，导致冷前沿在到达较大距离前被破坏。只有进行一次核心通过的亚团能产生一个稳定的冷前沿，并在后来的时间里扩展到较大半径，但是在核区域没有在后来的时间形成其他前沿。研究发现，质量比为R∼1:5且初始冲击参数为θ∼20°–25°的亚团产生了大的冷前沿，并在后来的时间在核心区域产生了第二组冷前沿。这些模拟表明，“古老”的冷前沿的年龄约为6–8.5亿年。对于观测结果提供了最接近匹配的模拟来说，亚团已经完全并入主团。 <div>
The intracluster medium of the Perseus Cluster exhibits spiral-shaped X-ray surface brightness discontinuities known as “cold fronts,” which simulations indicate are caused by the sloshing motion of the gas after the passage of a subcluster. Recent observations of Perseus have shown that these fronts extend to large radii. In this work, we present simulations of the formation of sloshing cold fronts in Perseus using the AREPO magnetohydrodynamics code, to produce a plausible scenario for the formation of the large front at a radius of 700 kpc. Our simulations explore a range of subcluster masses and impact parameters. We find that low-mass subclusters cannot generate a cold front that can propagate to such a large radius, and that small impact parameters create too much turbulence, which leads to the disruption of the cold front before it reaches such a large distance. Subclusters that make only one core passage produce a stable initial front that expands to large radii, but without a second core passage of the subcluster, other fronts are not created at a later time in the core region. We find a small range of simulations with subclusters with mass ratios of R ∼ 1:5 and an initial impact parameter of θ ∼ 20°–25° that not only produce the large cold front but a second set in the core region at later times. These simulations indicate that the “ancient” cold front is ∼6–8.5 Gyr old. For the simulations providing the closest match with observations, the subcluster has completely merged into the main cluster.

The origin of fast flux variability in blazars is a long-standing problem, with many theoretical models proposed to explain it. In this study, we focus on BL Lacertae to model its spectral energy distribution (SED) and broadband light curves using a diffusive shock acceleration process involving multiple mildly relativistic shocks, coupled with a time-dependent radiation transfer code. BL Lacertae was the target of a comprehensive multiwavelength monitoring campaign in early 2021 July. We present a detailed investigation of the source’s broadband spectral and light-curve features using simultaneous observations at optical–UV frequencies with the Swift Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope, in X-rays with the Swift X-Ray Telescope and AstroSat-SXT/LAXPC, and in gamma rays with Fermi-LAT, covering the period from 2021 July to August (MJD 59400–59450). A fractional variability analysis shows that the source is most variable in gamma rays, followed by X-rays, UV, and optical. This allowed us to determine the fastest variability time in gamma rays to be on the order of a few hours. The AstroSat-SXT and LAXPC light curves indicate X-ray variability on the order of a few kiloseconds. Modeling simultaneously the SEDs of low- and high-flux states of the source and the multiband light curves provided insights into the particle acceleration mechanisms at play. This is the first instance of a physical model that accurately captures the multiband temporal variability of BL Lacertae, including the hour-scale fluctuations observed during the flare.

总结:
本文对六个高质量恒星形成区使用了Taeduk射电天文台14米望远镜观测的CN (N = 1–0)数据和来自Herschel存档的尘埃连续数据，以测试CN线和尘埃连续辐射是否可以追踪相似的区域，并因此可用于推断三维磁场强度。通过比较所有目标的CN和H2柱密度，发现CN线发射倾向于强烈的连续区域。在所有目标中，峰值CN柱密度的位置与峰值H2柱密度的位置特别良好地相关，至少在一个或两个天文望远镜波束尺度内的H2柱密度为8.0×1022cm−2以上，这意味着CN线和尘埃连续辐射区域很可能在空间上重合。这使我们能够通过对其BLOS和BPOS进行矢量求和，可靠地测量出五个目标的三维磁场强度，有助于确定目标的磁致密性为超临界或跨临界。<br /><br /> <div>
Measuring the strength of a three-dimensional (3D) magnetic field vector is challenging as it is not easy to recognize whether its line-of-sight (LOS) and plane-of-sky (POS) components are obtained from the same region. CN (N = 1–0) emission has been used to get the LOS component of a magnetic field (BLOS) from its Zeeman splitting lines, while dust continuum emission has been used to get the POS component of a magnetic field (BPOS). We use the CN (N = 1–0) data observed with the Taeduk Radio Astronomy Observatory 14 m telescope and the dust continuum data from the Herschel archive toward six high-mass star-forming regions in order to test whether CN line and dust continuum emission can trace a similar region and thus can be used for inferring 3D magnetic field strength. Our comparison between CN and H2 column densities for all targets indicates that CN line emission tends to be strong toward bright continuum regions. The positions of peak CN column densities are particularly well correlated with those of peak H2 column densities, at least over the H2 column density of 8.0 × 1022 cm−2 within one or two telescope beam sizes in all targets, implying that CN-line- and dust-continuum-emitting regions are likely spatially coincident. This enabled us to make the reliable measurement of the 3D magnetic field strengths of five targets by taking a vector sum of their BLOS and BPOS, helping to decide the magnetical criticality of the targets as supercritical or transcritical.

After the final stage of the merger of two black holes (BHs), the ringdown signal takes an important role in providing information about the gravitational dynamics in strong field. We introduce a novel time-domain (TD) approach, predicated on the -statistic, for ringdown analysis. This method diverges from traditional TD techniques in that its parameter space remains constant irrespective of the number of modes incorporated. This feature is achieved by reconfiguring the likelihood and analytically maximizing over the extrinsic parameters that encompass the amplitudes and reference phases of all modes. Consequently, when performing the ringdown analysis under the assumption that the ringdown signal is detected by the Einstein Telescope, the parameter estimation computation time is shortened by at most 5 orders of magnitude compared to the traditional TD method. We further establish that traditional TD methods become difficult when including multiple overtone modes due to close oscillation frequencies and damping times across different overtone modes. Encouragingly, this issue is effectively addressed by our new TD technique. The accessibility of this new TD method extends to a broad spectrum of research and offers flexibility for various topics within BH spectroscopy applicable to both current and future gravitational wave detectors.

<div> 关键词: Massive star-forming regions, hub-filament systems, cloud–cloud collision, magnetohydrodynamic simulation, turbulence

总结: 
近期观测研究表明，云团之间的碰撞可能与枢纽-丝状系统的形成有关。研究人员分析了云团碰撞的磁流体力学模拟数据，发现碰撞会在压缩层内形成丝状结构并驱动内部气流。这些气流在锥体的顶点汇聚，迅速聚集高密度气体，最终可能形成大质量恒星。PV图表明了气流朝着锥体顶点的流动，而磁场形态则朝着碰撞的方向弯曲。要注意的是，如果碰撞的云团大小差异较大，则在位置-速度和位置-位置空间中检测两个云团并确认它们的互补分布可能存在挑战。 <div>
Massive star-forming regions (MSFRs) are commonly associated with hub-filament systems (HFSs) and sites of cloud–cloud collision (CCC). Recent observational studies of some MSFRs suggest a possible connection between CCC and the formation of HFSs. To understand this connection, we analyzed the magnetohydrodynamic simulation data from Inoue et al. This simulation involves the collision of a spherical turbulent molecular cloud with a plane-parallel sea of dense molecular gas at a relative velocity of about 10 km s−1. Following the collision, the turbulent and nonuniform cloud undergoes shock compression, rapidly developing filamentary structures within the compressed layer. We found that CCC can lead to the formation of HFSs, which is the combined effect of turbulence, shock compression, magnetic field, and gravity. The collision between the cloud components shapes the filaments into a cone and drives inward flows among them. These inward flows merge at the vertex of the cone, rapidly accumulating high-density gas, which can lead to the formation of massive star(s). The cone acts as a mass-collecting machine, involving a nongravitational early process of filament formation, followed by gravitational gas attraction to finalize the HFS. The gas distribution in the position–velocity (PV) and position–position spaces highlights the challenges in detecting two cloud components and confirming their complementary distribution if the colliding clouds have a large size difference. However, such CCC events can be confirmed by the PV diagrams presenting gas flow toward the vertex of the cone, which hosts gravitationally collapsing high-density objects, and by the magnetic field morphology curved toward the direction of the collision.

<div> 巨型星系, 化学丰度数据, 银河系, 矮星系, 化学丰度模型

总结:<br /><br />这项研究使用了“两过程模型”来解释银河系和矮星系的恒星化学丰度数据，从而实现了对星系之间化学丰度历史差异的定量经验研究。研究发现，虽然矮星系的元素丰度模式存在着较大的变化，但是两过程框架能够准确地刻画它们之间许多元素的丰度模式，而这些多元素模式在矮星系卫星和银河系盘片之间存在着系统性差异。文章探讨了此差异的起源，强调了银河系盘片可能经历了大量原始气体的流入，稀释了形成星体的金属丰度，但没有改变元素丰度比。 <div>
The “two-process model” is a promising technique for interpreting stellar chemical abundance data from large-scale surveys (e.g., the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV/V and the Galactic Archeology with HERMES survey), enabling more quantitative empirical studies of differences in chemical enrichment history between galaxies without relying on detailed yield and evolution models. In this work, we fit two-process model parameters to (1) a luminous giant Milky Way (MW) sample and (2) stars comprising the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (Sgr). We then use these two sets of model parameters to predict the abundances of 14 elements of stars belonging to the MW and in five of its massive satellite galaxies, analyzing the residuals between the predicted and observed abundances. We find that the model fit to (1) results in large residuals (0.1–0.3 dex) for most metallicity-dependent elements in the metal-rich ([Mg/H] > −0.8) stars of the satellite galaxies. However, the model fit to (2) results in small or no residuals for all elements across all satellite galaxies. Therefore, despite the wide variation in [X/Mg]–[Mg/H] abundance patterns of the satellite galaxies, the two-process framework provides an accurate characterization of their abundance patterns across many elements, but these multielement patterns are systematically different between the dwarf galaxy satellites and the MW disks. We consider a variety of scenarios for the origin of this difference, highlighting the possibility that a large inflow of pristine gas to the MW disk diluted the metallicity of star-forming gas without changing abundance ratios.

The Press–Schechter (PS) and excursion set (ES) models of structure formation fail in reproducing the halo bias found in simulations, while the ES-peaks' formalism built in the peak model reproduces it only at high masses and does not address in a fully satisfactory manner peak nesting, and the mass and time of ellipsoidal collapse of triaxial peaks in the Gaussian-smoothed density field. Here, we apply the confluent system of peak trajectories formalism fixing all these issues from first principles and with no free parameters to infer the Lagrangian local peak bias parameters, which adopt very simple analytic expressions similar to those found in the PS and ES models. The predicted Eulerian linear halo bias recovers the results of simulations. More specifically, we show that the only small departure observed at intermediate and low masses can be due to the spurious halo splitting and grouping caused by the spherical overdensity halo-finding algorithm used in simulations.

<br /><br />总结: 这篇论文研究了极端红移夸脱星系的X射线特性，并发现它们通常被高速氧三离子发出的气流所伴随，可能代表了强烈的反馈作用。研究表明，这些ERQs被重度遮蔽，X射线辐射较弱，并且显示出更高速度的气体流动。这一发现可能表明X射线辐射较弱有助于产生更强劲的气体流动，从而影响星系的演化。另外，这些现象也可能与超艾登顿吸积有关。 <div>
Quasar feedback is a key ingredient in shaping galaxy evolution. A rare population of extremely red quasars (ERQs) at z = 2−3 are often associated with high-velocity [O iii]λ5008 outflows and may represent sites of strong feedback. In this paper, we present an X-ray study of 50 ERQs to investigate the link between the X-ray and outflow properties of these intriguing objects. Using hardness ratio analysis, we confirm that the ERQs are heavily obscured systems with gas column density reaching NH = 1023−24 cm−2. We identify 20 X-ray-nondetected ERQs at high mid-infrared (MIR) luminosities of νLν,6 μm ≳ 3 × 1046 erg s−1. By stacking the X-ray observations, we find that the nondetected ERQs are on average underluminous in X-rays by a factor of ∼10 for their MIR luminosities. We consider such X-ray weakness to be due to both heavy gas absorption and intrinsic factors. Moreover, we find that the X-ray-weak sources also display higher-velocity outflows. One option to explain this trend is that weaker X-rays facilitate more vigorous line-driven winds, which then accelerate the [O iii]-emitting gas to kiloparsec scales. Alternatively, super-Eddington accretion could also lead to intrinsic X-ray weakness and more powerful continuum-driven outflow.

How do galaxies of different luminosities contribute to the metal absorber populations of varying species and strength? We present our analysis of the predicted metal contributions from galaxies as observed in quasar absorption line spectra during the end of the epoch of reionization (10 ≥ z ≥ 5.5). This was done by implementing on-the-fly particle tracking into the latest Technicolor Dawn simulation and then linking C ii, C iv, Si ii, Si iv, O i, and Mg ii absorbers to host galaxies in postprocessing. We define the host galaxy luminosity distribution (HGLD) as the rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity distribution of galaxies contributing ions to an absorber, weighted by the fractional contribution, and compute its dependence on ion and absorber strength. The HGLD shape is predicted to be indistinguishable from the field luminosity function, indicating that there is no relationship between the absorber strength or ion and the luminosity of the dominant contributing galaxy. Switching from galaxy luminosity to stellar mass, the predicted host galaxy mass distributions (HGMDs) indicate that more-massive galaxies contribute a higher fraction of metal ions to absorbers of each species, with the HGMDs of stronger absorbers extending out to higher masses. We conclude that the fraction of absorbing metal ions contributed by galaxies increases weakly with stellar mass, but the scatter in luminosity at fixed stellar mass obscures this relationship. For the same reason, we predict that observational analyses of the absorber–galaxy relationship will uncover stronger trends with stellar mass than with luminosity.

本研究利用时间序列极限精度光谱观测、脉冲星定时和银河系太阳附近的脉冲星定时和星相交叉脉冲双星的加速度测量，来对银河系的质量分布进行研究。通过测量得到的加速度，可以确定总质量密度，并推断出暗物质的含量。研究使用了FIRE-2模拟对银河系质量的宇宙学模型进行了比较，并观察到了在CDM和SIDM中的垂直加速度剖面的显著不对称性。结果显示，SIDM的暗物质晕呈现出更扁平的形状，并且在太阳附近的区域中具有更高的局部恒星和暗物质密度，以及更陡的垂直加速度梯度。然而，相似的幅度变化也可能来自于在固定半径处的星系盘组分的方位变化和外部影响等因素，使得单个星系中的加速度测量很难区分CDM和SIDM。

Measurements of the accelerations of stars enabled by time-series extreme-precision spectroscopic observations, pulsar timing, and eclipsing binary stars in the solar neighborhood offer insights into the mass distribution of the Milky Way that do not rely on traditional equilibrium modeling. Given the measured accelerations, we can determine a total mass density and infer the amount of dark matter (DM) by accounting for the mass in stars, gas, and dust. Leveraging FIRE-2 simulations of Milky Way–mass galaxies we compare vertical acceleration profiles between cold DM (CDM) and self-interacting DM (SIDM) with a constant cross section of 1 cm2 g−1 across three halos with diverse assembly histories. Notably, significant asymmetries in vertical acceleration profiles near the midplane at fixed radii are observed in both CDM and SIDM, particularly in halos recently affected by mergers with satellites of Sagittarius/SMC-like masses or greater. These asymmetries offer a unique window into exploring the merger history of a galaxy. We show that SIDM halos manifest a more oblate shape and consistently exhibit higher local stellar and DM densities and steeper vertical acceleration gradients, up to 10%–30% steeper near the solar neighborhood. However, similar magnitude changes can arise from azimuthal variations in the baryonic components at a fixed radius and external influences like mergers, making it difficult to distinguish between CDM and SIDM using acceleration measurements in a single galaxy.

太阳活动是由太阳大气中积累的磁能释放所引起的。为了了解其物理机制，必须研究日冕磁场的动力学。然而，由于缺乏直接测量，主导机制仍不清楚。基于磁流体力学（MHD）的数值模拟可以复制太阳日冕磁场的动态演化，提供了一个探索耀斑起源的有用工具。基于观测数据的MHD模拟可以探索不同的机制。通过使用光球磁场的时间序列观测数据作为模拟边界条件，我们对NOAA活动区11283中的几次大型耀斑进行了模拟。我们使用了零beta MHD控制的数据驱动模型，重点关注M5.3耀斑（2011年9月6日01:59 UT）前的自由磁能积累。我们再现了与耀斑相关的喷发，随着扭曲磁场或磁通绳（MFR）的形成，并受其足点处的光球运动的影响。我们发现，喷发首先是由挽稳定性的增长触发的。喷发的MFR通过与喷发方向上的邻近磁场线的磁重联导致了喷发。利用模拟结果和以MFR为中心的轴向-径向衰减指数，我们找到了喷发倾斜的自然解释，并可能预测太阳喷发事件的方向的方法。

Solar energetic events are caused by the release of magnetic energy accumulated in the solar atmosphere. To understand their initiating physical mechanisms, the dynamics of the coronal magnetic fields must be studied. Unfortunately, the dominant mechanisms are still unclear due to a lack of direct measurements. Numerical simulations based on magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) can reproduce the dynamical evolution of solar coronal magnetic field, providing a useful tool to explore flare initiation. Data-driven MHD simulations, in which the time-series observational data of the photospheric magnetic field is used as the simulation boundary condition, can explore different mechanisms. To investigate the accumulation of free magnetic energy through a solar eruption, we simulated the first of several large flares in NOAA active region 11283. We used a data-driven model that was governed by zero-beta MHD, focusing on the free magnetic energy accumulation prior to the M5.3 flare (2011 September 6 at 01:59 UT). We reproduced the flare-associated eruption following the formation of twisted magnetic fields, or a magnetic flux rope (MFR), formed by photospheric motions at its footpoints. We found that the eruption was first triggered by the growth of the torus instability. The erupting MFR caused magnetic reconnections with neighboring magnetic field lines located along the direction of the eruption. Using the simulation results and an axial-radial decay index centered on the MFR, we find a natural explanation for the inclination of the eruption and a possible approach to predict the direction of solar eruptive events.

We compute the gaseous dynamical friction force experienced by massive perturbers on elliptical Keplerian orbits. Using linear perturbation theory, we investigate the density wake morphology, dynamical friction force, and secular orbital evolution for massive single perturbers as well as equal-mass binaries embedded in a homogeneous, static medium. In all cases, the rate of change in the semimajor axis is found to be negative (as expected), whereas the rate of change in eccentricity is negative for strictly subsonic trajectories and positive for strictly supersonic trajectories. Transonic orbits can experience both positive and negative torques during the course of an orbit, with some growing in eccentricity and others circularizing. We observe all initial orbits becoming highly supersonic and eccentric (over sufficiently long timescales) due to a relentless semimajor axis decay increasing the Mach number and subsequent eccentricity driving. We compare our findings to previous studies for rectilinear and circular motion while also making our data for the evolution of Keplerian orbits available.

We present a study of asteroseismically derived surface gravities, masses, and radii of a sample of red giant stars both with and without confirmed planetary companions using TESS photometric light curves. These red giants were drawn from radial velocity surveys, and their reported properties in the literature rely on more traditional methods using spectroscopy and isochrone fitting. Our asteroseismically derived surface gravities achieved a precision of ∼0.01 dex; however, they were on average ∼0.1 dex smaller than the literature. The systematic larger gravities of the literature could plausibly present as a systematic overestimation of stellar masses, which would in turn lead to overestimated planetary masses of the companions. We find that the fractional discrepancies between our asteroseismically determined parameters and those previously found are typically larger for stellar radii (∼10% discrepancy) than for stellar masses (<5% discrepancy). However, no evidence of a systematic difference between methods was found for either fundamental parameter. Two stars, HD 100065 and HD 18742, showed significant disagreement with the literature in both mass and radii. We explore the impacts of updated stellar properties on inferred planetary properties and caution that red giant radii may be more poorly constrained than uncertainties suggest.

中子星和小行星带之间的重复FRBs问题一直让人们费解。一种观点认为，重复的FRBs可能是由中子星与小行星带之间的相互作用产生的。本文中，我们研究了围绕大质量恒星存在小行星带的系统，并且中子星作为大质量恒星的伴星，通过引力相互作用与小行星带发生作用。我们假设了各种不同的轨道配置，并进行了直接N体模拟来研究小行星带的动力学演化。我们发现，中子星的轨道离心率越大，小行星带就会更快地被摧毁，大量小行星将被散射出系统。低倾角不仅抑制了碰撞，而且在早期阶段还抑制了小行星的抛射率。然而，高倾角系统可能会经历强烈的振荡，导致科萨伊-李多夫不稳定。在各种配置中，我们观察到了在轨道离心率为0.7且相互倾角为0°的情况下碰撞事件的明显周期性。我们发现，这种周期性至少可以在八个中子星轨道周期内持续存在，支持了这种机制是解释周期性重复FRB的可能性。我们的研究还表明，这种FRB源的活跃阶段应该是有限的，因为小行星带最终会被中子星摧毁。 <br /><br />总结: 本文研究了中子星和小行星带之间的相互作用，发现中子星的轨道参数对小行星带的演化有着重要的影响。我们观察到了在特定轨道配置下碰撞事件的周期性，这可能解释了重复FRB的现象。另外，我们也发现这种类型的FRB源的活跃期是有限的，因为小行星带最终会被摧毁。 <div>
Some fast radio bursts (FRBs) exhibit repetitive behaviors, and their origins remain enigmatic. It has been argued that repeating FRBs could be produced by the interaction between a neutron star and an asteroid belt. Here, we consider the systems in which an asteroid belt dwells around a massive star, while a neutron star, as a companion of the massive star, interacts with the belt through gravitational force. Various orbital configurations are assumed for the system. Direct N-body simulations are performed to investigate the dynamical evolution of the asteroids' belt. It is found that a larger orbital eccentricity of the neutron star will destroy the belt more quickly, with a large number of asteroids being scattered out of the system. A low inclination not only suppresses the collisions but also inhibits the ejection rate at early stages. However, highly inclined systems may undergo strong oscillations, resulting in the Kozai–Lidov instabilities. Among the various configurations, a clear periodicity is observed in the collision events for the case with an orbital eccentricity of 0.7 and mutual inclination of 0◦. It is found that such a periodicity can be sustained for at least eight neutron star orbital periods, supporting this mechanism as a possible explanation for periodically repeating FRBs. Our studies also suggest that the active stage of these kinds of FRB sources should be limited, since the asteroid belt would finally be destroyed by the neutron star after multiple passages.

We carry out idealized three-dimensional general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of prograde, weakly magnetized, and geometrically thick accretion flows where the gas distribution is misaligned from the black hole (BH) spin axis. We evolve the disk for three BH spins: a = 0.5, 0.75, and 0.9375, and we contrast them with a standard aligned disk simulation with a = 0.9375. The tilted disks achieve a warped and twisted steady-state structure, with the outer disk misaligning further away from the BH and surpassing the initial 24° misalignment. However, closer to the BH, there is evidence of partial alignment, as the inclination angle decreases with radius in this regime. Standing shocks also emerged in proximity to the BH, roughly at ∼6 gravitational radii. We show that these shocks act to partially align the inner disk with the BH spin. The rate of alignment increases with increasing BH spin magnitude, but in all cases is insufficient to fully align the gas before it accretes. Additionally, we present a toy model of orbit crowding that can predict the location of the shocks in moderate-to-fast rotating BHs, illustrating a potential physical origin for the behavior seen in simulations—with possible applications in determining the positions of shocks in real misaligned astrophysical systems.

这篇文章研究了嵌入在星盘中的两个轨道飞行器之间的排斥效应。研究使用了理论框架和二维流体力学模拟。模拟结果表明，排斥效应对质量更大的轨道飞行器来说更大，并且随着轨道间距和盘的粘性而减小。研究对排斥的理论标度关系做出了两种不同假设。第一种情景假设每个轨道飞行器吸收伴侣的尘域区域所沉积的角动量。而第二种情景则假设轨道飞行器的共转力由于伴侣改变了盘面密度的径向梯度而发生了改变。研究发现这两种情景的预测结果有显著差异。第一种情景不能复现排斥与盘粘度的标度关系，并且普遍高估了排斥的强度。然而，第二种情景得出的结果与模拟结果基本一致。 <br /><br />总结:该研究使用2D流体力学模拟研究了两个轨道飞行器之间的排斥效应，发现排斥效应对于质量更大的轨道飞行器更强，并且随着轨道间距和盘的粘性而减小。研究做出了两种情景的理论标度关系假设，发现第一种情景不能复现排斥与盘粘度的标度关系，但第二种情景的预测结果与模拟结果基本一致。 <div>
We develop a theoretical framework and use 2D hydrodynamical simulations to study the repulsive effect between two close orbiters embedded in an accretion disk. We consider orbiters on fixed Keplerian orbits with masses low enough to open shallow gaps. The simulations indicate that the repulsion is larger for more massive orbiters and decreases with the orbital separation and the disk’s viscosity. We use two different assumptions to derive theoretical scaling relations for the repulsion. A first scenario assumes that each orbiter absorbs the angular momentum deposited in its horseshoe region by the companion’s wake. A second scenario assumes that the corotation torques of the orbiters are modified because the companion changes the underlying radial gradient of the disk surface density. We find a substantial difference between the predictions of these two scenarios. The first one fails to reproduce the scaling of the repulsion with the disk viscosity and generally overestimates the strength of the repulsion. The second scenario, however, gives results that are broadly consistent with those obtained in the simulations.

<div> 3He, 4He, heavy ions, spectral properties, solar energetic particles <br />
在这项研究中，我们分析了自1997年至2024年间Advance Composition Explorer太空飞船观测到的80个3He丰富太阳高能粒子事件的光谱特性。我们将光谱分析分为两个标准：伴有快速和广泛日冕物质喷射的事件（称为“FW事件”）和伴有缓慢、狭窄或无日冕物质喷射的事件（称为“非FW事件”）。总的来说，我们发现伴有快速和广泛日冕物质喷射的事件在所有种类的粒子中表现出更均匀的光谱，并且它们的低能谱指数强烈相关，这表明日冕物质喷射提供了一种额外的3He丰富太阳高能粒子的再加速机制。此外，当比较没有与快速和广泛日冕物质喷射相关的事件中每种粒子的低能谱指数时，我们发现3He的谱硬度存在主要峰值，而Mg和Si存在次要峰值。最后，我们提出额外的再加速和/或传输机制可能在Fe和更重的离子的丰度增强中发挥作用，这也是需要进一步研究的问题。<br /><br />总结: 该研究总结了80个3He丰富太阳高能粒子事件的光谱特性分析，发现了日冕物质喷射对粒子再加速的影响，同时也观察到了3He、Mg和Si的谱硬度的不同峰值。此外，对Fe和更重离子的丰度增强提出了需要进一步研究的假设。 <div>
We analyze the spectral properties of 3He and 4He as well as the heavy ions (oxygen, neon, magnesium, silicon, and iron) in 80 3He-rich solar energetic particle (SEP) events observed by the Ultra-Low-Energy Ion Spectrometer on board the Advanced Composition Explorer spacecraft since its launch in 1997 until 2024. We split the spectral analysis into two criteria: events with fast and wide coronal mass ejections (CMEs; called “FW events”) and events with slow, narrow, or no observed CMEs (called “non-FW events”). Overall, we find that events with fast and wide CMEs exhibit more uniform spectra across all species, and their low-energy spectral indices are strongly correlated, suggesting a CME provides an additional reacceleration mechanism for the 3He-rich SEPs. When comparing each species’ low-energy spectral index for events with no associated fast-and-wide CME, we find a primary peak in the spectral hardness of 3He, and a secondary peak in Mg and Si. If we consider a plasma temperature of 1.0–1.3 MK, Mg and Si have a charge-to-mass ratio (Q/M) nearest to one-third (1/3), directly half that of 3He. Thus, our results support the results of Roth & Temerin, which suggest heavy ions resonate with the second harmonic of the same ion cyclotron waves energizing 3He. However, it is unclear why the Fe enhancement is not reflected in its spectral index, and we propose that additional acceleration and/or transport mechanisms are playing a role in the abundance enhancement of Fe and heavier ions.

<div> 边界层，剪切不稳定性，冷却速率，波动传播，质量和角动量传输
<br /><br />该研究调查了在一系列热力学条件下这些系统的动态，包括盘的声速和冷却速率。快速和缓慢冷却几乎不影响波动动力学。然而，当冷却时间与波周期相当时，波阻尼变得极端。在冷却速率中等的情况下，质量和角动量传输可以比等温和未冷却的情况下抑制几个数量级。盘中的冷却导致对接近和低于盘马赫数的波数的偏好；对应的较低频率可以与星内的重力模式耦合，在吸积系统中可能驱动低频变化，如矮新星和准周期振荡。
<br /><br />总结: 边界层的剪切不稳定性在盘向行星、恒星、白矮星和中子星的加速过程中起主导作用。冷却速率对波动动力学具有显著影响，当冷却时间与波周期相当时，波阻尼变得极端。较低频率的波动可以与星内的重力模式耦合，可能导致吸积系统中的低频变化。 <div>
In many cases accretion proceeds from disks onto planets, stars, white dwarfs, and neutron stars via a boundary layer, a region of intense shear where gas transitions from a near-Keplerian speed to that of the surface. These regions are not susceptible to the common magnetorotational and Kelvin–Helmholtz instabilities, and instead global modes generated by supersonic shear instabilities are a leading candidate to govern transport in these regions. This work investigates the dynamics of these systems under a range of thermodynamic conditions, surveying both disk sound speeds and cooling rates. Very fast and very slow cooling have little effect on wave dynamics: In the fast-cooling limit, waves propagate in an effectively isothermal manner, and in the slow-cooling limit, wave propagation is effectively adiabatic. However, when the cooling timescale is comparable to the wave period, wave damping becomes extreme. In cases with intermediate cooling rates, mass and angular momentum transport can be suppressed by orders of magnitude compared to isothermal and uncooled cases. Cooling in accretion disks leads to a preference for wavenumbers near and below the Mach number of the disk; the corresponding lower frequencies can (in nonisothermal systems) couple to gravity modes within the star, potentially driving low-frequency variability such as dwarf nova and quasi-periodic oscillations in accreting systems.

<div> GRB 200613A, Fermi satellite, Bayesian block method, Band+blackbody model, neutrino annihilation process
总结:<br /><br />本文报告了对Fermi卫星探测到的GRB 200613A的光学观测和多波段分析。通过贝叶斯分块方法进行了及时光谱分析，确定了统计上最佳的时间区间。根据贝叶斯信息准则，数据通常支持Band+黑体(BB)模型。我们推测主要的Band成分来自Blandford–Znajek机制，而额外的BB成分来自中微子湮灭过程。根据我们的模型与数据的比较，BB成分对于低自旋、高吸积速率的黑洞中央引擎是显著的。余辉光曲线表现出典型的幂律衰减，并且其行为可以通过抛射物和恒定星际介质的碰撞来解释。模型拟合得到如下参数：XXX。此外，我们使用公共Python包Prospector对宿主星系进行了光谱能量分布建模。结果表明，宿主星系是一颗大质量星系（），具有适度的星形成率（yr−1）。这种星形成率与从观测光谱中推导的∼34.2M⊙ yr−1的 [O ii]发射线的星形成率一致。 <div>
We present our optical observations and multiwavelength analysis of the GRB 200613A detected by the Fermi satellite. Time-resolved spectral analysis of the prompt gamma-ray emission was conducted utilizing the Bayesian block method to determine statistically optimal time bins. Based on the Bayesian Information Criterion, the data generally favor the Band+blackbody (BB) model. We speculate that the main Band component comes from the Blandford–Znajek mechanism, while the additional BB component comes from the neutrino annihilation process. The BB component becomes significant for a low-spin, high-accretion-rate black hole central engine, as evidenced by our model comparison with the data. The afterglow light curve exhibits typical power-law decay, and its behavior can be explained by the collision between the ejecta and the constant interstellar medium. Model fitting yields the following parameters: erg, , , cm−3, degree, and . In addition, we employed the public Python package Prospector to perform a spectral energy distribution modeling of the host galaxy. The results suggest that the host galaxy is a massive galaxy ( ) with a moderate star formation rate ( yr−1). This SFR is consistent with the SFR of ∼34.2M⊙ yr−1 derived from the [O ii] emission line in the observed spectrum.

<div> LAEs, low dust attenuation, ODIN, Lyα equivalent widths, [O ii] and [O iii] emitters<br />
<br />总结:<br />Lyman-alpha-emitting galaxies (LAEs)是年轻、低质量、星形成的星系，其低尘埃衰减使得它们的Lyα发射在观测中发光明亮。ODIN项目利用定制窄带滤光片在不同宇宙历史时期发现了大量LAE候选星系。研究引入了一种新的双宽带连续光谱估计技术，提高了Lyα当量宽度的估计精度。通过该方法，在扩展的COSMOS区域发现了大约6032、5691和4066个z=2.4、3.1和4.5的LAE候选星系。在LAE样本中，[O ii]发射星系的污染很小，但类似绿豌豆星系的[O iii]发射星系在红移4.5样本中很重要。研究还引入了一种识别[O ii]和[O iii]发射星系的创新方法，使得它们能够作为不同类别的对象进行研究。对每个星系样本进行了放大的堆叠光谱能量分布的中位数分析，展现了选择方法的整体成功。同时，计算了LAE样本的Lyα当量宽度，发现当量宽度分布最适合以w0 = 53 ± 1, 65 ± 1 和 59 ± 1 Å的指数函数拟合。 <div>
Lyman-alpha-emitting galaxies (LAEs) are typically young, low-mass, star-forming galaxies with little extinction from interstellar dust. Their low dust attenuation allows their Lyα emission to shine brightly in spectroscopic and photometric observations, providing an observational window into the high-redshift Universe. Narrowband surveys reveal large, uniform samples of LAEs at specific redshifts that probe large-scale structure and the temporal evolution of galaxy properties. The One-hundred-deg2 DECam Imaging in Narrowbands (ODIN) utilizes three custom-made narrowband filters on the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) to discover LAEs at three equally spaced periods in cosmological history. In this paper, we introduce the hybrid-weighted double-broadband continuum estimation technique, which yields improved estimation of Lyα equivalent widths. Using this method, we discover 6032, 5691, and 4066 LAE candidates at z = 2.4, 3.1, and 4.5 in the extended COSMOS field (∼9 deg2). We find that [O ii] emitters are a minimal contaminant in our LAE samples, but that interloping Green Pea–like [O iii] emitters are important for our redshift 4.5 sample. We introduce an innovative method for identifying [O ii] and [O iii] emitters via a combination of narrowband excess and galaxy colors, enabling their study as separate classes of objects. We present scaled median stacked spectral energy distributions for each galaxy sample, revealing the overall success of our selection methods. We also calculate rest-frame Lyα equivalent widths for our LAE samples and find that the EW distributions are best fit by exponential functions with scale lengths of w0 = 53 ± 1, 65 ± 1, and 59 ± 1 Å, respectively.

Joint observations in electromagnetic and gravitational waves shed light on the physics of objects and surrounding environments with extreme gravity that are otherwise unreachable via siloed observations in each messenger. However, such detections remain challenging due to the rapid and faint nature of counterparts. Protocols for discovery and inference still rely on human experts manually inspecting survey alert streams and intuiting optimal usage of limited follow-up resources. Strategizing an optimal follow-up program requires adaptive sequential decision-making given evolving light curve data that (i) maximizes a global objective despite incomplete information and (ii) is robust to stochasticity introduced by detectors/observing conditions. Reinforcement learning (RL) approaches allow agents to implicitly learn the physics or detector dynamics and the behavior policy that maximizes a designated objective through experience. To demonstrate the utility of such an approach for the kilonova follow-up problem, we train a toy RL agent with the goal of maximizing follow-up photometry for the true kilonova among several contaminant transient light curves. In a simulated environment where the agent learns online, it achieves 3× higher accuracy compared to a random strategy. However, it is surpassed by human agents by up to a factor of 2. This is likely because our hypothesis function (Q that is linear in state-action features) is an insufficient representation of the optimal behavior policy. More complex agents could perform at par or surpass human experts. Agents like these could pave the way for machine-directed software infrastructure to efficiently respond to next generation detectors, for conducting science inference and optimally planning expensive follow-up observations, scalably and with demonstrable performance guarantees.

Solar filaments can undergo eruptions that result in the formation of coronal mass ejections, which can significantly impact planetary space environments. Observations of eruptions involving polar crown filaments, situated in the polar regions of the Sun, are limited. In this study, we report a polar crown filament eruption (SOL2023-06-12), characterized by fast downflows below the filament. The downflows appear instantly after the onset of the filament eruption and persist for approximately 2 hr, exhibiting plane-of-sky velocities ranging between 92 and 144 km s−1. They originate from the leading edge of the filament, and no clear acceleration is observed. Intriguingly, these downflows appear at two distinct sites, symmetrically positioned at the opposite ends of the conjugate flare ribbons. Based on the observations, we propose that the filament might be supported by a magnetic flux rope (MFR), and these downflows possibly occur along the legs of the MFR. The downflows likely result from continuous reconnections between the MFR and the overlying magnetic field structures and could either be reconnection outflows or redirected filament materials. We also observed horizontal drifting of the locations of downflows, which might correspond to the MFR’s footpoint drifting. This type of downflow can potentially be utilized to track the footpoints of MFRs during eruptions.

这篇文章总结了对20 pc范围内棕矮星质量分布的研究成果。棕矮星的质量与其可观测参数（光度、光谱类型或颜色）之间缺乏相关性，因此棕矮星质量函数的测量必须通过代理测量和理论模型来获得。研究利用各种质量函数形式、出生率函数、低质量截断和理论进化模型，建立了有效温度分布的预测形式，并找到了与观测到的有效温度分布最匹配的质量函数。最终得出了一个简单的幂律形式的质量函数，并确定了恒星形成的低质量截断。研究还发现出生率对温度分布的影响较小，但不同的出生率倾向于较小的幂指数值。研究中的代码可公开获取。此外，研究还通过模拟老年（8-10亿年）棕矮星的分布，提出了亚矮温度间隙的宽度和位置的发现。
<br />总结: 棕矮星质量分布的研究揭示了质量函数形式和恒星形成的低质量截断，同时强调出生率对温度分布的影响。研究中开发的代码可用于模拟棕矮星的分布，并通过模拟老年棕矮星的分布，得出了亚矮温度间隙的宽度和位置的发现。 <div>
After decades of brown dwarf discovery and follow-up, we can now infer the functional form of the mass distribution within 20 pc, which serves as a constraint on star formation theory at the lowest masses. Unlike objects on the main sequence that have a clear luminosity-to-mass correlation, brown dwarfs lack a correlation between an observable parameter (luminosity, spectral type, or color) and mass. A measurement of the brown dwarf mass function must therefore be procured through proxy measurements and theoretical models. We utilize various assumed forms of the mass function, together with a variety of birthrate functions, low-mass cutoffs, and theoretical evolutionary models, to build predicted forms of the effective temperature distribution. We then determine the best fit of the observed effective temperature distribution to these predictions, which in turn reveals the most likely mass function. We find that a simple power law ( ) with α ≈ 0.5 is optimal. Additionally, we conclude that the low-mass cutoff for star formation is ≲0.005 M⊙. We corroborate the findings of Burgasser, which state that the birthrate has a far lesser impact than the mass function on the form of the temperature distribution, but we note that our alternate birthrates tend to favor slightly smaller values of α than the constant birthrate. Our code for simulating these distributions is publicly available. As another use case for this code, we present findings on the width and location of the subdwarf temperature gap by simulating distributions of very old (8–10 Gyr) brown dwarfs.

We present a novel, deep-learning-based method—dubbed Galactic-Seismology Substructures and Streams Hunter, or GS3 Hunter for short—to search for substructures and streams in stellar kinematics data. GS3 Hunter relies on a combined application of Siamese neural networks to transform the phase space information and the K-means algorithm for the clustering. As a validation test, we apply GS3 Hunter to a subset of the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) cosmological simulations. The stellar streams and substructures thus identified are in good agreement with corresponding results reported earlier by the FIRE team. In the same vein, we apply our method to a subset of local halo stars from the Gaia Early Data Release 3 and GALAH DR3 data sets and recover several previously known dynamical groups, such as Thamnos 1+2, the hot thick disk, ED-1, L-RL3, Helmi 1+2, Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus, Sequoia, Virgo Radial Merger, Cronus, and Nereus. Finally, we apply our method without fine-tuning to a subset of K giant stars located in the inner halo region, obtained from the LAMOST Data Release 5 data set. We recover three previously known structures (Sagittarius, Hercules-Aquila Cloud, and the Virgo Overdensity), but we also discover a number of new substructures. We anticipate that GS3 Hunter will become a useful tool for the community dedicated to the search for stellar streams and structures in the Milky Way (MW) and the Local Group, thus helping advance our understanding of the stellar inner and outer halos and the assembly and tidal stripping history in and around the MW.

总结:
Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX)观测了来自太阳圈层的能量中性原子（ENA）通量，丰富了我们对太阳风与局部星际介质（LISM）相互作用的理解。研究人员提出了一个新模型，利用磁流体动力学模拟太阳风-LISM相互作用，并在通过太阳圈后传播捡起离子后分析了来自Voyager 2方向的IBEX观测。这项研究扩展了模型，包括了来自Voyager 1方向以及带状的低纬度部分。研究结果显示，Voyager 1方向的模型与Voyager 2方向的结果一致，并且中间带状部分的结果也能复现实际观测。最后，研究人员通过模拟展示了三个大压力波很可能在VLISM中合并，并被Voyager 1观测到为“pf2”，而至少其中一个波的效应在太阳圈层中被IBEX观测到，表现为2016年初ENA通量的短暂增强。 <div>
Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) observations of energetic neutral atom (ENA) fluxes from the heliosphere have greatly enriched our understanding of the interaction of the solar wind (SW) with the local interstellar medium (LISM). However, there has been recent controversy surrounding the inability of most ENA models to produce as high an intensity of ∼0.5–6 keV ENAs as IBEX observes at 1 au, especially as a function of time. In our previous study (E. J. Zirnstein et al.), we introduced a new model that utilizes a data-driven magnetohydrodynamic simulation of the SW–LISM interaction to propagate pickup ions through the heliosheath (HS) after they are nonadiabatically heated at the heliospheric termination shock. E. J. Zirnstein et al. only simulated and analyzed IBEX observations from the direction of Voyager 2. In this study, we expand our model to include fluxes from the direction of Voyager 1, as well as in the low-latitude part (middle) of the ribbon (10° below the ecliptic plane). We show that the model results at Voyager 1 are consistent with E. J. Zirnstein et al.’s results at Voyager 2 in terms of a secondary ENA source contribution of ≲20% from both directions. Our results in the middle of the ribbon also reproduce the data, when including a time-dependent secondary ENA source. Finally, we demonstrate with our simulation that three large pressure waves likely merged in the VLISM and were observed by Voyager 1 as “pf2,” while at least one of the wave’s effects in the HS was observed by IBEX as a brief enhancement in ENA flux in early 2016.

这篇论文使用Keck/LRIS和Keck/MOSFIRE光谱观测数据，研究了z ∼ 3星系的Lyα剖面形状与电离辐射逸出的关联。他们发现低速度分离vLyα,red的KLCS物体的电离辐射逸出比例显著更高。他们还发现Lyα剖面形状与fesc之间没有明显趋势。与文献中z ∼ 0.3的“Green Peas”星系的测量结果相比，KLCS对象在相同vLyα,red情况下具有更大的vsep和更高的fesc。作者得出结论，高红移源的Lyα剖面形状根本不同，vLyα,red等参数与fesc之间的关系也不同，并警告不要仅基于低红移矮星系的Lyα剖面构建重离子化时期的fesc诊断。
<br /><br />总结: 高红移星系的Lyα剖面形状与电离辐射逸出相关，低速度分离的KLCS物体具有更高的电离辐射逸出比例。Lyα剖面形状与fesc之间没有明显趋势。与z ∼ 0.3的“Green Peas”星系相比，KLCS对象具有不同的Lyα剖面形状和逸出比例。作者警告不要仅基于低红移矮星系的Lyα剖面构建重离子化时期的fesc诊断。 <div>
While the shape of the Lyα profile is viewed as one of the best tracers of ionizing-photon escape fraction (fesc) within low-redshift (z ∼ 0.3) surveys of the Lyman continuum, this connection remains untested at high redshift. Here, we combine deep, rest-UV Keck/LRIS spectra of 80 objects from the Keck Lyman Continuum Spectroscopic Survey with rest-optical Keck/MOSFIRE spectroscopy in order to examine potential correlations between Lyα profile shape and the escape of ionizing radiation within z ∼ 3 star-forming galaxies. We measure the velocity separation between double-peaked Lyα emission structure (vsep), between red-side Lyα emission peaks and systemic (vLyα,red), and between red-side emission peaks and low-ionization interstellar absorption lines (vLyα−LIS). We find that the IGM-corrected ratio of ionizing to nonionizing flux density is significantly higher in KLCS objects with lower vLyα,red. We find no significant trend between measures of ionizing-photon escape and vLyα−LIS. We compare our results to measurements of z ∼ 0.3 “Green Peas” from the literature and find that KLCS objects have larger vsep at fixed vLyα,red, larger fesc at fixed vLyα,red, and higher vLyα,red overall than z ∼ 0.3 analogs. We conclude that the Lyα profile shapes of our high-redshift sources are fundamentally different, and that measurements of profile shape such as vLyα,red map on to fesc in different ways. We caution against building reionization-era fesc diagnostics based purely on Lyα profiles of low-redshift dwarf galaxies. Tracing vsep, vLyα,red, and fesc in a larger sample of z ∼ 3 galaxies will reveal how these variables may be connected for galaxies at the epoch of reionization.

<div> 关键词: 质量间隙黑洞-中子星并合, 引力波, 恒星演化, 天体物理, 脉冲星

总结:
质量间隙黑洞-中子星（mgBHNS）并合是引力波事件中GW230529的一个重要组成部分，由孤立双星演化渠道形成。研究使用“延迟”超新星模型和合理的模型实现来模拟人口综合，结果表明我们的模拟可以同时匹配从人口分析推断出的mgBHNS和总BHNS并合的速率密度，以及LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration报道的BH质量在BHNS并合中的分布。GW230529对推断的mgBHNS速率密度贡献显著，因此我们建议GW230529可以通过孤立双星演化渠道解释。考虑AP4（DD2）态方程，GW230529发生撕裂的概率分别为12.8％（63.2％）。如果GW230529是一个撕裂事件，其金新星峰值视星等预测约为23-24等，并且可以被当前的观测项目和大型巡天望远镜发现。由于GW230529可能是GW观测推断出的非轴向事件，其相关的伽玛射线暴（GRB）可能太暗而无法被γ射线探测器观测到，解释了缺乏GRB观测。我们的研究表明由于GW230529的发现，通过孤立双星演化渠道形成mgBHNS并合的存在，表明BHNS并合仍有可能是发射引力波、伽玛射线暴和金新星的多信使源。虽然mgBHNS并合占据了宇宙学BHNS人口的约50％，但我们发现≳90％的被撕裂的BHNS并合预计来自mgBHNS并合的形成。 <div>
In this paper, we explore the formation of the mass-gap black hole-neutron star (mgBHNS) merger detected in gravitational wave (GW) event, i.e., GW230529, from the isolated binary evolution channel, and study potential signatures of its electromagnetic counterparts. By adopting the “delayed” supernova prescription and reasonable model realizations, our population synthesis simulation results can simultaneously match the rate densities of mgBHNS and total BHNS mergers inferred from the population analyses, along with the population distribution of the BH mass in BHNS mergers reported by the LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA Collaboration. Because GW230529 contributes significantly to the inferred mgBHNS rate densities, we suggest that GW230529 can be explained through the isolated binary evolution channel. Considering the AP4 (DD2) equation of state, the probability that GW230529 can make tidal disruption is 12.8% (63.2%). If GW230529 is a disrupted event, its kilonova peak apparent magnitude is predicted ∼23–24 mag, and hence, can be detected by the present survey projects and Large Synoptic Survey Telescope. Since GW230529 could be an off-axis event inferred from the GW observation, its associated gamma-ray burst (GRB) might be too dim to be observed by γ-ray detectors, interpreting the lack of GRB observations. Our study suggests the existence of mgBHNS mergers formed through the isolated binary evolution channel due to the discovery of GW230529, indicating that BHNS mergers are still likely to be multimessenger sources that emit GWs, GRBs, and kilonovae. Although mgBHNS mergers account for ∼50% of the cosmological BHNS population, we find that ≳90% of disrupted BHNS mergers are expected to originate from mgBHNS mergers.

总结:
在太阳系的边界区域，也就是太阳风终止震波和日球层之间的赫尔尼辣甚重要。本文使用自洽的混合动力学模拟研究了湍流对赫尔尼辣中离子分布的影响，并与旅行者号观测进行了比较，限定了湍流的振幅和可压缩性范围。结果表明，湍流耗散导致太阳风热离子的温度显著增加，从而增加了低能量处（约100电子伏）的ENAs的电荷交换源。然而，湍流的影响可能不足以完全解释这些不一致。<br /><br /> <div>
The distribution of ions in the heliosheath—the region between the heliospheric termination shock and the heliopause—is important for understanding remote observations of energetic neutral atoms (ENAs). The ion distributions were estimated previously based on hybrid simulations of the heating and evolution of solar wind and interstellar pickup ions across the solar wind termination shock, but these estimates only provide the distributions near the shock. In this work, we use self-consistent hybrid kinetic simulations to investigate the effects of turbulence on ion distributions in the heliosheath. The simulations are compared against Voyager observations, constraining the feasible amplitude and compressibility of turbulence. We find that the heating due to turbulent dissipation can lead to a significant increase in the temperature of thermal solar wind ions. Both turbulent velocity fluctuations and the heating of solar wind ions increase the charge-exchange source for ENAs at low energies (around 100 eV), where current ENA models underpredict observations by more than an order of magnitude. However, the effects of turbulence are likely not strong enough to fully explain these discrepancies.

<div> LHS 3154 b, 质量, 恒星, 行星形成理论, 模拟

总结:
LHS 3154 b是一颗质量为13.2倍地球质量的行星，围绕质量为0.11太阳质量的恒星运转。这一发现挑战了传统的行星形成理论，认为质量较小的恒星周围不会形成质量如此巨大的行星。研究人员提出了“打破锁链”情景的模拟，表明类似LHS 3154 b这样质量巨大且距离恒星较近的行星在模拟系统中出现的概率约为1%。这一结果暗示这些行星不需要特别不寻常的形成条件，而是已有的理论可以解释。另外，模拟系统中还包含大约30天公转周期的小行星，这为该假设提供了可能的检验。 <div>
Conventional planet formation theories predict a paucity of massive planets around small stars, especially very low-mass (0.1−0.3 M⊙) mid-to-late M dwarfs. Such tiny stars are expected to form planets of terrestrial sizes but not much bigger. However, this expectation is challenged by the recent discovery of LHS 3154 b, a planet with period of 3.7 days and minimum mass of 13.2 M⊕ orbiting a 0.11 M⊙ star. Here, we propose that close-in Neptune-mass planets like LHS 3154 b formed through an anomalous series of mergers from a primordial compact system of super-Earths. We perform simulations within the context of the “breaking the chains” scenario, in which super-Earths initially form in tightly spaced chains of mean-motion resonances before experiencing dynamical instabilities and collisions. Planets as massive and close-in as LHS 3154 b (Mp ∼ 12−20 M⊕, P < 7 days) are produced in ∼1% of simulated systems, in broad agreement with their low observed occurrence. These results suggest that such planets do not require particularly unusual formation conditions but rather are an occasional by-product of a process that is already theorized to explain compact multiplanet systems. Interestingly, our simulated systems with LHS 3154 b-like planets also contain smaller planets at around ∼30 days, offering a possible test of this hypothesis.

<div> NGC 3718, star-forming complexes, UV study, minor merger, disturbed morphology
总结:
NGC 3718是一种近邻特殊星系，其光学形态受多重潮汐臂、扭曲盘和显著的弯曲尘埃巷的影响，但在近红外波段下，它看起来是一个以球状组分为主的星系。研究发现，这种扰动的形态使其成为研究潮汐扰动星系中恒星形成的理想案例。通过对星系进行分区，研究了恒星形成团的分布和特性。研究结果表明，次级并合事件可以触发星系盘的内部－外部生长，年轻的恒星形成团位于外潮汐臂而非内盘中。在中心盘区，恒星形成密度较大，恒星形成团的年龄也较大。 <br /><br /> <div>
We present a UV, optical, and near-IR study of the star-forming complexes in the nearby peculiar galaxy NGC 3718, using Ultraviolet Imaging telescope, Galaxy Evolution Explorer, Spitzer, and DECam Legacy Survey imaging data. The galaxy has a disturbed optical morphology owing to the multiple tidal arms, the warped disk, and the prominent curved dust lanes, but in the near-IR it appears to be a bulge-dominated galaxy. Its disturbed morphology makes it an excellent case to study star formation in a tidally disturbed galaxy that may have undergone a recent minor merger. To study the distribution and properties of the star-forming clumps (SFCs), we divided the galaxy within the R25 (B band) radius into three parts—the upper, central, and lower regions. Using the UV band images, we investigated the warped star-forming disk, the extended tidal arms, and the distribution and sizes of the 182 SFCs. Their distribution is 49, 60, and 73 in the galaxy’s upper, central, and lower regions, respectively. We determined the UV color, star formation rates (SFRs), star formation density (ΣSFR), and ages of the SFCs. The central disk of the galaxy has a larger mean ΣSFR that is ∼3.3 and ∼1.6 times higher than the upper and lower regions, respectively. We also find that the SFCs in the central disk are older than those in the tidal arms. Our study thus shows that minor mergers can trigger the inside-out growth of galaxy disks, where the younger SFCs are in outer tidal arms and not in the inner disk.

<div> 核心形成, 超大质量黑洞, 双星, 引力波, N体模拟

总结:
核心形成的主要机制是超大质量黑洞双星的清除作用和来自引力波反冲的加热作用。研究使用N体模拟模拟了四个具有超过0.5千秒差距的大质量椭圆星系的形成过程。结果表明，NGC 1600和A2147-BCG的核心尺寸小于1.3千秒差距，可以通过双星清除机制形成，而NGC 6166和A2261-BCG的大于2千秒差距的核心则需要引力波引起的加热作用。引力波加热作用会导致表面亮度变平，对应着真正的三维空间密度的平坦核心，并且会优先移除轨道角动量低的恒星离星系核心。 <br /><br /> <div>
Scouring by supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries is the most accepted mechanism for the formation of the cores seen in giant elliptical galaxies. However, an additional mechanism is required to explain the largest observed cores. Gravitational-wave (GW) recoil is expected to trigger further growth of the core, as subsequent heating from dynamical friction of the merged SMBH removes stars from the central regions. We model core formation in massive elliptical galaxies from both binary scouring and heating by GW recoil and examine their unique signatures. We aim to determine whether the nature of cores in 3D space density can be attributed uniquely to either process and whether the magnitude of the kick can be inferred. We perform N-body simulations of galactic mergers of multicomponent galaxies, based on the observed parameters of four massive elliptical galaxies with cores >0.5 kpc. After binary scouring and hardening, the merged SMBH remnant is given a range of GW recoil kicks with 0.5–0.9 of the escape speed of the galaxy. We find that binary scouring alone can form the cores of NGC 1600 and A2147-BCG, which are <1.3 kpc in size. However, the >2 kpc cores in NGC 6166 and A2261-BCG require heating from GW recoil kicks of <0.5 of the galaxy escape speed. A unique feature of GW recoil heating is flatter cores in surface brightness, corresponding to truly flat cores in 3D space density. It also preferentially removes stars on low angular momentum orbits from the galactic nucleus.

总结:
CME是一种复杂的磁化等离子体结构，其磁轴与黄道面角度不同，会受到不均匀和各向同性的星际磁场和太阳风的影响。研究使用EUHFORIA 3D模型进行模拟，关注CME倾斜度对其传播的影响。研究发现，CME的倾斜度会影响其保护层演变、磁流体动力学阻力和非径向流动。此外，研究还发现，随着距离太阳的增加，保护层持续时间会增加，而非径向流动在黄道面外更为显著。然而，在数值设定上无法解决阻力参数的倾斜度依赖性。 <div>
Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are complex magnetized plasma structures in which the magnetic field spirals around a central axis, forming what is known as a flux rope (FR). The central FR axis can be oriented at any angle with respect to the ecliptic. Throughout its journey, a CME will encounter interplanetary magnetic fields and solar winds that are neither homogeneous nor isotropic. Consequently, CMEs with different orientations will encounter different ambient medium conditions and, thus, the interaction of a CME with its surrounding environment will vary depending on the orientation of its FR axis, among other factors. This study aims to understand the effect of inclination on CME propagation. We performed simulations with the EUHFORIA 3D magnetohydrodynamic model. This study focuses on two CMEs modeled as spheromaks with nearly identical properties, differing only by their inclination. We show the effects of CME orientation on sheath evolution, MHD drag, and nonradial flows by analyzing the model data from a swarm of 81 virtual spacecraft scattered across the inner heliospheric. We have found that the sheath duration increases with radial distance from the Sun and that the rate of increase is greater on the flanks of the CME. Nonradial flows within the studied sheath region appear larger outside the ecliptic plane, indicating a “sliding” of the interplanetary magnetic field in the out-of-ecliptic plane. We found that the calculated drag parameter does not remain constant with radial distance and that the inclination dependence of the drag parameter cannot be resolved with our numerical setup.

<title>The Accelerating Decline of the Mass Transfer Rate in the Recurrent Nova T Pyxidis*</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The recurrent nova T Pyxidis (T Pyx) has erupted six times since 1890, with its last outburst in 2011, and the relatively short recurrence time between classical nova explosions indicates that T Pyx must have a massive white dwarf (WD) accreting at a high rate. It is believed that, since its outburst in 1890, the mass transfer rate in T Pyx was very large due to a feedback loop where the secondary is heated by the hot WD. The feedback loop has been slowly shutting off, reducing the mass transfer rate, and thereby explaining the magnitude decline of T Pyx from ∼13.8 (before 1890) to 15.7 just before the 2011 eruption. We present an analysis of the latest Hubble Space Telescope far-ultraviolet and optical spectra, obtained 12 yr after the 2011 outburst, showing that the mass transfer rate has been steadily declining and is now below its preoutburst level by about 40%: yr−1 for a WD mass of ∼1.0–1.4 M⊙, an inclination of 50°–60°, reddening of E(B − V) = 0.30 ± 0.05, and a Gaia Data Release 3 distance of pc. This steady decrease in the mass transfer rate in the ∼decade after the 2011 outburst is in sharp contrast with the more constant preoutburst ultraviolet continuum flux level from archival International Ultraviolet Explorer spectra. The flux (i.e., ) decline rate is 29 times faster now in the last ∼decade than observed since 1890 to ∼2010. The feedback loop shut off seems to be accelerating, at least in the decade following its 2011 outburst. In all eventualities, our analysis confirms that T Pyx is going through an unusually peculiar short-lived phase.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The end of supernova remnant (SNR) evolution is characterized by a so-called “radiative” stage, in which efficient cooling of the hot bubble inside the forward shock slows expansion, leading to eventual shock breakup. Understanding SNR evolution at this stage is vital for predicting feedback in galaxies, since SNRs are expected to deposit their energy and momentum into the interstellar medium at the ends of their lives. A key prediction of SNR evolutionary models is the formation at the onset of the radiative stage of a cold, dense shell behind the forward shock. However, searches for these shells via their neutral hydrogen emission have had limited success. We instead introduce an independent observational signal of shell formation arising from the interaction between nonthermal particles accelerated by the SNR forward shock (cosmic rays) and the dense shell. Using a semi-analytic model of particle acceleration based on state-of-the-art simulations coupled with a high-resolution hydrodynamic model of SNR evolution, we predict the nonthermal emission that arises from this interaction. We demonstrate that the onset of the radiative stage leads to nonthermal signatures from radio to gamma rays, including radio and gamma-ray brightening by nearly 2 orders of magnitude. Such a signature may be detectable with current instruments, and will be resolvable with the next generation of gamma-ray telescopes (namely, the Cherenkov Telescope Array).

A population of structures unique to the Galactic Center (GC), known as the nonthermal filaments (NTFs), has been studied for over 40 yr, but much remains unknown about them. In particular, there is no widely accepted and unified understanding for how the relativistic electrons illuminating these structures are generated. One possibility is that there are compact and extended sources of cosmic rays, which then diffuse along magnetic flux tubes leading to the illumination of the NTFs through synchrotron emission. In this work, we present and discuss the polarimetric distributions associated with a set of faint NTFs in the GC that have only been studied in total intensity previously. We compare the derived polarized intensity, rotation measure, and intrinsic magnetic field distributions for these structures with the results obtained for previously observed GC NTFs. The results are then used to enhance our understanding of the large-scale polarimetric properties of the GC. We then use the derived polarimetric distributions to constrain models for the mechanisms generating the relativistic electrons that illuminate these structures.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Meteorites and their components exhibit a diverse range of oxygen isotope compositions, and the isotopic exchange timescale between dust grains and ambient gas is a key parameter for understanding the spatiotemporal evolution of the solar nebula. As dust grains existed as macroscopic aggregates in the solar nebula, it is necessary to consider the isotopic exchange timescales for these aggregates. Here, we theoretically estimate the isotope exchange timescales between dust aggregates and ambient vapor. The isotope exchange process between aggregates and ambient vapor is divided into four processes: (i) supply of gas molecules to the aggregate surface, (ii) diffusion of molecules within the aggregate, (iii) isotope exchange on the surface of constituent particles, and (iv) isotope diffusion within the particles. We evaluate these timescales and assess which one becomes the rate-determining step. We reveal that the isotope exchange timescale is approximately the same as that of the constituent particles when the aggregate radius is smaller than the critical value, which is a few centimeters when considering the exchange reaction between amorphous forsterite aggregates and water vapor.

总结: Parker Solar Probe在靠近太阳的轨道上发现了大幅度的Alfvén波，在离散的磁场反转区域产生了磁场反转斑块。文章使用了Solar Orbiter的数据，发现这些斑块并没有区别于周围太阳风的离子和元素组成。同时，斑块和周围的太阳风都表现出快速和慢速风的特征，说明它们可能源自太阳日冕区域不同的磁场和热性质。研究还表明，可能是置换重连接和/或剪切驱动过程在斑块的形成中发挥了作用。<br /><br /> <div>
Since Parker Solar Probe’s (Parker’s) first perihelion pass at the Sun, large-amplitude Alfvén waves grouped in patches have been observed near the Sun throughout the mission. Several formation processes for these magnetic switchback patches have been suggested with no definitive consensus. To provide insight into their formation, we examine the heavy ion properties of several adjacent magnetic switchback patches around Parker’s 11th perihelion pass, capitalizing on a spacecraft lineup with Solar Orbiter where each samples the same solar wind streams over a large range of longitudes. Heavy ion properties (Fe/O, C6+/C5+, O7+/O6+) related to the wind’s coronal origin, measured with Solar Orbiter, can be linked to switchback patch structures identified near the Sun with Parker. We find that switchback patches do not contain distinctive ion and elemental compositional signatures different from the surrounding nonswitchback solar wind. Both the patches and ambient wind exhibit a range of fast and slow wind qualities, indicating coronal sources with open and closed field lines in close proximity. These observations and modeling indicate switchback patches form in coronal hole boundary wind and with a range of source region magnetic and thermal properties. Furthermore, the heavy ion signatures suggest interchange reconnection and/or shear-driven processes may play a role in their creation.

We present slick (the Scalable Line Intensity Computation Kit), a software package that calculates realistic CO, [C i], and [C ii] luminosities for clouds and galaxies formed in hydrodynamic simulations. Built on the radiative transfer code despotic, slick computes the thermal, radiative, and statistical equilibrium in concentric zones of model clouds, based on their physical properties and individual environments. We validate our results by applying slick to the high-resolution run of the Simba simulations, testing the derived luminosities against empirical and theoretical/analytic relations. To simulate the line emission from a universe of emitting clouds, we have incorporated random forest machine learning (ML) methods into our approach, allowing us to predict cosmologically evolving properties of CO, [C i], and [C ii] emission from galaxies such as luminosity functions. We tested this model in 100,000 gas particles, and 2500 galaxies, reaching an average accuracy of ∼99.8% for all lines. Finally, we present the first model light cones created with realistic and ML-predicted CO, [C i], and [C ii] luminosities in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, from z = 0 to z = 10.

利用JWST MIRI/Medium Resolution Spectrograph积分场观测，展示了GATOS调查中包括的六个邻近Seyfert星系的千秒巴尔中心区域的电离气体分布和动力学的多样性。具体来说，我们呈现了六条电离发射线的空间分辨率的流量分布和速度场图，涵盖了很大范围的电离电位（15.8-97.1 eV）。根据这些地图，我们展示了六个目标的电离气体流出的证据，发现NGC 5728、NGC 5506和ESO137-G034存在一些高度扰动的区域。我们提出，AGN驱动的无线电喷流可能在触发这些高度扰动的区域中发挥着重要作用。基于[Ne V]发射估算的流出速率，我们发现这六个目标的电离流出速率趋于收敛到比以前更窄的范围。这些结果对于具有可比辐射度的AGN的流出性质具有重要意义。<br /><br />总结: 利用JWST MIRI的积分场观测，展示了六个邻近Seyfert星系的电离气体分布和动力学的多样性，发现了电离气体流出的证据，推测AGN驱动的无线电喷流可能在触发高度扰动的区域中发挥着重要作用，对AGN的流出性质具有重要意义。 <div>
Utilizing JWST MIRI/Medium Resolution Spectrograph integral field unit observations of the kiloparsec-scale central regions, we showcase the diversity of ionized gas distributions and kinematics in six nearby Seyfert galaxies included in the GATOS survey. Specifically, we present spatially resolved flux distribution and velocity field maps of six ionized emission lines covering a large range of ionization potentials (15.8–97.1 eV). Based on these maps, we showcase the evidence of ionized gas outflows in the six targets, and find some highly disturbed regions in NGC 5728, NGC 5506, and ESO137-G034. We propose active galactic nucleus (AGN)-driven radio jets plausibly play an important role in triggering these highly disturbed regions. With the outflow rates estimated based on [Ne V] emission, we find the six targets tend to have ionized outflow rates converged to a narrower range than the previous finding. These results have an important implication for the outflow properties in AGN of comparable luminosity.

<div> 磁性双星，ϵ Lupi A，X射线观测，磁层相互作用，磁场重连接<br />
ϵ Lupi A系统是唯一一个两个组分都有可检测磁场的磁性双星系统，磁层相互作用在其射电光度曲线中呈现出周期性脉冲。本研究旨在探究X射线领域中的磁层相互作用现象。利用XMM-Newton望远镜对该系统进行观测，覆盖了其轨道周期。我们观测到可变的X射线发射，在近心点附近呈现最大通量，与射电观测相似。X射线光谱显示在近心点期间，硬X射线通量显着增加。我们将软X射线发射归因于个体磁层，而硬X射线发射则解释为磁层相互作用，特别是由于磁场重连接。然而，与射电不同的是，我们并未发现任何显著的短期X射线爆发。这种异国情调的系统可能是研究具有有序磁层的近邻双星中磁层相互作用的理想目标。<br /><br />总结: 研究发现了ϵ Lupi A系统中磁层相互作用的X射线表现，包括变化的X射线发射、硬X射线通量的显著增加以及与射电观测的相似性。同时也发现了与射电观测不同的地方，即未发现显著的短期X射线爆发。这表明这一独特的系统可能是研究有序磁层近邻双星中磁层相互作用的理想目标。 <div>
The ϵ Lupi A (HD 136504) system stands out among magnetic massive binaries as the only short-period binary system in which both components have detectable magnetic fields. The proximity of the magnetospheres of the components leads to magnetospheric interactions, which are revealed as periodic pulses in the radio light curve of this system. In this work, we aim to investigate the magnetospheric interaction phenomenon in the X-ray domain. We observed this system with the XMM-Newton telescope, covering its orbital period. We observe variable X-ray emission with maximum flux near periastron, showing similarity with radio observations. The X-ray spectra show significantly elevated hard X-ray flux during periastron. We attribute the soft X-ray emission to individual magnetospheres, while the hard X-ray emission is explained by magnetospheric interaction, particularly due to magnetic reconnection. However, unlike in the radio, we do not find any significant short-term X-ray bursts. This exotic system may be an ideal target to study magnetospheric interactions in close binaries with organized magnetospheres.

<br />
通过采用k-ω模型，模拟了不同金属丰度和初始质量的氮序列Wolf-Rayet（WNL）星的演化，包括旋转和非旋转模型，并与经典的过冷模型进行了比较。结果表明，在相同的初始条件下，k−ω模型通常会产生更大的对流核心和更宽的过冷区，从而增加了WNL星的质量范围和寿命，并增加形成WNL星的可能性。WNL星的质量和寿命都随着金属丰度和初始质量的增加而增加。在高金属丰度条件下，两种过冷方案在WNL星的寿命上存在明显差异，但在WNL星的质量范围上差异不大。旋转可能会在低质量、金属贫穷对应体中促使WNL星的形成，这种效应在过冷模型中更为显著。在主序星相形成的富金属WNL星的表面氮可能主要来自CN循环，而在相对金属贫穷的对应体中可能来自CN和NO循环。我们的模型可以有效解释银河系中WNL星的分布，但似乎在解释大麦哲伦星云中的WNL星方面存在不足。 <br /><br />总结: 演化模拟表明，k-ω模型产生较大的对流核心和更宽的超越区域，增加了WNL星的寿命和形成可能性。WNL星的质量和寿命随金属丰度和初始质量增加而增加，而旋转有助于在低质量、金属贫穷对应体中形成WNL星。表面氮的来源在不同金属丰度条件下存在差异。这一模型解释了银河系中WNL星的分布，但解释大麦哲伦星云中的WNL星还存在不足。 <div>
We adopt a set of second-order differential equations (k − ω model) to handle core convective overshooting in massive stars, simulate the evolution of nitrogen sequence Wolf–Rayet (WNL) stars with different metallicities and initial masses, both rotating and nonrotating models, and compare the results with the classical overshooting model. The results indicate that, under the same initial conditions, the k − ω model generally produces larger convective cores and wider overshooting regions, thereby increasing the mass ranges and extending the lifetimes of WNL stars, as well as the likelihood of forming WNL stars. The masses and lifetimes of WNL stars both increase with higher metallicities and initial masses. Under higher-metallicity conditions, the two overshooting schemes significantly differ in their impacts on the lifetimes of WNL stars, but are insignificant in the mass ranges of the WNL stars. Rotation may drive the formation of WNL stars in low-mass, metal-poor counterparts, with this effect being more pronounced in the overshooting model. The surface nitrogen of metal-rich WNL stars formed during the main-sequence phase is likely primarily from the CN cycle, while it may come from both the CN and NO cycles for relatively metal-poor counterparts. Our model can effectively explain the distribution of WNL stars in the Milky Way, but appears to have inadequacies in explaining the WNL stars in the LMC.

We present a catalog of stellar parameters (effective temperature Teff, surface gravity , age, and metallicity [Fe/H]) and elemental-abundance ratios ([C/Fe], [Mg/Fe], and [α/Fe]) for some five million stars (4.5 million dwarfs and 0.5 million giant stars) in the Milky Way, based on stellar colors from the Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS) DR3 and Gaia EDR3. These estimates are obtained through the construction of a large spectroscopic training set with parameters and abundances adjusted to uniform scales, and trained with a kernel principal component analysis. Owing to the seven narrow/medium-band filters employed by J-PLUS, we obtain precisions in the abundance estimates that are as good as or better than those derived from medium-resolution spectroscopy for stars covering a wide range of the parameter space: 0.10–0.20 dex for [Fe/H] and [C/Fe], and 0.05 dex for [Mg/Fe] and [α/Fe]. Moreover, systematic errors due to the influence of molecular carbon bands on previous photometric-metallicity estimates (which only included two narrow/medium-band blue filters) have now been removed, resulting in photometric-metallicity estimates down to [Fe/H] ∼ −4.0, with typical uncertainties of 0.40 dex and 0.25 dex for dwarfs and giants, respectively. This large photometric sample should prove useful for the exploration of the assembly and chemical-evolution history of our Galaxy.

通过结合Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument的光谱测量和LOw-Frequency ARray Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) DR2目录以及Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) quick-look目录的无线电源，我们研究了射电模式反馈对冷环银河介质（CGM）性质的影响。我们选择大约30,000个射电星系和具有相似光学性质但在LoTSS和VLASS中没有射电对应物的星系作为对照组。通过测量Mg ii吸收线追踪的射电星系和对照样本的冷CGM性质，包括覆盖分数、静息等效宽度和气体动力学，我们的研究结果显示，射电星系周围的气体性质与对照样本没有显著差异，表明大质量星系的射电模式反馈对冷CGM的性质没有可检测的影响。最后，我们展示了射电星系的CGM包含大约10^10M⊙的大量冷气体，这一丰度可以对射电模式反馈模型提出严格限制。

We explore the influence of radio-mode feedback on the properties of the cool circumgalactic medium (CGM). To this end, we assemble a statistical sample of approximately 30,000 radio galaxies with background quasars by combining optical spectroscopic measurements of luminous red galaxies and quasars from the year 1 data set of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument and radio sources from the LOw-Frequency ARray Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) DR2 catalog and the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) quick-look catalog. Galaxies with similar optical properties but with no radio counterparts in LoTSS and VLASS are selected as the control group. We measure the cool CGM properties of radio galaxies and their control samples traced by Mg ii absorption lines, including covering fraction, rest equivalent width, and gas kinematics. Our results show no significant difference in the properties of gas around radio galaxies and their control sample, indicating that the operating radio-mode feedback of massive galaxies does not produce detectable effects on the properties of the cool CGM. Finally, we show that the CGM of radio galaxies contains a nonnegligible amount of cool gas with approximately 1010M⊙. This abundance can place a stringent constraint on the radio-mode feedback models.

Solar energetic particle (SEP) events are one of the most crucial aspects of space weather that require continuous monitoring and forecasting using robust methods. We demonstrate a proof of concept of using a data-driven supervised classification framework on a multivariate time-series data set covering solar cycles 22, 23, and 24. We implement ensemble modeling that merges the results from three proton channels (E ≥ 10 MeV, 50 MeV, and 100 MeV) and the long-band X-ray flux (1–8 Å) channel from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite missions. Our task is binary classification, such that the aim of the model is to distinguish strong SEP events from nonevents. Here, strong SEP events are those crossing the Space Weather Prediction Center’s “S1” threshold of solar radiation storm and proton fluxes below that threshold are weak SEP events. In addition, we consider periods of nonoccurrence of SEPs following a flare with magnitudes ≥C6.0 to maintain a natural imbalance of sample distribution. In our data set, there are 244 strong SEP events comprising the positive class. There are 189 weak events and 2460 “SEP-quiet” periods for the negative class. We experiment with summary statistic, one-nearest neighbor, and supervised time-series forest (STSF) classifiers and compare their performance to validate our methods for prediction windows from 5 minutes up to 60 minutes. We find the STSF model to perform better under all circumstances. For an optimal classification threshold of ≈0.3 and a 60 minutes prediction window, we obtain a true skill statistic TSS = 0.850, Heidke skill score HSS = 0.878, and Gilbert skill score GSS = 0.783.

Potential field source surface (PFSS) models are widely used to simulate coronal magnetic fields. PFSS models use the observed photospheric magnetic field as the inner boundary condition and assume a perfectly radial field beyond a “source surface” (Rss). At present, total solar eclipse (TSE) white-light images are the only data that delineate the coronal magnetic field from the photosphere out to several solar radii (R⊙). We utilize a complete solar cycle span of these images between 2008 and 2020 as a benchmark to assess the reliability of PFSS models. For a quantitative assessment, we apply the Rolling Hough Transform to the eclipse data and corresponding PFFS models to measure the difference, Δθ, between the data and model magnetic field lines throughout the corona. We find that the average Δθ, 〈Δθ〉, can be minimized for a given choice of Rss depending on the phase within a solar cycle. In particular, Rss ≈ 1.3 R⊙ is found to be optimal for solar maximum, while Rss ≈ 3 R⊙ yields a better match at solar minimum. Regardless, large (〈Δθ〉 > 10°) discrepancies between TSE data and PFSS-generated coronal field lines remain regardless of the choice of source surface. However, implementation of solar-cycle-dependent Rss optimal values does yield more reliable PFSS-generated coronal field lines for use in models and for tracing in situ measurements back to their sources at the Sun.

We present Lightcurve Anomaly Identification and Similarity Search (LAISS), an automated pipeline to detect anomalous astrophysical transients in real-time data streams. We deploy our anomaly detection model on the nightly Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) Alert Stream via the ANTARES broker, identifying a manageable ∼1–5 candidates per night for expert vetting and coordinating follow-up observations. Our method leverages statistical light-curve and contextual host galaxy features within a random forest classifier, tagging transients of rare classes (spectroscopic anomalies), of uncommon host galaxy environments (contextual anomalies), and of peculiar or interaction-powered phenomena (behavioral anomalies). Moreover, we demonstrate the power of a low-latency (∼ms) approximate similarity search method to find transient analogs with similar light-curve evolution and host galaxy environments. We use analogs for data-driven discovery, characterization, (re)classification, and imputation in retrospective and real-time searches. To date, we have identified ∼50 previously known and previously missed rare transients from real-time and retrospective searches, including but not limited to superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), tidal disruption events, SNe IIn, SNe IIb, SNe I-CSM, SNe Ia-91bg-like, SNe Ib, SNe Ic, SNe Ic-BL, and M31 novae. Lastly, we report the discovery of 325 total transients, all observed between 2018 and 2021 and absent from public catalogs (∼1% of all ZTF Astronomical Transient reports to the Transient Name Server through 2021). These methods enable a systematic approach to finding the “needle in the haystack” in large-volume data streams. Because of its integration with the ANTARES broker, LAISS is built to detect exciting transients in Rubin data.

总结: 
本文研究了伽马射线暴后的迟发射，即在观测到的100-1000秒后出现的X射线异常。研究估计了这些迟发射产生的中微子的检测可能性，并发现IceCube-Gen2通过堆积约1000-2000个事件有望实现中微子的检测。同时，文章还指出即使未检测到中微子，仍可以获得有意义的对迟发射特性的约束。文章的研究有望为未来的多信使观测提供重要的参考。<br /><br /> <div>
In gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), ∼100–1000 s after the prompt emission, afterglow observations have consistently shown X-ray excesses detected in the form of flares (in long GRBs) or extended emission (in short GRBs). These observations are interpreted as emissions from jets launched by late central engine activity. However, the characteristics of these late-time jets, particularly the dissipation radius (rdiss), Lorentz factor (Γ), and cosmic-ray loading factor (ξp), remain unknown despite their importance. Here, in order to understand the properties of the late-time jets with future multimessenger observations, we estimate the detectability of neutrinos associated with late-time emissions for a wide range of rdiss and Γ, assuming ξp = 10. We take into account external seed photons from the cocoon around the jets, which can enhance the neutrino production through photohadronic interaction in the jet dissipation region. Our results are still consistent with the upper limit obtained by IceCube. Our calculations indicate a promising prospect for neutrino detection with IceCube-Gen2 through the stacking of ∼1000–2000 events, for a wide range of rdiss and Γ. We found that setting an optimal energy threshold of 10 TeV can significantly reduce noise without negatively affecting neutrino detection. Furthermore, even in the case of nondetection, we show that meaningful constraints on the characteristics of the late-time jets can be obtained.

本文重点研究了高能电子束在传播过程中的能量通量减少以及返回电流对加速电子束所携带能量通量的影响。通过系统计算，得出了在不同的束流和等离子体参数下，返回电流损失对能量通量的重要性，并估计了能量通量损失的程度。此外，还分析了在注入通量较高时可能出现的两种情况：一是失控电子的显著影响，二是电流驱动不稳定性的显著影响。最后，还讨论了返回电流对电子束反射的重要性，指出许多太阳耀斑的解释需要重新审视以考虑返回电流的影响。 <div>
High-energy electrons carry much of a solar flare’s energy. Therefore, understanding changes in electron beam distributions during their propagation is crucial. A key focus of this paper is how the cospatial return current reduces the energy flux carried by these accelerated electrons. We systematically compute this reduction for various beam and plasma parameters relevant to solar flares. Our 1D model accounts for collisions between beam and plasma electrons, return-current electric-field deceleration, thermalization in a warm target approximation, and runaway electron contributions. The results focus on the classical (Spitzer) regime, offering a valuable benchmark for energy flux reduction and its extent. Return-current losses are only negligible for the lowest nonthermal fluxes. We calculate the conditions for return-current losses to become significant and estimate the extent of the modification to the beam’s energy flux density. We also calculate two additional conditions that occur for higher injected fluxes: (1) where runaway electrons become significant, and (2) where current-driven instabilities might become significant, requiring a model that self-consistently accounts for them. Condition 2 is relaxed and the energy flux losses are reduced in the presence of runaway electrons. All results are dependent on beam and cospatial plasma parameters. We also examine the importance of the reflection of beam electrons by the return-current electric field. We show that the interpretation of a number of flares needs to be reviewed to account for the effects of return currents.

<div> 高红移、星系形成、线强度映射、[C II] 158 微米线、突发星形成<br />
总结:<br />
研究发现，在高红移星系中突发星形成现象普遍存在，表现为[C II] 158 微米线的强度映射。为了理解突发星形成对[C II]线强度映射的影响，文章提出了一个解释高红移星系形成和[C II]信号的分析模型。该模型的结果显示，突发星形成对低质量星系的平均星形成率和[C II] 发光度有显著影响，并且在[C II]功率谱中会产生大尺度聚类项的显著过量。因此，在建模和分析早期宇宙中的[C II]数据集时，必须考虑突发性，并且在极端情况下，突发性的特征可能会被第一代实验如TIME、CONCERTO和CCAT-DSS所发现。 <div>
Bursty star formation—a key prediction for high-redshift galaxies from cosmological simulations explicitly resolving stellar feedback in the interstellar medium—has recently been observed to prevail among galaxies at redshift z ≳ 6. Line intensity mapping (LIM) of the 158 μm [C ii] line as a star formation rate (SFR) indicator offers unique opportunities to tomographically constrain cosmic star formation at high redshift, in a way complementary to observations of individually detected galaxies. To understand the effects of bursty star formation on [C ii] LIM, which have remained unexplored in previous studies, we present an analytic modeling framework for high-z galaxy formation and [C ii] LIM signals that accounts for bursty star formation histories induced by delayed supernova feedback. We use it to explore and characterize how bursty star formation can impact and thus complicate the interpretation of the [C ii] luminosity function and power spectrum. Our simple analytic model indicates that bursty star formation mainly affects low-mass galaxies by boosting their average SFR and [C ii] luminosity, and in the [C ii] power spectrum it can create a substantial excess in the large-scale clustering term. This distortion results in a power spectrum shape that cannot be explained by invoking a mass-independent logarithmic scatter. We conclude that burstiness must be accounted for when modeling and analyzing [C ii] data sets from the early Universe, and that in the extreme, the signature of burstiness may be detectable with first-generation experiments such as TIME, CONCERTO, and CCAT-DSS.

<title>Nucleosynthesis Contribution of Neutrino-dominated Accretion Flows to the Solar Neighborhood</title>

<div> 星际丰度，56Fe，NDAF，SNe Ia，化学丰度<br />
NDAF在太阳邻域的化学丰度演化中扮演重要角色，通过研究铁的演变和金属量比随着时间的变化，发现了NDAF对金属丰度的贡献。太阳邻域的金属丰度在SNe Ia之前逐渐增加，在考虑NDAF的情况下，由于铁的增加，金属贫乏星的金属量分布得到改善，而且还能够复现观测到的[Mg/Fe]的演变。这些结果深入理解了太阳环境中金属丰度的演化。 <br /><br />总结: <br />核崩解超新星在早期起主导作用，而Ia型超新星在后期起主导作用；NDAF对金属丰度的贡献尤为重要；NDAF的考虑改善了金属贫乏星的金属量分布；NDAF可复现[Mg/Fe]的观测到的演变变化；进一步加深了对太阳环境中金属丰度演化的理解。 <div>
The elemental abundances of stars reflect the complex enrichment history of the Galaxy. To explore and explain the metal enrichment history of the cosmic environment near our solar system, we study the evolution of 56Fe abundance over time and [Mg/Fe] versus [Fe/H] evolution in the solar neighborhood. Core-collapse supernovae make the dominant contribution in the early stages, while Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) have a delayed and dominant impact in the later stages. In this work, we consider the nucleosynthesis contribution of neutrino-dominated accretion flows (NDAFs) formed at the end of the lives of massive stars. The results show that the [Fe/H] gradually increases over time and eventually reaches [Fe/H] = 0 and above, reproducing the chemical enrichment process in the solar neighborhood. Before the onset of SNe Ia, the ratio of 56Fe mass to the total gas mass increases by a factor of at most ∼1.44 when NDAFs are taken into account. We find that by including NDAF in our models, the agreement with the observed metallicity distribution of metal-poor stars in the solar neighborhood (<1 kpc) is improved while not significantly altering the location of the metallicity peak. This inclusion can also reproduce the observed evolutionary change of [Mg/Fe] at [Fe/H] ∼ −1.22, bringing the ratio to match the solar abundance. Our results provide an extensive understanding of metallicity evolution in solar environments by highlighting the nucleosynthesis contribution of NDAF outflows in the solar neighborhood.

<div> 前景窄线射电星系，背景亚毫米星系，MMT/Binospec，Hubble Space Telescope，Chandra。

领先的狭窄射线射电星系（“星系A”，zA = 0.6850）镜像了一个背景亚毫米星系（zSMG = 2.221）的罕见情况。MMT/Binospec的新光谱证实了伴星系（“星系B”）是镜像系统的一部分，其zB = 0.6835。Hubble Space Telescope的新的三色数据显示完整的爱因斯坦环，并允许更精确的透镜模型。新的HST图像还显示了星系A周围的扩展发射，光谱显示出不规则形态的扩展[O ii]发射和复杂的速度结构。所有迹象表明，两个透镜星系是一个引力相互作用的对。星系A和B的强烈[O ii]发射表明目前有恒星形成，这可能是相互作用的结果。这表明比以前假设的更年轻的恒星群，并暗示了相同亮度的较小恒星质量。改进的透镜模型和扩展的光谱能够更好地估算前景星系的恒星质量。由此得出的暗物质部分约为0.8，比以前计算的要高。更深入的Chandra成像显示了扩展的X射线发射，但没有证据表明与任何星系相关的X射线点源。从3C 220.3的射电叶发射检测出X射线，估计叶中磁场约为3 nT，这是典型射电星系的平衡场的大约3倍。 <br /><br />总结: 3C 220.3系统是一个罕见的案例，其中前景窄线射电星系镜像了一个背景亚毫米星系。透镜模型经过改进，能够更好地估算前景星系的恒星质量，得出的暗物质部分约为0.8。而深入的Chandra成像显示了扩展的X射线发射，但没有与任何星系相关的X射线点源。 <div>
The 3C 220.3 system is a rare case of a foreground narrow-line radio galaxy (“galaxy A,” zA = 0.6850) lensing a background submillimeter galaxy (zSMG = 2.221). New spectra from MMT/Binospec confirm that the companion galaxy (“galaxy B”) is part of the lensing system with zB = 0.6835. New three-color Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data reveal a full Einstein ring and allow a more precise lens model. The new HST images also reveal extended emission around galaxy A, and the spectra show extended [O ii] emission with irregular morphology and complex velocity structure. All indications are that the two lensing galaxies are a gravitationally interacting pair. Strong [O ii] emission from both galaxies A and B suggests current star formation, which could be a consequence of the interaction. This would indicate a younger stellar population than previously assumed and imply smaller stellar masses for the same luminosity. The improved lens model and expanded spectral energy distributions have enabled better stellar mass estimates for the foreground galaxies. The resulting dark matter fractions are ∼0.8, which are higher than previously calculated. Deeper Chandra imaging shows extended X-ray emission but no evidence for an X-ray point source associated with either galaxy. The detection of X-rays from the radio lobes of 3C 220.3 allows an estimate of ∼3 nT for the magnetic fields in the lobes, a factor of ∼3 below the equipartition fields, as is typical for radio galaxies.

Enzo-N是一个GPU加速的混合流体/ N体模拟代码，旨在同时模拟星团和宿主星系的挑战。该代码通过利用半静态背景加速度近似，将直接N体模拟代码（Nbody6++GPU）集成到宇宙学（磁）流体动力学代码（Enzo）中。Enzo-N成功地模拟了星团和宿主星系的共同演化，捕捉到了星团的核心坍缩和由于星系引力潮汐而发生的潮汐剥离等现象。这一全面的框架为研究星团在星系中的演化提供了新的可能性，提供了以前无法获得的见解。

Enzo-N是一个GPU加速的混合流体/ N体模拟代码，通过半静态背景加速度近似成功地模拟了星团和宿主星系的共同演化。 Enzo-N的创新之处在于将直接N体模拟代码集成到宇宙学（磁）流体动力学代码中，捕捉了星团的核心坍缩和潮汐剥离等重要现象。这一全面的框架为研究星团在星系中的演化提供了新的可能性，提供了以前无法获得的见解。 <div>
We introduce a GPU-accelerated hybrid hydro/N-body code (Enzo-N) designed to address the challenges of concurrently simulating star clusters and their parent galaxies. This task has been exceedingly challenging, primarily due to the considerable computational time required, which stems from the substantial scale difference between galaxies (∼0.1 Mpc) and star clusters (∼parsecs). Yet, this significant scale separation means that particles within star clusters perceive those outside the star cluster in a semistationary state. By leveraging this aspect, we integrate a direct N-body code (Nbody6++GPU) into a cosmological (magneto)hydrodynamic code (Enzo) through utilization of the semistationary background acceleration approximation. We solve the dynamics of particles within star clusters using a direct N-body solver with regularization for few-body interactions, while evolving particles outside—dark matter, gas, and stars—using a particle-mesh gravity solver and hydrodynamic methods. We demonstrate that Enzo-N successfully simulates the coevolution of star clusters and their parent galaxies, capturing phenomena such as core collapse of the star cluster and tidal stripping due to galactic tides. This comprehensive framework opens up new possibilities for studying the evolution of star clusters within galaxies, offering insights that were previously inaccessible.

总结:<br />
这篇文章讨论了在最冷的棕矮星和外行星上，水必须凝结成冰云的问题。研究发现，云的性质受复杂微物理过程的影响，但这些复杂性通常无法被气候模型或检索模型中使用的简单参数化云模型所捕获。为了解决这一问题，研究者将微物理云模拟和一维气候模拟相结合，以将微物理模型的见解纳入一个自洽的参数化云模型中。研究结果表明，将微物理知识纳入参数化云模型可以更好地生成未来冷的次恒星对象的水云模型。 <div>
Water must condense into ice clouds in the coldest brown dwarfs and exoplanets. When they form, these icy clouds change the emergent spectra, temperature structure, and albedo of the substellar atmosphere. The properties of clouds are governed by complex microphysics but these complexities are often not captured by the simpler parameterized cloud models used in climate models or retrieval models. Here, we combine microphysical cloud modeling and 1D climate modeling to incorporate insights from microphysical models into a self-consistent, parameterized cloud model. Using the 1D Community Aerosol and Radiation Model for Atmospheres (CARMA), we generate microphysical water clouds and compare their properties with those from the widely used EddySed cloud model for a grid of Y dwarfs. We find that the mass of water condensate in our CARMA water clouds is significantly limited by available condensation nuclei; in models without additional seed particles for clouds added, the atmosphere becomes supersaturated. We incorporate water latent heat release in the convective and radiative parts of the atmosphere and find no significant impact on water-ice cloud formation for typical gas giant compositions. Our analysis reveals the CARMA cloud profiles have a gradual decrease in opacity of approximately 4% per bar below the cloud base. Incorporating this gradual cloud base falloff and a variable fsed parameter allows spectra generated from the parameterized Eddysed model to better match those of the microphysical CARMA model. This work provides recommendations for efficiently generating microphysically informed water clouds for future models of cold substellar objects with H/He atmospheres.

总结:<br />
该研究通过测量M82的星系晕端星形成结束时间（t90）和金属丰度（[M/H]）以及NGC 3077的东部潮汐尾的特征，来验证M82是否具有真正的星系晕，确定NGC 3077的潮汐破碎是否与星形成历史有关，以及创建M81星系群中心三个星系的组装历史时间表。研究结果表明，M82具有一个真正的金属贫瘠星系晕，形成于约66亿年前的一个小卫星星系的合并过程。NGC 3077潮汐尾中的恒星形成在与M81之前，且金属丰度大致均匀，表明NGC 3077的原型具有显著的人群梯度。最后，该研究呈现了中心三星系的并购/相互作用历史时间表。 <div>
Mergers of and interactions between galaxies imprint a wide diversity of morphological, dynamical, and chemical characteristics in stellar halos and tidal streams. Measuring these characteristics elucidates aspects of the progenitors of the galaxies we observe today. The M81 group is the perfect galaxy group to understand the past, present, and future of a group of galaxies in the process of merging. Here, we measure the end of star formation (t90) and metallicity ([M/H]) of the stellar halo of M82 and the eastern tidal stream of NGC 3077 to: (1) test the idea that M82 possesses a genuine stellar halo, formed before any interaction with M81; (2) determine if NGC 3077's tidal disruption is related to the star formation history in its tails; and (3) create a timeline of the assembly history of the central trio in the M81 group. We argue that M82 possesses a genuine, metal-poor ([M/H] ∼ −1.62 dex) stellar halo, formed from the merger of a small satellite galaxy roughly 6.6 Gyr ago. We also find that the stars present in NGC 3077's tails formed before tidal disruption with M81, and possess a roughly uniform metallicity as shown in S. Okamoto et al., implying that NGC 3077's progenitor had significant population gradients. Finally, we present a timeline of the central trio’s merger/interaction history.

<div> 频率选择，天空遮蔽，Planck 2018温度数据，透镜异常，宇宙学模型

总结：<br /><br />这篇文章重新审视了Planck 2018年温度（TT）数据中的透镜异常，并检查了其对频率选择和额外天空遮蔽的稳健性。研究的主要发现包括：（1）现象学的透镜振幅参数AL随黄道纬度变化，在黄道附近有AL>1的2.9σ偏好，在黄道极附近有1.0σ偏好，这种行为主要源自或完全源自217 GHz，暗示了一些非随机效应。 （2）217 GHz的TT数据也显示出比较低频率更强的AL>1的偏好。从217 GHz数据中剔除银河尘埃遮罩后的AL变化过大，不能仅仅用统计波动来解释，表明与前景处理有关。总体来看，Planck AL异常并非单一简单原因所致。从217 GHz TT数据中删除后，AL>1的偏好降至1.8σ。低多极（ℓ < 30）的TT数据通过与ΛCDM参数的相关性贡献了AL>1的偏好。在ℓ≥30时，100和143 GHz的数据对AL>1的偏好达到1.3σ，且在我们进行的遮蔽测试中似乎很稳健。透镜异常可能影响对替代宇宙学模型的拟合。通过对Planck TT谱线可选地应用AL边缘化可以检查这一点。提出用于解决宇宙学张力的模型应对Planck 217 GHz TT数据的剔除具有稳健性。 <div>
We revisit the lensing anomaly in the Planck 2018 temperature (TT) data and examine its robustness to frequency selection and additional sky masking. Our main findings are as follows. (1) The phenomenological lensing amplitude parameter, AL, varies with ecliptic latitude, with a 2.9σ preference for AL > 1 near the ecliptic and 1.0σ preference near the ecliptic poles, compared to 2.5σ on the original masks. This behavior is largely or solely from 217 GHz and suggestive of some nonrandom effect, given the Planck scan strategy. (2) The 217 GHz TT data also show a stronger preference for AL > 1 than the lower frequencies. The shifts in AL from 217 GHz with additional Galactic dust masking are too large to be explained solely by statistical fluctuations, indicating some connection with the foreground treatment. Overall, the Planck AL anomaly does not have a single simple cause. Removing the 217 GHz TT data leaves a 1.8σ preference for AL > 1. The low-multipole (ℓ < 30) TT data contribute to the preference for AL > 1 through correlations with ΛCDM parameters. The 100 and 143 GHz data at ℓ ≥ 30 prefer AL > 1 at 1.3σ, and this appears robust to the masking tests we performed. The lensing anomaly may impact fits to alternative cosmological models. Marginalizing over AL, optionally applied only to Planck TT spectra, can check this. Models proposed to address cosmological tensions should be robust to removal of the Planck 217 GHz TT data.

The first generations of stars left their chemical fingerprints on metal-poor stars in the Milky Way and its surrounding dwarf galaxies. While instantaneous and homogeneous enrichment implies that groups of conatal stars should have the same element abundances, small amplitudes of abundance scatter are seen at fixed [Fe/H]. Measurements of intrinsic abundance scatter have been made with small high-resolution spectroscopic data sets where measurement uncertainty is small compared to this scatter. In this work, we present a method to use mid-resolution survey data, which have larger errors, to make this measurement. Using APOGEE Data Release 17, we calculate the intrinsic scatter of Al, O, Mg, Si, Ti, Ni, and Mn relative to Fe for 333 metal-poor stars across six classical dwarf galaxies around the Milky Way, and 1604 stars across 19 globular clusters (GCs). We calibrate the reported abundance errors in bins of signal-to-noise ratio and [Fe/H] using a high-fidelity halo data set. Applying these calibrated errors to the APOGEE data, we find small amplitudes of average intrinsic abundance scatter in dwarf galaxies ranging from 0.03 to 0.09 dex, with a median value of 0.047 dex. For the GCs, we find intrinsic scatters ranging from 0.01 to 0.11 dex, with particularly high scatter for Al and O. Our measurements of intrinsic abundance scatter place important upper bounds, which are limited by our calibration, on the intrinsic scatter in these systems, as well as constraints on their underlying star formation history and mixing that we can look to simulations to interpret.

IC 10 X-1 is one of the close X-ray binaries containing a Wolf–Rayet donor, which can provide an evolutionary link between high-mass X-ray binaries and gravitational wave sources. It is still unclear about the precise nature of the accreting compact object in IC 10 X-1, although it looks more like a black hole (BH) than a neutron star. In this work, we use a binary population synthesis method to simulate the formation of IC 10 X-1–like binaries by assuming different common-envelope ejection efficiencies. This work represents a big step forward over previous studies since we adopt new criteria for mass-transfer stability. These criteria allow the formation of IC 10 X-1–like systems without experiencing common envelope evolution. Based on our calculations, we propose that the compact object in IC 10 X-1 is a BH with a mass of ∼10–30 M⊙ and the progenitor evolution of this binary probably just experienced stable mass transfer.

We perform the asteroseismic fitting of four DAVs using a grid of WDEC models with chemical profiles that closely mimic those of the LPCODE models and compare them with published asteroseismic fitting results using the LPCODE. These four objects are KIC 11911480, J113655.17+040952.6, KIC 4552982, and GD 1212. The similarities in the results in those controlled experiments point to a consistency in the models. Given similar input, the LPCODE and the WDEC make similar models and calculate similar periods. We further perform the asteroseismic fitting of the same four DAVs by relaxing the constraints on the chemical profiles. We explore the effects of different methods for weighing the modes when calculating the goodness of fit of the models, as well as the effect of only including a subset of the known period spectrum. Such numerical experiments can help place recent and future efforts in the pipeline fitting of numerous DAVs and DBVs using the WDEC on a firmer footing.

<div> 关键词: 小麦云，红巨星分支，绝对校准，SARGs，变化性<br />
总结:<br />这篇文章研究了小麦云红巨星分支（TRGB）的绝对校准，使用了光学引力透镜实验（OGLE）分类的小幅度红巨星（SARGs）。研究表明，所有接近小麦云TRGB的星都是SARGs。通过区分A序列和B序列的年长和年轻红巨星，研究发现小麦云和大麦云的SARG族群存在许多相似之处，但也有显著的差异。利用变化性导出的信息，揭示了小麦云的年龄和金属丰度梯度，并表明其核心由年轻、金属丰富的红巨星组成。B序列提供了最明亮和最准确的校准（MF814W，syn = -4.057 ± 0.019(stat.) ± 0.029(syst.) mag），用于测量云彩之间的距离模数差异并研究金属度效应。未使用变化性信息的距离测量应采用基于靠近分支的所有星的SARG校准（MF814W，syn = -4.024 ± 0.041（stat.）± 0.029（syst.）mag）。这项工作强调红巨星群体多样性对TRGB距离测量的影响，需要进一步研究以揭示这些影响并改进TRGB标准化。 <div>
We investigate the absolute calibration of the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) using small amplitude red giant stars (SARGs) classified by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE). We show that all stars near the SMC’s TRGB are SARGs. Distinguishing older and younger RGs near the tip according to two period–luminosity sequences labeled A and B, we show many similarities among SARG populations of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the SMC, along with notable differences. In particular, SMC SARGs have shorter periods due to lower metallicity and smaller amplitudes due to younger ages than LMC SARGs. We discover two period–color relations near the TRGB that span all A-sequence and B-sequence stars in the OGLE-III footprints of the SMC and LMC, and we investigate using periods instead of color for TRGB standardization. Using variability-derived information only, we trace the SMC’s age and metallicity gradients and show the core to be populated by younger, more metal-rich RGs. The B-sequence yields the brightest and most accurate calibration (MF814W,syn = −4.057 ± 0.019(stat.) ± 0.029(syst.) mag), which we use to measure the distance modulus difference between the Clouds and investigate metallicity effects. Distance measurements not informed by variability should employ the SARG-based calibration based on all stars near the tip (MF814W,syn = −4.024 ± 0.041(stat.) ± 0.029(syst.) mag). Our work highlights the impact of RG population diversity on TRGB distance measurements. Further study is needed to unravel these effects and improve TRGB standardization.

Because the anomalous Balmer decrements are not reproduced under the Case B recombination, we explore the nebulae with optical depths smaller and larger than the Case B recombination by physical modeling. We find two cases quantitatively explaining the anomalies: (1) density-bounded nebulae that are opaque only up to around Lyγ–Ly8 transitions and (2) ionization-bounded nebulae partly/fully surrounded by optically thick excited H i clouds. The case of (1) produces more Hβ photons via Lyγ absorption in the nebulae, requiring fine tuning in optical depth values, while this case helps ionizing photon escape for cosmic reionization. The case of (2) needs the optically thick excited Hi clouds with N2 ≃ 1012−1013 cm−2, where N2 is the column density of the hydrogen atom with the principal quantum number of n = 2. Interestingly, the high N2 values qualitatively agree with the recent claims for GS-NDG-9422 with the strong nebular continuum requiring a number of 2s-state electrons and for RXCJ2248-ID with the dense ionized regions likely coexisting with the optically thick clouds. While the physical origin of the optically thick excited H i clouds is unclear, these results may suggest gas clouds with excessive collisional excitation caused by an amount of accretion and supernovae in the high-z galaxies.

<div> 关键词: 大气层，热力锁定，外行星，朝晚各边，交接时间<br />
总结:<br />
本文讨论了大气不均一性对过境时间测量精度的影响，特别是对朝晚各边巨大温差的热力锁定外行星。研究指出，对于James Webb太空望远镜的观测来说，朝晚各边对总体透射光谱的贡献可以在一定情况下被准确分离。然而，大气不均一性与行星交接时间的不确定性之间存在高度重叠，可能导致对于大气不均一性的准确研究。文章推导了一个描述大气不均一性对视为交接时间变化的通用公式，并得出这种变化可能高达十秒。此外，文章还推导了一个关于这种额外数值偏差的分析公式。这些公式可以应用于新观测的计划或解释文献的测量结果，并给出了常见外行星的例子。 <div>
Atmospheres are not spatially homogeneous. This is particularly true for hot, tidally locked exoplanets with large day-to-night temperature variations, which can yield significant differences between the morning and evening terminators—known as limb asymmetry. Current transit observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are precise enough to disentangle the separate contributions of these morning and evening limbs to the overall transmission spectrum in certain circumstances. However, the signature of limb asymmetry in a transit light curve is highly degenerate with uncertainty in the planet’s time of conjunction. This raises the question of how precisely transit times must be measured to enable accurate studies of limb asymmetry, in particular with JWST. Although this degeneracy has been discussed in the literature, a general description of it has not been presented. In this work, we show how this degeneracy results from apparent changes in the transit contact times when the planetary disk has asymmetric limb sizes. We derive a general formula relating the magnitude of limb asymmetry to the amount by which it would cause the apparent time of conjunction to vary, which can reach tens of seconds. Comparing our formula to simulated observations, we find that numerical fitting techniques add additional bias to the measured time, of generally less than a second, resulting from the occultation geometry. We also derive an analytical formula for this extra numerical bias. These formulae can be applied to planning new observations or interpreting literature measurements, and we show examples for commonly studied exoplanets.

The intricate behavior of particle acceleration and transport mechanisms complicates the overall efforts in formulating a comprehensive understanding of solar energetic particle (SEP) events; these efforts include observations of low-energy particles (from tens of keV to hundreds of MeV) by space-borne instruments and measurements by the ground-based neutron monitors of the secondary particles generated in the Earth atmosphere by SEPs in the GeV range. Numerous space-borne missions provided good data on the nature/characteristics of these solar particles in past solar cycles, but more recently—concurrently with the rise toward the maximum of solar cycle 25—the High-Energy Particle Detector (HEPD-01) proved to be well suited for the study of solar physics and space weather. Its nominal 30–300 MeV energy range for protons can enlarge the detection capabilities of solar particles at low Earth orbit, closer to the injection limit of many SEP events. In this work, we characterize three SEP events within the first six months of 2022 through spectral and velocity dispersion analysis, assessing the response of HEPD-01 to >M1 events.

<title>Anisotropies of 40–139 keV Ions Measured beyond the Termination Shock and in the Very Local Interstellar Medium</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We analyze the count rates of 40–139 keV ions that were measured in situ by the Low Energy Charged Particle instrument on Voyager 1 in order to identify the suprathermal ion anisotropies beyond the termination shock and in the very local interstellar (IS) medium (VLISM). The analysis results in a region of ∼9–10 au before the heliopause (HP) where the radial anisotropy of ions is negative, while the azimuthal ion anisotropy inside the heliosheath lies in the −T direction. In agreement to our previous analyses, we identify a positive radial anisotropy of ions up to at least ∼30 au beyond the HP, which becomes nearly zero from 2021 up to 2023 November (for ∼10 au). Notably, the anisotropy in the azimuthal direction is statistically zero throughout the upstream region, i.e., for ∼40 au past the HP, showing that the 40–139 keV ion anisotropy in the VLISM is only in the radial direction and has no azimuthal component. The presence of suprathermal ions of solar origin over such long spatial scales in the VLISM, along with the inflow of ions from IS space into the heliosheath, are important constraints for characterizing the interaction of the heliosheath with the VLISM. Our observations provide indications that V1 has entered a new regime in the VLISM since (at least) the year 2021, progressively developing characteristics akin to the pristine IS medium. Alternatively, this drop to nearly zero radial anisotropies beyond 2021 could be a manifestation of a prolonged compression/shock of solar origin.

<title>Very Extended Ionized Gas Discovered around NGC 1068 with the Circumgalactic Hα Spectrograph</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We have performed wide-field, ultra-low-surface-brightness Hα emission-line mapping around NGC 1068 with the newly commissioned Circumgalactic Hα Spectrograph. NGC 1068 is notable for its active galactic nucleus, which globally ionizes gas in the disk and halo. Line-emitting diffuse ionized gas is distributed throughout the galactic disk and large-scale ionized filaments are found well beyond the disk, aligned with the cone angle of the central jet. We report the discovery of a new ribbon of ionized gas around NGC 1068 beyond even the known outer filamentary structure, located 20 kpc from the galaxy. The Hα surface brightness of this ribbon is on the order of the bright telluric lines, ranging from 4 to 16 R, with fainter regions on the order of the sky background continuum. Unlike previous extended emission, the ribbon is not as well aligned with the current axis of the central jet. It is not associated with any galactic structure or known tidal features in the halo of NGC 1068, though it may originate from a larger distribution of unmapped neutral atomic or molecular gas in the halo. The morphology of the ribbon emission in Hα is correlated with extended UV emission around NGC 1068. Hα-to-UV flux ratios in the ribbon are comparable to extended emission-line ratios in the halos of NGC 5128, NGC 253, and M82. The Hα excess in the ribbon gas suggests ionization by slow shocks or a mixture of in situ star formation and photoionization and collisional ionization processes.

这篇研究模拟了太阳耀斑极紫外晚期阶段对电离层电子密度的影响，使用了真实观测到的2012年10月23日X1.8级耀斑的太阳光谱驱动离子层-热层耦合模型。全球总电子含量（TEC）的观测和模拟显示，在极紫外晚期，白天电离层的TEC增加超过了耀斑主要阶段。研究还检验了模型在具有极紫外晚期的耀斑中的性能。结果显示，F层电子密度增强和恢复不能以与极紫外晚期的时间变化相同的速度变化，并且极紫外晚期的存在延长了电子密度的恢复约9小时。研究还发现，电子密度增强主要由化学产生决定，而电子密度的恢复主要受电场输运效应控制。这项研究加深了对地球空间环境和太阳耀斑极紫外晚期事件中类似行星系统的复杂物理和光化学过程的理解。

<br /><br />总结: 
1. 研究模拟了太阳耀斑极紫外晚期对电离层电子密度的影响
2. 使用真实观测到的太阳光谱驱动模型进行了研究
3. 结果显示极紫外晚期比耀斑主要阶段更能影响白天电离层的电子密度

5. 电子密度的增强主要受化学产生影响，而恢复主要受电场输运效应控制。 <div>
Effects of the extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) late phase of solar flares on the ionosphere were rarely studied. Here we simulated such effects on the ionospheric electron density using an ionosphere−thermosphere coupled model driven by the realistic solar spectrum observed during the X1.8 flare on 2012 October 23. Global total electron content (TEC) observations and simulations showed that the dayside ionospheric TEC during the EUV late phase increased more than that of the flare’s main phase. We examined the performance of the model for flares with EUV late phase. The results showed that the F-region electron density enhancement and recovery did not vary in the same pace as the temporal variations of the EUV late phase, and the presence of the EUV late phase prolonged the recovery of electron density by ∼9 hr. We also found that the enhancement in electron density was mainly determined by the chemical production, while the recovery of electron density was primarily controlled by the electric field transport effects. This study enhanced understanding of the intricate physical and photochemical processes governing Earth’s space environment and similar planetary systems during solar flare events with EUV late phase.

<div> 关键词: heliospheric current sheets, Voyager 2, solar maximum periods, magnetic reconnection, Parker spiral field

总结: 
本研究利用2008年至2018年间Voyager 2探测器的观测数据，对太阳风层中的赤道面电流片（HCSs）进行了分析。通过严格的标准，共发现了34个HCSs，这些变化表明磁极性发生了显著变化。这些现象在太阳活动最大期间更为普遍，当HCS扩展到较高的纬度时，与太空飞船平均定位在太阳赤道平面以南31°的纬度相吻合。我们确定了识别的HCS大尺度结构的某些特征。最重要的是，使用两种不同的方法表明，在太阳风层中HCS的厚度范围在0.003到0.4天文单位（au），平均厚度约为0.03到0.1 au，具体取决于事件选择和拟合技术。这个厚度超过了1 au或其他太阳风层距离时所知的厚度。这也明显比典型的质子惯性长度厚，暗示了磁重联的不利条件。此外，我们的分析揭示了HCS平面相对于太阳赤道平面的频繁倾斜，倾斜角度可高达数十度，可能意味着HCS在太阳风层内部常见的扭曲结构。从纵向上看，HCS平面与太阳风层中预期的Parker螺旋场方向紧密对齐。最后，对于识别的HCS事件的大部分，HCS平面可能具有旋转不连续性。这些发现在本研究中使用的1小时分辨率数据的限制范围内是有效的。 <div>
In this paper, we conducted an analysis of the heliospheric current sheets (HCSs) in the heliosheath (HS), utilizing observations by Voyager 2 between 2008 and 2018. Employing rigorous criteria, we identified a total of 34 HCSs that indicate significant changes in magnetic polarity. These occurrences were more prevalent during solar maximum periods when the HCS expanded to higher latitudes, coinciding with the spacecraft positioned at an average latitude of −31° from the solar equator. We determined certain features of the large-scale structures of the identified HCSs. Most importantly, employing two distinct methods indicates that the thickness of the HCSs within the HS ranges from ∼0.003 to ∼0.4 au with an average thickness of ∼0.03 to ∼0.1 au, depending on methods of event selection and fitting techniques. This thickness surpasses that known near 1 au or other heliospheric distances. It is also notably thicker than the typical proton inertial length, implying unfavorable conditions for magnetic reconnection. Additionally, our analysis reveals a frequent tilt of HCS planes relative to the solar equatorial plane by a varying angle up to several tens of degrees, likely implying a common occurrence of a warped structure of the HCS within the HS. Longitudinally, the HCS planes closely align with the Parker spiral field direction expected in the HS. Finally, for a large fraction of the identified HCS events, the HCS planes are likely characterized by a rotational discontinuity. These findings are valid within the limits of the 1 hr resolution data used in this study.

<div> 快速射电暴，窄带谱，角尺寸，多普勒效应，等离子体透镜

FRB的一些观测显示，它们的频谱非常窄，即Δν/ν0 ≪ 1。当射电暴的发射区域的角尺寸大于多普勒束缚角时，由于高纬度效应，观测到的谱宽(Δν/ν0)超过0.58，即使在源点的共动框架中谱线很窄。对于FRB的磁层模型，源的角尺寸可以小于多普勒束缚角，这种几何效应不会影响观测到的带宽。我们讨论了各种传播效应，以确定是否有任何可能将宽频谱射电脉冲转换为观测者位置的窄频谱信号。我们发现等离子体透镜和涟漪效应可能导致观测频谱的窄带宽。然而，在观测到的大量FRB样本中，具有Δν/ν0 < 0.58的窄谱观测谱的现象产生的可能性非常小。

<br /><br />总结：
本研究发现，一些快速射电暴具有极窄的频谱，即Δν/ν0 ≪ 1。在射电暴的发射区域的角尺寸大于多普勒束缚角时，由于高纬度效应，观测到的谱宽(Δν/ν0)超过0.58。磁层模型下，源的角尺寸可以小于多普勒束缚角。等离子体透镜和涟漪效应可能导致观测频谱的窄带宽。然而，在大量FRB样本中，出现具有Δν/ν0 < 0.58的窄谱观测谱的可能性非常小。 <div>
Observations find that some fast radio bursts (FRBs) have extremely narrowband spectra, i.e., Δν/ν0 ≪ 1. We show that, when the angular size of the emission region is larger than the Doppler beaming angle, the observed spectral width (Δν/ν0) exceeds 0.58 due to the high-latitude effects for a source outside the magnetosphere, even when the spectrum in the source’s comoving frame is monochromatic. The angular size of the source for magnetospheric models of FRBs can be smaller than the Doppler beaming angle, in which case this geometric effect does not influence the observed bandwidth. We discuss various propagation effects to determine if any could transform a broad-spectrum radio pulse into a narrow spectrum signal at the observer’s location. We find that plasma lensing and scintillation can result in a narrow bandwidth in the observed spectrum. However, the likelihood of these phenomena being responsible for the narrow observed spectra with Δν/ν0 < 0.58 in the fairly large observed sample of FRBs is exceedingly small.

GRB的射电传输计算对于理解射流、紧凑天体和宇宙学具有重要意义，但其即时发射的不完全了解限制了其作为这些现象探测的应用。存在许多模型可解释伽玛射线和X射线能量范围内对GRB的各种观测，但这些模型缺乏对将来电磁谱观测的预测能力。本研究利用MCRaT辐射传输代码计算了两个长GRB的独特流体动力学模拟对应的X射线光谱偏振特征。我们进行了X射线和伽玛射线的时分辨和时间综合对比，揭示了X射线即时发射特征所能提供的信息。研究结果显示，从X射线光曲线导出的T90是最好的诊断中心引擎活动时间的方法。我们还发现我们的模拟复现了Einstein探测器探测到的GRB 240315C的特征。基于我们的模拟，我们还能对未来的X射线光谱测量进行预测。我们的结果表明进行GRB射流全局辐射传输计算对于更好地理解即时发射观测，并约束产生即时发射的机制至关重要。<br /><br />总结: GRB的即时发射具有重要意义，在不完全了解的情况下通过X射线光谱偏振特征进行计算和预测，可以更好地理解其特征和限制即时发射的机制。 <div>
While gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have the potential to shed light on the astrophysics of jets, compact objects, and cosmology, a major set back in their use as probes of these phenomena stems from our incomplete knowledge surrounding their prompt emission. There are numerous models that can account for various observations of GRBs in the gamma-ray and X-ray energy ranges, due to the flexibility in the number of parameters that can be tuned to increase agreement with data. Furthermore, these models lack predictive power that can test future spectropolarimetric observations of GRBs across the electromagnetic spectrum. In this work, we use the MCRaT radiative transfer code to calculate the X-ray spectropolarimetric signatures expected from the photospheric model for two unique hydrodynamic simulations of long GRBs. We make time-resolved and time-integrated comparisons between the X-ray and gamma-ray mock observations, shedding light on the information that can be obtained from X-ray prompt emission signatures. Our results show that the T90 derived from the X-ray light curve is the best diagnostic for the time that the central engine is active. We also find that our simulations reproduce the observed characteristics of the Einstein Probe–detected GRB 240315C. Based on our simulations, we are also able to make predictions for future X-ray spectropolarimetric measurements. Our results show the importance of conducting global radiative transfer calculations of GRB jets to better contextualize the prompt emission observations and constrain the mechanisms that produce the prompt emission.

We present an enhanced version of the publicly available Stripe 82X catalog (S82-XL), featuring a comprehensive set of 22,737 unique X-ray point sources identified with a significance ≳4σ. This catalog is four times larger than the original Stripe 82X catalog, by including additional archival data from the Chandra and XMM-Newton telescopes. Now covering ∼54.8 deg2 of nonoverlapping sky area, the S82-XL catalog roughly doubles the area and depth of the original catalog, with limiting fluxes (half-area fluxes) of 3.4 × 10−16 (2.4 × 10−15), 2.9 × 10−15 (1.5 × 10−14), and 1.4 × 10−15 (9.5 × 10−15) erg s−1 cm−2 across the soft (0.5–2 keV), hard (2–10 keV), and full (0.5–10 keV) bands, respectively. S82-XL occupies a unique region of flux-area parameter space compared to other X-ray surveys, identifying sources with rest-frame luminosities from 1.2 × 1038 to 1.6 × 1047 erg s−1 in the 2–10 keV band (median X-ray luminosity, 7.2 × 1043 erg s−1), and spectroscopic redshifts up to z ∼ 6. By using hardness ratios, we derived the obscuration of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), obtaining a median value of and an overall, obscured fraction ( ) of ∼36.9%. S82-XL serves as a benchmark in X-ray surveys and, with its extensive multiwavelength data, is especially valuable for comprehensive studies of luminous AGNs.

We propose an analytic dual-cone accretion model for horizon-scale images of the cores of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei, including those observed by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). Our model is of synchrotron emission from an axisymmetric, magnetized plasma, constrained to flow within two oppositely oriented cones that are aligned with the black hole’s spin axis. We show this model can accurately reproduce images of a variety of time-averaged general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations and that it accurately recovers the black hole spin, orientation, emission scale height, peak emission radius, and fluid flow direction from these simulations within a Bayesian inference framework using radio interferometric data. We show that nontrivial topologies in the images of relativistic accretion flows around black holes can result in nontrivial multimodal solutions when applied to observations with a sparse array, such as the EHT 2017 observations of M87*. The presence of these degeneracies underscores the importance of employing Bayesian techniques to adequately sample the posterior space for the interpretation of EHT measurements. We fit our model to the EHT observations of M87* and find a 95% highest posterior density interval for the mass-to-distance ratio of θg ∈ (2.84, 3.75) μas, and give an inclination of θo ∈ (11°, 24°). These new measurements are consistent with mass measurements from the EHT and stellar dynamical estimates and with the spin axis inclination inferred from properties of the M87* jet.

<div> 重复快速射电爆发，X射线和无线电观测，FRB 20220912A，X射线和无线电数据，观测方法，观测结果<br /><br />总结:
本研究对重复快速射电爆发源FRB 20220912A进行了为期8周的X射线和无线电观测。观测结果显示，在30次射电爆发期间未检测到显著的X射线发射，并且根据推断，X射线与射电的能量比值(ηx/r)小于7 × 10^6。此外，在FRB 20220912A的位置上也未观测到持续的X射线发射。研究还提出了一种层次化方法，可结合多次观测数据，得出了截至目前关于FRB ηx/r的最佳上界。最后，如果采用类似于2020年4月28日观测到的银河磁星SGR 1935+2154的X射线谱，将得出ηx/r的上界为8 × 10^5，仅为SGR 1935+2154观测到的ηx/r的3倍。 <div>
We present an extensive contemporaneous X-ray and radio campaign performed on the repeating fast radio burst (FRB) source FRB 20220912A for 8 weeks immediately following the source’s detection by CHIME/FRB. This includes X-ray data from XMM-Newton, NICER, and Swift, and radio detections of FRB 20220912A from CHIME/Pulsar and Effelsberg. We detect no significant X-ray emission at the time of 30 radio bursts with upper limits on a 0.5–10.0 keV X-ray fluence of (1.5–14.5) × 10−10 erg cm−2 (99.7% credible interval, unabsorbed) on a timescale of 100 ms. Translated into a fluence ratio ηx/r = FX-ray/Fradio, this corresponds to ηx/r < 7 × 106. For persistent emission from the location of FRB 20220912A, we derive a 99.7% 0.5–10.0 keV isotropic flux limit of 8.8 × 10−15 erg cm−2 s−1 (unabsorbed) or an isotropic luminosity limit of 1.4 × 1041 erg s−1 at a distance of 362.4 Mpc. We derive a hierarchical extension to the standard Bayesian treatment of low-count and background-contaminated X-ray data, which allows the robust combination of multiple observations. This methodology allows us to place the best (lowest) 99.7% credible interval upper limit on an FRB ηx/r to date, ηx/r < 2 × 106, assuming that all 30 detected radio bursts are associated with X-ray bursts with the same fluence ratio. If we instead adopt an X-ray spectrum similar to the X-ray burst observed contemporaneously with FRB-like emission from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154 detected on 2020 April 28, we derive a 99.7% credible interval upper limit on ηx/r of 8 × 105, which is only 3 times the observed value of ηx/r for SGR 1935+2154.

<br />
这篇文章介绍了一种不依赖红移信息并仍具有与依赖红移信息的分类器相当精度的SN光度曲线光度分类器Superphot+。他们使用了一个参数模型来从多波段SN光度曲线中提取有意义的特征，并训练了一个梯度提升机。在没有红移信息的情况下，分类器的F1分数为0.61，总精度为0.83。在加入红移信息后，这些指标分别提高到0.71和0.88。他们还为3558个没有经过光谱分类但显示出SN特征的ZTF瞬变现象分配了新的类别概率。最后，他们将他们的预测的SN标签与ALeRCE光度曲线分类器生成的标签进行了比较，发现两个分类器在光谱标签的光曲线上达成82%的一致性，而在没有光谱标签的光曲线上达成72%的一致性。Superphot+目前通过ANTARES Broker实时对ZTF SNe进行分类，并设计用于未来对六波段的Rubin光度曲线的简单适应。

Photometric classifications of supernova (SN) light curves have become necessary to utilize the full potential of large samples of observations obtained from wide-field photometric surveys, such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. Here, we present a photometric classifier for SN light curves that does not rely on redshift information and still maintains comparable accuracy to redshift-dependent classifiers. Our new package, Superphot+, uses a parametric model to extract meaningful features from multiband SN light curves. We train a gradient-boosted machine with fit parameters from 6061 ZTF SNe that pass data quality cuts and are spectroscopically classified as one of five classes: SN Ia, SN II, SN Ib/c, SN IIn, and SLSN-I. Without redshift information, our classifier yields a class-averaged F1-score of 0.61 ± 0.02 and a total accuracy of 0.83 ± 0.01. Including redshift information improves these metrics to 0.71 ± 0.02 and 0.88 ± 0.01, respectively. We assign new class probabilities to 3558 ZTF transients that show SN-like characteristics (based on the ALeRCE Broker light-curve and stamp classifiers) but lack spectroscopic classifications. Finally, we compare our predicted SN labels with those generated by the ALeRCE light-curve classifier, finding that the two classifiers agree on photometric labels for 82% ± 2% of light curves with spectroscopic labels and 72% ± 0% of light curves without spectroscopic labels. Superphot+ is currently classifying ZTF SNe in real time via the ANTARES Broker, and is designed for simple adaptation to six-band Rubin light curves in the future.

<div> 关键词: 星速度分布，暗物质，高斯混合模型，银河系演化，动力学学习<br />
<br />
本研究利用数值模拟表明星体速度分布与暗物质之间存在相关性。通过高斯混合模型，在化学动力学空间中将来自LAMOST DR8和Gaia DR3的K型巨星分为盘状结构、暗物质晕及各向同性暗物质晕组分。发现暗物质晕的子结构组分在径向上具有很高的各向异性，可能与Gaia–Enceladus–Sausage(GES)并入事件有关，而各向同性暗物质晕组分是接收自最早的并入，并且服从Maxwell–Boltzmann分布(标准暗物质模型[SHM]).研究发现GES样子的子结构组分占据了太阳附近约85%的本地非盘星体数量，这一结果对于不同体积切割和额外角动量约束的应用几乎没有变化。通过利用金属丰度-恒星质量关系和恒星质量-暗物质晕质量关系，我们发现本地暗物质中约有25%存在于这种动力学子结构中。结合非盘组分的恒星分布，我们修正了本地暗物质的太阳系速度分布。与SHM相比，速度降低，峰值更尖锐，更新了暗物质直接探测实验的检测限。本研究还讨论了GMM拟合中存在的退化，并建议未来更多动力学和化学信息，如α丰度，有助于打破这种退化。我们的工作证实了本地暗物质速度分布显著偏离SHM，需要在暗物质探测实验中得到适当的考虑。 <br /><br />总结: 本研究利用高斯混合模型对银河系内的恒星进行动力学学习，发现本地暗物质晕存在着高度的子结构成分，并且这一组分对于本地暗物质速度分布产生了重大影响，需要在暗物质探测实验中加以充分考虑。 <div>
Numerical simulations indicate that correlations exist between the velocity distributions of stars and dark matter (DM). We study the local DM velocity distribution based on these correlations. We select K giants from LAMOST DR8 cross-matched with Gaia DR3, which have robust measurements of velocity and metallicity, and separate them into the disk, halo substructure, and isotropic halo components in the chemodynamical space utilizing the Gaussian mixture model. The substructure component is highly radially anisotropic and possibly related to the Gaia–Enceladus–Sausage (GES) merger event, while the isotropic halo component is accreted from the earliest mergers following the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution (standard halo model [SHM]). We find that the GES-like substructure contributes ∼85% of the local nondisk stars in the solar neighborhood, which is nearly invariant when applying different volume cuts or additional angular momentum constraints. Utilizing the metallicity–stellar mass relation and the stellar mass–halo mass relation, we find that of local DM is in the kinematic substructure. Combined with the stellar distributions of nondisk components, we modify the heliocentric velocity distribution of local DM. It shifts to a lower speed with a sharper peak compared to the SHM and updates the detection limits of DM direct detection experiments. We discuss extensively the degeneracies present in the GMM fitting and propose that more kinematic and chemical information such as α abundance could help to break the degeneracy in the future. Our work confirms that the local DM velocity distribution deviates significantly from the SHM and needs to be properly accounted for in the DM detection experiments.

<div> Athena++, Monte Carlo radiation transfer module, RMHD simulations, super-Eddington accretion, hard X-ray emission
<br />总结:
研究利用Athena++模拟了超艾丁顿吸积率对黑洞的影响，焦点在硬X射线发射上。他们通过MC和RMHD模拟的比较发现，RMHD模拟中的灰色辐射传输模型低估了喷口区域的气体温度，而多能组模拟更符合MC模拟的结果，并产生了硬X射线辐射比灰色模拟更强的后处理光谱。他们还使用MC后处理光谱尝试直接拟合超光源X射线源的观测数据，结果发现第一原理模型可以很好地解释观测到的硬X射线光谱。 <div>
We use the Athena++ Monte Carlo (MC) radiation transfer module to postprocess simulation snapshots from nonrelativistic Athena++ radiation magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) simulations. These simulations were run using a gray (frequency-integrated) approach but were also restarted and ran with a multigroup approach that accounts for Compton scattering with a Kompaneets operator. These simulations produced moderately super-Eddington accretion rates onto a 6.62 M⊙ black hole. Since we only achieve inflow equilibrium out to 20–25 gravitational radii, we focus on the hard X-ray emission. We provide a comparison between the MC and RMHD simulations, showing that the treatment of Compton scattering in the gray RMHD simulations underestimates the gas temperature in the funnel regions above and below the accretion disk. In contrast, the restarted multigroup snapshots provide a treatment for the radiation field that is more consistent with the MC calculations, and result in postprocessed spectra with harder X-ray emission compared to their gray snapshot counterparts. We characterize these MC postprocessed spectra using commonly employed phenomenological spectral fitting models. We also attempt to fit our MC spectra directly to observations of the ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) NGC 1313 X-1, finding best-fit values that are competitive to phenomenological model fits, indicating that first principle models of super-Eddington accretion may adequately explain the observed hard X-ray spectra in some ULX sources.

<div> 黑洞质量，潮撕裂事件，辐射流体动力学模拟，早期发射，气体循环

流体动力学模拟显示，当给定一个超爱丁顿回落速率时，流-流碰撞可以发生多次，并产生高达10^4太阳质量每秒的强流出。这些流出将气体分散到≳100rs，延迟了气体的循环，并导致前几次流-流碰撞期间次爱丁顿的吸积速率。碰撞和循环的冲击可以在数天内维持约10^44尔格每秒的亮度。这个亮度通常是次爱丁顿的，并且在早期与吸积速率呈弱相关。流出是光学厚的，产生一个大小约10^14厘米、光球温度约4×10^4开尔文的辐射层。 <br /><br />总结: 该研究在流体动力学模拟中发现，潮撕裂事件的早期发射和气体循环受到流-流碰撞的影响。在给定的条件下，流-流碰撞可以产生强大的气体流出，并延迟气体的循环。同时，产生的光度通常是次爱丁顿的，并且与吸积速率呈弱相关。产生的光度主要受到流-流碰撞和循环的冲击影响，同时产生的流出是光学厚的，产生辐射层。 <div>
The rising part of a tidal disruption event light curve provides unique insight into early emission and the onset of accretion. Various mechanisms are proposed to explain the pre-peak emission, including shocks from debris interaction and reprocessing of disk emission. We study the pre-peak emission and its influence on the gas circularization by a series of gray radiation hydrodynamic simulations with varying black hole mass. We find that, given a super-Eddington fallback rate of , the stream–stream collision can occur multiple times and drive strong outflows of up to . By dispersing gas to ≳100rs, the outflow can delay gas circularization and leads to sub-Eddington accretion rates during the first few stream–stream collisions. The stream–stream collision shock and circularization shock can sustain a luminosity of ∼1044 erg s−1 for days. The luminosity is generally sub-Eddington and shows a weak correlation with accretion rate at early times. The outflow is optically thick, yielding a reprocessing layer with a size of ∼1014 cm and photospheric temperature of ∼4 × 104 K.

<title>Searching for Bumps in the Cosmological Road: Do Type Ia Supernovae with Early Excesses Have Biased Hubble Residuals?</title>

<div> 关键词: Type Ia supernovae, early-time light curves, excesses, Zwicky Transient Facility, Hubble residuals<br />
总结: <br /><br />这篇文章研究了Type Ia超新星早期光变曲线的多个理论模型和观测到的flux excesses，以及这些过量的影响。作者使用ZTF观测到的SNe Ia的光变曲线进行系统性搜索，发现了17个SNe Ia具有显著的早期过量。研究发现，具有过量的SNe Ia在经过形状、颜色和宿主星系质量的校正后可能具有较低的哈勃残差。作者还比较了具有过量和没有过量的SNe Ia的宿主星系质量，发现它们大致一致，尽管具有过量的SNe Ia可能更倾向于较低质量的宿主星系。这些发现提供了理解SN Ia宇宙学潜在偏见和探索SN Ia前体物理的有效方式。 <div>
Flux excesses in the early-time light curves of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are predicted by multiple theoretical models and have been observed in a number of nearby SNe Ia over the last decade. However, the astrophysical processes that cause these excesses may affect their use as standardizable candles for cosmological parameter measurements. We perform a systematic search for early-time excesses in SNe Ia observed by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) to study whether SNe Ia with these excesses yield systematically different Hubble residuals. We analyze two compilations of SN Ia light curves from ZTF’s first year of operations: 127 high-cadence light curves from Y. Yao et al. and 305 light curves from the ZTF cosmology data release of S. Dhawan et al. We detect significant early-time excesses for 17 SNe Ia in these samples and find that the excesses have a median g − r color of 0.10 ± 0.11 mag; we do not find a clear preference for blue excesses as predicted by several models. Using the SALT3 model, we measure Hubble residuals for these two samples, finding that excess-having SNe Ia may have lower Hubble residuals (HR) after correcting for shape, color, and host-galaxy mass, at ∼2–3σ significance; our baseline result is ΔHR = −0.056 ± 0.026 mag (2.2σ). We compare the host-galaxy masses of excess-having and no-excess SNe Ia and find they are consistent, though at marginal significance excess-having SNe Ia may prefer lower-mass hosts. Additional discoveries of early excess SNe Ia will be a powerful way to understand potential biases in SN Ia cosmology and probe the physics of SN Ia progenitors.

总结: 研究发现，日冕空洞中的羽流形成前会频繁出现小尺度喷射和射流，在其基部逐渐形成羽流薄雾。羽流在其形成后6小时内迅速发展成其熟知的形态，同时显示出多热性质并且在整个寿命内强度变化。此外，羽流的磁场动态与其171 Å的光度曲线高度相关。羽流中存在高温等离子体的内部温度结构。这些结果为我们对羽流的形成、动态和热性质提供了新的见解，从而更紧密地约束了相关模型，深入理解羽流的热力学演化和其在太阳风中的潜在作用。 <br /><br /> <div>
Plumes are considered to play an important role in the origin of the solar wind. However, an understanding of their thermodynamic evolution is not complete. Here, we perform a detailed study of a plume inside a coronal hole throughout its lifetime, using the observations from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly and the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager. We find that the plume’s formation is preceded by frequent occurrences of small-scale jets and jetlets at its base, leading to the gradual development of plume haze. The plume rapidly developed within the first 6 hr into its well-known morphology. Light curves from all extreme ultraviolet channels exhibit a similar profile, suggesting its multithermal nature and intensity modulation over its lifespan. Moreover, the photospheric magnetic field dynamics at the plume’s base are highly correlated with its light curve in 171 Å. We calculate outflow velocities, observed prominently in the 171 Å passband and mildly in the 193 and 211 Å passbands, with median speeds lower in higher temperature bands but occasionally comparable to the respective sound speeds. When data are averaged over larger spatial scales, the plume appears isothermal along its length, with constant temperature throughout its lifetime. However, an analysis of the differential emission measure at full resolution reveals the presence of higher-temperature plasma, indicating internal temperature structures within the plume. These results provide new insights into the formation, dynamics, and thermal properties of coronal plumes, placing tighter constraints on models to understand their thermodynamic evolution and potential role in the solar wind.

总结: 
研究了AT 2022cmc这一近期发现的潮汐撕裂事件，发现其具有明亮的喷流， beg在X射线和射电观测中表现出快速下降的和长时间持续的辐射。通过提出一个涉及具有不同洛伦兹因子的相对论性喷流的多区域模型，系统地研究了快速和慢速喷流在外部密度分布中的演变，考虑了与时间相关的质量回落时间前后的连续能量注入率。研究了快速和慢速喷流正、反冲击区域的时变多波段辐射的自洽性。结果表明能量注入率可以显著影响喷流演变，并随后影响光变曲线。 X射线光谱和光变曲线可以通过更快喷流的反冲击区域的电子同步辐射来描述，其中延迟时间X射线的上限可以解释为喷流的突变。同时，射电观测可以解释为来自更慢喷流的正冲击区域的同步辐射。还讨论了通过当前和未来观测来测试模型的前景。 <div>
AT 2022cmc is a recently documented tidal disruption event that exhibits a luminous jet, accompanied by fast-declining X-ray and long-lasting radio and millimeter emission. Motivated by the distinct spectral and temporal signatures between the X-ray and radio observations, we propose a multizone model involving relativistic jets with different Lorentz factors. We systematically study the evolution of faster and slower jets in an external density profile, considering the continuous energy injection rate associated with time-dependent accretion rates before and after the mass fallback time. We investigate time-dependent multiwavelength emission from both the forward shock (FS) and reverse shock (RS) regions of the fast and slow jets, in a self-consistent manner. Our analysis demonstrates that the energy injection rate can significantly impact the jet evolution and subsequently influence the lightcurves. We find that the X-ray spectra and lightcurves could be described by electron synchrotron emission from the RS of the faster jet, in which the late-time X-ray upper limits, extending to 400 days after the disruption, could be interpreted as a jet break. Meanwhile, the radio observations can be interpreted as a result of synchrotron emission from the FS region of the slower jet. We also discuss prospects for testing the model with current and future observations.

In the emerging era of big data astrophysics, large-scale extragalactic surveys will soon provide high-quality imaging for billions of celestial objects to answer major questions in astrophysics such as the nature of dark matter and dark energy. Precision cosmology with surveys requires accurate photometric redshift (photo-z) estimation with well-constrained uncertainties as inputs for weak lensing models to measure cosmological parameters. Machine learning methods have shown promise in optimizing the information gained from galaxy images in photo-z estimation; however, many of these methods are limited in their ability to estimate accurate uncertainties. In this work, we present one of the first applications of Bayesian convolutional neural networks (BCNNs) for photo-z estimation and uncertainties. In addition, we use conformal mapping to calibrate the photo-z uncertainties to achieve good statistical coverage. We use the public GalaxiesML data set of ∼300k galaxies from the Hyper Suprime-Cam survey containing five-band photometric images and known spectroscopic redshifts from 0 < z < 4. We find that the performance is much improved when using images compared to photometry, with the BCNN achieving 0.098 rms error, a standard outlier rate of 3.9%, a 3σ outlier rate of 4.5%, and a bias of 0.0007. The performance drops significantly beyond z > 1.5 due to the relative lack of training data beyond those redshifts. This investigation demonstrates the power of using images directly and we advocate that future photo-z analysis of large-scale surveys include galaxy images.

We report on the discovery of a dual supermassive black hole system in the radio galaxy J1543−0757, with a projected separation between the two black holes of ∼46 mas. The result is based on recent multifrequency observations using the Very Long Baseline Array and European VLBI Network, which reveal two compact, variable, flat-spectrum, active nuclei within the elliptical host galaxy of J1543−0757. Multiepoch observations from the Very Long Baseline Array also provide constraints on the spectral index and proper motions of all components. The flat spectra of both N and S at both frequencies strongly support the hypothesis that these radio components are associated with two separate, accreting supermassive black holes. The two nuclei appear stationary, while the jets emanating from the weaker of the two nuclei appear to move out and terminate in bright hotspots. The discovery of this system has implications for the number of close dual black holes that might be sources of gravitational radiation.

<title>Mapping the Longitudinal Magnetic Field in the Atmosphere of an Active Region Plage from the Inversion of the Near-ultraviolet CLASP2.1 Spectropolarimetric Data</title>

We apply the HanleRT Tenerife Inversion Code to the spectropolarimetric observations obtained by the Chromospheric Layer Spectropolarimeter. This suborbital space experiment measured the variation with wavelength of the four Stokes parameters in the near-ultraviolet spectral region of the Mg ii h and k lines over a solar disk area containing part of an active region plage and the edge of a sunspot penumbra. We infer the stratification of the temperature, the electron density, the line-of-sight velocity, the microturbulent velocity, and the longitudinal component of the magnetic field from the observed intensity and circular polarization profiles. The inferred model atmosphere shows larger temperature and electron density in the plage and the superpenumbra regions than in the quiet regions. The shape of the plage region in terms of its brightness is similar to the pattern of the inferred longitudinal component of the magnetic field in the chromosphere, as well as to that of the overlying moss observed by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly in the 171 Å band, which suggests a similar magnetic origin for the heating in both the plage and the moss region. Moreover, this heating is particularly significant in the regions with larger inferred magnetic flux. In contrast, in the superpenumbra, the regions with larger electron density and temperature are usually found in between these regions with larger magnetic flux, suggesting that the details of the heating mechanism in the chromosphere of the superpenumbra may be different from those in the plage, but with the magnetic field still playing a key role.

<title>Prior-informed Active Galactic Nucleus Host Spectral Decomposition Using PyQSOFit</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We introduce an improved method for decomposing the emission of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and their host galaxies using templates from principal component analysis (PCA). This approach integrates prior information from PCA with a penalized pixel fitting mechanism that improves the precision and effectiveness of the decomposition process. Specifically, we have reduced the degeneracy and overfitting in AGN host decomposition, particularly for those with low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), where traditional methods tend to fail. By applying our method to 76,565 Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 16 quasars with z < 0.8, we achieve a success rate of ≈94%, thus establishing the largest host-decomposed spectral catalog of quasars to date. Our fitting results consider the impact of the host galaxy on the overestimation of the AGN luminosity and black hole mass (MBH). Furthermore, we obtained stellar velocity dispersion (σ⋆) measurements for 4137 quasars. The slope of the MBH−σ⋆ relation in this subsample is generally consistent with previous quasar studies beyond the local Universe. Our method provides a robust and efficient approach to disentangle the AGN and host galaxy components across a wide range of SNRs and redshifts.

<title>The Wanderer: Charting WASP-77A b’s Formation and Migration Using a System-wide Inventory of Carbon and Oxygen Abundances</title>

The elemental and isotopic abundances of volatiles like carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen may trace a planet’s formation location relative to H2O, CO2, CO, NH3, and N2 “snowlines,” or the distance from the star at which these volatile elements sublimate. By comparing the C/O and 12C/13C ratios measured in giant exoplanet atmospheres to complementary measurements of their host stars, we can determine whether the planet inherited stellar abundances from formation inside the volatile snowlines, or nonstellar C/O and 13C enrichment characteristic of formation beyond the snowlines. To date, there are still only a handful of exoplanet systems where we can make a direct comparison of elemental and isotopic CNO abundances between an exoplanet and its host star. Here, we present a 12C/13C abundance analysis for host star WASP-77A (whose hot Jupiter’s 12C/13C abundance was recently measured). We use MARCS stellar atmosphere models and the radiative transfer code TurboSpectrum to generate synthetic stellar spectra for isotopic abundance calculations. We find a 12C/13C ratio of 51 ± 6 for WASP-77A, which is subsolar (∼91) but may still indicate 13C enrichment in its companion planet WASP-77A b (12C/13C = 26 ± 16, previously reported). Together with the inventory of carbon and oxygen abundances in both the host and companion planet, these chemical constraints point to WASP-77A b’s formation beyond the H2O and CO2 snowlines and provide chemical evidence for the planet’s migration to its current location ∼0.024 au from its host star.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of SiO, SiS, H2O, NaCl, and SO line emission at ∼30–50 mas resolution. These images map the molecular outflow and disk of Orion Source I (SrcI) on ∼12–20 au scales. Our observations show that the flow of material around SrcI creates a turbulent boundary layer in the outflow from SrcI, which may dissipate angular momentum in the rotating molecular outflow into the surrounding medium. Additionally, the data suggest that the proper motion of SrcI may have a significant effect on the structure and evolution of SrcI and its molecular outflow. As the motion of SrcI funnels material between the disk and the outflow, some material may be entrained into the outflow and accrete onto the disk, creating shocks that excite the NaCl close to the disk surface.

<title>Late-time X-Ray Observations of the Jetted Tidal Disruption Event AT2022cmc: The Relativistic Jet Shuts Off</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2022cmc represents the fourth known example of a relativistic jet produced by the tidal disruption of a stray star, providing a unique probe of the formation and evolution of relativistic jets in otherwise dormant supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Here we present deep, late-time Chandra observations of AT2022cmc extending to tobs ≈ 400 days after disruption. Our observations reveal a sudden decrease in the X-ray brightness by a factor of ≳14 over a factor of ≈2.3 in time, and a deviation from the earlier power-law decline with a steepening α ≳ 3.2 (FX ∝ t−α), steeper than expected for a jet break, and pointing to the cessation of jet activity at tobs ≈ 215 days. Such a transition has been observed in two previous TDEs (Swift J1644+57 and Swift J2058+05). From the X-ray luminosity and the timescale of jet shut-off, we parameterize the mass of the SMBH in terms of unknown jet efficiency and accreted mass fraction parameters. Motivated by the disk–jet connection in active galactic nuclei, we favor black hole masses ≲105M⊙ (where the jet and disk luminosities are comparable), and disfavor larger black holes (in which extremely powerful jets are required to outshine their accretion disks). We additionally estimate a total accreted mass of ≈0.1 M⊙. Applying the same formalism to Swift J1644+57 and Swift J2058+05, we favor comparable black hole masses for these TDEs of ≲ a few × 105M⊙, and suggest that jetted TDEs may preferentially form from lower-mass black holes when compared to nonrelativistic events, owing to generally lower jet and higher disk efficiencies at higher black hole masses.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Using stacked emission-line flux measurements of cool circumgalactic gas (CGM) in lower-mass galaxies (109.0 ≤ M*/M⊙ ≤ 1010.2), we measure the dependence of the emission characteristics on orientation relative to the disk plane as a function of radius and compare to what we found previously for massive (M* > 1010.4 M⊙) early-type galaxies. Although the line ratios (the lower [N ii]/Hα and [O iii]/Hβ) suggest an overall softer ionizing source than in the more massive galaxies, consistent with previous findings, we find the same ionization hardening signature (a higher [N ii]/Hα ratio in the inner polar region) along the polar direction at small radii that we found for the more massive galaxies. The line ratio in the inner polar bin is distinct from that measured for the inner planar bin with 99.99%, confidence and with >99.9% confidence we conclude that it lies outside the star formation regime. The effective hardening of the ionization of the CGM along the polar axis, at small radii, could indicate either relic effects of active galactic nucleus activity or shock ionization. In either case, this signature appears to be ubiquitous across the stellar mass range we are able to explore with our spectral stacking technique and currently available archival data.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Cosmic dawn represents a critical juncture in cosmic history when the first population of stars emerged. The astrophysical processes that govern this transformation need to be better understood. The detection of redshifted 21 cm radiation emitted from neutral hydrogen during this era offers a direct window into the thermal and ionization state of the Universe. This emission manifests as differential brightness between spin temperature and the cosmic microwave background. The SARAS experiment aims to detect the sky-averaged signal in the frequency range 40–200 MHz. SARAS’s unique design and operational strategy to float the antenna over a water body minimizes spectral features that may arise due to stratified ground beneath the antenna. However, the antenna environment can be prone to configuration changes due to variations in critical design parameters such as conductivity and antenna tilt. In this paper, we connect the variations in antenna properties to signal detection prospects. By using realistic simulations of a direction- and frequency-dependent radiation pattern of the SARAS antenna and its transfer function, we establish critical parameters and estimate bias in the detectability of different models of the global 21 cm signal. We find a correlation between the nature of chromaticity in antenna properties and the bias in the recovered spectral profiles of 21 cm signals. We also find stringent requirements for transfer function corrections, which can otherwise make detection prospects prohibitive. We finally explore a range of critical parameters that allow robust signal detection.

<div> 高质量，星形成，ALMA观测，温度，碎裂尺度
总结:
高质量星体形成通常发生在星团环境中，本文利用ALMA 1.33mm连续观测分析了30个高质量星体形成区域，利用树状图算法发现了573个核心，并发现了约5800天文单位的核心分离度。经过进一步分析，确定了约7000天文单位的特征碎裂尺度，与区域的热约恩长度相当。因此，热约恩碎裂在高质量星体形成区域中起着决定性的作用，而不需要调用湍流约恩碎裂。 <div>
Fragmentation contributes to the formation and evolution of stars. Observationally, high-mass stars are known to form multiple-star systems, preferentially in cluster environments. Theoretically, Jeans instability has been suggested to determine characteristic fragmentation scales, and thermal or turbulent motion in the parental gas clump mainly contributes to the instability. To search for such a characteristic fragmentation scale, we have analyzed Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) 1.33 mm continuum observations toward 30 high-mass star-forming clumps taken by the Digging into the Interior of Hot Cores with ALMA survey. We have identified 573 cores using the dendrogram algorithm and measured the separation of cores by using the Minimum Spanning Tree technique. The core separation corrected by projection effects has a distribution peaked around 5800 au. In order to remove biases produced by different distances and sensitivities, we further smooth the images to a common physical scale and perform completeness tests. Our careful analysis finds a characteristic fragmentation scale of ∼7000 au, comparable to the thermal Jeans length of the clumps. We conclude that thermal Jeans fragmentation plays a dominant role in determining the clump fragmentation in high-mass star-forming regions, without the need to invoke turbulent Jeans fragmentation.

<br /><br />总结:
本研究利用JWST NIRCam广场无缝光谱仪，在ASPIRE项目的25个领域进行了系统的搜索，发现了16个红移为z≈4-5的广谱Hα发射线源。这些源的宽线部分的全宽半最大宽度为1000到3000km/s，暗示黑洞质量在10^7到10^8M⊙之间，同时暗示存在聚集现象。研究结果为高红移下的微弱AGN群体提供了宝贵的数据库。 <div>
Low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with low-mass black holes (BHs) in the early universe are fundamental to understanding the BH growth and their coevolution with the host galaxies. Utilizing JWST NIRCam Wide Field Slitless Spectroscopy, we perform a systematic search for broad-line Hα emitters (BHAEs) at z ≈ 4–5 in 25 fields of the A SPectroscopic survey of biased halos In the Reionization Era (ASPIRE) project, covering a total area of 275 arcmin2. We identify 16 BHAEs with FWHM of the broad components spanning from ∼1000 to 3000 km s−1. Assuming that the broad line widths arise as a result of Doppler broadening around BHs, the implied BH masses range from 107 to 108M⊙, with broad Hα-converted bolometric luminosities of 1044.5–1045.5 erg s−1 and Eddington ratios of 0.07–0.47. The spatially extended structure of the F200W stacked image may trace the stellar light from the host galaxies. The Hα luminosity function indicates an increasing AGN fraction toward the higher Hα luminosities. We find possible evidence for clustering of BHAEs: two sources are at the same redshift with a projected separation of 519 kpc; one BHAE appears as a composite system residing in an overdense region with three close companion Hα emitters. Three BHAEs exhibit blueshifted absorption troughs indicative of the presence of high column density gas. We find that the broad-line-selected and photometrically selected BHAE samples exhibit different distributions in the optical continuum slopes, which can be attributed to their different selection methods. The ASPIRE broad-line Hα sample provides a good database for future studies of faint AGN populations at high redshift.

<br /><br />在这项研究中，研究人员通过STARFORGE项目的辐射-尘埃-磁流体动力学模拟对恒星形成分子云进行了研究。研究发现，一旦恒星超过一定的质量阈值（约2太阳质量），它们发出的辐射将清除其周围的尘埃颗粒，形成大约100天文单位大小的尘埃抑制区。这种尘埃的清除改变了该区域的气体性质，并且导致了恒星和其周围盘的降尘对气比（ADG）质量比的质量依赖性减少。研究预测，质量较大的恒星（≳10太阳质量）的ADG比将比其云的约低一个数量级。因此，恒星、其盘和周围环境将显示出与尘埃颗粒相关的元素（如碳和氧）的显著差异。 
<br /><br />总结: 这项研究通过模拟恒星形成过程中尘埃颗粒的动力学行为，发现随着恒星质量的增加，辐射会导致恒星周围形成尘埃抑制区，改变气体性质，影响恒星和其周围环境的尘埃对气比。对于质量较大的恒星，这种影响将导致其周围环境中常见尘埃颗粒相关元素的丰度显著减少。 <div>
Stars form within dense cores composed of both gas and dust within molecular clouds. However, despite the crucial role that dust plays in the star formation process, its dynamics is frequently overlooked, with the common assumption being a constant, spatially uniform dust-to-gas ratio and grain size spectrum. In this study, we introduce a set of radiation-dust-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of star-forming molecular clouds from the STARFORGE project. These simulations expand upon the earlier radiation MHD models, which included cooling, individual star formation, and feedback. Notably, they explicitly address the dynamics of dust grains, considering radiation, drag, and Lorentz forces acting on a diverse size spectrum of live dust grains. We find that once stars exceed a certain mass threshold (∼2 M⊙), their emitted radiation can evacuate dust grains from their vicinity, giving rise to a dust-suppressed zone of size ∼100 au. This removal of dust, which interacts with gas through cooling, chemistry, drag, and radiative transfer, alters the gas properties in the region. Commencing during the early accretion stages and preceding the main-sequence phase, this process results in a mass-dependent depletion in the accreted dust-to-gas (ADG) mass ratio within both the circumstellar disk and the star. We predict that massive stars (≳10 M⊙) would exhibit ADG ratios that are approximately 1 order of magnitude lower than that of their parent clouds. Consequently, stars, their disks, and circumstellar environments would display notable deviations in the abundances of elements commonly associated with dust grains, such as carbon and oxygen.

We present a spatially resolved study of stellar populations in six galaxies with stellar masses M* ∼ 1010M☉ at z ∼ 3.7 using 14-filter James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)/NIRCam imaging from the JADES and JEMS surveys. The six galaxies are visually selected to have clumpy substructures with distinct colors over rest frame 3600−4100 Å, including a red, dominant stellar core that is close to their stellar-light centroids. With 23-filter photometry from the Hubble Space Telescope to JWST, we measure the stellar-population properties of individual structural components via spectral energy distribution fitting using Prospector. We find that the central stellar cores are ≳2 times more massive than the Toomre mass, indicating they may not form via single in situ fragmentation. The stellar cores have stellar ages of 0.4−0.7 Gyr that are similar to the timescale of clump inward migration due to dynamical friction, suggesting that they likely instead formed through the coalescence of giant stellar clumps. While they have not yet quenched, the six galaxies are below the star-forming main sequence by 0.2−0.7 dex. Within each galaxy, we find that the specific star formation rate is lower in the central stellar core, and the stellar-mass surface density of the core is already similar to quenched galaxies of the same masses and redshifts. Meanwhile, the stellar ages of the cores are either comparable to or younger than the extended, smooth parts of the galaxies. Our findings are consistent with model predictions of the gas-rich compaction scenario for the buildup of galaxies’ central regions at high redshifts. We are likely witnessing the coeval formation of dense central cores, along with the onset of galaxy-wide quenching at z > 3.

<div> 光子，γ射线，大气响应，散射，能谱畸变
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章讨论了MeV γ射线在大气中的响应特征。观察到两种组分，一种是未经散射达到探测器的光子，另一种是经过一次或多次散射后达到探测器的光子。散射组分对于所测光谱造成了显著的能量相关畸变，尤其是在观测巴龙载荷时需要重点考虑。文章通过模拟大气中γ射线传输的完整响应发现，散射组分在更低能量下变得越来越显著，在0.1 MeV时，可能会使测量通量增加约2-4倍，取决于光子指数和源的离轴角度。这对于扩散源特别重要，而对于用成像望远镜观测的点源，散射效应可能大大降低。 <div>
The atmospheric response for MeV γ rays (∼0.1–10 MeV) can be characterized in terms of two observed components. The first component is due to photons that reach the detector without scattering. The second component is due to photons that reach the detector after scattering one or more times. While the former can be determined in a straightforward manner, the latter is much more complex to quantify, as it requires tracking the transport of all source photons that are incident on Earth’s atmosphere. The scattered component can cause a significant energy-dependent distortion in the measured spectrum, which is important to account for when making balloon-borne observations. In this work, we simulate the full response for γ-ray transport in the atmosphere. We find that the scattered component becomes increasingly more significant toward lower energies, and at 0.1 MeV, it may increase the measured flux by as much as a factor of ∼2–4, depending on the photon index and off-axis angle of the source. This is particularly important for diffuse sources, whereas the effect from scattering can be significantly reduced for point sources observed with an imaging telescope.

该研究报告了一项UNCOVER调查中的一项工作，对一颗红移为3.97的巨大宁静星系进行了光谱确认。尽管存在中等尘埃衰减的证据，深度观测在Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array中发现该星系与低（<10 M⊙ yr−1 ）星形成率（SFR）一致。研究对星系进行了详细的成分分析，发现其内部区域明显偏红，在不同区域的颜色具有强烈的梯度。通过空间分辨率的质量与光度测量，并结合最佳的双组分Sérsic模型，研究人员推断出了该星系的总质量和星际物质比。研究结果表明，这颗星系早期形成了一个密集的、低星形成率的尘埃核心，这对我们对早期结构演化的理解有着重要的启示。另外，全局、整合的尘埃特性与空间梯度的不一致也彰显了在描述星系早期生长过程时，考虑径向变化的恒星种群结构的重要性。 <div>
We report the spectroscopic confirmation of a massive ( ), Hubble Space Telescope–dark (mF150W − mF444W = 3.6) quiescent galaxy at zspec = 3.97 in the UNCOVER survey. NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopy and a nondetection in deep Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array imaging surprisingly reveals that the galaxy is consistent with a low (<10 M⊙ yr−1) star formation rate (SFR) despite evidence for moderate dust attenuation. The F444W image is well modeled with a two-component Sérsic fit that favors a compact, re ∼ 200 pc, n ∼ 2.9 component and a more extended, re ∼ 1.6 kpc, n ∼ 1.7 component. The galaxy exhibits strong color gradients: the inner regions are significantly redder than the outskirts. Spectral energy distribution models that reproduce both the red colors and low SFR in the center of UNCOVER 18407 require both significant (Av ∼ 1.4 mag) dust attenuation and a stellar mass-weighted age of 900 Myr, implying 50% of the stars in the core already formed by z = 7.5. Using spatially resolved annular mass-to-light measurements enabled by the galaxy’s moderate magnification ( ) to reconstruct a radial mass profile from the best-fitting two-component Sérsic model, we infer a total mass-weighted kpc and log . The early formation of a dense, low SFR, and dusty core embedded in a less attenuated stellar envelope suggests an evolutionary link between the earliest-forming massive galaxies and their elliptical descendants. Furthermore, the disparity between the global, integrated dust properties and the spatially resolved gradients highlights the importance of accounting for radially varying stellar populations when characterizing the early growth of galaxy structure.

总结: 本研究使用了流体动力学模拟研究了银河系中心的Wolf-Rayet星的恒星风，预测了超大质量黑洞Sgr A*的X射线光谱。结果表明，在Sgr A*周围形成了一个"冷"（104K）的气体盘，这与先前的网格模拟一致。我们通过产生合成光谱来比较冷盘环境的等离子体场景与没有冷盘环境的情况，并发现目前和未来的X射线任务不太可能区分这两种场景中等离子体的动力学特征。我们的模型与Chandra HETGS获得的Sgr A*光谱相匹配。最后，我们发现射电效率低的吸积流模型和流体动力学模拟的模型并没有强烈的偏好。新的X射线任务将提供更清晰的区分，但只有角秒分辨率的未来X射线任务才能在X射线领域显著推进我们对Sgr A*吸积流的理解。 <div>
Hydrodynamic simulations of the stellar winds from Wolf–Rayet stars within the Galactic center can provide predictions for the X-ray spectrum of the supermassive black hole Sgr A*. Herein, we present results from updated smooth particle hydrodynamics simulations, building on the architecture of Cuadra et al. and Russell et al., and find that a “cold” (104 K) gas disk forms around Sgr A* with a simulation runtime of 3500 yr. This result is consistent with previous grid-based simulations, demonstrating that a cold disk can form regardless of numerical method. We examine the plasma scenarios arising from an environment with and without this cold disk, by generating synthetic spectra for comparison to the quiescent Fe Kα Sgr A* spectrum from Chandra HETGS, taken through the Chandra X-ray Visionary Program. We find that current and future X-ray missions are unlikely to distinguish between the kinematic signatures in the plasma in these two scenarios. Nonetheless, the stellar wind plasma model presents a good fit to the dispersed Chandra spectra within 1.″5 of Sgr A*. We compare our results to the radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) model fit to the HETGS spectrum presented in Paper I and find that the Bayesian model evidence does not strongly favor either model. With 9″ angular resolution and high spectral resolution of the X-IFU, NewAthena will offer a clearer differentiation between the RIAF plasma model and hydrodynamic simulations, but only a future X-ray mission with arcsecond resolution will significantly advance our understanding of Sgr A*’s accretion flow in X-rays.

<div> 关键词：Sgr A*，超大质量黑洞，辐射低效率的吸积流，Chandra HETG-S谱，RIAF模型

总结:<br /><br />本研究使用辐射低效率的吸积流（RIAF）模型对Chandra HETG-S谱进行分析，并考虑了吸积流几何形状和仪器效应。结果显示，谱线特征表明等温和速度结构存在于等离子体内。拟合高分辨率光栅谱表明，存在一个与流出平衡的流入（s∼1），并且温度分布比1/r的引力潜能预期的要平缓。数据要求铁的丰度相对太阳较低（ZFe < 0.32 Z⊙，90％的置信区间），远低于在附近晚型巨星中测量的2 Z⊙金属丰度。未来的任务将提供更高的谱分辨率，但源分离仍将是一个问题。利用Chandra无与伦比的空间分辨率进行详细的银河中心X射线的研究仍然至关重要。 <div>
The extreme low-luminosity supermassive black hole Sgr A* provides a unique laboratory in which to test models of radiatively inefficient accretion flows (RIAFs). Previous fits to the quiescent Chandra ACIS-S spectrum found that a RIAF model with an equal inflow–outflow balance works well. In this work, we apply the RIAF model to the Chandra HETG-S spectrum obtained through the Chandra X-ray Visionary Program, which displays features suggestive of temperature and velocity structures within the plasma. A comprehensive forward model analysis accounting for the accretion flow geometry and HETG-S instrumental effects is required for a full interpretation of the quiescent Chandra HETG-S spectrum. We present a RIAF model that takes these effects into account. Our fits to the high-resolution grating spectrum indicate an inflow balanced by an outflow (s ∼ 1) alongside a temperature profile that appears shallower than what would be expected from a gravitational potential following 1/r. The data require that the abundance of iron relative to solar is ZFe < 0.32 Z⊙ (90% credible interval), much lower than the 2 Z⊙ metallicity measured in nearby late-type giants. While future missions like NewAthena will provide higher spectral resolution, source separation will continue to be a problem. Leveraging Chandra’s unparalleled spatial resolution, which is not expected to be surpassed for decades, remains essential for detailed investigations of the densely populated Galactic center in X-rays.

<br /><br />总结:
本研究探讨了毫秒脉冲星在球状星团中的丰度和其光度函数的参数限制能力。我们引入了一种基于边际神经比估计的新型无似然分析方法，该方法能够一致地产生良好行为的后验概率。我们发现Terzan 5球状星团可能拥有158颗MSPs，但对这一数字的不确定性仍然很大。通过对模拟的Terzan 5样本数据进行分析，我们发现通过添加球状星团的弥散射电辐射的可靠测量或将当前无线电脉冲调查的检测阈值提高至少2倍，可以显著改善后验概率。 <div>
Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are abundant in globular clusters (GCs), which offer favorable environments for their creation. While the advent of recent, powerful facilities led to a rapid increase in MSP discoveries in GCs through pulsation searches, detection biases persist. In this work, we investigate the ability of current and future detections in GCs to constrain the parameters of the MSP population in GCs through a careful study of their luminosity function. Parameters of interest are the number of MSPs hosted by a GC, as well as the mean and the width of their luminosity function, which are typically affected by large uncertainties. While, as we show, likelihood-based studies can lead to ill-behaved posteriors on the size of the MSP population, we introduce a novel, likelihood-free analysis, based on marginal neural ratio estimation, which consistently produces well-behaved posteriors. We focus on the GC Terzan 5 (or Ter 5), which currently counts 48 detected MSPs. We find that 158 MSPs should be hosted in this GC, but the uncertainty on this number remains large. We explore the performance of our new method on simulated Terzan 5-like data sets mimicking possible future observational outcomes. We find that significant improvement on the posteriors can be obtained by adding a reliable measurement of the diffuse radio emission of the GC to the analysis or by improving the detection threshold of current radio pulsation surveys by at least a factor of 2.

<div> 关键词: CGM, 矮星系, 模拟, 摩擦剥离, 星际介质

总结: 本研究通过模拟探究了矮星系的CGM在类似银河系环境中对摩擦剥离的敏感程度。研究发现，矮星系的CGM在数百兆年内就有超过95%的质量被摩擦剥离，即使在弱摩擦剥离轨道上，ISM的剥离也是可忽略的。另外，发现加入卫星CGM并不会有效保护其星系，因此ISM的剥离速率不受影响。这些结果表明矮星系的CGM在卫星星系中难以被探测到，并且矮星系的星形成很可能不会得到CGM的补充。 <div>
The circumgalactic medium (CGM) of star-forming dwarf galaxies plays a key role in regulating the galactic baryonic cycle. We investigate how susceptible the CGM of dwarf satellite galaxies is to ram pressure stripping in Milky Way–like environments. In a suite of hydrodynamical wind tunnel simulations, we model an intermediate-mass dwarf satellite galaxy (M* = 107.2M⊙) with a multiphase interstellar medium (ISM; MISM = 107.9M⊙) and CGM (MCGM,vir = 108.5M⊙) along two first-infall orbits to more than 500 Myr past pericenter of a Milky Way–like host. The spatial resolution is ∼79 pc in the star-forming ISM and 316−632 pc in the CGM. Our simulations show that the dwarf satellite CGM removal is fast and effective: more than 95% of the CGM mass is ram pressure stripped within a few hundred megayears, even under a weak ram pressure orbit where the ISM stripping is negligible. The conditions for CGM survival are consistent with the analytical halo gas stripping predictions in McCarthy et al. We also find that including the satellite CGM does not effectively shield its galaxy, and therefore the ISM stripping rate is unaffected. Our results imply that a dwarf galaxy CGM is unlikely to be detected in satellite galaxies; and that the star formation of gaseous dwarf satellites is likely devoid of replenishment from a CGM.

MFs作为一种强大的拓扑摘要统计工具，对提取非高斯信息具有重要作用。研究发现，利用EOR阶段的21厘米亮度温度场的MFs，可以限制再电离参数。通过模拟电波干涉阵列实验，如HERA和SKA的观测，考虑包括热噪声、合成波束和前景回避在内的实际效应。研究表明，利用SKA-Low测量的21厘米信号的MFs可以区分不同的再电离模型，而使用类似HERA的阵列进行的MF测量无法准确进行。进一步预测了利用MFs测量可以限制再电离参数的精度，使用基于前向建模的参数推断的标准Markov Chain Monte Carlo分析。发现对于SKA-Low观测，MFs提供了与功率谱（PS）分析相当的再电离参数无偏估计的精度。此外，使用MFs和PS的联合约束可以提高约30%的约束精度，相比仅使用PS。然而，如果采用强前景回避缩小EOR窗口，约束精度可能会降低。我们的分析表明，MFs作为一组摘要统计量，从21厘米EOR场中提取出与双点统计不同的互补信息，因此有很大动力将MFs纳入未来21厘米观测的数据分析中。<br /><br />总结: MFs作为拓扑摘要统计工具，在21厘米再电离观测数据分析中具有重要潜力，可以提供与功率谱分析相当的再电离参数无偏估计的精度。同时，MFs与PS的联合约束可以提高约束精度，并在21厘米观测中提取出互补信息。 <div>
The Minkowski functionals (MFs), a set of topological summary statistics, have emerged as a powerful tool for extracting non-Gaussian information. We investigate the prospect of constraining the reionization parameters using the MFs of the 21 cm brightness temperature field from the epoch of reionization (EOR). Realistic effects, including thermal noise, synthesized beam, and foreground avoidance, are applied to the mock observations from radio interferometric array experiments such as the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) and the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). We demonstrate that the MFs of the 21 cm signal measured with SKA-Low can be used to distinguish different reionization models, whereas the MF measurement with a HERA-like array cannot be made accurately enough. We further forecast the accuracies with which the MF measurements can place constraints on reionization parameters, using the standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis for parameter inference based on forward modeling. We find that for SKA-Low observation, MFs provide unbiased estimations of the reionization parameters with accuracies comparable to the power spectrum (PS) analysis. Furthermore, joint constraints using both MFs and PS can improve the constraint accuracies by up to 30% compared to those with the PS alone. Nevertheless, the constraint accuracies can be degraded if the EOR window is shrunk with strong foreground avoidance. Our analysis demonstrates the promise of MFs as a set of summary statistics that extract complementary information from the 21 cm EOR field to the two-point statistics, which suggests a strong motivation for incorporating the MFs into the data analysis of future 21 cm observations.

总结: 
本研究分析了2016年10月12日在L1拉格朗日点探测到的星际日冕物质喷发与高速流的相互作用。通过观测-建模相结合的方法，估计了相互作用发生/起始的星际空间区域。研究使用了多种分析方法，包括最小方差分析和Walen测试来研究可能出现在星际日冕物质喷发和高速流接触界面的重联耗散。同时，使用了逐步圆柱壳重建CME来估计日冕物质喷发的几何形状和源区位置。最后，使用了两步阻力模型来估计相互作用发生的星际空间区域。研究结果表明，星际实际观测显示出具有对称和未受扰动结构的磁障碍，并展现出典型星际日冕物质喷发的磁通量、螺旋度和膨胀速度特征。而最终的两步阻力模型结果表明，星际日冕物质喷发开始与高速流相互作用的地点接近地球（约0.81天文单位），与实际观测的推断相吻合。 <br /> <div>
We analyze the interaction between an interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) detected in situ at the L1 Lagrange point on 2016 October 12 with a trailing high-speed stream (HSS). We aim to estimate the region in the interplanetary (IP) space where the interaction happened/started using a combined observational-modeling approach. We use minimum variance analysis (MVA) and the Walen test to analyze possible reconnection exhaust at the interface of ICME and HSS. We perform a graduated cylindrical shell reconstruction of the CME to estimate the geometry and source location of the CME. Finally, we use a two-step drag-based model (DBM) model to estimate the region in IP space where the interaction took place. The magnetic obstacle observed in situ shows a fairly symmetric and undisturbed structure and shows the magnetic flux, helicity, and expansion profile/speed of a typical ICME. The MVA together with the Walen test, however, confirms reconnection exhaust at the ICME–HSS boundary. Thus, in situ signatures are in favor of a scenario where the interaction is fairly recent. The trailing HSS shows a distinct velocity profile which first reaches a semi-saturated plateau with an average velocity of 500 km s−1 and then saturates at a maximum speed of 710 km s−1. We find that the HSS's interaction with the ICME is influenced only by this initial plateau. The results of the two-step DBM suggest that the ICME has started interacting with the HSS close to Earth (∼0.81 au), which compares well with the deductions from in situ signatures.

Interpretation of the ongoing efforts to simulate the atmospheres of potentially habitable terrestrial exoplanets requires that we understand the underlying dynamics and chemistry of such objects to a much greater degree than 1D or even simple 3D models enable. Here, for the tidally locked habitable-zone planet TRAPPIST-1e, we explore one effect which can shape the dynamics and chemistry of terrestrial planets: the inclusion of an Earth-like land–ocean distribution with orography. To do this we use the Earth-system model WACCM6/CESM2 to run a pair of TRAPPIST-1e models with N2–O2 atmospheres and with the substellar point fixed over either land or ocean. The presence of orography shapes atmospheric transport, and in the case of Earth-like orography, breaks the symmetry between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres which was previously found in slab ocean models. For example, peak zonal jet speeds in the Southern Hemisphere are 50%–100% faster than similar jets in the Northern Hemisphere. This also affects the meridional circulation, transporting equatorial material toward the south pole. As a result we also find significant changes in the atmospheric chemistry, including the accumulation of potentially lethal quantities of ozone at both the south pole and the surface. Future studies which investigate the effects of landmass distribution on the dynamics of exoplanetary atmospheres should pay close attention to both the dayside land fraction as well as the orography of the land. Simply modeling a flat landmass will not give a complete picture of its dynamical impact.

Intrinsic colors (ICs) of stars are essential for studies on both stellar physics and dust reddening. In this work, we developed an XGBoost model to predict ICs with the atmospheric parameters Teff, , and [M/H]. The model was trained and tested for three colors at Gaia and Two Micron All Sky Survey bands with 1,040,446 low-reddening sources. The atmospheric parameters were determined by the Gaia DR3 General Stellar Parameterizer from Photometry (GSP-phot) module and were validated by comparing with the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment and Large Sky Area Multi-Object fiber Spectroscopic Telescope. We further confirmed that the biases in GSP-phot parameters, especially for [M/H], do not present a significant impact on the IC prediction. The generalization error of the model estimated by the test set is 0.014 mag for , 0.050 mag for , and 0.040 mag for . The model was applied to a sample containing 5,714,528 reddened stars with stellar parameters from R. Andrae et al. to calculate ICs and reddenings. The high consistency in the comparison of E(J − KS) between our results and literature values further validates the accuracy of the XGBoost model. The variation of E(GBP − KS)/E(GBP − GRP), a representation of the extinction law, with Galactic longitude is found on large scales. This work preliminarily presents the feasibility and accuracy of the machine learning approach for IC and dust reddening calculation, whose products could be widely applied to spectrophotometric data. The data sets and trained model can be accessed via Zenodo, doi:10.5281/zenodo.12787594. Models for more bands will be completed in following work.

<div> NGC 4278, LINER, γ-ray source, Swift-XRT, spectral energy distribution
<br /><br />
NGC 4278是一个低光度活动星系核，通常被归类为低电离核发射线区(LINER)。最近，有报道称它与首个大型高海拔空气淋浴观测站(LHAASO)源目录中的一个很高能的γ射线源1LHAASO J1219+2915相关。然而，通过分析费米伽马射线空间望远镜(LAT)的数据，没有检测到相关联的对应物。通过分析Swift-XRT的X射线观测数据，我们发现NGC 4278在MJD 59546时处于高通量状态，X射线通量比大约11.7年前的Chandra观测结果高出一个数量级。有趣的是，这个Swift-XRT观测是在γ射线源1LHAASO J1219+2915的活跃阶段进行的。我们提出，NGC 4278的高能γ射线的检测可能归因于其中心活动核的存在。为了再现NGC 4278的光谱能量分布(SED)，我们采用了一个单区域的轻子模型，通常用于拟合BL Lac的宽频谱SED，并发现所需的磁场强度比典型TeV BL Lac要小。此外，与典型TeV BL Lac相比，NGC 4278在无线电和TeV波段表现出显著较低的亮度。在无线电亮度与艾丁顿比平面上，NGC 4278显示出与Seyfert星系和LINERs更相似，而不是BL Lac，然而，它仍然大致跟随BL Lac在较低亮度方向的延伸。 
<br /><br />总结: 
1. NGC 4278被归类为低光度活动星系核(LINER)；
2. 与γ射线源1LHAASO J1219+2915相关，但费米望远镜未检测到对应物；
3. Swift-XRT观测显示NGC 4278处于高通量状态；
4. 提出NGC 4278的高能γ射线检测可能与活动核有关；
5. 采用轻子模型再现NGC 4278的光谱能量分布，磁场强度较小。 <div>
NGC 4278, a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus, is generally classified as a low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER). Recently, it has been reported to be associated with a very high energy γ-ray source 1LHAASO J1219+2915 in the first Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory source catalog. However, no associated counterpart has been detected by analyzing the data collected by the Large Area Telescope on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. By analyzing its X-ray observation data from Swift-XRT, we find that NGC 4278 is in a high-flux state on MJD 59546, with the X-ray flux more than one order of magnitude higher than that observed ∼11.7 yr earlier by Chandra. Interestingly, this Swift-XRT observation was conducted during the active phase of the γ-ray source 1LHAASO J1219+2915. We propose that the detection of very high energy γ-rays from NGC 4278 may be attributed to the presence of an active nucleus in its center. To reproduce the spectral energy distribution (SED) of NGC 4278, we employ a one-zone leptonic model, typically used for fitting broadband SEDs of BL Lacs, and find that a smaller magnetic field strength is required than that of typical TeV BL Lacs. Furthermore, NGC 4278 exhibits significantly lower luminosity in both radio and TeV bands when compared with typical TeV BL Lacs. In the radio luminosity versus Eddington ratio plane, NGC 4278 shows greater similarity to Seyfert galaxies and LINERs than to BL Lacs; however, it still roughly follows the extension toward lower luminosity seen in BL Lacs.

Recently, the detection of a coherent radio flash associated with short-duration GRB 201006A, occurring 76.6 minutes after the burst, has attracted great attention. However, the physical origin of the coherent radio flash remains under debate. By reanalyzing its data observed by Fermi and Swift, we find that an early radio afterglow as the physical origin of the radio flash can be ruled out, but the coherent radio emission seems to be consistent with the hypothesis of a supramassive magnetar as the central engine collapsing into a black hole. Within this scenario, the derived magnetar surface magnetic field (Bp) and the initial spin period (P0) fall into a reasonable range but require a preferably low value of ηR = 10−7 or 10−6. Moreover, the calculated low-ε value and Eγ,iso–Ep correlation of GRB 201006A also supports the progenitor which is from the merger of compact stars. We also discuss the non-detected kilonova emission associated with GRB 201006A, and then compare with its upper limits of optical observations.

Tilted disk precession exists in different objects. Negative superhumps (NSHs) in cataclysmic variable stars are believed to arise from the interaction between the reverse precession of a tilted disk and the streams from the secondary star. Utilizing Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite photometry, we present a comprehensive investigation into the tilted disk precession and NSHs in the dwarf nova (DN) HS 2325+8205, employing eclipse minima, eclipse depths, NSH frequencies, and NSH amplitudes and the correlation between them as the windows. We identified NSHs with a period of 0.185671(17) day in HS 2325+8205. The NSH frequency exhibits variability with a period of 3.943(9) days, akin to the tilted disk precession period validated in nova-like stars (SDSS J0812) and intermediate polars (IPs; TV Col). The O − C of the eclipse minima were similarly found to vary cyclically in a period of 4.135(5) days, characterized by a faster rise than fall. Furthermore, the NSH amplitude exhibits complex and diverse variations, which may be linked to changes in the disk radius, the mass transfer rate, and the apparent area of the hot spot. For the first time in DNe, we observe biperiodic variations in eclipse depth (P1 = 4.131(4) days and P2 = 2.065(2) days ≈ Pprec/2) resembling those seen in IPs, suggesting that variations with P2 are not attributable to an accretion curtain, as previously suspected. Moreover, NSH amplitude and eclipse depth decrease with increasing NSH frequency, while NSH amplitude correlates positively with eclipse depth. These complex variations observed across multiple observational windows provide substantial evidence for the understanding of tilted disk precession and NSHs.

<div> Solar energetic particle (SEP), prediction, machine learning, support vector machines, accuracy<br />
<br />总结:<br />本文使用了机器学习方法来评估新数据对太阳耀斑后SEP事件的预测潜力。研究发现尽管数据量增加，预测精度仍未超过之前的基准，但模拟实际操作环境的线性支持向量机模型显示对SEP事件的预测精度略有提高。这表明需要更复杂、物理知识驱动的模型以更好地理解导致SEP事件的基本过程。 <div>
The prediction of solar energetic particle (SEP) events garners increasing interest as space missions extend beyond Earth’s protective magnetosphere. These events, which are, in most cases, products of magnetic-reconnection-driven processes during solar flares or fast coronal-mass-ejection-driven shock waves, pose significant radiation hazards to aviation, space-based electronics, and particularly space exploration. In this work, we utilize the recently developed data set that combines the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Space-weather Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager Active Region Patches and the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory/Space-weather Michelson Doppler Imager Active Region Patches. We employ a suite of machine learning strategies, including support vector machines (SVMs) and regression models, to evaluate the predictive potential of this new data product for a forecast of post-solar flare SEP events. Our study indicates that despite the augmented volume of data, the prediction accuracy reaches 0.7 ± 0.1 (experimental setting), which aligns with but does not exceed these published benchmarks. A linear SVM model with training and testing configurations that mimic an operational setting (positive–negative imbalance) reveals a slight increase (+0.04 ± 0.05) in the accuracy of a 14 hr SEP forecast compared to previous studies. This outcome emphasizes the imperative for more sophisticated, physics-informed models to better understand the underlying processes leading to SEP events.

<div> 超轨道信号, 临近光度分析, 断断续续的超表面信号, 周期振荡, 出现幅度的变化
<br />
总结:<br />
这篇文章报道了对EX Dra的光度研究发现。数据显示了20次完整的爆发，表现出几个有趣且罕见的特征。光度曲线展现出一个明显的超轨道信号，周期约为4.39天，以及一个负的超脉冲，周期约为4.805小时，表明了凝聚盘的倾斜和进动。此外，超轨道周期的时变特性表明了进动周期的波动。在平静期的掩星光度极小值O-C分析显示了一个周期为3.9天的振荡，略短于超轨道周期。我们认为这不太可能是轨道周期的突然改变，而更可能受到了凝聚盘的倾斜和进动的影响。值得注意的是，我们发现了从每隔26天出现一次幅度为3.5等的爆发行为，转变为幅度大约为2.5等、周期大约为12天的行为，这种行为持续了14年才恢复。此外，在非遮蔽相位的平台上提取出了在37至40分钟之间的准周期振荡。 <div>
We present a photometric study of EX Dra, a dwarf nova that has been extensively observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. The data reveal the occurrence of 20 complete outbursts, exhibiting several intriguing and rare characteristics. The light curves exhibit a distinct superorbital signal with a period of approximately Psor ∼ 4.39(7) days, along with a negative superhump showing an approximate period of Pnsh ∼ 4.805(1) hr, indicating that the accretion disk is tilted and undergoing precession with the period of Psor. In addition, the time-varying nature of Psor suggests that the precession period is fluctuating.The eclipsing light minima O – C analysis during quiescence shows an oscillation with period of 3.9(5) days, which is a little shorter than the superorbital period. We contend that this is unlikely to be a sudden alteration of the orbital period, but rather, it is influenced by the tilt and precession of the accretion disk. Notably, we found an amplitude shift in the outburst behavior from 3.5 mag with a periodicity of about 26 days to an amplitude of around 2.5 mag with a periodicity of about 12 days, which persisted for 14 yr before reverting. Furthermore, we have extracted quasiperiodic oscillations in the plateau at the noneclipsed phases, characterized by periods ranging between 37 and 40 minutes.

In recent years, the continued detection of complex organic molecules of prebiotic interest has refueled the interest in a panspermic origin of life. The prebiotic molecule glyceraldehyde is proposed to be formed from (Z)-1,2-ethenediol, a molecule recently detected toward the G+0.693-0.027 molecular cloud at the galactic center. In this work, we computationally simulate the formation of (Z)-1,2-ethenediol from vinyl alcohol on the surface of amorphous solid water in a two-step synthesis involving an OH addition and an H abstraction reaction. In total, we considered all reaction possibilities of the 1,1- and 1,2-OH addition to vinyl alcohol followed by H abstraction or H addition reactions on the resulting radicals. The combination of these reactions is capable of explaining the formation of (Z)-1,2-ethenediol provided a suprathermal diffusion of OH. We also conclude that our proposed formation pathway is not selective and also yields other abstraction and addition products. Key in our findings is the connection between the adsorption modes of the reactants and intermediates and the stereoselectivity of the reactions.

在本研究中，研究人员构建了一个半解析模型，估算了再电离对超大质量黑洞生长的影响。他们发现，在质量为1012、1011、1010 M⊙的暗物质暗云内，早期的再电离可以使超大质量黑洞的质量在z = 6时减少50%至90%。此外，他们的研究还表明，再电离的影响程度取决于Eddington accretion rate是否可以超过，如果可以，那么超大质量黑洞的质量主要在早期再电离阶段(z≳10)被抑制，否则则在整个红移范围内受抑制。最后，研究发现，全球平均再电离可能会使1011 M⊙以下的暗物质暗云内的超大质量黑洞质量减少至少两倍。未来JWST发现的超大质量黑洞普查结果可能可以验证更质量的超大质量黑洞更可能存在于后期再电离的宇宙体积中的基本预测。
<br /><br />总结: <div>
The supermassive black holes (SMBHs) that power active galactic nuclei found at z ≥ 6 were formed during the Epoch of Reionization. Because reionization is an inhomogeneous process, the physical properties of SMBH host-galaxy environments will vary spatially during reionization. We construct a semi-analytic model to estimate the impact of reionization on SMBH growth. Using a series of merger trees, reionization models, and black hole (BH) growth models, we find that early reionization can reduce a SMBH’s mass by up to [50, 70, 90]% within dark matter halos of mass [1012, 1011, 1010] M⊙ by z = 6. Our findings also suggest that the redshift range in which BH growth is impacted by reionization strongly depends on whether the Eddington accretion rate can be exceeded. If so, we find that BH masses are significantly suppressed principally during the early phases of reionization (z ≳ 10), while they are more readily suppressed across the full redshift range if super-Eddington growth is not allowed. We find that the global average impact of reionization may be to reduce the masses of BHs residing in ≲1011M⊙ halos by a factor of ≳2. The census of SMBHs being uncovered by the JWST may offer a means to test the basic prediction that more massive BHs reside in cosmological volumes that are reionized at later times.

<br /><br />总结:
研究利用詹姆斯·韦伯空间望远镜中红外仪器的中分辨率光谱仪观测了UGC 8782的射电活跃星系核宿主，以绘制温暖的分子和电离气体动力学。数据显示在内部2千秒差距内存在空间分辨的流出现象，低电离（由[Ar ii] 6.99 μm发射跟踪）和温暖的分子气体（由H2旋转跃迁跟踪）均可见。我们发现温暖流（198K ≤ T ≤ 1000K）在距离核心约900pc处的最大流出率为4.90 ± 2.04 M⊙ yr−1，并估计更热的气体相（T > 1000 K）的流出率高达1.22 ± 0.51 M⊙ yr−1。这些流出可以在约1百万年内清除整个核心温暖分子气体。所得分子流出动能导致与AGN光度的耦合效率为2%–5%，远高于AGN反馈在扼制恒星形成中至少预期的最低值。 <div>
We use the James Webb Space Telescope Mid-Infrared Instrument medium-resolution spectrometer observations of the radio-loud active galactic nucleus (AGN) host UGC 8782 to map the warm molecular and ionized gas kinematics. The data reveal spatially resolved outflows in the inner 2 kpc, seen in low ionization (traced by the [Ar ii] 6.99 μm emission) and in warm molecular gas (traced by the H2 rotational transitions). We find a maximum mass-outflow rate of 4.90 ± 2.04 M⊙ yr−1 at ∼900 pc from the nucleus for the warm outflow (198 K ≤ T ≤ 1000 K) and estimate an outflow rate of up to 1.22 ± 0.51 M⊙ yr−1 for the hotter gas phase (T > 1000 K). These outflows can clear the entire nuclear reservoir of warm molecular gas in about 1 Myr. The derived kinetic power of the molecular outflows leads to coupling efficiencies of 2%–5% of the AGN luminosity, way above the minimum expected for the AGN feedback to be effective in quenching the star formation.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章讨论了基于宇宙大尺度结构的统计分析，使用了两点摘要统计方法，如功率谱或两点相关函数。研究者重新审视了宇宙网格的几何度量，使用了最新的MillenniumTNG ΛCDM模拟套件。他们发现，暗物质分布的网格统计随着红移和聚集强度呈现明显变化，而对数值分辨率也存在显著影响。研究者还分析了星系模拟目录的网格统计，结果显示与采样密度相关性比星系选择标准更强。然而，研究结果表明，在控制采样密度时，网格统计仍然可作为互补宇宙学测试的有用工具。 <div>
The statistical analysis of cosmic large-scale structure is most often based on simple two-point summary statistics, like the power spectrum or the two-point correlation function of a sample of galaxies or other types of tracers. In contrast, topological measures of clustering are also sensitive to higher-order correlations and thus offer the prospect to access additional information that may harbor important constraining power. We here revisit one such geometric measure of the cosmic web in the form of the so-called percolation analysis, using the recent MillenniumTNG simulation suite of the ΛCDM paradigm. We analyze continuum percolation statistics both for high-resolution dark matter particle distributions and for galaxy mock catalogs from a semianalytic galaxy formation model within a periodic simulation volume of 3000 Mpc on a side. For comparison, we also investigate the percolation statistics of random particle sets and neutrino distributions with two different summed particle masses. We find that the percolation statistics of the dark matter distribution evolves strongly with redshift and thus clustering strength, yielding a progressively lower percolation threshold toward later times. However, there is a sizable residual dependence on numerical resolution, which we interpret as a residual influence of different levels of shot noise. This is corroborated by our analysis of galaxy mock catalogs, whose results depend on sampling density more strongly than on galaxy selection criteria. While this limits the discriminative power of percolation statistics, our results suggest that it still remains useful as a complementary cosmological test when controlled for sampling density.

<div> 磁星，磁场，爆发，应力张量，地壳断裂
<br />总结:
磁星爆发受到强烈磁场的驱动。最近，这一现象引起了人们的广泛关注，因为据报道与一些快速射电暴有关。了解磁星爆发可能揭示了神秘的瞬变事件的关键。地壳由于磁场演化而产生的弹性变形会在长时间尺度上累积。最终，地壳会在特定阈值之上断裂或产生塑性变形。确定临界限制是需要获得对磁应力响应中的剪应变张量的理解。在一些研究中，这个张量被一个从磁应力代数确定的近似表达式所取代。这项研究通过将其与适当计算得出的应变张量进行比较来评估该近似的有效性。通过求解由磁场驱动的弹性变形的微分方程，结果表明该近似并未准确表示应变张量的数值和空间分布。以往基于虚假标准的演化计算可能会高估应变张量的大小，并且地壳断裂会在较短时间尺度上发生。因此，有必要通过使用正确的方法重新审视演化计算。这项研究对于发展磁星地壳断裂和磁场演化的动力学非常重要。 <div>
Magnetar outbursts are powered by an intense magnetic field. The phenomenon has recently drawn significant attention because of a connection to some fast radio bursts that has been reported. Understanding magnetar outbursts may provide the key to mysterious transient events. The elastic deformation of the solid crust due to magnetic field evolution accumulates over a secular timescale. Eventually, the crust fractures or responds plastically beyond a particular threshold. Determination of the critical limit is required to obtain the shear strain tensor in response to magnetic stress. In some studies, the tensor was substituted with an approximate expression determined algebraically from the magnetic stress. This study evaluated the validity of the approximation by comparing it with the strain tensor obtained through appropriate calculations. The differential equations for the elastic deformation driven by the magnetic field were solved. The results indicated that the approximation did not represent the correct strain tensor value, in both magnitude and spatial profile. Previous evolutionary calculations based on spurious criteria are likely to overestimate the magnitude of the strain tensor, and crustal failure occurs on a shorter timescale. Therefore, revisiting evolutionary calculations using the correct approach is necessary. This study is essential for developing the dynamics of crustal fractures and the magnetic field evolution in a magnetar.

Giant eruptions (GEs) in luminous blue variables are years-to-decades-long episodes of enhanced mass loss from the outer layers of the star during which the star undergoes major changes in its physical and observed properties. We use the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics stellar evolution code to model the evolution of a 70 M⊙ star that undergoes a GE. We let the star evolve to the termination of the main sequence, and when it reaches T ≃ 19,400 K we emulate a GE by removing mass from its outer layers at a rate of 0.15 M⊙ yr−1 for 20 yr. As mass is being lost, the star contracts and releases a substantial amount of gravitational energy. The star undergoes an initial ≃3 days of expansion followed by years of contraction. During that time the star tries to reach an equilibrium state, and as a result of loss in gravitational energy, its luminosity drops about 1 order of magnitude. As the GE terminates, we let the star continue to evolve without any further mass loss and track its recovery as it regains its equilibrium by adjusting its internal structure. After ≃87 yr it reaches a state very close to the one where the GE was first initiated. We suggest that at this point another GE or a cycle of GEs may occur.

Minifilament eruptions producing small jets and microflares have mostly been studied based on coronal observations at extreme-ultraviolet and X-ray wavelengths. This study presents chromospheric plasma diagnostics of a quiet-Sun minifilament of size ∼ 2″ × 5″ with a sigmoidal shape and an associated microflare observed on 2021 August 7 17:00 UT using high temporal and spatial resolution spectroscopy from the Fast Imaging Solar Spectrograph (FISS) and high-resolution magnetograms from the Near InfraRed Imaging Spectropolarimeter (NIRIS) installed on the 1.6 m Goode Solar Telescope at Big Bear Solar Observatory. Using FISS Hα and Ca ii 8542 Å line spectra at the time of the minifilament activation we determined a temperature of 8600 K and a nonthermal speed of 7.9 km s−1. During the eruption, the minifilament was no longer visible in the Ca ii 8542 Å line, and only the Hα line spectra were used to find the temperature of the minifilament, which reached 1.2 × 104 K and decreased afterward. We estimated thermal energy of 3.6 × 1024 erg from the maximum temperature and kinetic energy of 2.6 × 1024 erg from the rising speed (18 km s−1) of the minifilament. From the NIRIS magnetograms we found small-scale flux emergence and cancellation coincident with the minifilament eruption, and the magnetic energy change across the conjugate footpoints reaches 7.2 × 1025 erg. Such spectroscopic diagnostics of the chromospheric minifilament complement earlier studies of minifilament eruptions made using coronal images.

Polarization of starlight and thermal dust emission caused by aligned dust grains is a valuable tool to characterize magnetic fields (B-fields) and constrain dust properties. However, the grain alignment physics is not fully understood. To test the radiative torque (RAT) paradigm, including RAT alignment (RAT-A) and disruption (RAT-D), we use dust polarization observed by Planck and Stratosphere Observatory for Infrared Astronomy/High-resolution Airborne Wideband Camera Plus toward two filaments, Musca and OMC-1, with contrasting physical conditions. Musca, a quiescent filament, is ideal for testing RAT-A, while OMC-1, an active star-forming region OMC-1, is most suitable for testing RAT-D. We found that polarization fraction, P, decreases with increasing polarization angle dispersion function, , and increasing column density, N(H2), consistent with RAT-A. However, P increases with increasing dust temperature, Td, but decreases when Td reaches a certain high value. We compute the polarization fraction for the ideal models with B-fields in the plane of sky based on the RAT paradigm, accounting for the depolarization effect by B-field tangling. We then compare the realistic polarization model with observations. For Musca with well-ordered B-fields, our numerical model successfully reproduces the decline of P toward the filament spine (aka polarization hole), having higher N(H2) and lower Td, indicating the loss of grain alignment efficiency due to RAT-A. For OMC-1, with stronger B-field variations and higher temperatures, our model can reproduce the observed P–Td and P−N(H2) relations only if the B-field tangling and RAT-D effect are incorporated. Our results provide more robust observational evidence for the RAT paradigm, particularly the recently discovered RAT-D.

Using an established classification technique, we leverage standard observations and analyses to predict the progenitors of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). This technique, utilizing support vector machine statistics, provides a more nuanced prediction than the previous two-component Gaussian mixture in duration of the prompt gamma-ray emission. Based on further covariance testing from Fermi/Gamma Ray Burst Monitor, Swift/Burst Alert Telescope, and Swift/X-Ray Telescope data, we find that our classification based only on prompt emission properties gives perspective on the recent evidence that mergers and collapsars exist in both “long” and “short” GRB populations.

总结: 本研究利用JWST的新观测数据，对五颗原恒星的中心区域进行了亮CO基本发射的研究。通过提取两个振动带的近红外和中红外频谱中的CO线发射图像和通量，发现13CO未被探测到，表明12CO发射为光学薄。利用H2发射线对CO通量进行校正，并构建了CO线的旋转图，估计了旋转温度和CO分子数。对v=1需要两个不同的旋转温度组分，v=2需要一个更热的组分。13CO的流失表明选择性的UV光解作用，可能解释了v=2的更高旋转温度。平均振动温度约为1000K，与最低旋转温度组分相似。根据测得的旋转和振动温度推断CO分子的总数，我们发现总气体质量范围从约低限为10^22克的最小质量原恒星到约10^26克的最大质量原恒星。我们的气体质量下限与更成熟系统中的相吻合，暗示最低旋转温度组分来自内部盘，并且也不能排除来自较大质量目标的盘风对CO发射的贡献。<br /> <div>
We investigate the bright CO fundamental emission in the central regions of five protostars in their primary mass assembly phase using new observations from JWST’s Near-Infrared Spectrograph and Mid-Infrared Instrument. CO line emission images and fluxes are extracted for a forest of ∼150 rovibrational transitions from two vibrational bands, v = 1−0 and v = 2−1. However, 13CO is undetected, indicating that 12CO emission is optically thin. We use H2 emission lines to correct fluxes for extinction and then construct rotation diagrams for the CO lines with the highest spectral resolution and sensitivity to estimate rotational temperatures and numbers of CO molecules. Two distinct rotational temperature components are required for v = 1 (∼600 to 1000 K and 2000 to ∼104 K), while one hotter component is required for v = 2 (≳3500 K). 13CO is depleted compared to the abundances found in the interstellar medium, indicating selective UV photodissociation of 13CO; therefore, UV radiative pumping may explain the higher rotational temperatures in v = 2. The average vibrational temperature is ∼1000 K for our sources and is similar to the lowest rotational temperature components. Using the measured rotational and vibrational temperatures to infer a total number of CO molecules, we find that the total gas masses range from lower limits of ∼1022 g for the lowest mass protostars to ∼1026 g for the highest mass protostars. Our gas mass lower limits are compatible with those in more evolved systems, which suggest the lowest rotational temperature component comes from the inner disk, scattered into our line of sight, but we also cannot exclude the contribution to the CO emission from disk winds for higher mass targets.

观测低质量原恒星IRAS 15398-3359，发现CO和H2O气体在5μm和6-8μm波段的发射。CO的激发温度为1598±118 K，存在于热库中，而H2O的激发温度为204±7 K，较冷。CO和H2O的排放区域限制在离原恒星约40天文单位范围内。CO可能源自于内嵌的原恒星盘中或致密盘风中，而H2O可能源自于更大的发射区域，可能是盘的更为扩展的部分，或者是流出空腔的内部。对总体消光的更好约束，与真实盘模型的比较，以及未来的动力学分辨观测可能有助于确定真正的排放库。<br /><br />总结: <br />观测发现CO和H2O气体的不同激发温度和排放区域，可能源自于盘或盘风不同部分，需要更多观测和实验来确定真正的排放来源。 <div>
We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI) observations of warm CO and H2O gas in emission toward the low-mass protostar IRAS 15398-3359, observed as part of the CORINOS program. The CO is detected via the rovibrational fundamental band and hot band near 5 μm, whereas the H2O is detected in the rovibrational bending mode at 6–8 μm. Rotational analysis indicates that the CO originates in a hot reservoir with an excitation temperature of 1598 ± 118 K, while the water is much cooler at 204 ± 7 K. Neither the CO nor the H2O line images are significantly spatially extended, constraining the emission to within ∼40 au of the protostar. The compactness and high temperature of the CO are consistent with an origin in the embedded protostellar disk, or in a compact disk wind. In contrast, the water must arise from a cooler region and requires a larger emitting area (compared to the CO) to produce the observed fluxes. The water may arise from a more extended part of the disk, or from the inner portion of the outflow cavity. Thus, the origin of the molecular emission observed with JWST remains ambiguous. Better constraints on the overall extinction, comparison with realistic disk models, and future kinematically resolved observations may all help to pinpoint the true emitting reservoirs.

<div> 高红移、双活跃星系核、X射线源、贝叶斯因子、上限

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了62个高红移（2.5 < z < 3.5）X射线源，旨在确定高红移宇宙中双活跃星系核的频率。使用BAYMAX分析工具，对每个X射线源进行分析，未发现强有力的双活跃星系核证据。通过比较测得的贝叶斯因子分布和预期的单点源样本分布，未在样本中发现双活跃星系核。虽然该研究利用了最大的Chandra高z X射线点源目录，但结果受到源于高斯时空分辨率和探测源的典型计数率的限制。该研究得出在2.5 < z < 3.5范围内X射线双活跃星系核比例的上限为4.8%。未来需要更大范围、更暗的通量的X射线测量来大幅扩展这些结果，而AXIS任务概念有望在这方面发挥潜在作用。 <div>
We present an analysis searching for dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) among 62 high-redshift (2.5 < z < 3.5) X-ray sources selected from the X-UDS, AEGIS-XD, CDF-S, and COSMOS-Legacy Chandra surveys. We aim to quantify the frequency of dual AGN in the high-redshift Universe, which holds implications for black hole merger timescales and low-frequency gravitational wave detection rates. We analyze each X-ray source using BAYMAX, an analysis tool that calculates the Bayes factor for whether a given archival Chandra AGN is more likely a single or dual point source. We find no strong evidence for dual AGN in any individual source in our sample. We increase our sensitivity to search for dual AGN across the sample by comparing our measured distribution of Bayes factors to that expected from a sample composed entirely of single point sources and find no evidence for dual AGN in the sample distribution. Although our analysis utilizes one of the largest Chandra catalogs of high-z X-ray point sources available to study, the findings remain limited by the modest number of sources observed at the highest spatial resolution with Chandra and the typical count rates of the detected sources. Our nondetection allows us to place an upper limit on the X-ray dual AGN fraction at 2.5 < z < 3.5 of 4.8% at the 95% confidence level. Expanding substantially on these results at X-ray wavelengths will require future surveys spanning larger sky areas and extending to fainter fluxes than has been possible with Chandra. We illustrate the potential of the AXIS mission concept in this regard.

<br />
G型食双星对KM UMa的首次详细光度测定和光谱分析表明，该系统是一个短周期的独立食双星。根据光谱观测数据，确定了质量比q=0.45（±0.04）。利用TESS的光变曲线和其他调查数据，以及多波段观测，发现了正负的O'Connell效应，并且这些效应在过去20年中逐渐交替出现，这可以通过主星表面的黑斑来解释。此外，在SuperWASP数据中还检测到了一个超大耀斑事件，进一步表明KM UMa是一个非常活跃的系统。通过分析数百个中分辨率谱线和一个低分辨率谱线，发现Hα线的当量宽度变化，表明存在一个5.21（±0.67）年的磁活动周期。利用O-C方法分析了轨道周期的变化，检测到了一个长期减小的趋势以及一个周期性变化。周期性变化的振幅为0.01124（±0.00004）天，周期为33.66（±0.0012）年，超过了5.21年的活动周期，这更可能是由第三体的光行时效应造成的。同时，基于Gaia的星表观测数据，还发现了一个视星等伴星，表明KM UMa实际上处于一个2+1+1的等级四重星系统中。<br /><br />总结: 本文首次对G型食双星KM UMa进行了详细的光度和光谱分析，确定了其短周期性质，发现了O'Connell效应和超大耀斑事件，并且发现了5.21年的磁活动周期和更长周期的轨道周期变化，最后确认了KM UMa实际上是一个包含两个视伴星的等级四重星系统。 <div>
The first detailed photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the G-type eclipsing binary KM UMa is presented, which indicates that the system is a short-period detached eclipsing binary. The radial velocity curves were calculated using the cross-correlation function method based on Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope, Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and our observations, which determined the mass ratio as q = 0.45 (±0.04). Based on the light curves from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, other survey data, and our multiband observations, the positive and negative O’Connell effects have been detected evolving gradually and alternately over the last 20 yr, which can be explained by the presence of spots on the primary component. A superflare event was detected in the SuperWASP data on 2007 February 28, further indicating that KM UMa is a very active system. We calculated its energy to be 5 × 1034 erg by assuming it occurred on the primary star. Utilizing hundreds of medium-resolution spectra and one low-resolution spectrum, the equivalent width variations of the Hα line were calculated, indicating the presence of a 5.21 (±0.67) yr magnetic activity cycle. The orbital period variations were analyzed using the O–C method, detecting a long-term decrease superimposed with a periodic variation. The amplitude of the cyclic variation is 0.01124 (±0.00004) day, with a period of 33.66 (±0.0012) yr, which exceeds the 5.21 yr activity cycle, suggesting that this is more likely attributable to the light travel time effect of a third body. Simultaneously, a visual companion has been detected based on the Gaia astrometric data, indicating that KM UMa is actually in a 2+1+1 hierarchical quadruple system.

这项研究探讨了新发现的行星宿主双星TOI-1173 A/B，利用高分辨率光谱分析了它们的化学成分。研究发现，TOI-1173 A 显著富含铁等高凝聚温度元素，暗示可能发生了约18地球质量的岩石材料被吞没到星A内部的情况。这一假设得到了该系统动力学的支持，表明超级海王星TOI-1173 A b可能是通过环化和von Zeipel–Lidov–Kozai机制被送至目前的短周期轨道，从而触发了内部岩石类行星的吞没事件。这一发现对于了解行星形成和双星系统中的化学演化具有重要意义。<br /><br />总结: 该研究通过对TOI-1173 A/B双星系统进行化学成分分析，发现TOI-1173 A富含高凝聚温度元素，暗示发生了约18地球质量的岩石材料被吞没的情况，该假设得到了系统动力学的支持。 <div>
Over the last decade, studies of large samples of binary systems have identified chemical anomalies and shown that they might be attributed to planet formation or planet engulfment. However, both scenarios have primarily been tested in pairs without known exoplanets. In this work, we explore these scenarios in the newly detected planet-hosting wide binary TOI-1173 A/B (projected separation ∼11,400 au), using high-resolution MAROON-X and ARCES spectra. We determined photospheric stellar parameters both by fitting stellar models and via the spectroscopic equilibrium approach. Both analyses agree and suggest that they are cool main-sequence stars located in the thin disk. A line-by-line differential analysis between the components (B−A) displays an abundance pattern in the condensation temperature plane, where the planet-hosting star TOI-1173 A is enhanced in refractory elements such as iron by more than 0.05 dex. This suggests the engulfment of ∼18 M⊕ of rocky material in star A. Our hypothesis is supported by the dynamics of the system (detailed in our companion paper), which suggest that the super-Neptune TOI-1173 A b might have been delivered to its current short period (∼7 days) through circularization and von Zeipel–Lidov–Kozai mechanisms, thereby triggering the engulfment of inner rocky exoplanets.

<br />
总结: <br />
本文研究了利用X射线观测提供重要见解的太阳耀斑中非热电子的加速和传播。研究发现，在耀斑条件下，传统的冷靶模型无法很好地描述低能截断，因此引入了温靶模型来更好地描述能谱。另外，研究还发现卡帕分布作为电子注入的更合适表示形式，并且在两次M级耀斑的分析中得到了较好的拟合结果。最后，研究还表明使用卡帕分布能够提供有关电子加速过程的宝贵信息，包括总电子数密度和平均能量。 <div>
X-ray observations provide important and valuable insights into the acceleration and propagation of nonthermal electrons during solar flares. Improved X-ray spectral analysis requires a deeper understanding of the dynamics of energetic electrons. Previous studies have demonstrated that the dynamics of accelerated electrons with a few thermal speeds are more complex than those with significantly higher speeds. To better describe the energetic electrons after injection, a model considering energy diffusion and thermalization effects in flare conditions (the warm-target model) has recently been developed for spectral analysis of hard X-rays. This model has demonstrated how the low-energy cutoff, which can hardly be constrained in cold-target modeling, can be determined. However, the power-law form may not be the most suitable representation of injected electrons. The kappa distribution, which is proposed as a physical consequence of electron acceleration, has been applied successfully in RHESSI spectral analysis. In this study, we employ the kappa-form injected electrons in the warm-target model to analyze two M-class flares, observed by RHESSI and the Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays, respectively. The best-fit results show that the kappa-form energetic electron spectrum generates lower nonthermal energy than the power-law form when producing a similar photon spectrum in the fit range. We also demonstrated that the fit parameters associated with the kappa-form electron spectrum can be well determined with small uncertainty. Further, the kappa distribution, which covers the entire electron energy range, enables the determination of key electron properties such as total electron number density and average energy at the flare site, providing valuable information on electron acceleration processes.

We present results from our deep far-ultraviolet (FUV) survey using AstroSat/UVIT of a filamentary structure at z ∼0.072. A total of four filaments comprising 58 galaxies were probed in our study. We detect 18 filament galaxies in our FUV observation. All filament galaxies are further classified based on their photometric color, nuclear activity, and morphology. The filaments contain galaxies with mixed stellar population types and structures. We do not detect galaxies in our UVIT survey up to a distance of 0.4 Mpc h−1 from the filament axis, implying a lack of recent star formation in the inner region of filaments. The FUV star formation rate (SFR) for star-forming galaxies agrees well with the SFR144MHz calculated using Low-Frequency Array radio-continuum observations. We witness an increase in the FUV specific-SFR (sSFR) of filament galaxies with increasing distance from the filament spine (Dfil). The intermediate-to-high stellar mass filament galaxies were more star-forming than cluster galaxies in a fixed stellar mass bin. The FUV morphology of some filament galaxies detected in the filament outskirts (Dfil ≳ 0.7 Mpc h−1) is comparable to or slightly extended than their optical counterpart. The mass assembly of galaxies examined by estimating (FUV − r) color gradients shows that more “red-cored’ galaxies reside in the outer region of the filaments. Our results prove that the likelihood of merger interaction and gas starvation increases when approaching the filament spine. We report a definitive and inhomogeneous impact of filaments on the galaxies residing inside them.

Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) images of the horizon-scale emission around the Galactic center supermassive black hole Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) favor accretion flow models with a jet component. However, this jet has not been conclusively detected. Using the “best-bet” models of Sgr A* from the EHT Collaboration, we assess whether this nondetection is expected for current facilities and explore the prospects of detecting a jet with very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) at four frequencies: 86, 115, 230, and 345 GHz. We produce synthetic image reconstructions for current and next-generation VLBI arrays at these frequencies that include the effects of interstellar scattering, optical depth, and time variability. We find that no existing VLBI arrays are expected to detect the jet in these best-bet models, consistent with observations to date. We show that next-generation VLBI arrays at 86 and 115 GHz—in particular, the EHT after upgrades through the ngEHT program and the ngVLA—successfully capture the jet in our tests due to improvements in instrument sensitivity and (u, v) coverage at spatial scales critical to jet detection. These results highlight the potential of enhanced VLBI capabilities in the coming decade to reveal the crucial properties of Sgr A* and its interaction with the Galactic center environment.

One of the most serious limitations of current astrochemical models with the rate equation (RE) approach is that only a single type of binding site is considered in grain surface chemistry, although laboratory and quantum chemical studies have found that surfaces contain various binding sites with different potential energy depths. When various sites exist, adsorbed species can be trapped in deep potential sites, increasing the resident time on the surface. On the other hand, adsorbed species can be populated in shallow sites, activating thermal hopping and thus two-body reactions even at low temperatures, where the thermal hopping from deeper sites is not activated. Such behavior cannot be described by the conventional RE approach. In this work, I present a framework for incorporating various binding sites (i.e., binding energy distribution) in gas-ice astrochemical models as an extension of the conventional RE approach. I propose a simple method to estimate the probability density function (pdf) for the occupation of various sites by adsorbed species, assuming a quasi-steady state. By using thermal desorption and hopping rates weighted by the pdfs, the effect of binding energy distribution is incorporated into the RE approach without increasing the number of ordinary differential equations to be solved. This method is found to be accurate and computationally efficient, and enables us to consider binding energy distribution even for a large gas-ice chemical network which contains hundreds of icy species. The impact of the binding energy distribution on interstellar ice composition is discussed quantitatively for the first time.

In the upcoming gravitational-wave (GW) observing runs, identifying host galaxies is crucial as it provides essential redshift information and enables the use of GW events as standard sirens. However, pinpointing host galaxies remains challenging due to the large localization uncertainties and the rapidly fading nature of their optical counterparts. Analyzing the host galaxies of short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) offers an alternative approach to deepen our understanding of the environments where binary neutron stars (BNS) primarily merge. This study compiles archival photometric data for the host galaxies of 76 sGRBs and four hybrid GRBs that are long GRBs accompanied by kilonova-like signals. We use this data to evaluate their physical properties through spectral energy distribution fitting. To assess the characteristics of the host galaxies, we utilized a volume-limited sample (z < 0.5) from the COSMOS field as a control group. Contrary to expectations that the BNS merger rate is proportional to host stellar mass, the short and hybrid GRB population appears less massive than the mass-weighted distribution of the control sample. Instead, we propose a formulation for the expected BNS merger rate from a galaxy as + , which optimally explains the deviation between the stellar mass distributions of the GRB host galaxies and the control sample. These insights provide a strategic framework for targeted GW follow-ups and enhance our ability to identify potential host galaxies for future GW events.

Massive evolved stars such as red supergiants and hypergiants are potential progenitors of Type II supernovae, and they are known for ejecting substantial amounts of matter, up to half their initial mass, during their final evolutionary phases. The rate and mechanism of this mass loss play a crucial role in determining their ultimate fate and the likelihood of their progression to supernovae. However, the exact mechanisms driving this mass ejection have long been a subject of research. Recent observations, such as the Great Dimming of Betelgeuse, have suggested that the activity of large convective cells, combined with pulsation, could be a plausible explanation for such mass-loss events. In this context, we conducted interferometric observations of the famous yellow hypergiant, ρ Cassiopeiae using the CHARA Array in H- and K-band wavelengths. ρ Cas is well known for its recurrent eruptions, characterized by periods of visual dimming (∼1.5–2 mag) followed by recovery. From our observations, we derived the diameter of the limb-darkened disk and found that this star has a radius of 1.04 ± 0.01 mas, or 564–700 R⊙. We performed image reconstructions with three different image reconstruction software packages, and they unveiled the presence of giant hot and cold spots on the stellar surface. We interpret these prominent hot spots as giant convection cells, suggesting a possible connection to mass ejections from the star’s envelope. Furthermore, we detected spectral CO emission lines in the K band (λ = 2.31–2.38 μm), and the image reconstructions in these spectral lines revealed an extended circumstellar envelope with a radius of 1.45 ± 0.10 mas.

总结: <br />这篇文章对类星体1604+159进行了多频率极化研究，发现了类星体呈现出类似Fanaroff–Riley I型结构的对称形态，具有多个叶状结构和凸起，形成一个蚕茧状形态。观测还发现了两个热点，呈现出对称的结构，热点间的流量密度比值表明存在多普勒爆发效应。极化辐射也展示出符合喷流方向的对称结构。研究还发现喷流在几处发生弯曲，其中边缘的极化强度和比例较高。文章讨论了观测结构和磁场的可能起源。<br /> <div>
We present a multifrequency polarimetric study for the quasar 1604+159. The source was observed at the L band with the American Very Long Baseline Array and the L, X, and U bands with the Very Large Array. These observations provide different resolutions from mas to arcsec, enabling us to probe the morphology and magnetic field from tens of parsec to hundreds of kiloparsec scale. We detect a symmetrical Fanaroff–Riley Class I–like structure. The source has several lobes and bulges, forming a cocoon shape. The polarization is normal to the edges of the structure with high fractional polarization up to ∼60%. Two hotspots are observed at the eastern and western sides of the source, located symmetrically relative to the core. The flux density ratio (>1.5) between the two hotspots suggests the Doppler beaming effect exists at a large scale. The polarized emission in the hotspots also shows a symmetrical structure with an oblique direction from the jet direction. In general, the jet propagates in a collimating structure with several bends. Polarization is also detected perpendicular to the local jet from ∼100 mas to ∼1″. The jet shows strong polarized intensity and high fractional polarization at the bending edges. We discuss the possible origins of the observed structure and magnetic field.

<div> 关键词: 通量-纳贝尔方程-黑洞-中微子-浓缩物质<br />
总结: <br />这篇文章研究了黑洞吸积盘风系统的中微子辐射。在模拟初期发现了电子激元数（ELN）-额外激元数（XLN）交叉现象，但随着时间推移，这种交叉现象只在赤道附近存在。文章对中微子辐射场的几何结构和演变进行了详细分析，并通过与其他发表作品的定性评估，讨论了造成差异的原因。研究发现的ELN-XLN交叉及快速味道不稳定性的几何结构和演变对中子星并合的重元素核成因具有重要意义。 <br /> <div>
We postprocess a three-dimensional, general relativistic, full transport neutrino radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulation of the black-hole-accretion disk-wind system thought to be a potential outcome of the GW170817 merger to investigate the presence of electron lepton number (ELN-XLN) crossings in the neutrino angular distribution. Neutrinos are evolved with an explicit Monte Carlo method and can interact with matter via emission, absorption, or scattering. Within the postprocessing framework, we find ubiquitous occurrence of ELN-XLN crossings at early times (∼11 ms), but this does not hold for later times in the simulation. At postmerger times of ∼60 ms and beyond, ELN-XLN crossings are only present near the equator. We provide a detailed analysis of the neutrino radiation field to investigate the origin and time evolution of these crossings. Previous reports have suggested ubiquitous flavor crossings persisting throughout the simulation lifetime, albeit for different sets of conditions for the merger remnant, the treatment of hydrodynamics, and neutrino transport. Even though we do not perform a direct comparison with other published works, we qualitatively assess the reasons for the difference with our results. The geometric structure and evolution of the ELN-XLN crossings found in our analysis, and by extension, fast flavor instabilities, have important implications for heavy element nucleosynthesis in neutron star mergers.

<div> Alfvén waves, solar wind, turbulence, dynamic alignment, Helios 2 spacecraft
<br /><br />总结:
本文研究了太阳风动力学对动态对齐的影响。研究表明太阳风的湍流受动态对齐影响，但小尺度上并无动态对齐。通过Helios 2航天器观测慢速太阳风间隔，发现只有反向Alfvén波会经历动态对齐，非Alfvén结构则不参与对齐过程。研究还发现，随着尺度缩小，反向Alfvén波的功率比逐渐减小，而非Alfvén结构的功率比在增加。这暗示着需要新的理论模型来充分解释太阳风的可压缩性、间歇性和不平衡性。 <div>
The solar wind dynamics are thought to be governed by counter-propagating Alfvén waves. Alfvén waves generate a turbulent cascade through nonlinear couplings between shearing wave packets. However, imbalances, structures, and intermittency complicate the solar wind’s magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. Simulations and theories have suggested that dynamic alignment, or the tendency for velocity and magnetic fluctuations to become more correlated as a function of scale, may dictate the turbulent cascade. Observations have hinted at dynamic alignment at large scales but remain inconclusive at small scales. To investigate the nature of dynamically aligning fluctuations in the solar wind, we examine slow wind intervals from the Helios 2 spacecraft. We develop a two-component model of solar wind turbulence consisting of Alfvénic and non-Alfvénic contributions. We assume that only counter-propagating Alfvén waves experience dynamic alignment, and the non-Alfvénic structures do not participate in the alignment process. Our model allows us to constrain the relative contribution of inward Alfvén waves and non-Alfvénic structures with respect to the amplitude of outward Alfvén waves in the slow solar wind as a function of scale under the assumption of dynamic alignment. We show that the power ratio of inward to outward Alfvén fluctuations decreases as a function of scale. At the same time, the non-Alfvénic structures to outward Alfvén fluctuations increase with decreasing scale. Increasing structures provide a possible explanation for no dynamic alignment at small scales. Our study implies the need for new theoretical models to fully account for the solar wind’s compressibility, intermittency, and imbalanced nature.

总结:<br /><br />文章介绍了Vera C. Rubin Observatory的独特性，以及它所采用的活跃光学系统来控制图像质量。研究还介绍了一种结构化方法来识别和解决调整自由度过多和由于噪音导致的退化问题。通过截断奇异值分解的新比例策略，该方法能够最大限度地分配调整度，确保实现最佳图像质量。这种方法不仅适用于Rubin Observatory，还可能对所有具有大量调整自由度的望远镜产生显著的益处。 <div>
The Vera C. Rubin Observatory is a unique facility for survey astronomy that will soon be commissioned and begin operations. Crucial to many of its scientific goals is the achievement of sustained high image quality, limited only by the seeing at the site. This will be maintained through an active optics system that controls optical element misalignments and corrects mirror figure error to minimize aberrations caused by both thermal and gravitational effects. However, the large number of adjustment degrees of freedom available on the Rubin Observatory introduces a range of degeneracies, including many that are induced by noise due to imperfect measurement of the wave-front errors. We present a structured methodology for identifying these degeneracies through an analysis of image noise level. We also present a novel scaling strategy based on truncated singular value decomposition that mitigates the degeneracy and optimally distributes the adjustment over the available degrees of freedom. Our approach ensures the attainment of optimal image quality, while avoiding excursions around the noise-induced subspace of degeneracies, marking a significant improvement over the previous techniques adopted for Rubin, which were based on an optimal integral controller. This new approach is likely to also yield significant benefits for all telescopes that incorporate large numbers of degrees of freedom of adjustment.

<div> 能谱、尖峰尺度、涡度、涡旋、星系团
<br /><br />总结:
本研究利用连续小波变换技术分析了宇宙流体速度场的湍流运动，并通过IllustrisTNG模拟数据构建了全局和环境相关的小波统计特征，如能谱和峰度，研究了湍流运动的波动和间歇性。研究发现能谱的峰值尺度定义了一个特征尺度，可视为湍流的整体尺度，而奈奎斯特波数可视为耗散尺度。有了这两个特征尺度，能谱可分为能量包含范围、惯性范围和耗散范围。小波峰度是波数k的增函数，随着k的增加而迅速变化，然后变化缓慢，表明宇宙流体随着波数k的增加变得更加间歇。在能量包含范围内，能谱在z = 2到1之间显著增加，但在z = 1到0之间几乎保持不变。环境相关的能谱和峰度与全局特征相似，而且在最低密度环境中能谱的幅度最小，在最高密度环境中最大，表明高密度环境中的宇宙流体湍动比低密度环境中更加剧烈。在惯性范围内，能谱的指数比科尔莫哥洛夫和波尔格指数更陡，表明了更有效的能量转移。 <div>
We use continuous wavelet transform techniques to construct the global and environment-dependent wavelet statistics, such as energy spectrum and kurtosis, to study the fluctuation and intermittency of the turbulent motion in the cosmic fluid velocity field with the IllustrisTNG simulation data. We find that the peak scale of the energy spectrum defines a characteristic scale, which can be regarded as the integral scale of turbulence, and the Nyquist wavenumber can be regarded as the dissipation scale. With these two characteristic scales, the energy spectrum can be divided into the energy-containing range, the inertial range, and the dissipation range of turbulence. The wavelet kurtosis is an increasing function of the wavenumber k, which first grows rapidly then slowly with k, indicating that the cosmic fluid becomes increasingly intermittent with k. In the energy-containing range, the energy spectrum increases significantly from z = 2 to 1, but remains almost unchanged from z = 1 to 0. We find that both the environment-dependent spectrum and kurtosis are similar to the global ones, and the magnitude of the spectrum is smallest in the lowest-density and largest in the highest-density environment, suggesting that the cosmic fluid is more turbulent in a high-density than in a low-density environment. In the inertial range, the energy spectrum’s exponent is steeper than both the Kolmogorov and Burgers exponents, indicating more efficient energy transfer compared to Kolmogorov or Burgers turbulence.

<div> AGN, massive stars, accretion, radiation hydrodynamic simulations, fast-diffusion regime
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了在活动星系核盘中形成或捕获的超大恒星，并通过模拟发现了它们的气体吸积过程。在“快扩散”和“慢扩散”两种不同的情况下，发现了不同的吸积速率和关键半径，并指出了在实际环境中的应用。文章强调了1D长期计算中需要注意的一些问题。 <div>
Massive stars may form in or be captured into active galactic nuclei (AGN) disks. Recent 1D studies employing stellar-evolution codes have demonstrated the potential for rapid growth of such stars through accretion up to a few hundred solar masses. We perform 3D radiation hydrodynamic simulations of moderately massive stars’ envelopes in order to determine the rate and critical radius Rcrit of their accretion process in an isotropic gas-rich environment in the absence of luminosity-driven mass loss. We find that in the “fast-diffusion” regime where characteristic radiative diffusion speed c/τ is faster than the gas sound speed cs, the accretion rate is suppressed by feedback from gravitational and radiative advection energy flux, in addition to the stellar luminosity. Alternatively, in the “slow-diffusion” regime where c/τ < cs, due to adiabatic accretion, the stellar envelope expands quickly to become hydrostatic and further net accretion occurs on thermal timescales in the absence of self-gravity. When the radiation entropy of the medium is less than that of the star, however, this hydrostatic envelope can become more massive than the star itself. Within this subregime, the self-gravity of the envelope excites runaway growth. Applying our results to realistic environments, moderately massive stars (≲100M⊙) embedded in AGN disks typically accrete in the fast-diffusion regime, leading to a reduction of steady-state accretion rate 1–2 orders of magnitudes lower than expected by previous 1D calculations and Rcrit smaller than the disk scale height, except in the opacity window at temperature T ∼ 2000 K. Accretion in slow diffusion regime occurs in regions with very high density ρ ≳ 10−9 g cm−3, and needs to be treated with caution in 1D long-term calculations.

总结:<br />
这项研究利用TNG50模拟的数据发现，银河系的高速云可能有着多种不同的起源。通过追踪TNG50 Milky Way−like galaxy模拟中冷、密云团的来源，发现只有17%来自盘内，21%来自卫星被剥离的物质，而大多数（62%）高速云是由环银河热气体经由热不稳定性冷却形成的，并通过与旋转的环银河介质相互作用获得其异常的速度。综合来看，这些结果表明银河系的高速云在来源上具有高度的异质性，并能够为形成环银河介质的物理过程提供深入的见解，例如盘上的流出、卫星的吸积和热不稳定性。 <div>
The origin of our Galaxy’s high-velocity clouds (HVCs) remains a mystery after many decades of effort. In this paper, we use the TNG50 simulation of the IllustrisTNG project to identify cool, dense clouds that match observations of Galactic H i HVCs. We track these clouds back in time to determine their origin. For a TNG50 Milky Way−like galaxy, we find that only 17% of HVCs can be tracked directly to the disk and 21% to material stripped out of satellites. The majority of HVCs (62%) arise from warm and hot circumgalactic gas that cools through thermal instability. They then obtain their anomalous velocities through interactions with the turbulent circumgalactic medium. At TNG50 resolution, we do not see evidence for HVCs forming out of very low metallicity intergalactic material. Instead, low-metallicity HVCs are most likely associated with satellites. These results suggest that Galactic HVCs are highly heterogeneous in their origin and can provide insight into the physical processes that shape the circumgalactic medium, such as disk outflows, satellite accretion, and thermal instabilities.

利用太阳动力学观测卫星（SDO）和太阳和日球层观测卫星（SOHO）的观测，研究了1999年至2021年间30个明显的电流片，包括SDO的10个在太阳盘面上和8个在边缘，以及SOHO的12个在边缘。每个在太阳盘面上的电流片是由两组大气结构的X型配置形成的，而每个边缘的电流片都涉及耀斑 - 日冕物质抛射事件。在磁重连期间，太阳盘面上的明显电流片从一个明亮点演变为一个细长的线状结构，在重连的后期结构变得很薄。随后，电流片内的等离子体分布呈现为一串等离子体小结。对于边缘的明显电流片，其长度延伸速度快于太阳盘面上的电流片，并且也检测到了变薄的过程。尽管边缘案例的长宽比与模拟研究中撕裂模式不稳定性的发生值相当，但在这些边缘电流片中并没有明显的等离子体小结，并且密度分布局部均匀。我们认为，由于边缘案例的迅速延伸，撕裂模式的不稳定性非常快，导致形成比仪器分辨率更小的微小等离子体小结。此外，还有另一种可能情况。观测到的边缘明显电流片只是一个明亮的射线，实际的电流片只是射线的一个小片段。
<br /><br />总结: 该研究利用SDO和SOHO观测了30个明显的太阳电流片，发现在太阳盘面上和边缘的电流片形成过程和特征有所不同。在磁重连期间，电流片从明亮点演变为细长的线状结构，随后形成等离子体小结。边缘电流片的长度延伸速度更快，并且没有明显的等离子体小结。这对于太阳物理领域的研究具有重要意义。 <div>
Based on observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), we investigate 30 apparent current sheets during 1999–2021, including 10 on-disk and 8 limb ones from the SDO, as well as 12 limb ones from the SOHO. Each on-disk current sheet is formed among an X-type configuration consisting of two sets of atmospheric structures, and each limb one is involved in a flare–coronal mass ejection event. During magnetic reconnection period, the on-disk apparent current sheet evolves from a bright point to an elongated line-like structure, and the structure becomes thin in the late stage of the reconnection. Subsequently, the plasma distribution within the current sheet manifests as a plasmoid chain. For the limb apparent current sheet, the length elongation is faster than that of the on-disk one, and the thinning process is also detected. Although the aspect ratios of the limb cases are comparable to the value for the occurrence of tearing mode instability from simulation research, no obvious plasmoid chain is detected within these limb current sheets, and the density distribution is locally uniform. We suggest that due to the rapid extension of limb cases, the tearing mode instability is very fast, resulting in the formation of tiny plasmoids that are smaller than the instrument resolution. Moreover, there is another possible scenario. The observed limb apparent current sheet is just a bright ray, and the actual current sheet is only a small segment of the ray.

Detecting planet signatures in protoplanetary disks is fundamental to understanding how and where planets form. In this work, we report dust and gas observational hints of planet formation in the disk around 2MASS J16120668-301027, as part of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Large Program “AGE-PRO: ALMA survey of Gas Evolution in Protoplanetary disks.” The disk was imaged with the ALMA at Band 6 (1.3 mm) in dust continuum emission and four molecular lines: 12CO(J = 2–1), 13CO(J = 2–1), C18O(J = 2–1), and H2CO(J = 3(3,0)–2(2,0)). Resolved observations of the dust continuum emission (angular resolution of ∼150 mas, 20 au) show a ring-like structure with a peak at 0.″57 (75 au), a deep gap with a minimum at 0.″24 (31 au), an inner disk, a bridge connecting the inner disk and the outer ring, along with a spiral arm structure, and a tentative detection (to 3σ) of a compact emission at the center of the disk gap, with an estimated dust mass of ∼2.7−12.9 Lunar masses. We also detected a kinematic kink (not coincident with any dust substructure) through several 12CO channel maps (angular resolution ∼200 mas, 30 au), located at a radius of ∼0.″875 (115.6 au). After modeling the 12CO velocity rotation around the protostar, we identified a purple tentative rotating-like structure at the kink location with a geometry similar to that of the disk. We discuss potential explanations for the dust and gas substructures observed in the disk and their potential connection to signatures of planet formation.

X-ray polarization provides a new way to probe accretion geometry in black hole systems. If the accretion geometry of black holes is similar regardless of mass, we should expect the same to be true of their polarization properties. We compare the polarimetric properties of all nonblazar black holes observed with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer. We find that their polarization properties are very similar, particularly in the hard state, where the corona dominates. This tentatively supports the idea that stellar and supermassive black holes share a common coronal geometry.

About 25%–50% of white dwarfs (WDs) are found to be polluted by heavy elements. It has been argued that the pollution could be caused by the tidal disruption of an approaching planet around the WD, during which a large number of clumps would be produced and would finally fall onto the WD. The reason that the planet approaches the WD is usually believed to be due to gravitational perturbations from another distant planet or stellar companion. However, the dynamics of the perturbations and the detailed partial disruption process are still poorly understood. In this study, we present an in-depth investigation of these issues. A triple system composed of a WD, an inner orbit planet, and an outer orbit planet is considered. The inner planet would be partially disrupted periodically over its long-term evolution. Fragments generated in the process are affected by gravitational perturbations from the remnant planet, facilitating their fall toward the WD. The mass-loss rate of the inner planet depends on both its internal structure and also on the orbital configuration of the planetary system.

<div> NGC 6822, low-metallicity, dwarf galaxy, CNM, LGLBS
总结:
NGC 6822是局部星系群中一个低金属量的矮星系，通过Local Group L-band Survey（LGLBS）的高空间和光谱分辨率探测到了两个局部的原子氢中性吸收特征，这是在麦哲伦云之外的低金属量矮星系中首次明确探测到冷中性介质（CNM）。研究使用了自定义管线对高角分辨率的H i吸收进行搜索，并提取相关的H i发射。进一步的高斯分解和辐射传输分析显示了五个CNM成分，并揭示了其关键特性：平均自旋温度为32 ± 6 K，平均CNM柱密度为3.1 × 1020 cm−2，以及两个视线的CNM质量分数分别为0.33和0.12。H i吸收与星形成区域相交，而H i吸收轮廓包括了CO（2−1）发射，表明了分子气体的巧合和高分辨率H i发射的抑制。进一步分析了附近的一个视线，发现了深而窄的H i自吸收，在这里，背景的暖中性介质被中间的CNM所吸收。CNM、CO和Hα发射的关联暗示了NGC 6822中较冷、较密的H i相和星形成之间的密切联系。 <div>
Measuring the properties of the cold neutral medium (CNM) in low-metallicity galaxies provides insights into heating and cooling mechanisms in early Universe-like environments. We report detections of two localized atomic neutral hydrogen (H i) absorption features in NGC 6822, a low-metallicity (0.2 Z⊙) dwarf galaxy in the Local Group. These are the first unambiguous CNM detections in a low-metallicity dwarf galaxy outside the Magellanic Clouds. The Local Group L-band Survey (LGLBS) enabled these detections, due to its high spatial (15 pc for H i emission) and spectral (0.4 km s−1) resolution. We introduce LGLBS and describe a custom pipeline for searching for H i absorption at high angular resolution and extracting associated H i emission. A detailed Gaussian decomposition and radiative transfer analysis of the NGC 6822 detections reveals five CNM components, with key properties: a mean spin temperature of 32 ± 6 K, a mean CNM column density of 3.1 × 1020 cm−2, and CNM mass fractions of 0.33 and 0.12 for the two sightlines. Stacking nondetections does not reveal low-level signals below our median optical depth sensitivity of 0.05. One detection intercepts a star-forming region, with the H i absorption profile encompassing the CO (2−1) emission, indicating coincident molecular gas and a depression in high-resolution H i emission. We also analyze a nearby sightline with deep, narrow H i self-absorption dips, where the background warm neutral medium is attenuated by intervening CNM. The association of CNM, CO, and Hα emissions suggests a close link between the colder, denser H i phase and star formation in NGC 6822.

<div> 关键词: Gaia mission, astrometric binaries, machine learning, artificial neural network, classification

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章提出了利用Gaia任务收集的数据，通过机器学习技术来自动分类恒星是否属于测量二元系统。研究使用了人工神经网络，并利用了高精度的数据进行训练和测试。结果表明，该方法在分类恒星时具有很高的准确性和效率，是一个有前景的替代方法。 <div>
With nearly two billion stars observed and their corresponding astrometric parameters evaluated in the recent Gaia mission, the number of astrometric binary candidates has risen significantly. Due to the surplus of astrometric data, the current computational methods employed to inspect these astrometric binary candidates are both computationally expensive and cannot be executed in a reasonable time frame. In light of this, a machine learning (ML) technique to automatically classify whether a set of stars belongs to an astrometric binary pair via an artificial neural network (ANN) is proposed. Using data from Gaia Data Release 3, the ANN was trained and tested on 1.5 million highly probable true and visual binaries, considering the proper motions, parallaxes, and angular and physical separations as features. The ANN achieves high classification scores, with an accuracy of 99.3%, a precision rate of 0.988, a recall rate of 0.991, and an area under the curve of 0.999, indicating that the utilized ML technique is a highly effective method for classifying astrometric binaries. Thus, the proposed ANN is a promising alternative to the existing methods for the classification of astrometric binaries.

<div> Seyfert 1 galaxy, Mrk 817, XMM-Newton/NuSTAR observations, ionized wind, absorption lines
<br />
在Seyfert 1星系Mrk 817的XMM-Newton和NuSTAR观测中，发现了出乎意料的临时遮挡流，这在该源中以前从未见过。通过高分辨率光栅光谱中的吸收特征，确定遮挡物实际上是一种多相离子化风，具有约5200 km s−1的出流速度，并首次发现在同时期的哈勃空间望远镜光谱中观测到了与相同速度的吸收特征相同离子化的下限组分。我们观察到吸收线的形状在几小时的时间尺度上发生变化，如果归因于沿视线的横向运动，则可将可变组分放置在大约1000个Schwarzschild半径，这一估计与对遮挡物距离独立UV测量相一致，表明存在于内部宽线区域的一个吸积盘风。我们估计出流需要大约200天从盘面到我们的视线，这与整个观测过程中流的柱密度变化的时间尺度一致。
<br /><br />总结: Seyfert 1星系Mrk 817的观测发现了一种之前未见的离子化风遮挡物，其在X射线和紫外线光谱中的吸收特征表现出多相并具有变化。测量距离遮挡物的方法为对相同参数的独立测量进行了估计。 <div>
We present the results of the XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations taken as part of the ongoing, intensive multiwavelength monitoring program of the Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk 817 by the AGN Space Telescope and Optical Reverberation Mapping 2 (AGN STORM 2) Project. The campaign revealed an unexpected and transient obscuring outflow, never before seen in this source. Of our four XMM-Newton/NuSTAR epochs, one fortuitously taken during a bright X-ray state has strong narrow absorption lines in the high-resolution grating spectra. From these absorption features, we determine that the obscurer is in fact a multiphase ionized wind with an outflow velocity of ∼5200 km s−1, and for the first time find evidence for a lower ionization component with the same velocity observed in absorption features in the contemporaneous Hubble Space Telescope spectra. This indicates that the UV absorption troughs may be due to dense clumps embedded in diffuse, higher ionization gas responsible for the X-ray absorption lines of the same velocity. We observe variability in the shape of the absorption lines on timescales of hours, placing the variable component at roughly 1000 Rg if attributed to transverse motion along the line of sight. This estimate aligns with independent UV measurements of the distance to the obscurer suggesting an accretion disk wind at the inner broad line region. We estimate that it takes roughly 200 days for the outflow to travel from the disk to our line of sight, consistent with the timescale of the outflow's column density variations throughout the campaign.

It is generally recognized that the electromagnetic multipolar emission from magnetars can be used to explain radiation from soft gamma repeaters or anomalous X-ray pulsars, but they have little impact on the spin-down of magnetars. We here present an analytical solution for the neutron star multipolar electromagnetic fields and their associated expected luminosities. We find that for newborn millisecond magnetars, the spin-down luminosity from higher multipolar components can match or even exceed that from the dipole component. Such high-intensity radiation will undoubtedly affect related astrophysical phenomena at the birth of a magnetar. We show that the spin-down luminosity from multipoles can well explain the majority of gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows, from the plateau starting at several hundred seconds until the normal decay phase lasting for many years. The fitted magnetar parameters for GRB afterglows are all typical values, with spins in the millisecond range and magnetic field strengths on the order of 1014–1015 G. Our results, in turn, provide support for the hypothesis that GRBs originate from the birth of magnetars with a period of a few milliseconds, thus deepening our understanding of the complex magnetic field structure and the equation of state of magnetars.

总结:
研究通过高分辨率数值模拟和风洞模拟，了解尘埃在热银河风中的演化和存活情况。发现尘埃在所有情况下都能够在风中存活，甚至在没有冷相遮挡的情况下也是如此。根据模拟云团特性，估计0.1μm尘埃能够有60%存活并分布在晕气和冷相。还研究了尘埃颗粒大小对结果的影响，发现小于0.01μm的颗粒无法抵御热相暴露，说明观测到的CGM中的小颗粒要么是由大颗粒破碎产生，要么是在冷相中带到那里。最后，还表明尘埃气比随着距离的增加而下降，这为观测到的宇宙中大量尘埃提供了一个解释。<br /><br /> <div>
We present a suite of high-resolution numerical simulations to study the evolution and survival of dust in hot galactic winds. We implement a novel dust framework in the Cholla hydrodynamics code and use wind tunnel simulations of cool, dusty clouds to understand how thermal sputtering affects the dust content of galactic winds. Our simulations illustrate how various regimes of cloud evolution impact dust survival, dependent on cloud size, wind properties, and dust grain size. We find that significant amounts of dust can survive in winds in all scenarios, even without shielding from the cool phase of outflows. We present an analytic framework that explains this result, along with an analysis of the impact of cloud evolution on the total fraction of dust survival. Using these results, we estimate that 60% of 0.1 μm dust that enters a starburst-driven wind could survive to populate both the hot and cool phases of the halo, based on a simulated distribution of cloud properties. We also investigate how these conclusions depend on grain size, exploring grains from 0.1 μm to 10 Å. Under most circumstances, grains smaller than 0.01 μm cannot withstand hot-phase exposure, suggesting that the small grains observed in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) are either formed in situ due to the shattering of larger grains, or must be carried there in the cool phase of outflows. Finally, we show that the dust-to-gas ratio of clouds declines as a function of distance from the galaxy due to cloud–wind mixing and condensation. These results provide an explanation for the vast amounts of dust observed in the CGMs of galaxies and beyond.

总结:
本文通过分析Advanced Composition Explorer/Solar Wind Ion Composition Spectrometer He+ double-coincidence pickup ion (PUI)的测量数据，研究了太阳圈与局部星际介质的相互作用。研究发现在1998年至2010年间，太阳风的流向并没有明显的变化趋势，通过拟合kappa函数和移除与日冕质量抛射相关的测量数据，得到这一结论。因此，可以得出太阳圈与局部星际介质的相互作用在该时期并没有发生明显的变化。 <div>
The size, shape, and composition of the heliosphere are affected by its interaction with the local interstellar medium. A means of quantifying this interaction is by measuring the relative motion of the two media. We determine the flow direction, , of the interstellar wind through the heliosphere and its trend over an 11 yr solar cycle using Advanced Composition Explorer/Solar Wind Ion Composition Spectrometer He+ double-coincidence pickup ion (PUI) measurements from a data set spanning 13 full orbits, with focusing cone crossings occurring between the years 1998 and 2010. We measure the flow direction by fitting a kappa function to the focusing cone signature in the count rates of He+ at the PUI cutoff measured as a function of ecliptic longitude. We determine for each three-orbit boxcar centered on the years 1999 through 2009 and find the trend of the resulting linear fit. We account for solar transients by removing measurements associated with CMEs. However, there still may be effects from compression regions, such as stream–stream and corotating interaction regions. We additionally make considerations to ensure the PUI torus is in view, to account for varying interplanetary magnetic field angles, to ensure that we analyze newly injected interstellar PUIs largely unaffected by transport effects, and to account for general solar activity. We measure a slope in the flow direction to be 0.00° ± 0.51° yr−1, indicating that we do not measure a varying trend over this period. We repeat the focusing cone analysis for the combined data set and determine an overall flow direction of 75.37° ± 0.43°.

Barium stars are peculiar stars with enhanced slow neutron capture process (s-process) elements. Abundance analysis of them aids in better understanding the chemical evolution of the Milky Way. In this paper, we introduce a data-driven method named the memory-enhanced adaptive spectral network (MEASNet) to search for barium candidates in the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) low-resolution survey (LRS) and estimate the abundance of five s-process elements: Sr, Y, Ba, Ce, and Nd. MEASNet, trained using spectra from common stars in both LAMOST and the Galactic Archaeology with HERMES survey, showcases notable performance: for the classification task, precision = 98.22% and recall = 94.12%; in prediction, the mean absolute error for the seven elements range between 0.07 and 0.15 dex. After training, we apply the model to 4,083,003 stellar spectra from LAMOST DR10 LRS, successfully identifying 1,803,670 spectra of barium candidates ([Ba/Fe] ≥ 0.25 dex) along with their five s-process elemental abundances. The catalog enlarges the sample size, providing a wealth of data for further statistical analysis of the formation and evolution of barium stars. Meanwhile, this work highlights the potential value of MEASNet in star classification and abundance estimation, offering a strong reference for future data-driven models.

总结: 本文总结了关于微粒级硅石的压碎曲线行为的过去研究，并进行了补充实验，提出了一种新的幂律函数，可以用于类似微粒级硅石的模拟材料的撞击模拟。作者进行了基准研究，比较了新的压碎曲线与其他研究中常用的参数二次压碎曲线，发现典型的二次压碎曲线参数并不符合硅石压碎实验的情况，因此他们在撞击点附近低估了压缩，而在远离撞击点时高估了压缩。因此，本文提出的适用于数百帕至1.1GPa压力范围的新的压碎曲线可能更加精确。此外，它没有被特定案例的参数所校准，可以普遍适用于类似微粒级硅石的彗星或小行星等天体，只要假设其组成类似微粒级硅石。 <div>
Crush curves are of fundamental importance to numerical modeling of small and porous astrophysical bodies. The empirical literature often measures them for silica grains, and different studies have used various methods, sizes, textures, and pressure conditions. Here, we review past studies and supplement further experiments in order to develop a full and overarching understanding of the silica crush curve behavior. We suggest a new power-law function that can be used in impact simulations of analog materials similar to microgranular silica. We perform a benchmarking study to compare this new crush curve to the parametric quadratic crush curve often used in other studies, based on the study case of the DART impact onto the asteroid Dimorphos. We find that the typical quadratic crush curve parameters do not closely follow the silica crushing experiments, and as a consequence, they under (over) estimate compression close (far) from the impact site. The new crush curve presented here, applicable to pressures between a few hundred Pa and up to 1.1 GPa, might therefore be more precise. Additionally, it is not calibrated by case-specific parameters, and can be used universally for comet- or asteroid-like bodies, given an assumed composition similar to microgranular silica.

We examine Ulysses magnetic field observations from 1993 to 1996 as the spacecraft made its first fast-latitude scan from the southern to the northern hemisphere. Most of the observations we use are representative of high-latitude solar minimum conditions. We examine magnetic field power spectra characteristics of interplanetary turbulence at high frequencies, where the spectrum breaks from an inertial range into the ion dissipation range. The onset and spectral index of the dissipation spectrum are consistent with low-latitude observations at 1 au. Both ranges have a ratio of power in perpendicular magnetic field components to parallel components near 3. The power spectrum ratio test developed by Bieber et al. for single-spacecraft analyses that determines the underlying anisotropy of the wave vectors yields only marginally more energy associated with field-aligned wave vectors than perpendicular wave vectors when comparing the inertial and dissipation-range spectra. The lack of significant change in the anisotropies between the inertial and dissipation ranges contrasts strongly with the turbulence found typically for 1 au near-ecliptic observations, where significant differences in both anisotropies are observed.

In this paper we describe the survey design for the Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam Observations before the Epoch of Reionization (UNCOVER) Cycle 1 JWST Treasury program, which executed its early imaging component in 2022 November. The UNCOVER survey includes ultradeep (∼29–30AB) imaging of ∼45 arcmin2 on and around the well-studied A2744 galaxy cluster at z = 0.308 and will follow up ∼500 galaxies with extremely deep low-resolution spectroscopy with the NIRSpec/PRISM during the summer of 2023, with repeat visits in summer 2024. We describe the science goals, survey design, target selection, and planned data releases. We also present and characterize the depths of the first NIRCam imaging mosaic, highlighting previously unparalleled resolved and ultradeep 2–4 μm imaging of known objects in the field.

In this study, we undertake a spectral-timing analysis of the black hole X-ray binary source GRS 1915+105 using simultaneous observations carried out by AstroSat (Large Area X-ray Proportional Counter, LAXPC and Soft X-ray Telescope, SXT) and Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) in 2017. The source showed two flux levels (high and low), whose energy spectra can be described by the thermal comptonization of disk photons. The spectral parameters obtained by the joint fitting of SXT/LAXPC and NICER/LAXPC were consistent. The power density spectra from LAXPC and NICER revealed a broad, prominent feature at ∼2 Hz. The energy dependence of the fractional rms and time lag of this feature cannot be explained by only variations of coronal spectral parameters. Instead, a model where the coronal heating rate varies first and induces a change in the disk temperature and inner radius can explain the variation. Our results underline the importance of simultaneous observations by AstroSat and NICER and highlight the need for more sophisticated models to explain the spectral-temporal behavior of black hole systems.

We conduct a reverberation mapping (RM) campaign to spectroscopically monitor a sample of selected bright active galactic nuclei with large anticipated broad-line region (BLR) sizes adequate for spectroastrometric (SA) observations by the GRAVITY instrument on the Very Large Telescope Interferometer. We report the first results for five objects, IC 4329A, Mrk 335, Mrk 509, Mrk 1239, and PDS 456, among which Mrk 1239 and PDS 456 are for the first time spectroscopically monitored. We obtain multiyear monitoring data and perform multicomponent spectral decomposition to extract the broad Hβ profiles. We detect significant time lags between the Hβ and continuum variations, generally obeying the previously established BLR size–luminosity relation. Velocity-resolved Hβ time lags illustrate diverse, possibly evolving, BLR kinematics. We further measure the Hβ line widths from mean and rms spectra and the resulting virial products show good consistency among different observing seasons. Adopting a unity virial factor and the FWHM of the broad Hβ line from the mean spectra as a measure of velocity, the obtained black hole masses averaged over seasons are , , , , and for the five objects, respectively. Black hole mass estimations using other line width measures are also reported. For objects with previous RM campaigns, our mass estimates are in agreement with earlier results. In a companion paper, we will employ BLR dynamical modeling to directly infer the black hole mass and thereby determine the virial factors.

<br /><br />
这篇文章研究了来自遥远星系核的一些电磁突发现象，发现其在几个月至几年的时间尺度上重复，并且每个源都可以由超大质量黑洞周围的重复潮汐撕裂产生的吸积耀斑而来。研究通过分析估计和流体力学模拟，测试了rpTDE模型，发现高质量（≳1M⊙）演化恒星可以在与SMBH的多次碰撞中存活，并且几乎不损失质量，从而产生近乎相同振幅的定期吸积耀斑，这与ASASSN-14ko的表现相符。此外，星体受到潮汐力传递的能量可以导致其轨道周期的变化，这与ASASSN-14ko吸积耀斑重现时间的观测衰减相当。相反，低质量和未演化的恒星在相同近日点距离下会逐渐损失更多质量，从而产生更明亮的吸积耀斑，导致星体迅速毁灭和耀斑停止。这也说明了重复瞬变的光变曲线与恒星类型密切相关。总结：研究发现重复瞬变的光变曲线与恒星类型密切相关，高质量演化恒星能够产生近乎相同振幅的定期吸积耀斑，而低质量未演化的恒星则会产生更明亮的吸积耀斑并迅速毁灭。 <div>
Some electromagnetic outbursts from the nuclei of distant galaxies have been found to repeat on months-to-years timescales, and each of these sources can putatively arise from the accretion flares generated through the repeated tidal stripping of a star on a bound orbit about a supermassive black hole (SMBH), i.e., a repeating partial tidal disruption event (rpTDE). Here, we test the rpTDE model through analytical estimates and hydrodynamical simulations of the interaction between a range of stars, which differ from one another in mass and age, and an SMBH. We show that higher-mass (≳1M⊙), evolved stars can survive many (≳10−100) encounters with an SMBH while simultaneously losing few × 0.01M⊙, resulting in accretion flares that are approximately evenly spaced in time with nearly the same amplitude, quantitatively reproducing ASASSN-14ko. We also show that the energy imparted to the star via tides can lead to a change in its orbital period that is comparable to the observed decay in the recurrence time of ASASSN-14ko’s flares, . Contrarily, lower-mass and less-evolved stars lose progressively more mass and produce brighter accretion flares on subsequent encounters for the same pericenter distances, leading to the rapid destruction of the star and cessation of flares. Such systems cannot reproduce ASASSN-14ko-like transients, but are promising candidates for recreating events such as AT2020vdq, which displayed a second and much brighter outburst compared to the first. Our results imply that the lightcurves of repeating transients are tightly coupled with stellar type.

在这篇文章中，研究人员对附近星系的形状进行了深入分析，使用了前向建模方法来克服先前研究中的局限性，并且对比了观测结果和宇宙学模拟。他们发现TNG50模拟和HSC-SSP观测之间的卓越一致性挑战了先前的观点，即ΛCDM模型低估了薄星系的丰度。尤其是在星等小于10^9.5的星系中，观测和模拟之间的张力小于0.1σ，与先前报告的张力大于10σ形成鲜明对比。研究人员还发现，TNG50模拟中的低质量星系比HSC-SSP观测中的对应星系更加厚实，这被归因于虚假的动力学加热效应人为膨胀了星系。此外，他们还发现，尽管整体上存在广泛的一致性，TNG50模拟中的星系在低质量和高质量端更加集中，在中等质量范围内则较少集中。然而，研究人员认为低质量TNG50星系的较高集中度不太可能是它们更厚/更圆外观的原因。这项研究强调了进行模拟的模拟观测和应用一致的测量方法的重要性，以便与观测进行适当的比较。<br /><br />总结: 研究表明TNG50模拟中的星系形状与HSC-SSP观测结果有很好的一致性，挑战了先前的观点；模拟中的低质量星系比观测更厚实，这归因于虚假的动力学加热效应；整体上存在一致性，但在不同质量范围中有一些差异；对模拟进行模拟观测和应用一致的测量方法是很重要的。 <div>
We perform a thorough analysis of the projected shapes of nearby galaxies in both observations and cosmological simulations. We implement a forward-modeling approach to overcome the limitations in previous studies, which hinder accurate comparisons between observations and simulations. We measure axis ratios of z = 0 (snapshot 99) TNG50 galaxies from their synthetic Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) images and compare them with those obtained from real HSC-SSP images of a matched galaxy sample. Remarkably, the comparison shows excellent agreement between the observations and the TNG50 simulation, challenging previous claims that ΛCDM models underproduced the abundance of thin galaxies. Specifically, for galaxies with stellar masses , we find ≲0.1σ tensions between the observations and the simulation, a stark contrast to the previously reported ≳10σ tensions. We reveal that low-mass galaxies (M⋆ ≲ 109.5) in TNG50 are thicker than their observed counterparts in HSC-SSP and attribute this to the spurious dynamical heating effects that artificially puff up galaxies. We also find that, despite the overall broad agreement, TNG50 galaxies are more concentrated than the HSC-SSP ones at the low- and high-mass end of the stellar mass range of and are less concentrated at intermediate stellar masses. But we argue that the higher concentrations of the low-mass TNG50 galaxies are not likely the cause of their thicker/rounder appearances. Our study underscores the critical importance of conducting mock observations of simulations and applying consistent measurement methodologies to facilitate proper comparison with observations.

<div> 关键词: metal-poor stars, low-mass galaxies, stellar evolution, mass loss, ionizing spectra<br />
总结: 该研究使用Keck Cosmic Web Imager光谱观测了Leo P、Sextans A和WLM等附近矮星系中的三颗O型恒星，发现它们的基本恒星特性和辐射驱动风具有一些与当前恒星演化模型不符的现象。研究强调了在极低金属丰度下验证恒星质量、温度和光度之间的关系的重要性，以及未来针对金属贫乏恒星群体的质量损失和演化模型的发展。总的来说，这些发现为未来研究提供了实证基准。 <br /> <div>
Metal-poor massive stars drive the evolution of low-mass galaxies, both locally and at high redshift. However, quantifying the feedback they impart to their local surroundings remains uncertain because models of stellar evolution, mass loss, and ionizing spectra are unconstrained by observations below 20% solar metallicity (Z⊙). We present new Keck Cosmic Web Imager optical spectroscopy of three O-type stars in the nearby dwarf galaxies Leo P, Sextans A, and WLM, which have gas-phase oxygen abundances of 3%–14% Z⊙. To characterize their fundamental stellar properties and radiation-driven winds, we fit PoWR atmosphere models to the optical spectra simultaneously with Hubble Space Telescope far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectra and multiwavelength photometry. We find that all three stars have effective temperatures consistent with their spectral types and surface gravities typical of main-sequence dwarf stars. Yet, the combination of those inferred parameters and luminosity for the two lower-Z stars is not reproduced by stellar evolution models, even those that include rotation or binary interactions. The scenario of multiple-star systems is difficult to reconcile with all available data, suggesting that these observations pose a challenge to current evolution models. We highlight the importance of validating the relationship between stellar mass, temperature, and luminosity at very low Z for accurate estimates of ionizing photon production and spectral hardness. Finally, all three stars’ FUV wind profiles reveal low mass-loss rates and terminal wind velocities in tension with expectations from widely adopted radiation-driven wind models. These results provide empirical benchmarks for future development of mass-loss and evolution models for metal-poor stellar populations.

<div> 高红移活跃星系核AGN, 复电离, JWST, 空间密度, 宇宙再电离<br /> 

在过去，高红移活跃星系核（AGN）曾被认为在复电离中扮演较小的角色，尽管Chandra和哈勃空间望远镜初期的证据支持它们在低亮度下的大空间密度。然而，最近JWST的观测发现在红移大于4时有相当数量的暗淡AGN，这确实证实了早期的研究结果。研究人员展示了红移约为5的AGN样本，这些样本来自于广泛的、浅层的地面调查和来自JWST的深层、铅笔光束观测，这使我们能够以前所未有的精度估计它们的空间密度。在红移约为5时，AGN亮度函数的亮端（M1450 < -26）已经得到了很好的限制，斜率相当陡峭。暗端（M1450 ≥ -22）表明有很高的空间密度，而波动很大，拐点（M1450 ~ -24）大部分尚未确定。与最先进的模型进行比较发现，在红移为5时，观测到的AGN亮度函数与预期的相当一致，而在更高红移时，预测的空间密度演化速度似乎过快。考虑到暗端的大方差，我们在拟合亮度函数和推导电离发射率时考虑了不同的选项。即使在最保守的情景中，红移约为5的AGN产生的光电离率也与紫外背景辐射的测量结果一致。观察到暗淡AGN空间密度的缓慢演化表明，活跃超大质量黑洞可能在红移大于6时不断产生大量的电离光子，远远超出再电离纪元。这是一个重要的指示，即高红移AGN可能是宇宙再电离的主要贡献者。<br /><br />总结: 过去高z AGN在再电离中的作用被低估，但JWST的观测证实了它们在红移大于4时的大量存在。红移约为5的AGN亮度函数显示出明显的斜率和高空间密度，而对比现代模型也有相当一致性。活跃超大质量黑洞可能在红移大于6时持续产生大量的电离光子，对宇宙再电离产生重要影响。 <div>
In the past, high-z active galactic nuclei (AGNs) were given a minor role as possible drivers of reionization, despite initial evidence in favor of their large space densities at low luminosities by Chandra and the Hubble Space Telescope. Recent observations from JWST are finding relatively large numbers of faint AGNs at z > 4, convincingly confirming these early results. We present a sample of z ∼ 5 AGNs, both from wide, shallow ground-based surveys and from deep, pencil-beam observations from JWST, allowing us to estimate their space densities with unprecedented accuracy. The bright end (M1450 < −26) of the z ∼ 5 AGN luminosity function is well constrained, with a rather steep slope. The faint end (M1450 ≥ −22) indicates a high space density, the scatter is significant, and the knee (M1450 ∼ −24) is mostly undetermined. Comparisons with state-of-the-art models find reasonable agreement with the observed AGN luminosity function at z = 5, while the predicted space density evolution at higher redshifts appears to be too fast with respect to observational constraints. Given the large variance at the faint end, we consider different options in fitting the luminosity functions and deriving the ionizing emissivity. Even in the most conservative scenario, the photoionization rate produced by z ∼ 5 AGNs is consistent with the ultraviolet background measurements. A slow evolution of the space density of faint AGNs is observed, indicating that active SMBHs are probably producing large amounts of ionizing photons at z > 6, well into the Epoch of Reionization. This is an important indication that high-z AGNs could be major contributors to the reionization of the Universe.

总结: 该研究报道了在Herbig Ae星MWC 480周围的盘中探测到了二甲醚（CH3OCH3），这是在非过渡性II类盘中首次发现CH3OCH3。观测显示CH3OCH3呈紧凑、未解析状态，半径≲25天文单位，线宽≈30 km/s，激发温度≈200 K，表明COMs在暖内盘中升华。尽管探测到了CH3OCH3，但并未探测到CH3OH，这导致了CH3OCH3/CH3OH的列密度比约为7。这一高比值表明在盘相阶段COMs发生重加工，以及内盘物理结构的影响。该研究还发现，这一比值高于最近发现的富含COMs的过渡盘。这可能表明在MWC 480的全盘中，COMs在内部经历了显著的化学重加工，而过渡盘中的COM发射主要跟踪了位于较大半径（≳20 au）的灰尘空洞边缘的继承冰的升华。 <br /><br /> <div>
Characterizing the chemistry of complex organic molecules (COMs) at the epoch of planet formation provides insights into the chemical evolution of the interstellar medium (ISM) and the origin of organic materials in our solar system. We report a detection of dimethyl ether (CH3OCH3) in the disk around the Herbig Ae star MWC 480 with sensitive Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations. This is the first detection of CH3OCH3 in a nontransitional Class II disk. The spatially unresolved, compact (≲25 au in radius) nature, broad line width (∼30 km s−1), and high excitation temperature (∼200 K) indicate the sublimation of COMs in the warm inner disk. Despite the detection of CH3OCH3, methanol (CH3OH), the most abundant COM in the ISM, has not been detected, from which we constrain the column density ratio of CH3OCH3/CH3OH ≳ 7. This high ratio may indicate the reprocessing of COMs during the disk phase, as well as the effect of the physical structure in the inner disk. We also find that this ratio is higher than in COM-rich transition disks recently discovered. This may indicate that in the full disk of MWC 480, COMs have experienced substantial chemical reprocessing in the innermost region, while the COM emission in the transition disks predominantly traces the inherited ice sublimating at the dust cavity edge located at larger radii (≳20 au).

3C 264 is one of the few FRI radio galaxies with detected TeV emission. It is a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (LLAGN) and is generally associated with a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF). Earlier multiwavelength studies suggest that the X-ray emission originates from a jet. However, the possibility that the RIAF can significantly contribute to the X-rays cannot be ruled out. In particular, hard X-ray emission ≳10 keV has never been detected, making it challenging to distinguish between X-ray models. Here we report a NuSTAR detection up to 25 keV from 3C 264. We also present subpixel deconvolved Chandra images to resolve jet emission down to ∼0.″2 from the center of the unresolved X-ray core. Together with a simultaneous Swift observation, we have constrained the dominant hard X-ray emission to be from its unresolved X-ray core, presumably in its quiescent state. We found evidence of a cutoff in the energy around 20 keV, indicating that at least some of the X-rays from the core can be attributed to the RIAF. The Comptonization model suggests an electron temperature of about 15 keV and an optical depth ranging between 4 and 7, following the universality of coronal properties of black hole accretion. The cutoff energy or electron temperature of 3C 264 is the lowest among those of other LLAGNs. The detected hard X-ray emission is at least an order of magnitude higher than that predicted by synchrotron self-Compton models introduced to explain γ-ray and TeV emission, suggesting that the synchrotron electrons might be accelerated to higher energies than previously thought.

总结:<br /><br />本研究利用NuSTAR、NICER、Swift、Fermi、NEOWISE和ATCA望远镜多波段观测，针对黑洞X射线双星IGR J17091-3624在2022年的喷发进行了全面的研究。重点关注X射线辐射中心的心跳样变化，旨在利用它作为解开心跳状态下非热辐射来源的工具。通过X射线定时和谱分析，观察到X射线辐射中心心跳样变化与盘温度的变化相关，支持了盘辐射压不稳定性场景。此外，除了柯普顿化成分外，我们的时间平均和相态解谱学显示出一个与盘成分独立变化的幂律成分。结合射电- X射线谱能量分布拟合，我们的结果表明幂律成分可能来自喷流中的自急旋同步辐射，这需要约B = (0.3–3.5) × 106 G的强磁场。此外，假设IGR J17091–3624和GRS 1915 + 105在硬和心跳状态下共享相同的无线电- X射线相关系数，我们得到了IGR J17091–3624的距离为13.7 ± 2.3 kpc。 <div>
We present a comprehensive study based on multiwavelength observations from the NuSTAR, NICER, Swift, Fermi, NEOWISE, and ATCA telescopes during the 2022 outburst of the black-hole X-ray binary IGR J17091–3624. Our investigation concentrates on the heartbeat-like variability in the X-ray emission, with the aim of using it as a tool to unravel the origin of the nonthermal emission during the heartbeat state. Through X-ray timing and spectral analysis, we observe that the heartbeat-like variability correlates with changes in the disk temperature, supporting the disk radiation pressure instability scenario. Moreover, in addition to a Comptonization component, our time-averaged and phase-resolved spectroscopy reveal the presence of a power-law component that varies independently from the disk component. Combined with the radio–X-ray spectral energy distribution fitting, our results suggest that the power-law component could originate from synchrotron self-Compton radiation in the jet, which requires a strong magnetic field of about B = (0.3–3.5) × 106 G. Additionally, assuming that IGR J17091-3624 and GRS 1915 + 105 share the same radio–X-ray correlation coefficient during both the hard and the heartbeat states, we obtain a distance of 13.7 ± 2.3 kpc for IGR J17091–3624.

Asteroseismic modeling is a powerful way to derive stellar properties. However, the derived quantities are limited by built-in assumptions used in stellar models. This work presents a detailed characterization of stellar model uncertainties in asteroseismic red giants, focusing on the mixing-length parameter αMLT, the initial helium fraction Yinit, the solar abundance scale, and the overshoot parameters. First, we estimate error floors due to model uncertainties to be ≈0.4% in mass, ≈0.2% in radius, and ≈17% in age, primarily due to the uncertain state of αMLT and Yinit. The systematic uncertainties in age exceed typical statistical uncertainties, suggesting the importance of their evaluation in asteroseismic applications. Second, we demonstrate that the uncertainties from αMLT can be entirely mitigated by direct radius measurements or partially through . Utilizing radii from Kepler eclipsing binaries, we determined the αMLT values and calibrated the αMLT–[M/H] relation. The correlation observed between the two variables is positive, consistent with previous studies using 1D stellar models, but in contrast with outcomes from 3D simulations. Third, we explore the implications of using asteroseismic modeling to test the scaling relation. We found that a perceived dependency of on [M/H] from individual frequency modeling can be largely removed by incorporating the calibrated αMLT–[M/H] relation. Variations in Yinit can also affect predictions. These findings suggest that conveys information not fully captured by individual frequencies, and that it should be carefully considered as an important observable for asteroseismic modeling.

<div> 关键词：活动星系核、TeV宇宙射线、超大质量黑洞、磁化湍流、中微子产生

总结:<br /><br />
本文研究了活动星系核作为潜在加速器的可能性，以及其产生的高能中微子。通过NGC 1068活动星系核发出的TeV中微子信号的证据，确认了这一观点，但关于宇宙射线加速的位置和机制仍存在疑问。研究表明，环绕中心超大质量黑洞的磁化湍流可能是宇宙射线加速的候选地点。最新的磁化湍流的粒子-电磁场模拟显示，随机宇宙射线加速是非共振的，与之前的研究假设不同。这对于自洽的活动星系核中微子产生理论有着重要影响，导致比之前认为的更快的宇宙射线加速。磁场湍流的波动和涡旋能量密度高于等于1%的重量能密度，能够解释NGC 1068中微子流的归一化，以及中微子的能谱形状。在这个框架内，只有一部分质子在活动星系核中被加速到高能。因此，NGC 1068中微子信号为磁化湍流中的粒子加速提供了一个检验基础。 <div>
The cores of active galactic nuclei are potential accelerators of 10–100 TeV cosmic rays, in turn producing high-energy neutrinos. This picture was confirmed by the compelling evidence of a TeV neutrino signal from the nearby active galaxy NGC 1068, leaving open the question of what is the site and mechanism of cosmic-ray acceleration. One candidate is the magnetized turbulence surrounding the central supermassive black hole. Recent particle-in-cell simulations of magnetized turbulence indicate that stochastic cosmic-ray acceleration is nonresonant, in contrast to the assumptions of previous studies. We show that this has important consequences on a self-consistent theory of neutrino production in the corona, leading to a more rapid cosmic-ray acceleration than previously considered. The turbulent magnetic-field fluctuations needed to explain the neutrino signal are consistent with a magnetically powered corona. We find that strong turbulence, with turbulent magnetic energy density higher than 1% of the rest-mass energy density, naturally explains the normalization of the IceCube neutrino flux, in addition to the neutrino spectral shape. Only a fraction of the protons in the corona, which can be directly inferred from the neutrino signal, are accelerated to high energies. Thus, in this framework, the neutrino signal from NGC 1068 provides a testbed for particle acceleration in magnetized turbulence.

磁重连接模拟结果显示，伴随着电子和质子的加热和能量增加，两种粒子形成了延伸近三个数量级能量的幂律分布。非热粒子的主要驱动机制是Fermi反射，在不断演变和合并的磁通绳内发生。尽管两种粒子的幂律指数相近，但质子的总能量增加比电子更多，并且它们的幂律延伸到更高能量。在低能量处，幂律分布转变为热分布，对于电子来说，转变能量比质子更低。强引导场通过减少Fermi驱动机制来减少非热粒子的产生。太阳耀斑中，质子的幂律分布应当延展到几十千电子伏特，远低于直接观测得到的能量。因此，质子应当携带比直接观测到的能量更多的磁能。 <br /><br />总结: 研究发现在磁重连接中产生了延伸近三个数量级能量的幂律分布的非热电子和质子，其中质子的能量增加更多，并且幂律分布延伸到更高能量。同时，强引导场能减少非热粒子的产生。在太阳耀斑中，质子应当携带比直接观测到的能量更多的磁能。 <div>
The results of simulations of magnetic reconnection accompanied by electron and proton heating and energization in a macroscale system are presented. Both species form extended power-law distributions that extend nearly three decades in energy. The primary drive mechanism for the production of these nonthermal particles is Fermi reflection within evolving and coalescing magnetic flux ropes. While the power-law indices of the two species are comparable, the protons overall gain more energy than electrons, and their power law extends to higher energy. The power laws roll into a hot thermal distribution at low energy with the transition energy occurring at lower energy for electrons compared with protons. A strong guide field diminishes the production of nonthermal particles by reducing the Fermi drive mechanism. In solar flares, proton power laws should extend down to tens of keV, far below the energies that can be directly probed via gamma-ray emission. Thus, protons should carry much more of the released magnetic energy than expected from direct observations.

Cyclopropenethione falls into the class of complex organic molecules but has not yet been observed in the interstellar medium or any circumstellar disks. However, its existence is very likely, and thus this study provides high-level ab initio predictions, which may serve as reference data for future observations or experimental work. Rovibrational configuration interaction theory based on multidimensional potential energy surfaces being obtained from explicitly correlated coupled-cluster calculations has been used to predict the fundamental vibrational modes, the microwave spectrum, and low-lying rovibrational transitions. Rotational constants as well as quartic and sextic centrifugal distortion constants were obtained from vibrational perturbation theory.

<div> Roche lobe overflow, low-mass star, supermassive black hole, tidal disruption events, multimessenger
总结:<br /><br />本文讨论了来自一个近乎圆形轨道上的一个低质量恒星向一个超大质量黑洞(RLO)的洪流。如果质量转移是不稳定的，那么其速率会在一个失控的过程中加速，结果会产生超Eddington质量吸积速率的辐射，伴随着从超大质量黑洞附近发出的光学/紫外线强光流。这会产生一个持续1-4周的明亮光学/紫外线耀斑，伴随着来自超大质量黑洞的吸积流的持续1-10年的X射线前体和后体。这种“循环潮汐破碎事件”(TDEs)代表了一类新的核瞬变现象，以至多占到了经典拖拽破碎事件速率的1%–10%。在破碎之前，近乎崩溃的旋转和强大的潮汐变形可能导致强大的磁场，使得循环TDEs成为射流TDEs可能的前体。破碎前的流出产生了一个约0.01-0.1 pc距离处约为10^-2 M⊙的星系核环境(CNM)，可能导致明亮的射电辐射，并且也类似于射流TDEs所推断的CNM。我们讨论了循环TDEs和其他最近确定的与星系核相关的瞬变事件类别之间的更广泛的联系，比如重复TDEs和准周期性X射线喷发，以及与AT2018cow等明亮快速蓝光瞬变事件可能的联系。我们还讨论了白矮星环绕中质量黑洞的类似RLO的观测特征，这可能是LISA时代的多信使源。 <div>
We consider Roche lobe overflow (RLO) from a low-mass star on a nearly circular orbit, onto a supermassive black hole (SMBH). If mass transfer is unstable, its rate accelerates in a runaway process, resulting in highly super-Eddington mass accretion rates, accompanied by an optically thick outflow emanating from the SMBH vicinity. This produces a 1–4 week long, bright optical/ultraviolet flare, accompanied by a 1–10 year long X-ray precursor and post-cursor emitted from the accretion flow onto the SMBH. Such “Circular Tidal Disruption Events” (TDEs) represent a new class of nuclear transients, occurring at up to 1%–10% of the canonical parabolic tidal disruption event rate. Near-breakup rotation and strong tidal deformation of the star prior to disruption could lead to strong magnetic fields, making circular TDEs possible progenitors of jetted TDEs. Outflows prior to the final stellar disruption produce a circumnuclear environment (CNM) with ∼10−2 M⊙ at distances of ∼0.01–0.1 pc, likely leading to bright radio emission, and also similar to the CNM inferred for jetted TDEs. We discuss broader connections between circular TDEs and other recently identified classes of transients associated with galactic nuclei, such as repeating TDEs and quasi-periodic X-ray eruptions, as well as possible connections to luminous fast blue optical transients such as AT2018cow. We also discuss observational signatures of the analogous RLO of a white dwarf around an intermediate-mass BH, which may be a multimessenger source in the LISA era.

<title>Radio Scrutiny of the X-Ray-weak Tail of Low-mass Active Galactic Nuclei: A Novel Signature of High-Eddington Accretion?</title>

总结:<br />
本文通过对18个高吸积率mBH（MBH ∼ 106M⊙）驱动的AGN的研究，发现了一个有趣的倾向，即X射线较弱的mBH倾向于具有更大的LR/LX值。这与X射线可能被“苗条”吸积盘遮挡的情景一致。作者比较了此观察结果与弱发射线类星体的结果，并建议这个结果可能为寻找高吸积率AGN提供了一个新的观测特征。 <div>
The supermassive black holes (MBH ∼ 106–1010M⊙) that power luminous active galactic nuclei (AGNs), i.e., quasars, generally show a correlation between thermal disk emission in the ultraviolet (UV) and coronal emission in hard X-rays. In contrast, some “massive” black holes (mBHs; MBH ∼ 105–106M⊙) in low-mass galaxies present curious X-ray properties with coronal radiative output up to 100× weaker than expected. To examine this issue, we present a pilot study incorporating Very Large Array radio observations of a sample of 18 high-accretion-rate (Eddington ratios Lbol/LEdd > 0.1), mBH-powered AGNs (MBH ∼ 106M⊙) with Chandra X-ray coverage. Empirical correlations previously revealed in samples of radio-quiet, high-Eddington AGNs indicate that the radio–X-ray luminosity ratio, LR/LX, is approximately constant. Through multiwavelength analysis, we instead find that the X-ray-weaker mBHs in our sample tend toward larger values of LR/LX even though they remain radio-quiet per their optical–UV properties. This trend results in a tentative but highly intriguing correlation between LR/LX and X-ray weakness, which we argue is consistent with a scenario in which X-rays may be preferentially obscured from our line of sight by a “slim” accretion disk. We compare this observation to weak emission-line quasars (AGNs with exceptionally weak broad-line emission and a significant X-ray-weak fraction) and conclude by suggesting that our results may offer a new observational signature for finding high-accretion-rate AGNs.

总结:
本研究使用了SOFIA和HST联合观测了NGC 2071 IR区域，对HOPS 361-A原恒星的流出现象进行了研究。通过SOFIA测量了新的[O I] 63μm光谱，可以跟踪流出现象、分辨光谱线轮廓、给出辐射速度，进而得到3D动力学、激波特性和反馈特性。HST的正确运动和灭光值提供了更完整的准3D图像，用于建立激波速度和密度模型。研究发现14个显示正确运动的明显特征。结合SOFIA数据，估计HOPS 361-A的质量流出率为3.16×10^-6M⊙ yr^-1，激波速度最高可达51 km s^-1。根据所有节，得到的流出力每面积单位为1.45 × 10^-4M⊙ km^-1 s^-1 yr^-1，能量每面积单位为2.37 × 10^-2M⊙ s^-3，假定为恒定，反馈值存在较大不确定性。使用所有SOFIA光圈包围HOPS 361的总[O I]亮度为0.7 L⊙，相当于质量流出率为7×10^-5M⊙ yr^-1。这是NGC 2071 IR区域在近、远红外区域进行的第二次3D动力学研究，SOFIA的[O I]光谱为连接HOPS 361-A最近一次流出事件、流出洞和周围NGC 2071 IR形成环境的参与气体提供了独特的聚焦。 <div>
We present a combined Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) and two-epoch Hubble Space Telescope (HST) study of the region NGC 2071 IR containing the outflow from the protostar HOPS 361-A (NGC 2071 IRS 1). New [O i] 63 μm spectra, taken with the German REciever for Astronomy at Terahertz frequencies (GREAT) instrument aboard SOFIA, trace the outflow, spectrally resolve line profiles, and give radial velocities of the far-IR emission to yield 3D kinematics, shock properties, and feedback properties. Proper motions and extinction values from HST give a more complete quasi-3D picture that we use to model shock speeds and densities. We identify 14 distinct features that show proper motions. Combined with the GREAT data, we estimate that HOPS 361-A has a mass outflow rate of 3.16 × 10−6M⊙ yr−1 with shock speeds up to 51 km s−1. The outflow force summed over all knots per area is measured to be 1.45 × 10−4M⊙ km−1 s−1 yr−1 and a power summed over all knotsper area of 2.37 × 10−2M⊙ s−3 dissipated assuming constant , with large uncertainties on the feedback values. The total [O i] luminosity using all SOFIA apertures encompassing the HOPS 361 clump is 0.7 L⊙, corresponding to a mass outflow rate of 7 × 10−5M⊙ yr−1. This is the second 3D kinematic study of an outflow in NGC 2071 IR in the near- and far-IR regimes following Rubinstein et al. (2023). The SOFIA [O i] spectra add unique focus to the entrained gas connecting the recent episode of outflows from HOPS 361-A to the outflow cavity and the surrounding NGC 2071 IR star-forming environment.

<br />总结:
本文研究了MGRO J1908+06在GeV-TeV能量范围内的γ射线发射的起源。通过分析Fermi大面积望远镜、Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System和High Altitude Water Cherenkov收集的数据，并加入之前LHAASO报告的谱数据，对MGRO J1908+06的形态和光谱特征进行了多波段研究，揭示了γ射线发射的起源。通过详细的宽带建模，限制了磁场强度、源年龄和距离，研究了明亮TeV射线的机制。光谱形状和能量相关形态均支持逆康普顿辐射假说，这种辐射由与PSR J1907+0602相关的演化脉冲星风星云产生，真实年龄T= 22±9千年，磁场B= 5.4±0.8μG，假设脉冲星距离dPSR = 3.2kpc。 <div>
This paper investigates the origin of the γ-ray emission from MGRO J1908+06 in the GeV–TeV energy band. By analyzing the data collected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope, the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System, and High Altitude Water Cherenkov, with the addition of spectral data previously reported by LHAASO, a multiwavelength study of the morphological and spectral features of MGRO J1908+06 provides insight into the origin of the γ-ray emission. The mechanism behind the bright TeV emission is studied by constraining the magnetic field strength, the source age, and the distance through detailed broadband modeling. Both spectral shape and energy-dependent morphology support the scenario that inverse Compton emission of an evolved pulsar wind nebula associated with PSR J1907+0602 is responsible for the MGRO J1908+06 γ-ray emission with a best-fit true age of T = 22 ± 9 kyr and a magnetic field of B = 5.4 ± 0.8 μG, assuming the distance to the pulsar dPSR = 3.2 kpc.

PG 1448+273 is a luminous, nearby (z = 0.0645), narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy, which likely accretes close to the Eddington limit. Previous X-ray observations of PG 1448+273 with XMM-Newton in 2017 and NuSTAR in 2022 revealed the presence of an ultrafast outflow, as seen through its blueshifted iron (Fe) K absorption profile, where the outflow velocity appeared to vary in the range 0.1−0.3c. In this work, new X-ray observations of PG 1448+273 are presented, in the form of four simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations performed in 2023 July and August. The X-ray spectra appeared at a similar flux in each observation, making it possible to analyze the mean 2023 X-ray spectrum at high signal-to-noise ratio. A broad (σ = 1 keV) and highly blueshifted (E = 9.8 ± 0.4 keV) Fe K absorption profile is revealed in the mean spectrum. The profile can be modeled by a fast, geometrically thick accretion disk wind, which reveals a maximum terminal velocity of v∞ = −0.43 ± 0.03c, one of the fastest known winds in a nearby active galactic nucleus. As a result, the inferred mass outflow rate of the wind may reach a significant fraction of the Eddington accretion rate.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章介绍了chianti数据库和软件包的第11版，主要介绍了增加的离子平衡模型对太阳过渡区的影响，以及新的原子模型对UV强线辐射的预测和实际观测结果的比较。新模型对于研究过渡区以及高密度天体和实验室等等方面都有更好的适用性。此外，还介绍了更新和添加的离子数据集以及辐射复合能量损失率的更新。 <div>
Version 11 of the chianti database and software package is presented. Advanced ionization equilibrium models have been added for low charge states of seven elements (C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Si, and S), and represent a significant improvement especially when modeling the solar transition region. The models include the effects of higher electron density and charge transfer on ionization and recombination rates. As an illustration of the difference these models make, a synthetic spectrum is calculated for an electron pressure of 7 × 1015 cm−3 K and compared with an active region observation from HRTS. Increases are seen in factors of 2–5 in the predicted radiances of the strongest lines in the UV from Si iv, C iv, and N v, compared to the previous modeling using the coronal approximation. Much better agreement (within 20%) with the observations is found for the majority of the lines. The new atomic models better equip both those who are studying the transition region and those who are interpreting the emission from higher-density astrophysical and laboratory plasma. In addition to the advanced models, several ion data sets have been added or updated, and data for the radiative recombination energy loss rate have been updated.

使用Dark Energy Camera (DECam) 在CTIO Blanco 4m 望远镜上进行了大麦哲伦星云 (LMC) 的新发射线调查，使用窄带Hα和[S ii]滤光片，以及一个连续波段来创建纯发射线图像。我们将这项新调查称为DeMCELS，以区别于早期的大麦哲伦星云发射线调查 (MCELS)。DeMCELS覆盖约54平方度，包括LMC的大部分明亮光学盘。由于DECam的像素大小仅为0.″27，我们的DeMCELS调查在分辨率上改进了3-5倍，与MCELS的深度相当，Hα和[S ii]的表面亮度限制分别为和。DeMCELS提供了关于各种尺度的星云的详细形态信息，从最大的超级泡沫到单个H ii区和超新星遗迹，再到包围单个恒星的发射气泡，甚至是LMC的弥散电离气体中的微弱结构。许多复杂的发射区域显示出[S ii] / Hα比值的显着变化，这表明了来自恒星风和/或超新星的冲击与嵌入式热年轻恒星的光电离的混合。我们介绍了这项调查的观测策略和数据处理的细节，并展示了与先前数据的比较结果。小麦哲伦星云的相关项目正在进行中，将另行报告。我们通过NOIRLab的数据实验室网站向整个社区提供这些新数据。 <div>
We have used the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) on the CTIO Blanco 4 m telescope to perform a new emission-line survey of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) using narrowband Hα and [S ii] filters in addition to a continuum band to create pure emission-line images. We refer to this new survey as DeMCELS, to distinguish it from the earlier Magellanic Cloud Emission-line Survey (MCELS). DeMCELS covers ∼54 deg2, encompassing most of the bright optical disk of the LMC. With DECam's pixel size of only 0.″27, our DeMCELS survey provides a seeing-limited improvement of 3–5 times over MCELS and is comparable in depth, with surface brightness limits of and in Hα and [S ii], respectively. DeMCELS provides detailed morphological information on nebulae of all scales, from the largest supershells to individual H ii regions and supernova remnants, to bubbles of emission surrounding individual stars, and even to faint structures in the diffuse ionized gas of the LMC. Many complex regions of emission show significant variations in the ratio of [S ii] to Hα—a sign of a mixture of shocks from stellar winds and/or supernovae with photoionization by embedded hot, young stars. We present the details of the observing strategy and data processing for this survey, and show selected results in comparison with previous data. A companion project for the Small Magellanic Cloud is in progress and will be reported separately. We are making these new data available to the community at large via NOIRLab’s Data Lab site.

Jansky非常大阵列的调查中被同时探测，该调查主要关注无法识别的Fermi γ射线源。通过realfast快速采样成像，将这些爆发定位到亚角秒的精度。Green Bank射电望远镜的跟踪观测发现了来自同一源的额外射电爆发。这些爆发在搜索480秒周期时并未显示出周期性，线偏振度接近100%，圆偏振度可达12%，且展现出数月时间尺度上的可变散射。realfast定位将这一源与Fermi γ射线源牢固地联系在一起，并将其放置在（尽管不是重合于）XMM-Newton X射线源附近。基于该源的整体特性，我们讨论了这一对象的各种性质，并提出它可能是一颗年轻的脉冲星、磁星或双脉冲星系统。

We report on the detection of radio bursts from the Galactic bulge using the real-time transient detection and localization system, realfast. The pulses were detected commensally on the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array during a survey of unidentified Fermi γ-ray sources. The bursts were localized to subarcsecond precision using realfast fast-sampled imaging. Follow-up observations with the Green Bank Telescope detected additional bursts from the same source. The bursts do not exhibit periodicity in a search up to periods of 480 s, assuming a duty cycle of <20%. The pulses are nearly 100% linearly polarized, show circular polarization up to 12%, and exhibit variable scattering on timescales of months. The arcsecond-level realfast localization links the source confidently with the Fermi γ-ray source and places it nearby (though not coincident with) an XMM-Newton X-ray source. Based on the source’s overall properties, we discuss various options for the nature of this object and propose that it could be a young pulsar, a magnetar, or a binary pulsar system.

总结: <br /><br />本文介绍了通过Local Volume Complete Cluster Survey项目使用弱引力透镜观测58个低红移X射线明亮星系团的研究。研究发现在星系团内部，BCG和RS分布的定向强烈相关，而RS分布和星系团质量分布的定向也有一定关联。这些定向关联暗示了星系团在宇宙时间尺度上的长期动力学演化。 <div>
The Local Volume Complete Cluster Survey is an ongoing program to observe nearly a hundred low-redshift X-ray-luminous galaxy clusters (redshifts 0.03 < z < 0.12 and X-ray luminosities in the 0.1–2.4 keV band LX500c > 1044 erg s−1) with the Dark Energy Camera, capturing data in the u, g, r, i, z bands with a 5σ point source depth of approximately 25th–26th AB magnitudes. Here, we map the aperture masses in 58 galaxy cluster fields using weak gravitational lensing. These clusters span a variety of dynamical states, from nearly relaxed to merging systems, and approximately half of them have not been subject to detailed weak lensing analysis before. In each cluster field, we analyze the alignment between the 2D mass distribution described by the aperture mass map, the 2D red-sequence (RS) galaxy distribution, and the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). We find that the orientations of the BCG and the RS distribution are strongly aligned throughout the interiors of the clusters: the median misalignment angle is 19° within 2 Mpc. We also observe the alignment between the orientations of the RS distribution and the overall cluster mass distribution (by a median difference of 32° within 1 Mpc), although this is constrained by galaxy shape noise and the limitations of our cluster sample size. These types of alignment suggest long-term dynamical evolution within the clusters over cosmic timescales.

<div> 关键词: 太阳活动、太阳探测器、太阳粒子、磁连接性、3He富集事件
总结: 本文报告了在2022年底和2023年初，ACE、STEREO和Solar Orbiter探测到的15次富含3He的太阳粒子事件。其中三至五次事件在至多40°的经度分隔处同时被至少两至三颗太空探测器探测到，而另外七次事件则只被单颗太空探测器探测到。通过磁连接性工具的统计分析，表明当太空探测器的模拟足点与太阳上潜在的源区的角距离小于24°时，探测概率大于50%，这支持了之前的研究结论。然而，由于日冕物质抛射、足点运动和/或磁力线的曲折路径，这可能导致在1天文单位处的探测结果出现差异。 <br /><br /> <div>
Multispacecraft observations of 3He-rich solar energetic particle (SEP) events are scarce, but much needed in order to understand and properly constrain the source and transport of these remarkably enriched 3He SEP events. In this paper, we report 15 3He-rich SEP events that were detected by the Advanced Composition Explorer, the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory, and Solar Orbiter near 1 au during Solar Orbiter’s aphelion pass at the end of 2022 and early 2023. Three (five) of these events were detected simultaneously by at least two (three) spacecraft at up to ∼40° longitudinal separation, while seven events were detected by only a single spacecraft, even though an adjacent spacecraft was less than 20° apart. Using a magnetic connectivity tool, we show statistically that there is a >50% probability of detection when the spacecraft-modeled footpoints have an angular separation angle of <24° to the potential source region back at the Sun. This supports previous studies suggesting that the source of these 3He-rich SEP events is narrow in longitudinal extent. On the other hand, the magnetic connectivity due to the presence of coronal mass ejections, footpoint motion, and/or field-line meandering may also lead to difference in a detection at 1 au.

太阳望远镜的观测和Mancha3D模拟结果表明，我们对浮现下方落结的形成和演化进行了分析，同时比较了观测到的结的宽度和运动学特征与模拟调查的结果。我们使用半自动化方法恢复观测参数，发现结的平均速度为-9.68 km/s，平均宽度为614 km。模拟结果显示，在临界波长λc为100到500 km和磁场强度B0为1到20 G的范围内，λc约为300 km，B0约为2到6 G的值最接近于观测结果。由于观测和模拟结果匹配，我们得出结论：磁性雷利-泰勒不稳定可以对此观测结果提供物理上有意义的解释。此外，我们还预测，在应用点扩散函数到模拟结果的示例时，Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope将能够从观测中恢复出落体前缘上的次级不稳定性。 <br /><br />总结: 太阳望远镜和Mancha3D模拟分析表明，磁性雷利-泰勒不稳定提供了对观测结果的物理上有意义的解释。观测得出的结的速度和宽度与模拟范围内的预期值匹配。此外，我们还预测Daniel K.

Using Swedish 1 m Solar Telescope Crisp Imaging Spectro-Polarimeter 6563 Å (Hα) observations and Mancha3D simulations, we analyze the formation and evolution of falling knots beneath a hedgerow prominence. By comparing the observed knot widths and kinematics to those of a parametric survey of simulations, we estimate the range of magnetic field values and characteristic wavelengths to test if the magnetic Rayleigh–Taylor instability (MRTI) can provide a physically meaningful explanation. We recover observational parameters using a novel semiautomated method and find knot velocities with a mean of −9.68 km s−1 and a mean width of 614 km. Our simulations survey a range of critical wavelengths, λc, of 100 to 500 km, and magnetic field strengths, B0, of 1 to 20 G, finding the closest match to observations around λc = 300 km, and B0 = 2 to 6 G. As both the observational and simulated values match expected values, we conclude that the MRTI can provide a physically meaningful explanation of this observation. Additionally, we also predict that the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope will be able to observationally recover secondary instabilities on the leading edge of the falling mass through applying a point-spread function to an example from the simulated results.

<div> Fraunhofer lines, spectropolarimetric, solar eclipse, Fiber Arrayed Solar Optical Telescope, polarization amplitude
总结:
太阳赤道上的上层和内部的色球层以及近日冕层的Fraunhofer线的光谱偏振结果是由Fiber Arrayed Solar Optical Telescope在2013年11月3日在加蓬的日全食期间收集的。研究发现，这些层中的Fraunhofer线的线偏振强烈依赖于特定的谱线和位置。Mg ib1518.4 nm处的Fraunhofer线的偏振幅度可高达0.36%，而Fe i/Cr i524.7 nm等线的偏振通常混合在噪音水平的6.0 × 10−4中。总体趋势是，Fraunhofer线的偏振随着高度的增加而增加，其振幅可能接近于相邻位置产生的发射线，通常大于连续谱。Fraunhofer线的偏振方向的旋转通常伴随着偏振振幅和轮廓形状的变化。还从这些偏振特性以及其他证据中判断，在这些大气层中存在中性金属原子。 <div>
Spectropolarimetric results of Fraunhofer lines between 516.3 and 532.6 nm are presented in local upper solar chromosphere and inner corona below a height of about 0.04 solar radius above the solar limb. The data were acquired on 2013 November 3 during a total solar eclipse in Gabon by the prototype Fiber Arrayed Solar Optical Telescope. It is found that the linear polarizations of the Fraunhofer lines in these layers depend strongly on specific spectral lines and positions. A Fraunhofer line at Mg ib1518.4 nm can have a polarization amplitude up to 0.36% with respect to the continuum polarization level, while polarizations of lines like Fe i/Cr i524.7 nm are often merged in the noise level of 6.0 × 10−4. The polarizations of the Fraunhofer lines, like the emission ones and the continuum, increase with height as a whole trend, and their amplitudes can be close to those of emission ones yielded in close positions, and generally larger than those of the continuum. Rotations of the polarization directions of the Fraunhofer lines are often accompanied by variations in their polarization amplitudes and profile shapes. It is also judged from these polarimetric properties, along with other evidence, that neutral metal atoms exist in these atmospheric layers.

<div> 磁导数近似, 离子速度分布函数, 有限拉莫半径效应, 磁层边界, Kelvin-Helmholtz 不稳定性

总结: 本研究使用本地杂交-Vlasov模拟来研究磁层边界类似的横向速度剪切层中与Kelvin-Helmholtz不稳定性相关的离子速度分布函数。我们发现当速度剪切层存在密度/温度不对称性时，有限拉莫半径效应在涡旋边缘产生热流。这种热流的量级相当于总磁层能流的显著部分，提供了一种可用单一航天器测量的明显特征。在Kelvin-Helmholtz不稳定性的后期非线性阶段，还发现了混合的非麦克斯韦离子速度分布函数。我们的研究结果同样适用于在磁层边界存在微小磁场剪切的情况。 <div>
The Kelvin–Helmholtz instability (KHI), characterized by vortices forming at a perturbed velocity shear layer, is a prominent candidate mechanism for mass, momentum, and energy transport across boundaries with velocity shear in various space plasma environments. It is of particular interest at the flanks of Earth’s magnetopause, which separates the plasma of the magnetosphere from the adjacent shocked solar wind flow in the magnetosheath. In the present study, we use local hybrid-Vlasov simulations to investigate the ion velocity distribution functions (VDFs) associated with KHI in a magnetopause-like, transverse velocity shear layer setting (magnetic field perpendicular to the shear plane). We look for signatures of ion finite Larmor radius (FLR) effects, which could be utilized in spacecraft measurements to recognize when such effects are active, influencing KHI evolution and driving plasma mixing. We show that when a density/temperature asymmetry exists across the shear layer, FLR effects produce a heat flux along the vortex edges. With a magnitude (≳0.1 mW m−2) that is a significant fraction of the total magnetosheath energy flux, the heat flux provides a distinct signature that could be measured with a single spacecraft. During the late nonlinear stage of KHI, mixed non-Maxwellian ion VDFs are additionally found within the vortices. Our results are also valid in the presence of a small magnetic shear across the magnetopause.

Due to observational challenges, the mass function of black holes (BH) at lower masses is poorly constrained in the local universe. Understanding the occupation fraction of BHs in low-mass galaxies is crucial for constraining the origins of supermassive BH seeds. Compact stellar systems (CSSs), including ultracompact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) and compact elliptical galaxies (cEs), are potential intermediate-mass BH hosts. Despite the difficulties posed by their limited spheres of influence, stellar dynamical modeling has been effective in estimating central BH masses in CSSs. Some CSSs may harbor a BH constituting up to 20% of their host stellar mass, while others might not have a central BH. In support of our ongoing efforts to determine the BH masses in select CSSs in the Virgo cluster using JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations and orbit-superposition dynamical models, we create mock kinematic data mimicking the characteristics of observed cEs/UCDs in the Virgo cluster with different BH masses. We then construct a series of dynamical models using the orbit-superposition code FORSTAND and explore the accuracy of recovering the BH mass. We find that the mass of BHs comprising 1% or more of the total host stellar mass can be accurately determined through kinematic maps featuring higher-order velocity moments. We also assess how BH mass measurement is affected by deprojection methods, regularization factors, anisotropy parameters, orbit initial conditions, the absence of higher-order velocity moments, the spatial resolution, and the signal-to-noise ratio.

这篇文章介绍了来自LAMOST调查的335个Mira变星样本，通过对M型巨星光谱中的巴尔望排放和金属排放进行特征分析，区分了富氧恒星和富碳恒星。针对富氧恒星，研究了排放线强度与绝对光度、大气参数与周期之间的关系。发现Fe iλλ 4202, 4308呈现明显渐进曲线，可追踪脉冲激震产生的荧光排放。温度和周期之间关系不明显，而对数重力和金属丰度在450天周期范围内呈下降趋势，与文献结果一致。通过两个目标的时间序列光谱展示了巴尔望线在恒星亮度最高时达到峰值强度。 <div>
We present a sample of 335 Mira variables, extracted from DR9 of the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) survey. These variables are characterized by the Balmer emissions (Hδ, Hγ, Hβ, and Hα) and the metal emissions (Fe iλλ 4202, 4308, 4376, and Mg iλ4571) observed in M giant spectra. We distinguished oxygen-rich stars from carbon-rich stars through the identification of carbon molecular bands present in the optical spectra. For the oxygen-rich stars we examined multiple attributes, such as the link between line strength and bolometric luminosity, and the connection between atmospheric parameters and their periods. We observed that Fe iλλ 4202, 4308 showed a significantly gradual progression, which can be postulated to trace the fluorescent emission resulting from pulsation shocks. Regarding the correlation between Teff and the period, Teff remains relatively constant over varying periods, with no clear trend, while both log g and [Fe/H] show a decreasing trend within a period range of 450 days, and this decreasing of the log g trend is consistent with the results in the literature. To shed more light on the variations of Balmer lines, we showcase time-series spectra for two objects, demonstrating that the Balmer lines reach their peak intensity during the brightest phase of the stellar cycle.

总结:<br />
这篇文章通过二维粒子模拟研究了低Mach数、低等离子体β值的准垂直激波。研究发现，在激波前缘激发了电子回旋漂移不稳定性，这是由于激波反射离子和入射电子之间的相对漂移导致的。由电子回旋漂移不稳定性触发的静电波能够散射和加热入射电子，有利于它们逃离激波的损失锥。这些电子然后被激波反射，并被SDA加速。这样一来，在低等离子体β值的准垂直激波中，SDA的加速效率得到了极大提高。 <div>
Shock drift acceleration (SDA) plays an important role in generating high-energy electrons at quasi-perpendicular shocks, but its efficiency in low-beta plasmas is questionable. In this article, we perform a two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulation of a low-Mach-number, low-plasma-beta quasi-perpendicular shock, and find that the electron cyclotron drift instability is unstable at the leading edge of the shock foot, which is excited by the relative drift between the shock-reflected ions and the incident electrons. The electrostatic waves triggered by the electron cyclotron drift instability can scatter and heat the incident electrons, which facilitates their escape from the shock’s loss cone. These electrons are then reflected by the shock and energized by SDA. In this way, the acceleration efficiency of SDA at low-plasma-beta quasi-perpendicular shocks is highly enhanced.

The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) has detected very-high-energy gamma rays from the low-ionization nuclear emission-line region galaxy NGC 4278, which has a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (LLAGN) and symmetric, mildly relativistic S-shaped twin jets detected by radio observations. Few LLAGNs have been detected in gamma rays due to their faintness. Earlier, several radio-emitting components were detected in the jets of NGC 4278. We model their radio emission with synchrotron emission of ultra-relativistic electrons to estimate the strength of the magnetic field inside these components within a time-dependent framework after including the ages of the different components. We show that the synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton emission by these components cannot explain the Swift X-ray data and the LHAASO gamma-ray data from NGC 4278. We suggest that a separate component in one of the jets is responsible for the high-energy emission, whose age, size, magnetic field, and the spectrum of the ultra-relativistic electrons inside it have been estimated after fitting the multiwavelength data of NGC 4278 with the sum of the spectral energy distributions from the radio components and the high-energy component. We note that the radio components of NGC 4278 are larger than the high-energy component, which has also been observed in several high-luminosity active galactic nuclei.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Classification of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has been a long-standing puzzle in high-energy astrophysics. Recent observations challenge the traditional short versus long viewpoint, where long GRBs are thought to originate from the collapse of massive stars and short GRBs from compact binary mergers. Machine learning (ML) algorithms have been instrumental in addressing this problem, revealing five distinct GRB groups within the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) light-curve data, two of which are associated with kilonovae (KNe). In this work, we extend our analysis to the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor catalog and identify five clusters using unsupervised ML techniques, consistent with the Swift/BAT results. These five clusters are well separated in the fluence-duration plane, hinting at a potential link between fluence, duration, and complexities (or structures) in the light curves of GRBs. Further, we confirm two distinct classes of KN-associated GRBs. The presence of GRB 170817A in one of the two KN-associated clusters lends evidence to the hypothesis that this class of GRBs could potentially be produced by binary neutron star mergers. The second KN-associated GRB cluster could potentially originate from neutron star–black hole mergers. Future multimessenger observations of compact binaries in gravitational waves and electromagnetic waves can be paramount in understanding these clusters better.

<title>3He and Fe Spectral Properties in 3He-rich Solar Energetic Particle Events</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We have surveyed 3He-rich events on the Solar Orbiter mission from 2020 April to 2024 April, selecting isolated injections whose rollover 3He spectral shape is presumed to represent the initial acceleration state, unprocessed by subsequent activity such as coronal mass ejections or jets. A main goal has been to find relationships between the spectra of 3He and heavy ions C–Fe, in order to explore a common acceleration mechanism in spite of the fact that these events show 3He enrichments of up to ∼104, while the heavy-ion enrichment is rarely larger than ∼10. Selecting 34 3He injections, we find that heavy ions are always present, and arrive at the same time as the 3He signaling a common origin. Concentrating on Fe since it is a minor ion but with higher abundance than many others, we find its spectral shape and intensity is similar to 3He. In ∼two-thirds of the cases, if the 3He spectrum is shifted to lower energy by a factor 3.0 ± 1.3, it nearly coincides with the Fe spectrum, illustrating their close connection. Several plasma wave turbulence models have calculated spectra that also show the ion rollovers around 1 MeV nucleon−1. The unique mass-to-charge ratio of 3He allows it to interact more efficiently with the turbulence, thereby gaining several times more energy per nucleon than the other heavy ions. In the spectral rollover region this can lead to the observed enormous enhancements of 3He. The acceleration appears to be associated with magnetic reconnection in emerging flux regions on the Sun.

We report the temporal evolution of electron pitch angle distributions behind the dipolarization front (DF) in the Earth's magnetotail with observations of the Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) spacecraft. Taking advantage of multipoint observations from the THEMIS mission lined up in space, we study pitch angle distributions of energetic electrons behind the DF during two typical events. Pancake, rolling-pin, and cigar distributions are observed sequentially during the acceleration process. Based on Liouville's theorem, it is revealed that pancake distribution is dominantly formed by betatron acceleration in the early stage, and rolling-pin distribution is generated by both dominant Fermi and weak betatron acceleration in the transition stage, while cigar distribution is formed by Fermi acceleration finally. Our results provide comprehensive in situ observational evidence of the temporal evolution of electron acceleration behind the DF during propagation.

<title>A Luminous X-Ray Active Galactic Nucleus in the Dwarf–Dwarf Galaxy Merger RGG 66</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the discovery of a luminous X-ray active galactic nucleus (AGN) in the dwarf galaxy merger RGG 66. The black hole is predicted to have a mass of MBH ∼ 105.4 M⊙ and to be radiating close to its Eddington limit (Lbol/LEdd ∼ 0.75). The AGN in RGG 66 is notable both for its presence in a late-stage dwarf–dwarf merger and for its luminosity of L2–10 keV = 1042.2 erg s−1, which is among the most powerful AGNs known in nearby dwarf galaxies. The X-ray spectrum has a best-fit photon index of Γ = 2.4 and an intrinsic absorption of NH ∼ 1021 cm−2. These results come from a follow-up Chandra X-ray Observatory study of four irregular/disturbed dwarf galaxies with evidence for hosting AGNs based on optical spectroscopy. The remaining three dwarf galaxies do not have detectable X-ray sources with upper limits of L2–10 keV ≲ 1040 erg s−1. Taken at face value, our results on RGG 66 suggest that mergers may trigger the most luminous of AGNs in the dwarf galaxy regime, just as they are suspected to do in more massive galaxy mergers.

总结:<br /><br />本研究对明亮的类星体Mrk 501进行了为期14个月的多波段偏振测量。使用IXPE进行了2-8 keV的X射线偏振测量，并且伴随有来自NuSTAR、Swift/XRT和/或XMM-Newton的同时X射线数据。此外，还进行了B、V、R、I和J波段的光学-红外偏振测量，以及4.85 GHz至225.5 GHz的射电偏振测量。研究发现，尽管前五次IXPE观测中未发现X射线偏振度和角度的显著变化，但最近的第六次观测发现偏振度高于其他五次观测的平均值。光学和射电测量结果与X射线偏振特性之间没有明显的相关性。总的来说，X射线偏振度始终高于或类似于R波段光学偏振度，而后者又高于射电值。这与最初提出的能量分层激波场景一致，该场景解释了前两次IXPE观测结果，即偏振的X射线、光学和射电辐射来自不同的区域。 <div>
We present multiwavelength polarization measurements of the luminous blazar Mrk 501 over a 14 month period. The 2–8 keV X-ray polarization was measured with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) with six 100 ks observations spanning from 2022 March to 2023 April. Each IXPE observation was accompanied by simultaneous X-ray data from NuSTAR, Swift/XRT, and/or XMM-Newton. Complementary optical–infrared polarization measurements were also available in the B, V, R, I, and J bands, as were radio polarization measurements from 4.85 GHz to 225.5 GHz. Among the first five IXPE observations, we did not find significant variability in the X-ray polarization degree and angle with IXPE. However, the most recent sixth observation found an elevated polarization degree at >3σ above the average of the other five observations. The optical and radio measurements show no apparent correlations with the X-ray polarization properties. Throughout the six IXPE observations, the X-ray polarization degree remained higher than, or similar to, the R-band optical polarization degree, which remained higher than the radio value. This is consistent with the energy-stratified shock scenario proposed to explain the first two IXPE observations, in which the polarized X-ray, optical, and radio emission arises from different regions.

<div> 关键词: 极端发射线星系，JWST，NIRCam，CEERS，光度学鉴定

这项研究利用James Webb太空望远镜（JWST）的NIRCam光度学数据，从4 < z < 9的宇宙中选取了1165个极端发射线星系（EELGs）。研究使用简单的方法在光度学上鉴定出具有Hβ + [O iii]或Hα等效宽度（EW）> 5000 Å的EELGs。研究通过对部分（34个）光度学选择的EELGs进行JWST/NIRSpec光谱观测验证了选择方法，结果表明所有光谱观测的EELGs均证实了光度学识别的极端发射。研究发现CEERS中的中带F410M滤波器在识别EELGs方面特别高效。文章还提供了被错误分类为超高红移（z > 12）的EELGs的案例，并将EELGs与相同红移范围内更广泛的（次极端的）星系群体进行比较，发现它们与更广泛的发射线星系群体一致。最高EW的EELGs倾向于具有比连续谱尺寸更紧凑的发射线尺寸，这表明活动星系核至少对一些最极端的EELGs负责。光度学推断的发射线比与具有高电离和适度低金属丰度的星际介质条件一致，与先前的光谱研究一致。

总结: 
这项研究利用JWST的NIRCam光度学数据成功鉴定出1165个4 < z < 9的极端发射线星系(EELGs)，并通过光谱观测验证了其选择方法；其中CEERS中的中带F410M滤波器在识别EELGs方面特别高效；研究还发现一些EELGs可能会被错误分类为超高红移的星系，同时对EELGs和更广泛的星系进行了比较，发现它们是更广泛发射线星系群体的更蓝色、高EW的尾部。最后，研究结果还表明高EW的EELGs倾向于具有紧凑的发射线尺寸，光度学推断的发射线比也与先前的光谱研究一致。 <div>
We present a sample of 1165 extreme emission-line galaxies (EELGs) at 4 < z < 9 selected using James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRCam photometry in the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) program. We use a simple method to photometrically identify EELGs with Hβ + [O iii] (combined) or Hα emission of observed-frame equivalent width (EW) > 5000 Å. JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopic observations of a subset (34) of the photometrically selected EELGs validate our selection method: All spectroscopically observed EELGs confirm our photometric identification of extreme emission, including some cases where the spectral-energy-distribution-derived photometric redshifts are incorrect. We find that the medium-band F410M filter in CEERS is particularly efficient at identifying EELGs, both in terms of including emission lines in the filter and in correctly identifying the continuum between Hβ + [O iii] and Hα in the neighboring broadband filters. We present examples of EELGs that could be incorrectly classified as ultrahigh redshift (z > 12) as a result of extreme Hβ + [O iii] emission blended across the reddest photometric filters. We compare the EELGs to the broader (subextreme) galaxy population in the same redshift range and find that they are consistent with being the bluer, high-EW tail of a broader population of emission-line galaxies. The highest-EW EELGs tend to have more compact emission-line sizes than continuum sizes, suggesting that active galactic nuclei are responsible for at least some of the most extreme EELGs. The photometrically inferred emission-line ratios are consistent with interstellar medium conditions with high ionization and moderately low metallicity, consistent with previous spectroscopic studies.

<title>A Multiwavelength Approach to Constraining the Merger Properties of ACT-CL J0034.4+0225</title>

<div> 关键词: J0034.4+0225, 星系团, 合并, 气体分布, X射线质量估算
总结:
J0034.4+0225是一个之前未被识别的星系团，其红移为0.38588。研究发现，该星系团存在两个表面亮度峰值，分别对应于两个最亮的星系团星系，这两个峰值间距约为259千秒差距，被扩展的星系团气体包围着。通过观测数据，确定了星系团的质量，并且通过对星系团的 X 射线图像以及气体和星系团成员的速度差进行分析，确定了星系团的合并状态和特性。同时，通过强镜效分析和星系团形态分析，也对星系团的质量比和合并状态进行了进一步的限制。 <div>
ACT-CL J0034.4+0225 is a previously unrecognized merging galaxy cluster at z = 0.38588 ± 0.00068. Our primary evidence is provided by a 21 ks Chandra image that shows two surface brightness peaks separated by ∼49″ (259 kpc) surrounded by an extended cluster gas distribution. Each gas peak contains a brightest cluster galaxy, offset from the gas peak. We collect new South African Large Telescope optical spectra that, when augmented by archival data, yield redshifts for the two BGCs and 58 other cluster members. Archival Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope and MeerKAT data reveal a radio halo that encompasses the X-ray peaks. We provide and compare three X-ray-based mass estimates (5.0 × 1014M⊙, 6.4 × 1014M⊙, and 8.6 × 1014M⊙). The Planck and ACT Sunyaev–Zel’dovich masses are ≈5.8 × 1014M⊙. We constrain the merger state and properties by comparing them to an existing suite of N-body/hydrodynamical models using the measured gas peak separation (259 kpc, projected) and radial velocity difference (0–1000 km s−1). This constrains the epoch of the merger to be within ∼100 Myr of first pericenter passage. A strong lensing analysis constrains the mass ratio to be in the range 1:1–1:20, while the cluster morphology prefers values near the equal-mass range.

<div> 磁重连，等离子体动力学，非热粒子加速，大规模全粒子模拟，磁场混沌

总结:<br /><br />本文通过进行大规模全粒子模拟，研究了多X线小磁通重联在弱导磁和强导磁条件下的独特三维动力学，揭示了导致磁场混沌和有效加速的机制，并实现了电子和质子的非热加速。在低导磁条件下，磁通绳扭结不稳定主导了有效加速的动力学过程；而在强导磁条件下，斜向磁通绳也参与了有效加速的主要动力学过程。电子和质子的非热加速过程受到垂直和平行电场的影响。磁场功率谱与现场磁尾观测相吻合，而谱指数可能反映了小磁通的大小分布。这项工作对于太阳物理和天体物理中的三维重联动力学和粒子加速具有广泛的意义。 <div>
Understanding plasma dynamics and nonthermal particle acceleration in 3D magnetic reconnection has been a long-standing challenge. In this paper, we explore these problems by performing large-scale fully kinetic simulations of multi-X-line plasmoid reconnection with various parameters in both the weak- and strong-guide-field regimes. In each regime, we have identified its unique 3D dynamics that lead to field-line chaos and efficient acceleration, and we have achieved nonthermal acceleration of both electrons and protons into power-law spectra. The spectral indices agree well with a simple Fermi acceleration theory that includes guide-field dependence. In the low-guide-field regime, the flux rope kink instability governs the 3D dynamics for efficient acceleration. The weak dependence of the spectra on the ion-to-electron mass ratio and β (≪1) implies that the particles are sufficiently magnetized for Fermi acceleration in our simulations. While both electrons and protons are injected at reconnection exhausts, protons are primarily injected by perpendicular electric fields through Fermi reflections and electrons are injected by a combination of perpendicular and parallel electric fields. The magnetic power spectra agree with in situ magnetotail observations, and the spectral index may reflect a reconnection-driven size distribution of plasmoids instead of the Goldreich–Sridhar vortex cascade. As the guide field becomes stronger, the oblique flux ropes of large sizes capture the main 3D dynamics for efficient acceleration. Intriguingly, the oblique flux ropes can also experience flux rope kink instability, to drive extra 3D dynamics. This work has broad implications for 3D reconnection dynamics and particle acceleration in heliophysics and astrophysics.

核心坍缩超新星（CCSN）模拟显示，长期模型能够产生与卡西欧座A中观察到的44Ti/56Ni比例相似的结果，并且现代超新星模型能够合成高达2×10−4M⊙的44Ti。中微子驱动的风和3D模型中同时存在吸积和爆炸是其产生的核心因素。研究得出以前CCSN模型中的44Ti产量不足问题已经不再存在。此外，研究还讨论了57Ni的产生以及稳定镍/铁比例，并将结果与SN 1987A和蟹状星云的观测进行了比较。<br /><br />总结:长期CCSN模型可以产生与观测相符合的44Ti/56Ni比例，现代超新星模型可合成高达2×10−4M⊙的44Ti。中微子驱动的风和3D模型中同时存在吸积和爆炸是其产生的核心因素。以前CCSN模型中的44Ti产量不足问题已经得到解决。另外，研究还讨论了57Ni的产生以及稳定镍/铁比例，并将结果与观测进行了比较。 <div>
We report nucleosynthetic results for both 44Ti and nickel isotopes for 18 three-dimensional (3D) core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulations extended to ∼20 s after bounce. We find that many of our long-term models are able to achieve 44Ti/56Ni ratios similar to that observed in Cassiopeia A, and modern supernova models can synthesize up to 2 × 10−4M⊙ of 44Ti. Neutrino-driven winds and the fact that there can be simultaneous accretion and explosion in 3D models of CCSNe play central roles in its production. We conclude that the 44Ti underproduction problem in previous CCSN models is no longer an issue. In addition, we discuss the production of both 57Ni and stable nickel/iron ratios and compare our results to observations of SN 1987A and the Crab.

总结:
高红移的TXS 1508+572是一颗非常亮的类星体，其在2022年2月至8月期间出现了高能γ射线活动，达到了与Fermi-LAT观测到的最亮耀斑相媲美的峰值亮度。通过使用XMM-Newton、Neil Gehrels Swift天文台、Effelsberg 100 m射电望远镜和非常长基线阵列进行多波段观测，研究人员发现该源在红外波段上的变化特别明显。在进行的观测活动中，所收集的光谱能量分布符合一区电子模型，γ射线耀斑是由于加速电子的新注入导致外部康普顿辐射增加造成的。 <div>
Blazars can be detected from very large distances due to their high luminosity. However, the detection of γ-ray emission of blazars beyond z = 3 has only been confirmed for a small number of sources. Such observations probe the growth of supermassive black holes close to the peak of star formation in the history of galaxy evolution. As a result from a continuous monitoring of a sample of 80 z > 3 blazars with the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT), we present the first detection of a γ-ray flare from the z = 4.31 blazar TXS 1508+572. This source showed high γ-ray activity from 2022 February to August, reaching a peak luminosity comparable to the most luminous flares ever detected with Fermi-LAT. We conducted a multiwavelength observing campaign involving XMM-Newton, the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, the Effelsberg 100 m radio telescope, and the Very Long Baseline Array. In addition, we make use of the monitoring programs by the Zwicky Transient Facility and the Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer at optical and infrared wavelengths, respectively. We find that the source is particularly variable in the infrared band on daily timescales. The spectral energy distribution collected during our campaign is well described by a one-zone leptonic model, with the γ-ray flare originating from an increase of external Compton emission as a result of a fresh injection of accelerated electrons.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章介绍了通过分析与空气核碰撞产生的次级宇宙射线粒子的特性间接表征超高能宇宙射线的方法。研究发现，观测到的大气深度宇宙线粒子到达地面的μ子数量明显超过了现有宇宙射线强子相互作用模型的模拟结果。为了解释这一μ子过多现象，引入了一个新的理论模型——胶子凝聚模型。这一模型假设在级联过程的第一次碰撞中出现胶子凝聚效应，导致奇异度产生显著增加，进而增加了K介子的产生率， nK/nπ大于通常的强子相互作用过程的值。该模型提供了一个新的理论可能性来解释μ子过多的难题。 <div>
Ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays are often characterized indirectly by analyzing the properties of secondary cosmic ray particles produced in the collisions with air nuclei. The particle number Nμ of muon and the depth of shower maximum Xmax after air shower cascade are mostly studied to infer the energy and mass of the incident cosmic rays. Research has shown that there is a significant excess in the observed number of muons arriving at the ground from extensive air showers compared to the simulations using the existing cosmic ray hadronic interaction model. To explain this muon excess phenomenon, a new theoretical model, the gluon condensation model, is introduced in this paper and simulated by using the AIRES engine. We assume that the gluon condensation (GC) effect appears mainly in the first collision of the cascade, leading to a significant increase in the strangeness production, consequently, the production rate of kaons is increased, and nK/nπ is greater than the value of the usual hadronic interaction process. In the calculation, the model assumes that only pions and kaons are produced in the GC state. The increase of strange particle yield would mean that the energy transferred from the hadronic cascade to the electromagnetic cascade through π0 → 2γ decay is reduced. This would in turn increase the number of muons at the ground level due to meson decays. Our model provides a new theoretical possibility to explain the muon excess puzzle.

CME是太阳释放的等离子体，可能对太空和地面电子设备造成严重损坏。研究CME的触发、加速和演变对我们更好地理解它们非常重要，而了解太阳低日冕中CME等离子体特性使用高分辨率紫外和极紫外光谱学是十分关键的。虽然目前对低太阳日冕中CME的光谱解析观测很少，但随着Solar Orbiter上Spectal Imaging of the Coronal Environment的发射和未来即将上线的Solar-C上的EUVST和MUSE，我们将有机会获得前所未有的光谱解析CME观测。利用Hinode/EUV成像光谱仪对CME进行的唯一完整极紫外光谱观测，我们预测SPICE，EUVST和MUSE在日冕CME喷发期间预计将观测到的光谱，以研究每种仪器的诊断能力。最后，我们提供了CME等离子体诊断的密度敏感和温度敏感比值列表，以及每种仪器预期光谱图谱，以便进行观测序列规划。

Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) expel multithermal, magnetized plasma from the Sun, and when directed toward Earth, can cause extensive damage to space and ground-based electronics. To better understand the triggering, acceleration, and evolution of CMEs, it is critical to study CME plasma properties close to the Sun. High-resolution ultraviolet and extreme ultraviolet (UV-EUV) spectroscopy can give the most detailed plasma diagnostics of CMEs in the low solar corona. Unfortunately, very few spectrally resolved observations of CMEs in the low solar corona exist. However, with the recent launch of the Spectral Imaging of the Coronal Environment on board Solar Orbiter and the upcoming missions, including the EUV High-Throughput Solar Telescope (EUVST) on Solar-C and the Multi-slit Solar Explorer (MUSE), we will have the opportunity to obtain unprecedented, spectrally resolved CME observations. Using the only full EUV spectral observation of a CME by the Hinode/EUV Imaging Spectrometer, we predict the spectra that SPICE, EUVST, and MUSE are expected to observe during an off-limb CME eruption to investigate the diagnostic capabilities of each instrument. Finally, we provide a list of density-sensitive and temperature-sensitive ratios for CME plasma diagnostics along with the expected spectral atlas for each instrument to facilitate observing sequence planning.

<div> β Hyi, subgiant, rotation period, asteroseismology, magnetic activity cycle
总结:
β Hyi是一个太阳型亚巨星，研究发现它有类似太阳的振荡，通过测量旋转周期和进行磁活动循环预测，得出β Hyi的旋转周期与减弱磁制动模型相一致，这表明亚巨星的结构变化可以重新激活大尺度的动力学，从而短暂地维持磁活动循环。这一结果支持了进化的亚巨星存在“再生”动力学的观点。 <div>
The solar-type subgiant β Hyi has long been studied as an old analog of the Sun. Although the rotation period has never been measured directly, it was estimated to be near 27 days. As a Southern Hemisphere target, it was not monitored by long-term stellar activity surveys, but archival International Ultraviolet Explorer data revealed a 12 yr activity cycle. Previous ground-based asteroseismology suggested that the star is slightly more massive and substantially larger and older than the Sun, so the similarity of both the rotation rate and the activity cycle period to solar values is perplexing. We use two months of precise time-series photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite to detect solar-like oscillations in β Hyi and determine the fundamental stellar properties from asteroseismic modeling. We also obtain a direct measurement of the rotation period, which was previously estimated from an ultraviolet activity–rotation relation. We then use rotational evolution modeling to predict the rotation period expected from either standard spin-down or weakened magnetic braking (WMB). We conclude that the rotation period of β Hyi is consistent with WMB and that changes in stellar structure on the subgiant branch can reinvigorate the large-scale dynamo and briefly sustain magnetic activity cycles. Our results support the existence of a “born-again” dynamo in evolved subgiants—previously suggested to explain the cycle in 94 Aqr Aa—which can best be understood within the WMB scenario.

本文通过 Parker Solar Probe (PSP) 最近的观测结果表明，在太阳圈电流层 (HCS) 处，质子和重离子被磁重连加速至高能。通过在大尺度 MHD 模拟中解决能量粒子输运方程，我们研究了在重新连接的 HCS 中质子和重离子的压缩加速。我们发现多种离子的加速导致了非热的幂律分布，其谱指数与 PSP 观测一致。我们的研究显示，质子的高能截断可以达到 1 MeV，取决于粒子扩散系数。我们还研究了不同离子种类的高能截断如何随着电荷质量比缩放。当从 Kolmogorov 磁场功率谱的准线性理论中确定扩散系数时，我们发现 α∼0.4，略小于 PSP 观测的 α∼0.7。 <div>
Recent observations by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) suggest that protons and heavier ions are accelerated to high energies by magnetic reconnection at the heliospheric current sheet (HCS). By solving the energetic particle transport equation in large-scale MHD simulations, we study the compression acceleration of protons and heavier ions in the reconnecting HCS. We find that the acceleration of multispecies ions results in nonthermal power-law distributions with a spectral index consistent with the PSP observations. Our study shows that the high-energy cutoff of protons can reach –1 MeV depending on the particle diffusion coefficients. We also study how the high-energy cutoff of different ion species scales with the charge-to-mass ratio . When determining the diffusion coefficients from the quasi-linear theory with a Kolmogorov magnetic power spectrum, we find that α ∼ 0.4, which is somewhat smaller than α ∼ 0.7 observed by PSP.

Pulsars have been primarily detected by their narrow pulses or periodicity in time domain data. Interferometric surveys for pulsars are challenging due to the trade-off between beam sensitivity and beam size and the corresponding tradeoff between survey sensitivity (depth), sky coverage, and computational efforts. The detection sensitivity of time domain searches for pulsars is affected by dispersion smearing, scattering, and rapid orbital motion of pulsars in binaries. We have developed a new technique to select pulsar candidates in interferometric radio images by identifying scintillating sources and measuring their scintillation bandwidth and timescale. Identifying likely candidates allows sensitive, focused time-domain searches, saving computational effort. Pulsar scintillation is independent of its timing properties and hence offers a different selection of pulsars compared to time-domain searches. Candidates identified from this method could allow us to find hard-to-detect pulsars, such as submillisecond pulsars and pulsars in very compact, highly accelerated binary orbits. We use upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) observations in the fields of PSR B1508+55, PSR J0437−4715, and PSR B0031−07 as test cases for our technique. We demonstrate that the technique correctly differentiates between the pulsar and other nonscintillating point sources and show that the extracted dynamic spectrum of the pulsar is equivalent to that extracted from the uGMRT phased array beam. We show the results from our analysis of known pulsar fields and discuss challenges in dealing with interference and instrumental effects.

<div> H ii regions, outflows, LMC, star formation, scaling relation
<br />
大麦哲伦星系（LMC）的研究发现在氢、硫、硅和碳等多种气体中存在离子化的外流现象。这些外流的质量明显与LMC的星形成速率表面密度（ΣSFR）相关，外流的质量以及质载因子进一步揭示了这一现象的特点。研究还发现，这些外流与LMC的年轻恒星盘同步转动，并且未受到外部力量的显著影响。因此，文章推测LMC前方存在一个能够屏蔽外流免受来自银河的迎风压力影响的弓形冲击波。总结: 大麦哲伦星系中存在多种气体的离子化外流，与星形成速率相关，与年轻恒星盘同步转动，可能存在屏蔽外流的弓形冲击波。 <div>
The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is home to many H ii regions, which may lead to significant outflows. We examine the LMC’s multiphase gas (T∼104-5 K) in H i, S ii, Si iv, and C iv using 110 stellar sight lines from the Hubble Space Telescope’s Ultraviolet Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential Standards program. We develop a continuum fitting algorithm based on the concept of Gaussian process regression and identify reliable LMC interstellar absorption over vhelio = 175–375 km s−1. Our analyses show disk-wide ionized outflows in Si iv and C iv across the LMC with bulk velocities of ∣vout, bulk∣ ∼ 20–60 km s−1, which indicates that most of the outflowing mass is gravitationally bound. The outflows’ column densities correlate with the LMC’s star formation rate surface densities (ΣSFR), and the outflows with higher ΣSFR tend to be more ionized. Considering outflows from both sides of the LMC as traced by C iv, we conservatively estimate a total outflow rate of and a mass-loading factor of η ≳ 0.15. We compare the LMC’s outflows with those detected in starburst galaxies and simulation predictions, and find a universal scaling relation of over a wide range of star-forming conditions (ΣSFR ∼ 10−4.5–102M⊙ yr−1 kpc−2). Lastly, we find that the outflows are corotating with the LMC’s young stellar disk and the velocity field does not seem to be significantly impacted by external forces; we thus speculate on the existence of a bow shock leading the LMC, which may have shielded the outflows from ram pressure as the LMC orbits the Milky Way.

JWST载荷、星系、UFOs、空间扩展、红移

JWST观测首年的一个意外发现是，在光学上看起来被认为是紧凑的光学暗星系（OFG）群体中，存在大量空间扩展的星系（超红扁平物体，或称UFOs）。利用JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey的深度和调查区域，我们对另外112个天体进行了观测，其中56个在F444W波段分辨率很高，有效尺寸Re > 0.″25，将之前的UFO数量增加了三倍以上。这些星系的红移大约在2 < z < 4之间，具有高质量星系（），并且具有约100-1000M⊙ yr−1的星形成速率。令人惊讶的是，UFOs在整个区域都呈现出红色，空间分辨率分析显示这是由于极高的尘埃衰减（通常在大半径处甚至达到AV > 2 mag）。在形态上，我们的UFO样本大多数倾向于具有较低的Sérsic指数（n∼1），表明这些大型、大质量的OFGs在F444W中几乎没有来自球状物的贡献。此外，大多数的轴比介于0.2 < q < 0.4之间，贝叶斯建模显示它们的本征形状与倾斜的圆盘和近似椭球体的混合相一致，几乎没有来自球状的贡献。虽然动力学约束将需要确定UFOs的真实本征形状，但显而易见的是一个意外的大型、扁平或近圆形物体的群体对OFGs的数量贡献很大。<br /><br />总结: JWST观测发现了大量的空间扩展星系（UFOs），它们具有高红移、高质量和高星形成速率。这些星系在整个区域都呈现出红色，并且大多数都具有较低的Sérsic指数，表明它们几乎没有来自球状物的贡献。此外，它们的本征形状可能是倾斜的圆盘和近似椭球体的混合。 <div>
One of the more surprising findings after the first year of JWST observations is the large number of spatially extended galaxies (ultrared flattened objects, or UFOs) among the optically faint galaxy (OFG) population otherwise thought to be compact. Leveraging the depth and survey area of the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey, we extend observations of the OFG population to an additional 112 objects, 56 of which are well-resolved in F444W with effective sizes, Re > 0.″25, more than tripling previous UFO counts. These galaxies have redshifts around 2 < z < 4, high stellar masses ( ), and star formation rates around ∼100–1000 M⊙ yr−1. Surprisingly, UFOs are red across their entire extents, which spatially resolved analysis of their stellar populations shows is due to large values of dust attenuation (typically AV > 2 mag even at large radii). Morphologically, the majority of our UFO sample tends to have low Sérsic indices (n ∼ 1) suggesting that these large, massive, OFGs have little contribution from a bulge in F444W. Further, a majority have axis ratios between 0.2 < q < 0.4, which Bayesian modeling suggests that their intrinsic shapes are consistent with being a mixture of inclined disks and prolate objects with little to no contribution from spheroids. While kinematic constraints will be needed to determine the true intrinsic shapes of UFOs, it is clear that an unexpected population of large, disky or prolate objects contributes significantly to the population of OFGs.

<div> 核子星；夸克物质；相变；热涨落；核化概率

总结:<br />
本文研究了在核子星内部的极高密度条件下可能形成的夸克物质。作者指出，夸克物质的形成可能是通过一种叫做核化的过程发生的，而热涨落对这一过程起着重要作用。在有限温度下，系统中的热力学量会围绕平均值产生波动。热涨落可能使核化过程在子系统中更容易发生。作者还指出，对于较低的温度，需要的过压已经超过了紧凑星所能达到的最大压力。最后，即使考虑到有限尺寸效应，对于更高的温度，核化过程也可能发生。 <div>
At the extreme densities reached in the core of neutron stars, it is possible that deconfined quark matter is produced. The formation of this new phase of strongly interacting matter is likely to occur via a first-order phase transition for the typical temperatures reached in astrophysical processes. The first seeds of quark matter would then form through a process of nucleation within the metastable hadronic phase. Here, we address the role of the thermal fluctuations in the hadronic composition on the nucleation of two-flavor quark matter. At finite temperature, the thermodynamic quantities in a system fluctuate around average values. Nucleation being a local process, it is possible that it occurs in a subsystem whose composition makes the nucleation easier. We will consider the total probability of the nucleation as the product between the probability that a subsystem has a certain hadronic composition different from the average in the bulk, and the nucleation probability in that subsystem. We will show how those fluctuations of the hadronic composition can increase the efficiency of nucleation already for temperatures ∼(0.1−1) keV. However, for temperatures ≲(1−10) MeV, the needed overpressure exceeds the maximum pressure reached in compact stars. Finally, for even larger temperatures the process of nucleation can take place, even taking into account finite-size effects.

该研究报道了罕见的核心崩溃超新星SN 2021wvw的详细多波段光度测量和光谱观测分析，包括达到250天的光度演化和达到100天的光谱覆盖。这一独特事件与IIP型超新星的一般趋势不符，显示出中等亮度，仅有约75天的短暂平台期，然后是非常快的（约10天）过渡到尾相。在速度空间中，与较大的II型样本相比，其速度较低。观测到的峰值绝对星等为r-band中的−16.1等，镍质量被良好地限制为0.020 ± 0.006 M⊙。使用MESA+STELLA进行详细的流体动力学建模表明，这是一个半径紧凑、低金属量、高质量的红超巨星前体（MZAMS=18 M⊙），爆发时释放了约0.2×1051 erg s−1，留下了一个Ejecta mass of Mej≈5 M⊙。与光度曲线特性相一致，前体+爆炸模型显示了显著的后期回落过程。作为迄今为止表面最暗的短暂平台超新星，这一事件增加了在经典的约100天平台型IIP和剥离壳事件之间的过渡事件的多样性。 <br /><br />总结：本研究报道了核心崩溃超新星SN 2021wvw的独特特征，其光度和速度特性与常见的IIP型超新星不符合，表现出中等亮度和短暂的平台期。使用MESA+STELLA进行流体动力学建模显示，这颗超新星的前体是一个半径紧凑、低金属量、高质量的红超巨星。研究结果对于增加我们对于不同超新星类型的了解提供了重要的信息。 <div>
We present detailed multiband photometric and spectroscopic observations and analysis of a rare core-collapse supernova, SN 2021wvw, that includes photometric evolution up to 250 days and spectroscopic coverage up to 100 days postexplosion. A unique event that does not fit well within the general trends observed for Type IIP supernovae, SN 2021wvw shows an intermediate luminosity with a short plateau phase of just about 75 days, followed by a very sharp (∼10 days) transition to the tail phase. Even in the velocity space, it lies at a lower velocity compared to a larger Type II sample. The observed peak absolute magnitude is −16.1 mag in r-band, and the nickel mass is well constrained to 0.020 ± 0.006 M⊙. Detailed hydrodynamical modeling using MESA+STELLA suggests a radially compact, low-metallicity, high-mass red supergiant progenitor (MZAMS = 18 M⊙), which exploded with ∼0.2 × 1051 erg s−1 leaving an ejecta mass of Mej ≈ 5 M⊙. Significant late-time fallback during the shock propagation phase is also seen in progenitor+explosion models consistent with the light-curve properties. As the faintest short-plateau supernova characterized to date, this event adds to the growing diversity of transitional events between the canonical ∼100 days plateau Type IIP and stripped-envelope events.

Precise spectroscopic classification of planet hosts is an important tool of exoplanet research at both the population and individual system level. In the era of large-scale surveys, data-driven methods offer an efficient approach to spectroscopic classification that leverages the fact that a subset of stars in any given survey has stellar properties that are known with high fidelity. Here, we use The Cannon, a data-driven framework for modeling stellar spectra, to train a generative model of spectra from the Gaia Data Release 3 Radial Velocity Spectrometer (RVS). Our model derives stellar labels with precisions of 72 K in Teff, 0.09 dex in logg, 0.06 dex in [Fe/H], 0.05 dex in [α/Fe], and 1.9 km s−1 in vbroad for main-sequence stars observed by Gaia DR3 by transferring GALAH labels, and is publicly available at https://github.com/isabelangelo/gaiaspec. We validate our model performance on planet hosts with available Gaia RVS spectra at SNR>50 by showing that our model is able to recover stellar parameters at ≥20% improved accuracy over the existing Gaia stellar parameter catalogs, measured by the agreement with high-fidelity labels from the Spectroscopic Observations of Cool Stars survey. We also provide metrics to test for stellar activity, binarity, and reliability of our model outputs and provide instructions for interpreting these metrics. Finally, we publish updated stellar labels and metrics that flag suspected binaries and active stars for Kepler Input Catalog objects with published Gaia RVS spectra.

We conduct a systematic search for high-redshift galaxy overdensities at 4.9 < zspec < 8.9 in both the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS)-N and GOODS-S fields using James Webb Space Telescope/Near-Infrared Camera (JWST/NIRCam) imaging from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey and JWST Extragalactic Medium-band Survey in addition to JWST/NIRCam wide field slitless spectroscopy from the First Reionization Epoch Spectroscopic Complete Survey. High-redshift galaxy candidates are identified using Hubble Space Telescope + JWST photometry spanning λ = 0.4–5.0 μm. We confirmed the redshifts for roughly a third of these galaxies using JWST spectroscopy over λ = 3.9–5.0 μm through identification of either Hα or around the best-fit photometric redshift. The rest-ultraviolet magnitudes and continuum slopes of these galaxies were inferred from the photometry: the brightest and reddest objects appear in more dense environments and thus are surrounded by more galaxy neighbors than their fainter and bluer counterparts, suggesting accelerated galaxy evolution within overdense environments. We find 17 significant (δgal ≥ 3.04, Ngal ≥ 4) galaxy overdensities across both fields (seven in GOODS-N and 10 in GOODS-S), including the two highest redshift spectroscopically confirmed galaxy overdensities to date at and (representing densities around ∼6 and ∼12 times that of a random volume). We estimate the total halo mass of these large-scale structures to be using an empirical stellar mass-to-halo mass relation, which are likely underestimates as a result of incompleteness. These protocluster candidates are expected to evolve into massive galaxy clusters with by z = 0.

In this study, galaxy samples have been generated using mock observation techniques based on the results of TNG100-1 simulations to investigate three forms of intrinsic alignment: satellite-central alignment between the orientation of the brightest group galaxies (BGG) and the spatial distribution of their satellites, radial alignment between the satellites’ orientation and the direction toward their BGG, as well as direct alignment between the orientation of BGG and that of its satellites. Overall, the predictions of galaxy alignment generally align with observations, although minor discrepancies have been identified. For satellite-central alignment, the alignment strength and color-dependence trends are well replicated by the mock observations. Regarding radial alignment, the signals are weak but discernible, with no apparent color dependence. As for direct alignment, no signal is detected, nor is there any color dependence. We also investigate the alignment dependencies on halo or the BGG properties, and proximity effect. For satellite-central alignment, the predicted alignment signal shows a positive correlation with halo and BGG mass, consistent with observations and previous predictions. Similar correlations have also been observed with the BGG age and metallicity, which merit future observational analysis for confirmation. Proximity effects have been observed for all three types of alignment, with satellites closer to the BGG exhibiting stronger alignment signals. The influence of galaxy definition and shape determination on alignment studies is also analyzed. This study underscores the importance of employing mock observation techniques for a fair comparison between predictions and observations.

总结:<br />
本文使用PIC模拟研究了低Mach数冲击波中的静电波现象，发现在这样的冲击波中，离子尺度的斜入射哨声波会产生两个热的反向电子流，驱动不稳定的电子声波，并在演化的后期形成静电孤波。通过周期性边界的模拟，显示出电子声波的特性符合线性色散分析。对于实际速度的冲击波，静电孤波的波长将减小到电子皮深度的十分之一，并且静电孤波幅值预计将超过准静态电场的100倍以上。这些理论预测可能解释了PIC模拟和卫星测量之间高频和低频电场波动相对幅度的不一致。 <div>
Collisionless low-Mach-number shocks are abundant in astrophysical and space plasma environments, exhibiting complex wave activity and wave–particle interactions. In this paper, we present 2D Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations of quasi-perpendicular nonrelativistic (vsh ≈ (5500–22000) km s−1) low-Mach-number shocks, with a specific focus on studying electrostatic waves in the shock ramp and precursor regions. In these shocks, an ion-scale oblique whistler wave creates a configuration with two hot counterstreaming electron beams, which drive unstable electron acoustic waves (EAWs) that can turn into electrostatic solitary waves (ESWs) at the late stage of their evolution. By conducting simulations with periodic boundaries, we show that the EAW properties agree with linear dispersion analysis. The characteristics of ESWs in shock simulations, including their wavelength and amplitude, depend on the shock velocity. When extrapolated to shocks with realistic velocities (vsh ≈ 300 km s−1), the ESW wavelength is reduced to one-tenth of the electron skin depth and the ESW amplitude is anticipated to surpass that of the quasi-static electric field by more than a factor of 100. These theoretical predictions may explain a discrepancy, between PIC and satellite measurements, in the relative amplitude of high- and low-frequency electric field fluctuations.

Active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback and its impact on their host galaxies are critical to our understanding of galaxy evolution. Here, we present a combined analysis of new high resolution ultraviolet (UV) data from the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) on AstroSat and archival optical spectroscopic data from the Very Large Telescope/MUSE, for the Seyfert galaxy, NGC 1365. Concentrating on the central 5 kpc region, the UVIT images in the far- and near-UV show bright star-forming knots in the circumnuclear ring as well as a faint central source. After correcting for extinction, we found the star formation rate (SFR) surface density of the circumnuclear 2 kpc ring to be similar to other starbursts, despite the presence of an AGN outflow, as seen in [O iii] 5007 Å. On the other hand, we found fainter UV and thus lower SFR in the direction southeast of the AGN relative to northwest in agreement with observations at other wavelengths from JWST and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The AGN outflow velocity is found to be lesser than the escape velocity, suggesting that the outflowing gas will rain back into the galaxy. The deep UV data have also revealed diffuse UV emission in the direction of the AGN outflow. By combining [O iii] and UV data, we found the diffuse emission to be of AGN origin.

<div> H ii regions, electron density, RRL–FS line method, observations, SOFIA Airborne Observatory

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章介绍了利用205μm [N ii]精细结构线和射电复合线来推导10个著名H ii区的电子密度。RRL-FS线方法结合了这两种光谱线，可以在无需了解电离区域大小的情况下，对n(e) ≥ 30 cm^-3的区域进行敏感探测。作者利用Green Bank天文台的H54α数据和SOFIA航空天文台的205μm数据，消除了观测中非均匀密度的显著误差。电子密度在观测的不同区域之间差异很大，从2600到36,000 cm^-3不等，其中两个低密度异常值分别为94和520 cm^-3。平均而言，这些密度比最高分辨率的单天线数据大约4倍，比182″角分辨率的单天线数据大约13倍。总体1σ的分数不确定性在0.15-0.29范围内。在RRL-FS线方法中，观测到的量与∫n2(z)dz / ∫n(z)dz成比例。这些高密度值可能是RRL-FS线技术对中心浓缩密度分布峰值的采样结果。 <div>
We employ observations of the 205 μm [N ii] fine structure (FS) line and radio recombination line (RRL) emission to derive the electron density in 10 well-known H ii regions. The combination of these two spectral lines (the RRL–FS line method) provides a sensitive probe of electron density in regions with n(e) ≥ 30 cm−3 without requiring knowledge of the size of the ionized region. By using H54α data from the Green Bank Telescope and 205 μm data from the SOFIA Airborne Observatory, we have almost identical 18″ beamwidths, removing a significant source of error for observations of H ii regions due to nonuniform density across the sources observed. The electron densities vary widely among the sources observed, from 2600 to 36,000 cm−3, with two low-density outliers at 94 and 520 cm−3. On average, these densities are a factor of 4 greater than the highest-resolution single-antenna data and a factor of almost 13 greater than the 182″ angular resolution single-antenna data having more sources in common. The total 1σ fractional uncertainties in n(e) are in the range 0.15–0.29. In the RRL–FS line method, the observationally determined quantity is proportional to ∫n2(z)dz / ∫n(z)dz. For a Gaussian density distribution much more extended than its 1/e radius, this is equal to , where n0 is the peak electron density. The high values of electron density found are plausibly the result of the RRL–FS line technique sampling the peak of a centrally condensed density distribution.

本研究报告了P II主要离子的两个共振跃迁的更新振子强度数值，这对于测量星际和星系周围气体中金属丰度至关重要。我们利用观测测量和高精度的准相对论Hartree-Fock理论计算，提出了P II 961.401 Å的共振跃迁的更新振子强度值为f = 0.147 ± 0.021。这个结果利用了非常大望远镜观测到的PKS 0528–250类星体的光谱。我们还计算了其他P II共振跃迁的理论振子强度，并提供了多个P II精细结构和激发态跃迁的理论数值。更新后的P II 961 Å跃迁的振子强度将在未来的磷元素丰度研究中发挥重要作用，特别是在1152 Å线饱和的视线测量中。 <div>
Abundance measurements for the volatile element phosphorus are important for measuring the metallicity in interstellar and circumgalactic gas, where their accuracies are limited by uncertainties in the oscillator strengths. We report updated oscillator strength values for two resonant transitions of the dominant ion P II, the transitions at 961.041 and 963.801 Å, which have historically shown large uncertainties. Using a combination of observational measurements and highly accurate quasi-relativistic Hartree–Fock theoretical calculations, we present an updated oscillator strength of f = 0.147 ± 0.021 for the poorly constrained P II resonant transition at 961.401 Å, which arises from the ground electronic state 3s23p23P0 to the excited level 3s23p3d3D . This result utilizes archival optical spectra obtained with the Very Large Telescope for the quasar PKS 0528–250, which has a damped Lyα absorber at z = 2.811. We calculate a theoretical f-value = 0.153 for 961.401 Å consistent with our empirically derived value, and calculate a theoretical f-value = 1.79 for 963.801 Å. We also present theoretical oscillator strengths for the P II resonant transitions at 972.779, 1124.945, 1152.818, 1301.874, and 1532.533 Å, as well as for multiple P II fine-structure and excited-level transitions. The updated f-value for the P II 961 Å transition will be useful in future studies of P abundances, especially in sight lines where the 1152 Å line is saturated.

<title>Where Have All the Sulfur Atoms Gone? Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon as a Possible Sink for the Missing Sulfur in the Interstellar Medium. I. The C–S Band Strengths</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad6dd7</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Despite its biogenic and astrochemical importance, sulfur (S), the 10th most abundant element in the interstellar medium (ISM) with a total abundance of S/H ≈ 2.2 × 10−5, largely remains undetected in molecular clouds. Even in the diffuse ISM where S was previously often believed to be fully in the gas phase, in recent years, observational evidence has suggested that S may also be appreciably depleted from the gas. What might be the dominant S reservoir in the ISM remains unknown. Solid sulfides like MgS, FeS, and SiS2 are excluded as major S reservoirs due to the nondetection of their expected infrared spectral bands in the ISM. In this work, we explore the potential role of sulfurated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules—PAHs with sulfur heterocycles (PASHs)—as a sink for the missing S. Utilizing density function theory, we compute the vibrational spectra of 18 representative PASH molecules. It is found that these molecules exhibit a prominent C–S stretching band at ∼10 μm and two relatively weak C–S deformation bands at 15 and 25 μm that are not mixed with the nominal PAH bands at 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.3, and 12.7 μm. If several parts per million of S (relative to H) are locked up in PAHs, the 10 μm C–S band would be detectable by Spitzer and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). To quantitatively explore the amount of S/H depleted in PASHs, a detailed comparison of the infrared emission spectra of PASHs with the Spitzer and JWST observations is needed.

<title>Galaxy Assembly Bias in the Stellar-to-halo Mass Relation for Red Central Galaxies from SDSS</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad6de1</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report evidence of galaxy assembly bias—the correlation between galaxy properties and biased secondary halo properties at fixed halo mass (MH)—in the stellar-to-halo mass relation for red central galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. In the MH = 1011.5–1013.5h−1M⊙ range, central galaxy stellar mass (M*) is correlated with the number density of galaxies within 10 h−1 Mpc (δ10), a common proxy for halo formation time. This galaxy assembly bias signal is also present when MH, M*, and δ10 are substituted with group luminosity, galaxy luminosity, and metrics of the large-scale density field. To associate differences in δ10 with variations in halo formation time, we fitted a model that accounts for (1) errors in the MH measured by the J. L. Tinker group catalog and (2) the level of correlation between halo formation time and M* at fixed MH. Fitting of this model yields that (1) errors in MH are ∼0.15 dex and (2) halo formation time and M* are strongly correlated (Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient ∼0.85). At fixed MH, variations of ∼0.4 dex in M* are associated with ∼1–3 Gyr variations in halo formation time and galaxy formation time (from stellar population fitting). These results are indicative that halo properties other than MH can impact central galaxy assembly.

The evolution of halos with masses around Mh ≈ 1011M⊙ and Mh ≈ 1012M⊙ at redshifts z > 9 is examined using constrained N-body simulations. The average specific mass accretion rates, , exhibit minimal mass dependence and generally agree with existing literature. Individual halo accretion histories, however, vary substantially. About one-third of simulations reveal an increase in around z ≈ 13. Comparing simulated halos with observed galaxies having spectroscopic redshifts, we find that for galaxies at z ≳ 9, the ratio between observed star formation rate and is approximately 2%. This ratio remains consistent for the stellar-to-halo mass ratio (SHMR) but only for z ≳ 10. At z ≃ 9, the SHMR is notably lower by a factor of a few. At z ≳ 10, there is an agreement between specific star formation rates (sSFRs) and . However, at z ≃ 9, observed sSFRs exceed simulated values by a factor of 2. It is argued that the mildly elevated SHMR in high-z halos with Mh ≈ 1011M⊙ can be achieved by assuming the applicability of the local Kennicutt–Schmidt law and a reduced effectiveness of stellar feedback due to deeper gravitational potential of high-z halos of a fixed mass.

<title>The Velocity Dispersion Function for Quiescent Galaxies in Massive Clusters from IllustrisTNG</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We derive the central stellar velocity dispersion function (VDF) for quiescent galaxies in 280 massive clusters with in IllustrisTNG300. The VDF is an independent tracer of the dark matter mass distribution of subhalos in galaxy clusters. Based on the IllustrisTNG cluster catalog, we select quiescent member subhalos with a specific star formation rate <2 × 10−11 yr−1 and stellar mass . We then simulate fiber spectroscopy to measure the stellar velocity dispersion of the simulated galaxies; we compute the line-of-sight velocity dispersions of star particles within a cylindrical volume that penetrates the core of each subhalo. We construct the VDFs for quiescent subhalos within R200. The simulated cluster VDF exceeds the simulated field VDF for , indicating the preferential formation of large velocity dispersion galaxies in dense environments. The excess is similar in simulations and in the observations. We also compare the simulated VDF for the three most massive clusters with with the observed VDF for the two most massive clusters in the local Universe, Coma and A2029. Intriguingly, the simulated VDFs are significantly lower for . This discrepancy results from (1) a smaller number of subhalos with in TNG300 compared to the observed clusters, and (2) a significant offset between the observed and simulated M*–σ* relations. The consistency in the overall shape of the observed and simulated VDFs offers a unique window into galaxy and structure formation in simulations.

三重星系统TIC 290061484打破了最短外部周期的记录，内部二进制系统表现出明显的食变时间变化。光动力学模型显示，三颗星将在20百万年内合并并经历II型超新星爆炸，留下一个单一的中子星残骸。 <div>
We have discovered a triply eclipsing triple-star system, TIC 290061484, with the shortest known outer period, Pout, of only 24.5 days. This “eclipses” the previous record set by λ Tauri at 33.02 days, which held for 68 yr. The inner binary, with an orbital period of Pin = 1.8 days, produces primary and secondary eclipses and exhibits prominent eclipse timing variations with the same periodicity as the outer orbit. The tertiary star eclipses, and is eclipsed by, the inner binary with pronounced asymmetric profiles. The inclinations of both orbits evolve on observable timescales such that the third-body eclipses exhibit dramatic depth variations in TESS data. A photodynamical model provides a complete solution for all orbital and physical parameters of the triple system, showing that the three stars have masses of 6.85, 6.11, and 7.90 M⊙, radii near those corresponding to the main sequence, and Teff in the range of 21,000–23,700 K. Remarkably, the model shows that the triple is in fact a subsystem of a hierarchical 2+1+1 quadruple with a distant fourth star. The outermost star has a period of ∼3200 days and a mass comparable to the stars in the inner triple. In ∼20 Myr, all three components of the triple subsystem will merge, undergo a Type II supernova explosion, and leave a single remnant neutron star. At the time of writing, TIC 290061484 is the most compact triple system and one of the tighter known compact triples (i.e., Pout/Pin = 13.7).

<br /> 
研究使用深度的斯皮策中红外光谱图对M101、NGC 628和NGC 2403三个附近的星系进行了研究，以探索多环芳烃（PAHs）在次太阳金属丰度下存在缺失的物理原因。研究发现，当金属丰度从太阳值降低到0.2太阳金属丰度以下时，PAHs总量与尘埃的辐射比率保持相对稳定，但在2/3太阳金属丰度以下迅速下降。为了解释这一现象，文章使用了新开发的颗粒模型来复现观测到的PAH-金属丰度关系，其中包括PAH特征强度的变化。最佳的模型使用了一个随金属丰度下降而变化的颗粒大小分布，表明金属丰度低时抑制了颗粒的生长，暗示星系中连续的补充过程是塑造PAH颗粒群的主导过程。 
<br /><br />总结: 
在跨越三个星系的实验中发现，PAH-金属丰度关系并非由辐射环境中最小颗粒的偏好破坏所导致，而是由金属丰度降低抑制颗粒生长而导致的。这一现象揭示了星系中连续的颗粒补充过程在塑造PAH颗粒群中发挥主导作用。 <div>
We use deep Spitzer mid-infrared spectroscopic maps of radial strips across three nearby galaxies with well-studied metallicity gradients (M101, NGC 628, and NGC 2403) to explore the physical origins of the observed deficit of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at subsolar metallicity (i.e., the PAH–metallicity relation or PZR). These maps allow us to trace the evolution of all PAH features from 5–18 μm as metallicity decreases continuously from solar (Z⊙) to 0.2 Z⊙. The total PAH-to-dust luminosity ratio remains relatively constant until reaching a threshold of ∼ 2/3 Z⊙, below which it declines smoothly but rapidly. The PZR has been attributed to preferential destruction of the smallest grains in the hard radiation environments found at low metallicity. In this scenario, a decrease in emission from the shortest-wavelength PAH features is expected. In contrast, we find a steep decline in long-wavelength power below Z⊙, especially in the 17 μm feature, with the shorter-wavelength PAH bands carrying an increasingly large fraction of power at low metallicity. We use newly developed grain models to reproduce the observed PZR trends, including these variations in fractional PAH feature strengths. The model that best reproduces the data employs an evolving grain size distribution that shifts to smaller sizes as metallicity declines. We interpret this as a result of inhibited grain growth at low metallicity, suggesting continuous replenishment in the interstellar medium is the dominant process shaping the PAH grain population in galaxies.

Transient current sheets (CSs) are common magnetic structures in the solar wind that can significantly disturb the planetary space environment and cause space weather phenomena. This study focuses on their properties in the Martian space environment and investigates their transformations caused by the Martian bow shock. Based on 14 months of data from the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution mission during similar solar activity, 786 CSs with directional changes greater than 90° and magnetic field depression were automatically identified, including 256 events in the upstream solar wind and 530 events in the Martian magnetosheath. After crossing the bow shock, the duration and thickness of the CSs decrease, while their current density and occurrence rate significantly increase. In the Martian magnetosheath, CSs located on the dayside exhibit stronger current density, a relatively lower occurrence rate, and a smaller than CSs located on the nightside. From the dayside to the nightside, the predominant magnetic field component of CSs changes to due to the draping process. Moreover, a clear dawn–dusk asymmetry in CS properties emerges from the foreshock to the downstream region of the Martian bow shock. Our results reveal the properties and evolution of solar wind CSs in the Martian space environment.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章报告了对TDE ASASSN-19bt/AT 2019ahk的详细射电观测结果，跨越了40至1464天的光学闪耀发现后的时间范围。研究发现，ASASSN-19bt的射电发射显示出与其他TDE不同的异常演化，其射电发射峰值亮度在光学发现后的457天内迅速增加，然后趋于稳定。通过广义的均衡技术，估算了两种可能的发射几何结构的能量和相应的物理参数，包括非相对论球形流和从不同观测角度观察到的相对论流。研究发现，非相对论解意味着出流的能量从E ∼ 10^46增加到E ∼ 10^49 erg，流速β约为0.05，而非轴向相对论喷流解则建议在极端非轴向情况下晚期为E ≈ 10^52 erg，洛伦兹因子Γ∼10。没有模型能全面解释射电发射的起源和演化，这强调了需要更复杂的模型。ASASSN-19bt成为显示出异常射电发射的TDE种群的一部分。进行这些TDE的长期射电观测，特别是在后期阶段，对于理解TDE中这类射电发射的产生至关重要。 <div>
We present detailed radio observations of the tidal disruption event (TDE) ASASSN-19bt/AT 2019ahk, obtained with the Australia Telescope Compact Array, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, and the MeerKAT radio telescopes, spanning 40–1464 days after the onset of the optical flare. We find that ASASSN-19bt displays unusual radio evolution compared to other TDEs, as the peak brightness of its radio emission increases rapidly until 457 days post-optical discovery and then plateaus. Using a generalized approach to standard equipartition techniques, we estimate the energy and corresponding physical parameters for two possible emission geometries: a nonrelativistic spherical outflow and a relativistic outflow observed from a range of viewing angles. We find that the nonrelativistic solution implies a continuous energy rise in the outflow from E ∼ 1046 to E ∼ 1049 erg with outflow speed β ≈ 0.05, while the off-axis relativistic jet solution instead suggests E ≈ 1052 erg with Lorentz factor Γ ∼ 10 at late times in the maximally off-axis case. We find that neither model provides a holistic explanation for the origin and evolution of the radio emission, emphasizing the need for more complex models. ASASSN-19bt joins the population of TDEs that display unusual radio emission at late times. Conducting long-term radio observations of these TDEs, especially during the later phases, will be crucial for understanding how these types of radio emission in TDEs are produced.

总结:<br />
这篇文章研究了NGC 4826星系的红外光度和哈勃空间望远镜成像和光谱，采用Schwarzschild动力学建模测量了其中心黑洞质量M。通过光度分解，发现NGC 4826包含约相等质量的经典和伪球。其总V波段光度为MVT = −21.07，经典球体与总光比为B/T ≃ 0.12，伪球与总光比为PB/T ≃ 0.13，外部盘呈指数型。最佳拟合的Schwarzschild模型得出的黑洞质量满足M与K带光度、恒星质量和经典球体速度色散的相关性。然而，与总（经典加伪）球体光度相关性相比，黑洞质量偏低。因此，NGC 4826星系符合以往关于黑洞比例关系的研究结果，并有助于加强低黑洞质量下的结果。 <div>
We present infrared photometry and Hubble Space Telescope imaging and spectroscopy of the Sab galaxy NGC 4826. Schwarzschild dynamical modeling is used to measure its central black hole mass M. Photometric decomposition is used to enable a comparison of M to published scaling relations between black hole masses and properties of host bulges. This decomposition implies that NGC 4826 contains classical and pseudobulges of approximately equal mass. The classical bulge has best-fit Sérsic index n = 3.27. The pseudobulge is made up of three parts, an inner lens (n = 0.18 at r ≲ 4″), an outer lens (n = 0.17 at r ≲ 45″), and a n = 0.58 Sérsic component required to match the surface brightness between the lens components. The total V-band luminosity of the galaxy is MVT = −21.07, the ratio of classical bulge to total light is B/T ≃ 0.12, and the ratio of pseudobulge to total light is PB/T ≃ 0.13. The outer disk is exponential (n = 1.07) and makes up D/T = 0.75 of the light of the galaxy. Our best-fit Schwarzschild model has a black hole mass with 1σ uncertainties of and a stellar population with a K-band mass-to-light ratio of at the assumed distance of 7.27 Mpc. Our modeling is marginally consistent with M = 0 at the 3σ limit. These best-fit parameters were calculated assuming the black hole is located where the velocity dispersion is largest; this is offset from the maximum surface brightness, probably because of dust absorption. The black hole mass—one of the smallest measured by modeling stellar dynamics—satisfies the well known correlations of M with the K-band luminosity, stellar mass, and velocity dispersion of the classical bulge only. In contrast, the black hole is undermassive with respect to the correlation of M with total (classical plus pseudo) bulge luminosity. Thus the composite (classical bulge plus pseudobulge) galaxy NGC 4826 is consistent with previous results on black hole scaling relations and helps to strengthen these results at low black hole masses.

<br /><br />总结:
该研究调查了在宇宙学框架下产生Type Ia超新星的Population III双星的情况。研究发现，假设初始恒星质量函数偏好低质量恒星，Population III恒星可能在高红移处引发大量SNe Ia，甚至可能成为z≳6时主要的SNe Ia产生者。在乐观的情况下，JWST在3年内的调查中预期在z≈4（5）处能够发现约1（2）颗来自Population III恒星的SNe Ia。在相同的调查中，可能会记录到大约400颗低红移（z≲2.5）处的SNe Ia，但只有大约一颗来自Population III的祖先。在红移为5-10的同一视场中可能会有大约6颗Population III SNe Ia。对5-10红移范围内的SNe Ia率的观测限制可以对Population III星的IMF提出关键限制。 <div>
Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) discovered at redshift z ≲ 2.5 are presumed to be produced from Population I/II stars. In this work, we investigate the production of SNe Ia from Population III binaries in the cosmological framework. We derive the SN Ia rate as a function of redshift in a theoretical context for the production of first-generation stars and evaluate the likelihood of their detection by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Assuming the initial stellar mass function (IMF) favors low-mass stars, as from recent numerical simulations, we found that Population III stars may give rise to a considerable number of SNe Ia at high redshift, and Population III stars may even be the dominant SN Ia producer at z ≳ 6. In an optimistic scenario, we expect ∼1(2) SNe Ia from Population III stars at z ≈ 4(5) for a survey of area during a 3 yr period with JWST. The same survey may record more than ∼400 SNe Ia at lower redshift (z ≲ 2.5) but with only about one of them from Population III progenitors. There will be ∼six Population III SNe Ia in the same field of view at redshifts of 5–10. Observational constraints on SN Ia rates at the redshift range of 5–10 can place crucial constraints on the IMF of Population III stars.

该研究利用NuSTAR望远镜观测到了附近强大的射电星系Pictor A，清晰地检测到了位于主星系西侧约4分钟的热点的X射线辐射，这是迄今为止最显著的在10keV以上探测到的热点辐射。通过光谱分析发现，其最佳拟合为指数为2.03的幂律分布，指数越小代表越硬的光谱。此外，通过Chandra观测发现了短时间尺度内的软X射线流量变化，强烈证实了热点的X射线辐射具有同步辐射特性。而光谱截断能量的下限则表明热点中的电子能量至少达到几TeV数量级。这些发现对于揭示射电星系喷流中X射线辐射的物理机制和条件具有重要意义。

X射线辐射的探测；NuSTAR观测到Pictor A热点的X射线辐射；热点光谱分析结果；Chandra观测发现热点X射线流量变化；研究对射电星系喷流X射线辐射物理机制和条件具有重要意义。 <div>
The origin of X-ray emission from the resolved kiloparsec-scale jets and hotspots of many active galactic nuclei remains uncertain, particularly where the X-ray emission is separate from the radio-optical synchrotron component. Possible explanations include synchrotron emission from a second electron population and external Compton or synchrotron self-Compton processes—alternatives which imply very different physical conditions within the jet. Until recently, X-ray studies of resolved jets and hotspots have been restricted to below ∼10 keV, often showing a hard spectral index indicating a spectral peak beyond this energy range. Here we present NuSTAR observations of the nearby powerful radio galaxy Pictor A, in which we clearly detect the western hotspot at approximately 4′ from the host galaxy, the most significant detection of hotspot emission above 10 keV to date. The NuSTAR spectrum is best fit by a single power law of index Γ = 2.03 ± 0.04; an exponential cutoff gives a 1σ lower limit on the cutoff energy of 40.7 keV. We confirm previous findings of variations in the soft X-ray flux detected by Chandra over the 2000 to 2015 period, at a significance of 6.5σ. This rises to >8σ in the common 3–8 keV band using the combined 22 yr span of Chandra and NuSTAR observations. The variability of the western Pictor A hotspot strongly confirms the previously argued synchrotron nature of the X-ray emission for the hotspot, while the lower bound to the spectral cutoff energy implies electron energies in the hotspot reach up to at least a few TeV.

<div> 关键词: JWST, 红移, 星系, 重力透镜, 星系团
总结:
JWST的空白场观测程序尚未发现预期在15≤ z ≤ 20形成的第一个星系，因此需要寻找更有效的调查策略。本文探讨了利用引力透镜星系团场的有效性，这在哈勃空间望远镜中已经被证明是最有效的发现工具。研究分析了JWST NIRCam模块中提供最高平均放大倍数的最庞大星系团在揭示这一群体方面的效果。结果表明，具有高放大倍数的前景庞大星系团特定领域，可以在单个NIRCam模块中揭示15≤ z ≤ 20范围的最高可能性，并且发现JWST可能的最高红移星系。而利用多个庞大星系团来交换调查深度则是一种更为高效的探索z > 15范围的时间有效方法。 <div>
Several large JWST blank field observing programs have not yet discovered the first galaxies expected to form at 15 ≤ z ≤ 20. This has motivated the search for more effective survey strategies that will be able to effectively probe this redshift range. Here, we explore the use of gravitationally lensed cluster fields, which have historically been the most effective discovery tool with the Hubble Space Telescope. In this paper, we analyze the effectiveness of the most massive galaxy clusters that provide the highest median magnification factor within a single JWST NIRCam module in uncovering this population. The results of exploiting these lensing clusters to break the z > 15 barrier are compared against the results from large-area, blank-field surveys such as JADES and CEERS in order to determine the most effective survey strategy for JWST. We report that the fields containing massive foreground galaxy clusters specifically chosen to occupy the largest fraction of a single NIRCam module with high magnification factors in the source plane while containing all multiple images in the image plane within a single module provide the highest probability of both probing the 15 ≤ z ≤ 20 regime as well as discovering the highest-redshift galaxy possible with JWST. We also find that using multiple massive clusters in exchange for shallower survey depths is a more time-efficient method of probing the z > 15 regime.

<br />总结:
ALMA观测了BHR 71 IRS1和IRS2的Class 0原恒星系统，检测到了12CO、13CO、C18O、H2CO和SiO分子线以及1.3mm连续谱。紧凑的尘埃连续发射显示了中心组分和延伸的发射，同时没有发现螺旋、环或间隙等结构。通过C18O线的位置-速度图分析，未发现明显的开普勒运动。然而，可以对BHR 71 IRS1和BHR 71 IRS2的中心原恒星质量设定上限。同时，通过12CO和SiO追踪的喷流显示出两个组分，即宽角流和喷流，在IRS1中，喷流表现出双螺旋结构，反映了系统的角动量移除，而在IRS2中，喷流非常集中并显示出一串节，这表明发生了周期性的吸积事件。 <div>
We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the binary Class 0 protostellar system BHR 71 IRS1 and IRS2 as part of the Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk) ALMA Large Program. We describe the 12CO (J = 2–1), 13CO (J = 2–1), C18O (J = 2–1), H2CO (J = 32,1–22,0), and SiO (J = 5–4) molecular lines along with the 1.3 mm continuum at high spatial resolution (∼0.″08 or ∼5 au). Dust continuum emission is detected toward BHR 71 IRS1 and IRS2, with a central compact component and extended continuum emission. The compact components are smooth and show no sign of substructures such as spirals, rings, or gaps. However, there is a brightness asymmetry along the minor axis of the presumed disk in IRS1, possibly indicative of an inclined geometrically and optically thick disk-like component. Using a position–velocity diagram analysis of the C18O line, clear Keplerian motions were not detected toward either source. If Keplerian rotationally supported disks are present, they are likely deeply embedded in their envelope. However, we can set upper limits of the central protostellar mass of 0.46 M⊙ and 0.26 M⊙ for BHR 71 IRS1 and BHR 71 IRS2, respectively. Outflows traced by 12CO and SiO are detected in both sources. The outflows can be divided into two components, a wide-angle outflow and a jet. In IRS1, the jet exhibits a double helical structure, reflecting the removal of angular momentum from the system. In IRS2, the jet is very collimated and shows a chain of knots, suggesting episodic accretion events.

本研究探讨了宇宙射线在小尺度上与星际介质的耦合问题。研究通过数值模拟构建了一个两区域宇宙射线传输模型，并发现在冷气体中快速扩散导致更多的冷气体形成，而在温暖气体中缓慢扩散导致宇宙射线能量从湍流能级吸收，这同时也导致了湍流能级在辐射冷却过程中的损失。最后，研究表明，该两区域模型能够匹配模拟中的一些传输路径的格默测量结果。 
<br /><br />总结: <div>
While cosmic rays (E ≳ 1 GeV) are well coupled to a galaxy’s interstellar medium (ISM) at scales of L > 100 pc, adjusting stratification and driving outflows, their impact on small scales is less clear. Based on calculations of the cosmic-ray diffusion coefficient from observations of the grammage in the Milky Way, cosmic rays have little time to dynamically impact the ISM on those small scales. Using numerical simulations, we explore how more complex cosmic-ray transport could allow cosmic rays to couple to the ISM on small scales. We create a two-zone model of cosmic-ray transport, with the cosmic-ray diffusion coefficient set at the estimated Milky Way value in cold gas but smaller in warm gas. We compare this model to simulations with a constant diffusion coefficient. Quicker diffusion through cold gas allows more cold gas to form compared to a simulation with a constant, small diffusion coefficient. However, slower diffusion in warm gas allows cosmic rays to take energy from the turbulent cascade anisotropically. This cosmic-ray energization comes at the expense of turbulent energy which would otherwise be lost during radiative cooling. Finally, we show our two-zone model is capable of matching observational estimates of the grammage for some transport paths through the simulation.

We present a numerical analysis investigating the reliability of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) delay-time distributions recovered from individual host galaxy star formation histories. We utilize star formation histories of mock samples of galaxies generated from the IllustrisTNG simulation at two redshifts to recover delay-time distributions. The delay-time distributions are constructed through piecewise constants as opposed to typically employed parametric forms such as power laws or Gaussian or skew/lognormal functions. The SN Ia delay-time distributions are recovered through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo exploration of the likelihood space by comparing the expected SN Ia rate within each mock galaxy to the observed rate. We show that a reduced representative sample of nonhost galaxies is sufficient to reliably recover delay-time distributions while simultaneously reducing the computational load. We also highlight a potential systematic between recovered delay-time distributions and the mass-weighted ages of the underlying host galaxy stellar population.

总结:
本文利用eROSITA全天巡天观测数据，在局部（D < 200 Mpc）矮星系中收集了74对活动星系核-矮星系对。通过清除X射线背景源、X射线双星和超亮X射线源，分析了矮星系中存在超大质量黑洞的情况。得出了矮星系AGN的光度函数，研究了黑洞质量与恒星质量的关系，并与本地和高红移关系进行了对比。研究结果表明，局部AGN在不同质量尺度上经历了类似的生长历史。同时，还与半解析模型进行了比较，结果表明数据支持将超大质量黑洞在矮星系中保持适度活跃的模型，这也促使模型改进以与矮星系中的AGN进行比较。 <div>
Although supermassive black holes (SMBHs) reside in the heart of virtually every massive galaxy, it remains debated whether dwarf galaxies commonly host SMBHs. Because low-mass galaxies may retain memory of the assembly history of their black holes (BHs), probing the BH occupation fraction of local dwarf galaxies might offer insights into the growth and seeding mechanisms of the first BHs. In this work, we exploit the Western half of the eROSITA all-sky survey (covering 20,000 deg2) and compile a catalog of accreting SMBHs in local (D < 200 Mpc) dwarf galaxies. Cleaning our sample from X-ray background sources, X-ray binaries, and ultraluminous X-ray sources, we identify 74 active galactic nucleus (AGN)–dwarf galaxy pairs. Using this large and uniform sample, we derive the luminosity function of the dwarf galaxy AGN, fitting it with a power-law function and obtaining . Measuring the offset between the dwarf galaxies' centroids and the X-ray sources, we find that ≈50% of the AGN are likely off-nuclear, in agreement with theoretical predictions. We compare the BH-to-stellar mass relation of our sample with the local and high-redshift relations, finding that our sources better adhere to the former, which suggests that local AGN across different mass scales undergo similar growth histories. Finally, we compare our sources with semianalytical models: while our sample’s shallowness prevents distinguishing between different seeding models, we find that the data favor models that keep SMBHs in dwarf galaxies active at a moderate rate, motivating model improvement by comparison to AGN in the dwarf galaxy regime.

<br /><br />总结:
在这篇文章中，研究人员对Montreal白矮星数据库100 pc样本和Pan-STARRS足迹中M > 0.9 M⊙、Teff ≥ 11,000 K的大质量白矮星进行了详细的模型大气分析。作者进行了109个目标的光学光谱后续研究，对样本中的204个对象进行了完整的光谱后续研究。研究发现118个正常的DA型白矮星，包括45个质量接近ZZ Ceti不稳定带的大质量DA型。样本中没有正常的大质量DB型，而其中六个DB型的白矮星是强磁性和/或快速自转的。样本中有20个大质量DQ型白矮星，所有的DQ型都处在晶化序列中。此外，样本中有66个目标是磁性的（占样本的32%）。研究人员使用磁性白矮星大气模型来限制磁场强度和几何形状，并使用磁性，运动学和自转测量来限制这一人口中合并残留物候选的分数。本样本中合并分数从0.9-1 M⊙的白矮星的25%增加到1.2-1.3 M⊙的49%。然而，对于1.1-1.2 M⊙的白矮星合并分数高达%。先前的研究表明，高质量白矮星中有5-9%因22Ne精馏过程停止冷却约8亿年，这导致太阳邻域Q-支白矮星的过剩。作者证明了我们样本中合并残留物的过多可能是由于相同的过程导致的。 <div>
We present a detailed model atmosphere analysis of massive white dwarfs with M > 0.9 M⊙ and Teff ≥ 11,000 K in the Montreal White Dwarf Database 100 pc sample and the Pan-STARRS footprint. We obtained follow-up optical spectroscopy of 109 objects with no previous spectral classification in the literature. Our spectroscopic follow-up is now complete for all 204 objects in the sample. We find 118 normal DA white dwarfs, including 45 massive DAs near the ZZ Ceti instability strip. There are no normal massive DBs: the six DBs in the sample are strongly magnetic and/or rapidly rotating. There are 20 massive DQ white dwarfs in our sample, and all are found in the crystallization sequence. In addition, 66 targets are magnetic (32% of the sample). We use magnetic white dwarf atmosphere models to constrain the field strength and geometry using offset dipole models. We also use magnetism, kinematics, and rotation measurements to constrain the fraction of merger remnant candidates among this population. The merger fraction of this sample increases from 25% for 0.9–1 M⊙ white dwarfs to 49% for 1.2–1.3 M⊙. However, this fraction is as high as % for 1.1–1.2 M⊙ white dwarfs. Previous works have demonstrated that 5%–9% of high-mass white dwarfs stop cooling for ∼8 Gyr due to the 22Ne distillation process, which leads to an overdensity of Q-branch stars in the solar neighborhood. We demonstrate that the overabundance of the merger remnant candidates in our sample is likely due to the same process.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章通过3D3V混合Vlasov模拟研究了磁暴尾等离子体中的湍流现象，发现了最近由NASA的磁层多尺度任务观测到的新型电子唯一再连接以及它对离子加热的影响。文章表明，在接近电子尺度的注入处，离子加热对电子唯一再连接具有显着影响，βi值较大时，离子与电子之间的解耦现象加剧。此外，文章还发现了离子在碰撞不到等离子体中的湍流加热对注入尺度与ρi之间的分离、βi和有限k∥效应敏感，因此需要进一步研究以得到准确的模型。这些发现对其他碰撞不到的天体物理环境，如星团间介质中的高β等离子体，具有重要意义，因为在这些环境中，微不稳定性或激波等过程可能会在离子动力学尺度附近注入能量。 <div>
We perform 3D3V hybrid-Vlasov simulations of turbulence with quasi-isotropic, compressible injection near ion scales to mimic the Earth’s magnetosheath plasma, and investigate the novel electron-only reconnection, recently observed by NASA’s Magnetospheric Multiscale mission, and its impact on ion heating. Retaining electron inertia in the generalized Ohm's law enables collisionless magnetic reconnection. Spectral analysis shows a shift from kinetic Alfvén waves to inertial kinetic Alfvén and inertial whistler waves near electron scales. To distinguish the roles of inertial scale and gyroradius (di and ρi), three ion beta (βi = 0.25, 1, 4) values are studied. Ion-electron decoupling increases with βi, as ions become less mobile when the injection scale is closer to ρi than di, highlighting the role of ρi in achieving an electron magnetohydrodynamic regime at sub-ion scales. This regime promotes electron-only reconnection in turbulence with small-scale injection at βi ≳ 1. We observe significant ion heating even at large βi, with Qi/ϵ ≈ 69%, 91%, and 96% at βi = 0.25, 1, and 4, respectively. While ion heating is anisotropic at βi ≤ 1 (Ti,⊥ > Ti,∥), it is marginally anisotropic at βi > 1 (Ti,⊥ ≳ Ti,∥). Our results show ion turbulent heating in collisionless plasmas is sensitive to the separation between injection scales (λinj) and ρi, βi, and finite-k∥ effects, necessitating further investigation for accurate modeling. These findings have implications for other collisionless astrophysical environments, like high-β plasmas in intracluster medium, where processes such as microinstabilities or shocks may inject energy near ion-kinetic scales.

总结: 通过最近的无线电调查发现，一些脉冲星的离散度和散射延迟超过了观测到的脉冲星群体，部分脉冲星的电子柱密度甚至超过了银河电子密度模型的最大预测。研究发现，大多数离散度大于600 pc cm−3并且散射延迟大于10毫秒的脉冲星位于H ii区域后方，而H ii区域的交叉可能与观测到的脉冲星群体的三分之一相关。考虑到H ii区域可以解释银河电子密度模型将高离子密度脉冲星置于银河盘外的矛盾。研究还发现，通过比较复合线观测推断的发射度与脉冲星的电子密度，H ii区域可能在脉冲星的视线方向上贡献了几十到几百pc/cm³的电子柱密度。几乎所有具有显著离群（和缺失）散射的脉冲星都与已知的离子化气体结构（包括H ii区域）空间相符。考虑到H ii区域对于解释无线电离散度和散射测量作为电子密度示踪器的重要性，不仅在银河系中，还在其他星系中至关重要。 <br /><br /> <div>
Recent radio surveys have revealed pulsars with dispersion and scattering delays induced by ionized gas that are larger than the rest of the observed pulsar population, in some cases with electron column densities (or dispersion measures, DMs) larger than the maximum predictions of Galactic electron density models. By cross-matching the observed pulsar population against H ii region catalogs, we show that the majority of pulsars with DM > 600 pc cm−3 and scattering delays τ(1 GHz) > 10 ms lie behind H ii regions, and that H ii region intersections may be relevant to as much as a third of the observed pulsar population. The fraction of the full pulsar population with sightlines intersecting H ii regions is likely larger. Accounting for H ii regions resolves apparent discrepancies where Galactic electron density models place high-DM pulsars beyond the Galactic disk. By comparing emission measures inferred from recombination line observations to pulsar DMs, we show that H ii regions can contribute tens to hundreds of parsecs per cubic centimeter in electron column density along a pulsar line of sight. We find that nearly all pulsars with significant excess (and deficit) scattering from the mean τ–DM relation are spatially coincident with known discrete ionized gas structures, including H ii regions. Accounting for H ii regions is critical to the interpretation of radio dispersion and scattering measurements as electron density tracers, both in the Milky Way and in other galaxies.

Constraining the formation processes of small solar system bodies is crucial for gaining insights into planetesimal formation. Their bulk densities, determined by their compressive strengths, offer valuable information about their formation history. In this paper, we utilize a formulation of the compressive strength of dust aggregates obtained from dust N-body simulations to establish the relation between the bulk density and diameter. We find that this relation can be effectively approximated by a polytrope with an index of 0.5, coupled with a formulation of the compressive strength of dust aggregates. The lowest-density trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) and main-belt asteroids (MBAs) are well reproduced by dust aggregates composed of 0.1 μm sized grains. However, most TNOs, MBAs, comets, and near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) exhibit higher densities, suggesting the influence of compaction mechanisms such as collision, dust grain disruption, sintering, or melting, leading to further growth. We speculate that there are two potential formation paths for small solar system bodies. One involves the direct coagulation of primordial dust grains, resulting in the formation of first-generation planetesimals, including the lowest-density TNOs, MBAs, and the parent bodies of comets and NEAs. In this case, comets and NEAs are fragments or rubble piles of first-generation planetesimals, and the objects themselves or the rubble are composed of 0.1 μm sized grains. The other path involves the further potential fragmentation of first-generation planetesimals into the compact dust aggregates observed in protoplanetary disks, resulting in the formation of second-generation planetesimals composed of compact dust aggregates, which may contribute to explaining another formation process of comets and NEAs.

<div> 竞争吸积，单体核坍缩，星团形成，模拟，空间分布
<br />
通过研究星团形成的平滑粒子流体动力学模拟，科学家发现竞争吸积模型预测的最大恒星应该在相对密度更高、或者位于更深的引力潜井中，只有在没有反馈的模拟中才符合这一预测。而当反馈效应被考虑时，只有一半的模拟中最大恒星位于更深的引力潜井内，且在空间分布上没有其他明显信号。此外，对于单体核坍缩的简单模型来说，最大恒星可能也会位于更深的引力潜井中。因此，无法通过最大恒星的空间分布来明确区分形成机制，需要其他预测来区分竞争吸积和单体坍缩。（总结：竞争吸积和单体核坍缩形成的恒星在空间分布上没有明显差异，需要其他特征来区分形成机制。） <div>
The two main competing theories proposed to explain the formation of massive (>10 M⊙) stars—competitive accretion and monolithic core collapse—make different observable predictions for the environment of the massive stars during, and immediately after, their formation. Proponents of competitive accretion have long predicted that the most massive stars should have a different spatial distribution to lower-mass stars, through the stars being either mass segregated or being in areas of higher relative densities or sitting deeper in gravitational potential wells. We test these predictions by analyzing a suite of smoothed-particle hydrodynamics simulations where star clusters form massive stars via competitive accretion with and without feedback. We find that the most massive stars have higher relative densities, and sit in deeper potential wells, only in simulations in which feedback is not present. When feedback is included, only half of the simulations have the massive stars residing in deeper potential wells, and there are no other distinguishing signals in their spatial distributions. Intriguingly, in our simple models for monolithic core collapse, the massive stars may also end up in deeper potential wells because if massive cores fragment then the stars that form are also massive, and dominate their local environs. We find no robust diagnostic test in the spatial distributions of massive stars that can distinguish their formation mechanisms, and so other predictions for distinguishing between competitive accretion and monolithic collapse are required.

<title>Observational Test of f(Q) Gravity with Weak Gravitational Lensing</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this article we confront a class of f(Q) gravity models with observational data of galaxy–galaxy lensing. Specifically, we consider f(Q) gravity models containing a small quadratic correction when compared with general relativity (GR), and quantify this correction by a model parameter, α. To derive the observational constraints, we start by extracting spherically symmetric solutions, which correspond to deviations from the Schwarzschild solution that depends on the model parameters in a twofold way, i.e., a renormalized mass and a new term proportional to r−2. Then, we calculate the effective lensing potential, the deflection angle, the shear component, and the effective excess surface density profile. After that, we employ a group catalog and a shape catalog from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 for the lens and source samples, respectively. Moreover, we handle the off-center radius as a free parameter and constrain it using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. Concerning the deviation parameter from GR we derive at the 1σ confidence level, and then compare the fitting efficiency with the standard Λ cold dark matter paradigm by applying the Akaike information criterion and Bayesian information criterion. Our results indicate that the f(Q) corrections alongside the off-center effect yield a scenario that is slightly favored.

<title>The Role of Meridional Flow in the Generation of Solar/Stellar Magnetic Fields and Cycles</title>

Meridional flow is crucial in generating the solar poloidal magnetic field by facilitating poleward transport of the field from decayed bipolar magnetic regions (BMRs). As the meridional circulation changes with the stellar rotation rate, the properties of stellar magnetic cycles are expected to be influenced by this flow. In this study, we explore the role of meridional flow in generating magnetic fields in the Sun and Sun-like stars using the STABLE (surface flux transport and Babcock–Leighton) dynamo model. We find that a moderate meridional flow increases the polar field by efficiently driving the trailing polarity flux toward the pole, while a strong flow tends to transport both polarities of BMRs poleward, potentially reducing the polar field. Our findings are in perfect agreement with what one can expect from the surface flux transport model. Similarly, the toroidal field initially increases with moderate flow speeds and then decreases beyond a certain value. This trend is due to the competitive effects of shearing and diffusion. Furthermore, our study highlights the impact of meridional flow on the strength and duration of stellar cycles. By including the meridional flow from a mean-field hydrodynamics model in STABLE, we show that the magnetic field strength initially increases with the stellar rotation rate and then declines in rapidly rotating stars, offering an explanation of the observed variation of stellar magnetic field with rotation rate.

<title>Molecular Distribution in the Central Region of M87</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The central region of M87 has been observed by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) several times to resolve its molecular cloud distribution. We present the ALMA CO(1–0), CO(2–1), and CO(3–2) observations of the M87 circumnuclear region. The CO(1–0) shows emission as well as molecular absorption features toward its nucleus, indicating the existence of cold molecular clouds/gas. ALMA imaging of the CO(1–0) observations show the distribution of molecular clouds toward the nucleus of M87 with a radius of ∼105 pc. The clouds seen in the CO(1–0) are moving with very high velocity and have an apparent motion in the range of −1000 to 3600 km s−1 relative to the central supermassive black hole, which has a systemic velocity of ∼1266 km s−1. The molecular gas mass was estimated to be about 1.08 ± 0.64 × 107M⊙ in the central 210 pc of M87. We calculated the optical depths using the absorption lines of the CO(1–0) and CO(2–1). The excitation temperature was estimated to be ∼7.133 ± 0.03 K using the optical depth ratio of the CO(2-1) to CO(1-0). We also found the line-of-sight column density to be ∼2.25 × 1015 cm−2, which corresponds to a hydrogen column density of ∼0.28 × 1020 cm−2.

<title>Subhalos in Galaxy Clusters: Coherent Accretion and Internal Orbits</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Subhalo dynamics in galaxy cluster host halos govern the observed distribution and properties of cluster member galaxies. We use the IllustrisTNG simulation to investigate the accretion and orbits of subhalos found in cluster-size halos. We find that the median change in the major axis direction of cluster-size host halos is approximately 80° between a ∼ 0.1 and the present day. We identify coherent regions in the angular distribution of subhalo accretion, and ∼68% of accreted subhalos enter their host halo through ∼38% of the surface area at the virial radius. The majority of galaxy clusters in the sample have ∼2 such coherent regions. We further measure angular orbits of subhalos with respect to the host major axis and use a clustering algorithm to identify distinct orbit modes with varying oscillation timescales. The orbit modes correlate with subhalo accretion conditions. Subhalos in orbit modes with shorter oscillations tend to have lower peak masses and accretion directions somewhat more aligned with the major axis. One orbit mode, exhibiting the least oscillatory behavior, largely consists of subhalos that accrete near the plane perpendicular to the host halo major axis. Our findings are consistent with expectations from inflow from major filament structures and internal dynamical friction: most subhalos accrete through coherent regions, and more massive subhalos experience fewer orbits after accretion. Our work offers a unique quantification of subhalo dynamics that can be connected to how the intracluster medium strips and quenches cluster galaxies.

The ability to accurately discern active massive black holes (BHs) in nearby dwarf galaxies is paramount to understanding the origins and processes of “seed” BHs in the early Universe. We present Chandra X-ray Observatory observations of a sample of three local dwarf galaxies (M* ≤ 3 × 109M⊙, z ≤ 0.15) previously identified as candidates for hosting active galactic nuclei (AGN). The galaxies were selected from the NASA-Sloan Atlas with spatially coincident X-ray detections in the eROSITA Final Equatorial Depth Survey. Our new Chandra data reveal three X-ray point sources in two of the target galaxies with luminosities between log(L2−10 keV [erg s−1]) = 39.1 and 40.4. Our results support the presence of an AGN in these two galaxies and an ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) in one of them. For the AGNs, we estimate BH masses of MBH ∼ 105−6M⊙ and Eddington ratios on the order of ∼10−3.

<title>The Remarkable X-Ray Spectra and Variability of the Ultraluminous Weak-line Quasar SDSS J1521+5202</title>

We present a focused X-ray and multiwavelength study of the ultraluminous weak-line quasar (WLQ) SDSS J1521+5202, one of the few X-ray weak WLQs that is amenable to basic X-ray spectral and variability investigations. J1521+5202 shows striking X-ray variability during 2006–2023, by up to a factor of ≈32 in 0.5–2 keV flux, and our new 2023 Chandra observation caught it in its brightest X-ray flux state to date. Concurrent infrared/optical observations show only mild variability. The 2023 Chandra spectrum can be acceptably described by a power law with intrinsic X-ray absorption, and it reveals a nominal intrinsic level of X-ray emission relative to its optical/ultraviolet emission. In contrast, an earlier Chandra spectrum from 2013 shows apparent spectral complexity that is not well fit by a variety of models, including ionized absorption or standard Compton-reflection models. Overall, the observations are consistent with the thick-disk plus outflow model previously advanced for WLQs, where a nominal level of underlying X-ray emission plus variable absorption leads to the remarkable observed X-ray variability. In the case of J1521+5202, it appears likely that the outflow, and not the thick disk itself, lies along our line of sight and causes the X-ray absorption.

<title>The Relation between Simulated Multiwavelength Blazar Variability and Stochastic Fluctuations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Blazars exhibit multiwavelength variability, a phenomenon whose underlying mechanisms remain elusive. This study investigates the origin of such variability through leptonic blazar emission simulations, focusing on stochastic fluctuations in environmental parameters. By analyzing the spectral indices of the power spectral densities of the variability, we assess their relationship with the underlying fluctuations. Our findings reveal that the variability spectral indices remain almost independent of the variations responsible for their emergence. This suggests a complex interplay of factors contributing to the observed multiwavelength variability in blazars.

This work introduces advanced computational techniques for modeling the time evolution of compact binary systems using machine learning. The dynamics of compact binary systems, such as black holes and neutron stars, present significant nonlinear challenges due to the strong gravitational interactions and the requirement for precise numerical simulations. Traditional methods, like the post-Newtonian approximation, often require significant computational resources and face challenges in accuracy and efficiency. Here, we employed machine learning algorithms, including deep learning models like long short-term memory (LSTM) and temporal convolutional network (TCN), to predict the future evolution of these systems based on extensive simulation data. Our results demonstrate that employing both LSTM and TCN even as black-box predictors for sequence prediction can also significantly improve the prediction accuracy without physics-informed neural networks (as partial differential equation solvers with prior knowledge or inductive bias. By employing LSTM and TCN, we obtained R2 values of 99.74% and 99.19% for the evolutionary orbits of the compact binaries data set, respectively. Our models demonstrate the ability to effectively capture the dynamics of the binaries, achieving high prediction performance with significantly reduced computational overhead by a factor of 40, compared to conventional numerical methods. This study paves the way for more effective and computationally scalable approaches to the understanding of gravitational phenomena and predictive modeling in gravitational-wave astronomy.

<title>Mapping Multiphase Metals in Star-forming Galaxies: A Spatially Resolved UV+Optical Study of NGC 5253</title>

<div> NGC 5253, spatially resolved, multiphase gas, abundances, star-forming clusters
总结:
NGC 5253是一个蓝色紧凑矮星系，进行了空间分辨的多相气体丰度研究，通过在Hubble空间望远镜的COS点ings和光学大型望远镜MUSE观测相结合，对星形成区进行了研究。研究发现中性气体的丰度明显低于电离气体，化学丰度与半径和年龄相关，N，O和N/O的丰度随年龄变化的规律与电离气体和中性气体有所不同，这提供了不同化学丰度形成的证据。 <div>
We present a pioneering, spatially resolved, multiphase gas abundance study on the blue compact dwarf galaxy NGC 5253, targeting 10 star-forming (SF) clusters inside six far-UV (FUV) Hubble Space Telescope/Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) pointings with cospatial optical Very Large Telescope/MUSE observations throughout the galaxy. The SF regions span a wide range of ages (1–15 Myr) and are distributed at different radii (50–230 pc). We performed a robust absorption-line profile fitting on the COS spectra, covering 1065–1430 Å in the FUV, allowing an accurate computation of neutral-gas abundances for 13 different ions sampling eight elements. These values were then compared with the ionized-gas abundances, measured using the direct method on MUSE integrated spectra inside analog COS apertures. Our multiphase, spatially resolved comparisons find abundances, which are lower in the neutral gas than the ionized gas by 0.22, 0.80, and 0.58 dex for log(O/H), log(N/H), and log(N/O), respectively. We modeled the chemical abundance distributions and evaluated correlations as a function of the radius and age. It was found that, while N, O, and N/O abundances decrease as a function of age in the ionized gas, they increase with age in the neutral gas. No strong correlations for N, O, or N/O were observed as a function of the radius. The N/O and N/H offsets between the phases were found to decrease with age, providing evidence that chemical enrichment happens differentially, first in the ionized-gas phase around 2–5 Myrs (due to N-rich Wolf–Rayet stars) and then mixing out into the cold neutral gas on longer timescales of 10–15 Myr.

<title>A Precessing Stellar Disk Model for Superorbital Modulations of the Gamma-Ray Binary LS I+61° 303</title>

<div> LS I+61° 303, gamma-ray binary, neutron star, Be star, superorbital modulation<br />
总结:<br />
这篇文章研究了伽马射线双星LS I+61° 303，发现其除了轨道调制外还存在长期的光变化，可能由Be星盘的进动引起。通过分析计算得到了望远镜观测数据的合理解释，认为X射线可能来自于星际震荡的同步辐射，而X射线的轨道相位漂移和长期光变的拟合结果表明中子星可能在小离心率轨道上围绕Be星运动。与其他Be/X射线双星的Corbet图相比较，发现其中子星的潮汐力可能诱导了LS I+61° 303中Be星盘的进动。 <div>
Gamma-ray binary LS I+61° 303 consists of a neutron star orbiting around a Be star with a period of Porb ≃ 26.5 days. Apart from orbital modulations, the binary shows long-term flux variations with a superorbital period of as seen in nearly all wavelengths. The origin of this superorbital modulation is still not well understood. Under the pulsar wind–stellar outflow interaction scenario, we propose that the superorbital modulations of LS I+61° 303 could be caused by the precession of the Be disk. Assuming X-rays arise from synchrotron radiation of the intrabinary shock, we develop an analytical model to calculate expected flux modulations over the orbital and superorbital phases. The asymmetric two-peak profiles in orbital light curves and sinusoidal-like long-term modulations are reproduced under the precessing disk scenario. The observed orbital phase drifting of the X-ray peak and our fitting of long-term X-ray data indicate that the neutron star is likely orbiting around the star with a small eccentricity and periastron phase around Φp ∼ 0.6. We compare the Corbet diagrams of LS I+61° 303 with other Be/X-ray binaries, and the linear correlation in the diagram suggests that the precession of the Be disk in LS I+61° 303 is induced by the tidal torque of its neutron star companion.

<title>Brightening and Fading in the Youngest Galactic Supernova Remnant G1.9+0.3: 13 Years of Monitoring with the Chandra X-Ray Observatory</title>

<div> 亮度变化，空间变化，磁场，粒子能量，爆发日期
<br /><br />总结:
通过对G1.9+0.3超新星遗迹的13年观测发现，该遗迹的亮度在不断增加，但空间上存在着很大的变化率差异，可能是由于爆炸波的演化、等离子团的扩张或压缩、磁场湍流或磁场角度的变化引起的。同时，对磁场强度和最大粒子能量进行了推测，并得出了爆炸日期和冲击效率因子等参数。然而，不同模型的光子指数随时间的变化可以对其进行验证。 <div>
We report 13 years of Chandra monitoring of the youngest Galactic supernova remnant G1.9+0.3, the only remnant known to be increasing in brightness. We confirm the spatially integrated rate of flux increase of (1.2 ± 0.2)% yr−1 (1–7 keV), but find large spatial variations, from −3% yr−1 to +7% yr−1, over length scales as small as 10″ or smaller. We observe relatively little change in spectral slope, though one region shows significant hardening as it brightens by 1% yr−1. Such rates of change can be accommodated by any of several explanations, including steady blast-wave evolution, expansion or compression of discrete plasma blobs, magnetic turbulence, or variations in magnetic-field aspect angle. Our results do not constrain the mean magnetic-field strength, but a self-consistent picture can be produced in which the maximum particle energies are limited by the remnant age (applying both to electrons and to ions) to about 20 TeV, and the remnant-averaged magnetic-field strength is about 30 μG. The deceleration parameter m (average shock radius varying as tm) is about 0.7, consistent with estimates from overall expansion dynamics and confirming an explosion date of about 1900 CE. Shock-efficiency factors ϵe and ϵB (fractions of shock energy in relativistic electrons and magnetic field) are 0.003 and 0.0002 in this picture. However, the large range of rates of brightness change indicates that such a global model is oversimplified. Temporal variations of photon index, expected to be small but measurable with longer time baselines, can discriminate among possible models.

To understand the origin of extended disks of low-surface brightness (LSB) galaxies, we studied in detail four such systems with large disks seen edge on. Two of them are edge-on giant LSB galaxies (gLSBGs) recently identified by our team. The edge-on orientation of these systems boosts their surface brightnesses that provided an opportunity to characterize stellar populations spectroscopically and yielded the first such measurements for edge-on gLSBGs. We collected deep images of one galaxy using the 1.4 m Milanković Telescope, which we combined with the archival Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam and DESI Legacy Surveys data available for the three other systems, and measured the structural parameters of the disks. We acquired deep long-slit spectra with the Russian 6 m telescope and the 10 m Keck II telescope and estimated stellar population properties in the high-surface brightness and LSB regions as well as the gas-phase metallicity distribution. The gas metallicity gradients are shallow to flat in the range between 0 and −0.03 dex per exponential disk scale length, which is consistent with the extrapolation of the gradient–scale length relation for smaller disk galaxies. Our estimates of stellar velocity dispersion in the LSB disks as well as the relative thickness of the disks indicate the dynamical overheating. Our observations favor mergers as the essential stage in the formation scenario for massive LSB galaxies.

总结: 该研究利用IXPE进行螃蟹星的X射线偏振测量，发现偏振角度呈S形变化，并揭示了与光学偏振不同的辐射机制。在内部星云中观察到的偏振地图显示了环形磁场结构，同时发现南部射流中磁场方向相对射流轴的变化和偏振度的减小。这些观察结果可能由射流中的扭结不稳定性或与高密度介质碰撞引起。通过光谱偏振分析发现内部星云四个象限的不对称偏振，与预期的环形磁场几何形状相符，并且偏振度与光子指数呈空间相关。 <div>
We present Crab X-ray polarization measurements using Imaging X-Ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) data with a total exposure of 300 ks, three times more than the initial 2022 discovery paper. Polarization is detected in three times more pulsar phase bins, revealing an S-shaped +40° polarization angle sweep in the main pulse and >1σ departures from the OPTIMA optical polarization in both pulses, suggesting different radiation mechanisms or sites for the polarized emission at the two wavebands. Our polarization map of the inner nebula reveals a toroidal magnetic field, as seen in prior IXPE analyses. Along the southern jet, the magnetic field orientation relative to the jet axis changes from perpendicular to parallel and the polarization degree decreases by ∼6%. These observations may be explained by kink instabilities along the jet or a collision with a dense, jet-deflecting medium at the tip. Using spectropolarimetric analysis, we find asymmetric polarization in the four quadrants of the inner nebula, as expected for a toroidal field geometry, and a spatial correlation between polarization degree and photon index.

总结:<br /><br />本研究利用NOEMA观测了DR Tau原行星盘，发现了较低的CS/SO比值以及异常的SO排布结构。通过热化学模型计算，结果表明DR Tau的低CS/SO比值和微弱的C2H发射可以通过盘中气相C/O比小于1来解释。与13CO结构图的比较结果表明，迟期的物质输入可能导致其盘的气相C/O比降低。 <div>
Millimeter wavelength observations of Class II protoplanetary disks often display strong emission from hydrocarbons and high CS/SO values, providing evidence that the gas-phase C/O ratio commonly exceeds 1 in their outer regions. We present new NOEMA observations of CS 5–4, SO 76–65 and 56–45, C2H N = 3–2, HCN 3–2, HCO+ 3–2, and H13CO+ 3–2 in the DR Tau protoplanetary disk at a resolution of ∼0.″4 (80 au). Estimates for the disk-averaged CS/SO ratio range from ∼0.4 to 0.5, the lowest value reported thus far for a T Tauri disk. At a projected separation of ∼180 au northeast of the star, the SO moment maps exhibit a clump that has no counterpart in the other lines, and the CS/SO value decreases to <0.2 at its location. Thermochemical models calculated with DALI indicate that DR Tau’s low CS/SO ratio and faint C2H emission can be explained by a gas-phase C/O ratio that is <1 at the disk radii traced by NOEMA. Comparisons of DR Tau’s SO emission to maps of extended structures traced by 13CO suggest that late infall may contribute to driving down the gas-phase C/O ratio of its disk.

总结: 
本研究调查了太阳风中阿尔文波中磁场扭曲对质子和阿尔法粒子的影响，重点研究了一个孤立的大尺度磁场扭曲，并详细研究了离子的动力学特性。我们发现在磁场扭曲内，质子和阿尔法粒子密度增加，表明存在波动活动。有趣的是，我们观察到磁场扭曲与阿尔法粒子温度之间存在明显的相关性，而与质子温度没有发现相关性。这表明磁场扭曲可能在优先加热重离子上发挥作用。我们的结果表明磁场扭曲可能导致质子速度分布函数的变形，而阿尔法粒子的优先加热效应可能是由于更密集的次级束和更小的束-核相对漂移速度所致。 <div>
We investigate how ions, namely protons and alpha particles, kinetically react to the presence of strong deflections in the magnetic field, the so-called switchbacks, in the first stream of slow Alfvénic wind observed by Solar Orbiter at the heliocentric distance of 0.64 au. We focus on an isolated, large-scale switchback, and we study in detail ion kinetic properties. Beyond the expected correlation between the magnetic deflection and ion velocity related to the Alfvénic nature of the switchbacks, we find that, within the switchback, proton and alpha particle densities increase, suggesting ongoing wave activity. Very interestingly, we observe a clear correlation between the magnetic deflection and alpha particle temperature, while no correlation has been found with proton temperature. This is an indication of a possible role played by switchbacks in preferentially heating heavy ions. Our results suggest that the presence of switchbacks can induce a deformation of the proton velocity distribution function, while the preferential heating of alpha particles could be due to a denser secondary beam and a smaller relative drift speed between the beam and core.

这篇文章报道了一项独特的Lyman-continuum（LyC）发射体的发现，其红移为z = 3.088。使用哈勃空间望远镜WFC3/UVIS F336W滤镜检测到了LyC发射，其信噪比为3.9。通过结合詹姆斯·韦伯空间望远镜（JWST）JADES、FRESCO和JEMS调查的成像和光谱数据，以及MXDF调查的VLT/MUSE数据，估计了与干扰者星系引起LyC发射的随机排列的概率小于6×10^-5。星系内的星际介质（ISM）条件类似于高红移处其他LyC发射者的条件，尽管单峰的Lyα谱线和缺乏的光学紫外线发射线表明星际介质为光学厚。观测结果表明LyC光子是通过一个狭窄的光学薄中性ISM锥体泄漏出来的，很可能是由过去的并合事件造成的。使用个体泄漏者的逃逸分数的限制和一个简单的模型，估计了电离锥体的开口半角可以小至16°（2%电离分数），从而再现一些理论关于星系平均逃逸分数的约束。所需的狭窄开口角可以解释已确认的LyC泄漏者数量较低的原因。 <br /><br />总结: Lyman-continuum发射体的发现，高红移区域，通过多个望远镜观测获得数据，LyC光子泄漏，星系内的星际介质条件，电离锥体的开口角。 <div>
We present the discovery of a unique Lyman-continuum (LyC) emitter at z = 3.088. The LyC emission was detected using the Hubble Space Telescope WFC3/UVIS F336W filter, covering a rest-frame wavelength range of 760–900 Å. The peak signal-to-noise ratio of LyC emission is 3.9 in an r = 0.″24 aperture and is spatially offset by 0.″29 ± 0.″04 (∼2.2 ± 0.3 kpc) from the peak of rest-UV emission (F606W). By combining imaging and spectroscopic data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) JADES, FRESCO, and JEMS surveys, along with VLT/MUSE data from the MXDF survey, we estimate that the probability of random alignment with an interloper galaxy causing the LyC emission is less than 6 × 10−5. The interstellar medium (ISM) conditions in the galaxy are similar to those in other LyC emitters at high redshift ( , , O32 = 0.63 ± 0.03), although the single-peaked Lyα profile and lack of rest-UV emission lines suggest an optically thick ISM. Our observations indicate that LyC photons are leaking through a narrow cone of optically thin neutral ISM, most likely created by a past merger (as evidenced by medium-band F210M and F182M images). Using the constraints on escape fraction from individual leakers and a simple model, we estimate that the opening half-angle of ionization cones can be as small as 16° (2% ionized fraction) to reproduce some of the theoretical constraints on the average escape fraction for galaxies. The narrow opening angle required can explain the low number density of confirmed LyC leakers.

<div> 关键词: 二进制轨道，角动量损失，吸积盘，盘风，质量比<br />
<br />总结: <br />这篇文章使用了分析框架来计算二进制轨道在一个考虑了吸积盘风的物理模型下的演化情况。他们发现盘风引起的角动量损失始终大于标准模型中因为吸积盘周围各个方向的质量流失而引起的角动量损失。在大多数情况下，考虑盘风的影响会导致轨道间距显著减小，差异可达60%。因此，文章得出结论，在演化二进制轨道时，考虑吸积盘风引起的角动量损失是非常重要的。 <div>
We use an analytic framework to calculate the evolution of binary orbits under a physically motivated model that accounts for angular momentum loss associated with winds from an accretion disk around the compact-objected accretor. Our prescription considers wind mass ejection from the surface of an accretion disk, accounting for a radial mass-loss dependence across the disk surface. We compare this to the standard prescription of angular momentum loss associated with isotropic mass loss from the vicinity of the accretor. The angular momentum loss from a disk wind is always larger. For mass ratios, q, between 2 and 10, angular momentum loss via a disk wind can be ≃3–40 times greater than the standard prescription. For the majority of mass ratios and disk properties, accounting for the disk wind can result in considerably smaller orbital separations compared to the standard formalism, the differences being ≃60% depending on how long the effect is integrated for. We conclude that it is important to consider the effects of angular momentum loss from a disk wind when evolving binary orbits.

这项研究探讨了行星形成盘中挥发性物质在冰层中的夹持效率，发现夹持效率与冰层厚度没有明显关联。通过温度程序脱附实验发现，微观冰层中的夹持对于H2O和CO2冰矩阵以及N2和Ar等超挥发性物质来说，对冰层厚度并不敏感。研究推测这可能与冰层表面的裂缝等特征有关，导致超挥发物质从深层冰层中逸出。因此在原行星盘中，我们可以预期各种颗粒大小的冰粒中都会有高效的夹持发生。 <br /><br />总结: <br />挥发性物质在行星形成盘中的夹持效率取决于冰层厚度，但对于微观冰层（大约50 ML以上）中的挥发性物质而言，其夹持效率与冰层厚度关系不大。超挥发性物质在冰层中的夹持也表现出相似的趋势。这可能是由于冰层表面特征导致超挥发性物质从深层冰层中逸出。因此，我们可以预期在原行星盘中，各种颗粒大小的冰粒中都会有高效的夹持发生。 <div>
The volatile inventories of planets depend on the precise partitioning of different volatiles between the gas and solid phases across the planet birth disk. For the case of hyper-volatiles (e.g., CO, N2, and noble gases), the partitioning also depends on how efficiently they are trapped into less volatile ice matrices. The thicknesses of these ice matrices can range from a few molecular layers to macroscopic bodies, and in this study we explore how entrapment efficiency depends on the ice thickness between tens of nanometers and a few micrometers (∼50–3000 monolayers, ML). We carry out a series of temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments on H2O:CO and CO2:CO mixtures with 5:1 and 15:1 matrix-to-CO mixing ratios. Entrapment efficiencies range from 41% to 64%, with higher entrapment efficiencies for the more dilute ices. Surprisingly, we find no significant difference in entrapment across the studied ice thicknesses for either H2O or CO2 ice matrices. Complementary TPD experiments with the additional hyper-volatiles N2 and Ar see a similar trend with ice thickness. We speculate that these results may be due to surface topography such as cracks that lead to hyper-volatile escape from deep ice layers. In either case, these experiments show that entrapment in microscopic ices is relatively insensitive to ice thickness (above ∼50 ML). In protoplanetary disks we therefore expect efficient entrapment in icy grains of a range of grain sizes.

A stellar-mass black hole surrounded by the neutrino-dominated accretion flow (NDAF) has been proposed as the central engine of gamma-ray bursts. In this work, we investigate the neutrino/antineutrino luminosity and annihilation luminosity from the NDAF and pair annihilation model, taking into account the neutrino oscillation above the accretion disk. The disk's hydrodynamical properties are modeled using an empirical solution previously derived with boundary conditions, including the effect of electron degeneracy and neutrino trapping. Our key parameters are the mass accretion rate and the black hole spin given in the ranges of –10 M⊙ s−1 and 0 ≤ a < 1, respectively. Without neutrino oscillation, the obtained neutrino/antineutrino luminosity is ∼1051–1053 erg s−1, while the neutrino annihilation luminosity is found to be ∼1046–1051 erg s−1. In the presence of neutrino oscillation in the vacuum limit, the electron neutrino annihilation luminosity decreases by ≲22% through the flavor transformation, while the muon and tau neutrino luminosity can increase by up to ∼45% and 60%, respectively. As a result, the total annihilation luminosity can be reduced by up to ∼19% due to the oscillation process above the disk. Finally, we also investigate the case whereby the charge-conjugation-parity-symmetry-violating (CP-violating) phase is changed from δCP = 0° to 245°. However, our results reveal that the CP-violating phase has minimal impact on the neutrino annihilation luminosity.

新出现的极小磁活跃区可以在短时间内产生耀斑和羽冠物质抛射，其产生机理与磁场约束的弱强度和核心区域能量非势性有关。在研究中发现，耀斑发生前，极小磁活跃区内的平均磁螺距离参数比磁通量值高，同时在极小磁活跃区的极性反转线附近存在磁场的衰减指数，表明有磁通发生。进一步的非线性强磁场场外推显示，极小磁活跃区在产生耀斑前会形成磁通，而在仅产生闭合耀斑时则不会形成磁通。这些研究结果表明，即使是磁通量和能量极小的新出现的磁活跃区，如果具备足够弱的背景磁场约束和强烈的核心能量非势性，也能产生耀斑和羽冠物质抛射。 <br /><br />总结: <br />磁活跃区的大小不一定决定其产生耀斑的能力，关键是其磁场约束的强弱和核心区的能量非势性。 <div>
Solar active regions (ARs) are the main sources of flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). NOAA AR 12089, which emerged on 2014 June 10, produced two C-class flares accompanied by CMEs within 5 hr after its emergence. When producing the two eruptive flares, the total unsigned magnetic flux (ΦAR) and magnetic free energy (Ef) of the AR are much smaller than the common CME-producing ARs. Why can this extremely small AR produce eruptive flares so early? We compare the AR magnetic environment for the eruptive flares to that for the largest confined flare from the AR. In addition to the ΦAR and Ef, we calculate the ratio between the mean characteristic twist parameter (αFPIL) within the flaring polarity inversion line (FPIL) region and ΦAR, a parameter considering both background magnetic field constraint and nonpotentiality of the core region, for the three flares. We find higher αFPIL/ΦAR values during the eruptive flares than during the confined flare. Furthermore, we compute the decay index along the polarity inversion line, revealing values of 1.69, 3.45, and 0.98 before the two eruptive and the confined flares, respectively. Finally, nonlinear force-free field extrapolation indicates that a flux rope was repeatedly formed along the FPIL before eruptive flares, which ejected out and produced CMEs. No flux rope was found before the confined flare. Our research suggests that even a newly emerged, extremely small AR can produce eruptive flares if it has sufficiently weak background field constraint and strong nonpotentiality in the core region.

未来的远程观测可能会检测到外行星大气中放射性元素的存在，这些放射性元素可能源自宇宙或地质，也可能来自工业源。它们的探测将揭示有关行星地质或空间环境的重要性质，并有可能作为技术标志。然而，很多放射性元素无法通过远程方法进行表征。目前的远程光谱观测任务概念在紫外到中红外波段对于放射性元素的存在并不敏感，因此未来更有可能通过飞掠或探测任务提供这些数据。 <div>
The characterization of exoplanetary atmospheres through transit spectra is becoming increasingly feasible, and technology for direct detection remains ongoing. The possibility of detecting spectral features could enable quantitative constraints on atmospheric composition or even serve as a potential biosignature, with the sensitivity of the instrument and observation time as key limiting factors. This paper discusses the possibility that future remote observations could detect the presence of radioactive elements in the atmospheres of exoplanets. Such radionuclides could arise from cosmogenic or geologic sources, as well as from industrial sources, all of which occur on Earth. The detection of radionuclides in an exoplanetary atmosphere could reveal important properties about the planet’s geology or space environment and potentially could serve as a technosignature. However, many radionuclides, including those from industrial sources, attach to aerosol or other particles that cannot be remotely characterized. Limited experimental and theoretical spectral data exist for long-lived radionuclides, but the sensitivity required to detect the spectral features of some known radionuclides would be at least several orders of magnitude greater than required to detect the spectral features of molecular oxygen. Present-day remote spectroscopic observing mission concepts at ultraviolet to mid-infrared wavelengths are not sensitive to discern the presence of radionuclides in exoplanetary atmospheres. Interplanetary fly-by or probe missions may be more likely to provide such data in the future.

氦新星是指白矮星吸积来自氦星伴侣的氢贫物质，氦包层质量达到临界值时会引发不稳定的氦燃烧，触发新星爆发。在早期爆发阶段，会出现明亮的软X射线相，称为X射线闪耀。通过理论光变曲线模拟发现，氦新星的X射线闪耀持续时间长（100天至10年），X射线亮度高（约10^38爱尔/秒），因此可以作为新型X射线瞬变体或持续X射线源进行探测。X射线闪耀是光学亮化的前兆，因此探测氦新星的X射线闪耀可以帮助规划观测光学前最大相，这一直是新星研究的前沿之一。文献中提到了一个可能的氦燃烧X射线闪耀候选天体。这个X射线瞬变源与1.35太阳质量的白矮星的X射线闪耀模型一致。 <div>
A helium nova occurs on a white dwarf (WD) accreting hydrogen-deficient matter from a helium star companion. When the mass of a helium envelope on the WD reaches a critical value, unstable helium burning ignites to trigger a nova outburst. A bright soft X-ray phase appears in an early outbursting phase of a helium nova before it optically rises toward maximum. Such an X-ray bright phase is called the X-ray flash. We present theoretical light curves of X-ray flashes for 1.0, 1.2, and 1.35 M☉ helium novae with mass accretion rates of (1.6–7.5) × 10−7M☉ yr−1. Long durations of the X-ray flashes (100 days–10 yr) and high X-ray luminosities (∼1038 erg s−1) indicate that X-ray flashes are detectable as a new type of X-ray transient or persistent X-ray sources. An X-ray flash is a precursor of optical brightening, so that the detection of X-ray flashes on helium novae enables us to plan arranged observation for optical premaximum phases that have been one of the frontiers of the study of novae. We found a candidate object of helium-burning X-ray flash from the literature on extragalactic X-ray surveys. This X-ray transient source is consistent with our X-ray flash model of a 1.35 M⊙ WD.

<title>On the Cosmic Variance of the Merger Rate Density of Binary Neutron Stars</title>

The cosmic variance on the star formation history may lead to bias in the merger rate density estimation of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers by compact binary population synthesis. In this paper, we take advantage of the large box size of the Millennium Simulation combined with the semianalytic galaxy formation model GABE and the parameterized population binary star evolution model to examine how much effect the cosmic variance will introduce on the estimation of the merger rate density of BNS mergers. We find that for subbox sizes of 100 and 200 Mpc, the variance of merger rate density σR/R at different redshifts is about 23%–35% and 13%–20%, respectively. On the one hand, as for the variance of the detection rate on BNS mergers with the current LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA (LVK) detector network, this value is very small at ≲10%, which indicates ignoring the cosmic variance is reasonable for estimating the merger rate density from current LVK observations. On the other hand, with next-generation gravitational wave detectors, it is possible to localize BNS mergers within subboxes possessing a length of 40 Mpc for a source redshift zs < 0.2. In such a small box, the cosmic variance of the merger rate density is significant, i.e., the value of σR/R is about ∼55%. This hints that estimating the merger rate density of BNS in different sky areas may provide useful information on the cosmic variance.

<title>The Dustiest Galactic S Stars: Mid-infrared Spectra from SOFIA/FORCAST</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present spectra of 12 of the reddest, and hence dustiest, S stars in the Milky Way, observed with the FORCAST grisms on SOFIA. S stars are asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars with C/O ∼ 1, so their molecular and dust chemistries are dominated by neither O nor C, often leading to atypical spectral features from their molecules and dust grains. All of the stars in our sample have strong dust emission features at 10–11 μm, but the shape of the feature in most of the stars differs from the shapes commonly observed in either oxygen-rich or carbon-rich AGB stars. Two stars also show the 13 μm feature associated with crystalline alumina. Two have a water absorption band at ∼6.5–7.5 μm, and a third has a tentative detection, but only one of these three has the more common SiO absorption band at 7.5 μm. Three others show a red 6.3 μm emission feature from complex hydrocarbons consistent with “Class C” objects, and in a fourth it appears at 6.37 μm, redder than even the standard Class C hydrocarbon feature. Class C spectra typically indicate complex hydrocarbons that have been less processed by UV radiation, resulting in more aliphatic bonds relative to aromatic bonds. None of the S stars show a strong 11.3 μm hydrocarbon feature, which is also consistent with the presence of aliphatic hydrocarbons.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
New results on the behavior of the double-mode RR Lyrae V338 Boo are presented. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observed this star again in 2022, and an observing campaign of the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO) was completed after the TESS observations as a follow-up. We find that the first overtone pulsation mode in this star completely disappears during the TESS observing window. This mode reappears at the end of the TESS observations, and the AAVSO observing campaign shows that in the months that followed, the first overtone mode was not only present but was the dominant mode of pulsation. This star, and potentially others like it, could hold the key to finally solving the mystery of the Blazhko effect in RR Lyrae.

<title>The Independence of Magnetic Turbulent Power Spectra to the Presence of Switchbacks in the Inner Heliosphere</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An outstanding gap in our knowledge of the solar wind is the relationship between switchbacks and solar wind turbulence. Switchbacks are large fluctuations, even reversals, of the background magnetic field embedded in the solar wind flow. It has been proposed that switchbacks may form as a product of turbulence and decay via coupling with the turbulent cascade. In this work, we examine how properties of solar wind magnetic field turbulence vary in the presence or absence of switchbacks. Specifically, we use in situ particle and fields measurements from Parker Solar Probe to measure magnetic field turbulent wave power, separately in the inertial and kinetic ranges, as a function of switchback magnetic deflection angle. We demonstrate that the angle between the background magnetic field and the solar wind velocity in the spacecraft frame (θvB) strongly determines whether Parker Solar Probe samples wave power parallel or perpendicular to the background magnetic field. Further, we show that θvB is strongly modulated by the switchback magnetic deflection angle. In this analysis, we demonstrate that switchback deflection angle does not correspond to any significant increase in wave power in either the inertial range or at kinetic scales. This result implies that switchbacks do not strongly couple to the turbulent cascade in the inertial or kinetic ranges via turbulent wave–particle interactions. Therefore, we do not expect switchbacks to contribute significantly to solar wind heating through this type of energy conversion pathway although contributions via other mechanisms, such as magnetic reconnection, may still be significant.

We present a flow-based generative approach to emulate grids of stellar evolutionary models. By interpreting the input parameters and output properties of these models as multidimensional probability distributions, we train conditional normalizing flows to learn and predict the complex relationships between grid inputs and outputs in the form of conditional joint distributions. Leveraging the expressive power and versatility of these flows, we showcase their ability to emulate a variety of evolutionary tracks and isochrones across a continuous range of input parameters. In addition, we describe a simple Bayesian approach for estimating stellar parameters using these flows and demonstrate its application to asteroseismic data sets of red giants observed by the Kepler mission. By applying this approach to red giants in open clusters NGC 6791 and NGC 6819, we illustrate how large age uncertainties can arise when fitting only to global asteroseismic and spectroscopic parameters without prior information on initial helium abundances and mixing length parameter values. We also conduct inference using the flow at a large scale by determining revised estimates of masses and radii for 15,388 field red giants. These estimates show improved agreement with results from existing grid-based modeling, reveal distinct population-level features in the red clump, and suggest that the masses of Kepler red giants previously determined using the corrected asteroseismic scaling relations have been overestimated by 5%–10%.

Variations within the UV/optical are well correlated, with longer wavelengths lagging shorter wavelengths in the direction predicted by thin-disk/lamppost models. The correlations are improved by “detrending,” subtracting a second-order polynomial fit to the UV/optical light curves to remove long-term trends that are not of interest to this study. Extensive testing indicates detrending with higher-order polynomials removes too much intrinsic variability signal on reverberation timescales. These data provide the clearest detection to date of interband lags within the UV, indicating that neither emission from a large disk nor diffuse continuum emission from the broad-line region (BLR) can independently explain the full observed lag spectrum. The observed X-ray flux variations are poorly correlated with those in the UV/optical. Further, subdivision of the data into four ∼160 days light curves shows that the UV/optical lag spectrum is highly stable throughout the four periods, but the X-ray to UV lags are unstable, significantly changing magnitude and even direction from one period to the next. This indicates the X-ray to UV relationship is more complex than predicted by the simple reprocessing model often adopted for AGN. A “bowl” model (lamppost irradiation and blackbody reprocessing on a disk with a steep rim) fit suggests the disk thickens at a distance (∼10 lt-day) and temperature (∼8000 K) consistent with the inner edge of the BLR.

<div> 关键词: circumplanetary disks, giant planet formation, multifluid radiation hydrodynamics simulations, cooling time, specific angular momentum

总结:<br /><br />本文利用FARGO3D代码进行了三维全局多流体辐射流体力学模拟，阐明了在Jovian行星的广泛轨道周围形成环绕行星盘的热力学条件。研究发现，冷却时间至少比轨道时间尺度短一个数量级时，气体的比角动量在Hill半径的1/3尺度上几乎是开普勒型的。模拟结果还表明，包括多流体尘埃动力学在内的模型可以促进旋转支持，因为尘埃沉降形成一个向各向异性的辐射分布，有利于快速冷却。此外，研究发现，具有辐射流体力学的模型中，随着时间的推移，具体角动量会减小，符合由于压缩加热形成内部等熵包层的情况。因此，年轻的气态巨行星可能具有球形的等熵包层，而不是环行行星盘。 <div>
The formation of circumplanetary disks is central to our understanding of giant planet formation, influencing their growth rate during the post-runaway phase and observability while embedded in protoplanetary disks. We use three-dimensional global multifluid radiation hydrodynamics simulations with the FARGO3D code to define the thermodynamic conditions that enable circumplanetary disk formation around Jovian planets on wide orbits. Our simulations include stellar irradiation, viscous heating, static mesh refinement, and active calculation of opacity based on multifluid dust dynamics. We find a necessary condition for the formation of circumplanetary disks in terms of a mean cooling time: When the cooling time is at least 1 order of magnitude shorter than the orbital timescale, the specific angular momentum of the gas is nearly Keplerian at scales of one-third of the Hill radius. We show that the inclusion of multifluid dust dynamics favors rotational support because dust settling produces an anisotropic opacity distribution that favors rapid cooling. In all our models with radiation hydrodynamics, specific angular momentum decreases as time evolves, in agreement with the formation of an inner isentropic envelope due to compressional heating. The isentropic envelope can extend up to one-third of the Hill radius and shows negligible rotational support. Thus, our results imply that young gas giant planets may host spherical isentropic envelopes, rather than circumplanetary disks.

总结: 
本研究探讨了超大质量黑洞喷流与星系周围介质相互作用的物理过程。喷流与星系间介质的相互作用对星系内恒星形成起到了调控作用。研究建立了喷流与光滑介质相互作用模型，包括了稠密云的影响，提出了重要物理量的标度关系。首次得到了介质颗粒度的解析条件，以验证与数值模拟结果。本研究还与实际观测进行了对比，并讨论了对费米/eROSITA泡泡的影响。这项工作也为宇宙射电源在宇宙射线模拟中提出了有效的次网格模型。 <div>
Accreting supermassive black holes frequently power jets that interact with the interstellar medium (ISM)/circumgalactic medium, regulating star formation in the galaxy. Highly supersonic jets launched by active galactic nuclei (AGN) power a cocoon that confines them and shocks the ambient medium. We build on the models of narrow conical jets interacting with a smooth ambient medium, including the effect of dense clouds, which are an essential ingredient of a multiphase ISM. The key physical ingredient of this model is that the clouds along the supersonic jet beam strongly decelerate the jet head but the subsonic cocoon easily moves around the clouds without much resistance. We propose scalings for important physical quantities—cocoon pressure, head and cocoon speed, and jet radius. For the first time, we obtain the analytic condition on the ambient medium’s clumpiness for the jet to dissipate within the cocoon and verify it with numerical simulations of conical jets interacting with a uniform ISM with embedded spherical clouds. A jet is defined to be dissipated when the cocoon speed exceeds the speed of the jet head. We compare our models with more sophisticated numerical simulations and direct observations of jet–ISM interaction (e.g., quasar J1316+1753), and we discuss implications for the Fermi/eROSITA bubbles. Our work also motivates effective subgrid models for AGN jet feedback in a clumpy ISM unresolved by the present generation of cosmological galaxy formation simulations.

<div> cosmic-ray ionization rate, gas density, extinction maps, H2 abundances, 3d-pdr code
总结:
本文重新评估了观测中测量漫射云中H2电离率的方法，并发现灰尘消光图可以提供与先前估计不同的气体密度值。使用这些数据，结合3d-pdr代码，得出了H2丰度和CR电离率的新值，发现平均来说，CR电离率比先前估计的值低了约9倍，主要是由于密度的降低。这些结果对所有现有的电离率测量都具有深远的影响。 <div>
All current estimates of the cosmic-ray (CR) ionization rate rely on assessments of the gas density along the probed sight lines. Until now, these have been based on observations of different tracers, with C2 being the most widely used in diffuse molecular clouds for this purpose. However, dust extinction maps have recently reached sufficient accuracy to give an independent measurement of the gas density on parsec scales. In addition, they allow us to identify the gas clumps along each sight line, thus localizing the regions where CR ionization is probed. We reevaluate observations, which are often considered as the most reliable method to measure the H2 ionization rate in diffuse clouds. The peak density values derived from the extinction maps for 12 analyzed sight lines turn out to be, on average, an order of magnitude lower than the previous estimates and agree with the values obtained from revised analysis of C2 data. We use the extinction maps in combination with the 3d-pdr code to self-consistently compute the and H2 abundances in the identified clumps for different values of . For each sight line, we obtain the optimum value by comparing the simulation results with observations. We show that is systematically reduced with respect to the earlier estimates by a factor of ≈9 on average, to ≈6 × 10−17 s−1, primarily as a result of the density reduction. We emphasize that these results have profound consequences for all available measurements of the ionization rate.

新的C2与H2碰撞激发的碰撞速率系数较之前采用的数值要大得多，这对于星际气体密度的探测非常重要。作者利用这些新的速率系数模拟了46个背景源的C2旋转分布，推测出导致观测到的C2吸收的前景星际云的气体密度比之前估算的要小4-7倍，与相关视线的3D消光图中的峰值密度基本吻合。对于那些还观测到吸收并用于估算宇宙射线离子化率（CRIR）的情况，我们对CRIR的估计也会相应减小，因为丰度是CRIR与气体密度的比值的函数。 
<br /><br />总结: C2与H2碰撞激发的速率系数重新计算，推测前景星际云气体密度减小，与3D消光图吻合，估计的CRIR也减小。 <div>
Newly computed collisional rate coefficients for the excitation of C2 in collisions with H2, presented recently by Najar & Kalugina, are significantly larger than the values adopted previously in models for the excitation of the C2 molecule, a widely used probe of the interstellar gas density. With these new rate coefficients, we have modeled the C2 rotational distributions inferred from visible and ultraviolet absorption observations of electronic transitions of C2 toward a collection of 46 nearby background sources. The inferred gas densities in the foreground interstellar clouds responsible for the observed C2 absorption are a factor 4–7 smaller than those inferred previously, a direct reflection of the larger collisional rate coefficients computed by Najar & Kalugina. These lower-density estimates are generally in good agreement with the peak densities inferred from 3D extinction maps for the relevant sight lines. In cases where absorption has also been observed and used to estimate the cosmic-ray ionization rate (CRIR), our estimates of the latter will also decrease accordingly because the abundance is a function of the ratio of the CRIR to the gas density.

<br />
这篇文章报告了对超大质量黑洞（M87*为典型案例）的燃料来自椭圆星系中的湍流冷却介质的三维磁气动力学模拟。研究发现，与类比的流体动力学模拟相比，质量吸积率增加了约10倍。从大约10 pc到10^-3 pc（约10个Schwarzschild半径），质量吸积率呈现出大致的比例关系，且通过视界的吸积率约为10^-2M⊙ yr^-1。在0.03-3 kpc的尺度上，吸积流呈磁化纤维的形式。在约30 pc范围内，冷气体环绕运动形成了一个高度被磁化（β约10^-3）的厚盘，由主要是环状磁场支撑。冷盘受到截断，并在约0.3 pc（10^3个Schwarzschild半径）处转变为湍流的热吸积流。磁场驱动向极端的强流出。通过的能量通量随着吸积体积减小而增加，对于rin=8 rg，能量通量达到约3 × 10^43 erg s^-1；这相当于接近恒定的能量反馈效率η约为0.05-0.1，与吸积体积无关。反馈能量足以平衡M87 / 维尔戈热晕的总冷却，直至约50 kpc。小半径的吸积磁通量类似于磁阻滞盘模型，与M87在视界尺度上形成强大的喷流相一致。我们的结果可以为低分辨率模拟中的吸积提供次网格模型，其中相对于邦迪率，热气体吸积率受到抑制。 <br /><br />总结: 这项研究重点讨论了超大质量黑洞在燃料来源、磁场作用和能量输出等方面的模拟结果。其中包括质量吸积率的增加、磁化纤维中的吸积流、冷盘的形成和热吸积流的转变以及强大的磁场驱动的极端流出等。研究结果推动了低分辨率模拟中的吸积次网格模型的发展。 <div>
We present 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the fueling of supermassive black holes in elliptical galaxies from a turbulent cooling medium on galactic scales, taking M87* as a typical case. We find that the mass accretion rate is increased by a factor of ∼10 compared with analogous hydrodynamic simulations. The scaling of roughly holds from ∼10 pc to ∼10−3 pc (∼10 rg) with the accretion rate through the event horizon being ∼10−2M⊙ yr−1. The accretion flow on scales ∼0.03–3 kpc takes the form of magnetized filaments. Within ∼30 pc, the cold gas circularizes, forming a highly magnetized (β ∼ 10−3) thick disk supported by a primarily toroidal magnetic field. The cold disk is truncated and transitions to a turbulent hot accretion flow at ∼0.3 pc (103rg). There are strong outflows toward the poles driven by the magnetic field. The outflow energy flux increases with smaller accretor size, reaching ∼3 × 1043 erg s−1 for rin = 8 rg; this corresponds to a nearly constant energy feedback efficiency of η ∼ 0.05–0.1 independent of accretor size. The feedback energy is enough to balance the total cooling of the M87/Virgo hot halo out to ∼50 kpc. The accreted magnetic flux at small radii is similar to that in magnetically arrested disk models, consistent with the formation of a powerful jet on horizon scales in M87. Our results motivate a subgrid model for accretion in lower-resolution simulations in which the hot gas accretion rate is suppressed relative to the Bondi rate by .

We present extensive observations and analysis of supernova (SN) SN 2021dbg, utilizing optical photometry and spectroscopy. For approximately 385 days following the explosion, SN 2021dbg exhibited remarkable luminosity, surpassing most Type II SNe (SNe II). This initial high luminosity is potentially attributed to interaction between the ejected material and the surrounding circumstellar material (CSM), as evidenced by the pronounced interaction signatures observed in its spectra. The subsequent high luminosity is primarily due to the significant 56Ni mass (0.17 ± 0.05 M⊙) produced in the explosion. Based on the flux of flash emission lines detected in the initial spectra, we estimate that the CSM mass near the progenitor amounted to ∼(1.0–2.0) × 10−3M⊙, likely resulting from intense stellar wind activity 2–3 yr preceding the explosion. Considering the bolometric light curve, nebular spectrum modeling, and mass-loss rate, we suggest that the progenitor of SN 2021dbg was a red supergiant (RSG) with a mass of ∼20 M⊙ and a radius of 1200 R⊙. This RSG featured a thick hydrogen shell, which may have contained a region with a sharp decrease in material density, electron density, and temperature, contributing to its layered structure. This object demonstrates mixed features of Type IIP and IIL SNe, making it a transitional event linking the above two subclasses of SNe II.

The dispersion measure of fast radio bursts (FRBs), arising from the interactions with free electrons along the propagation path, constitutes a unique probe of the cosmic baryon distribution. Their constraining power is further enhanced in combination with observations of the foreground large-scale structure and intervening galaxies. In this work, we present the first constraints on the partition of the cosmic baryons between the intergalactic medium (IGM) and circumgalactic medium (CGM), inferred from the FLIMFLAM spectroscopic survey. In its first data release, the FLIMFLAM survey targeted galaxies in the foreground of eight localized FRBs. Using Bayesian techniques, we reconstruct the underlying ∼Mpc-scale matter density field that is traced by the IGM gas. Simultaneously, deeper spectroscopy of intervening foreground galaxies (at impact parameters b⊥ ≲ r200) and the FRB host galaxies constrains the contribution from the CGM. Applying Bayesian parameter inference to our data and assuming a fiducial set of priors, we infer the IGM cosmic baryon fraction to be and a CGM gas fraction of for 1010M⊙ ≲ Mhalo ≲ 1013M⊙ halos. The mean FRB host dispersion measure (rest-frame) in our sample is , of which arises from the host galaxy interstellar medium (ISM) and/or the FRB progenitor environment. While our current figm and fgas uncertainties are too broad to constrain most galactic feedback models, this result marks the first measurement of the IGM and CGM baryon fractions, as well as the first systematic separation of the FRB host dispersion measure into two components: arising from the halo and from the inner ISM/FRB engine.

This study investigates the impact of spacecraft positioning and trajectory on in situ signatures of coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Employing the 3DCORE model, a 3D flux rope model that can generate in situ profiles for any given point in space and time, we conduct forward modeling to analyze such signatures for various latitudinal and longitudinal positions, with respect to the flux rope apex, at 0.8 au. Using this approach, we explore the appearance of the resulting in situ profiles for different flux rope types, with different handedness and inclination angles, for both high- and low-twist CMEs. Our findings reveal that CMEs exhibit distinct differences in signatures between apex hits and flank encounters, with the latter displaying elongated profiles with reduced rotation. Notably, constant, nonrotating in situ signatures are only observed for flank encounters of low-twist CMEs, suggesting the existence of untwisted magnetic field lines within CME legs. Additionally, our study confirms the unambiguous appearance of different flux rope types in in situ signatures in all of the cases, barring some indistinguishable cases, contributing to the broader understanding and interpretation of observational data. Given the model assumptions, this may refute trajectory effects as the cause for mismatching flux rope types as identified in solar signatures. While acknowledging limitations inherent in our model, such as the assumption of constant twist and a nondeformable torus-like shape, we still draw relevant conclusions within the context of the global magnetic field structures of CMEs and the potential for distinguishing flux rope types based on in situ observations.

<div> AGN feedback, galaxy formation simulations, FIRE-3, cosmological zoom-in simulations, star formation

总结:
超大质量黑洞的反馈被认为是驱动观测到的星系颜色双峰性的关键因素之一。该研究使用FIRE-3宇宙学放大模拟，首次考察了AGN反馈对质量范围在10^12–10^13M⊙的星系的影响。研究发现，AGN反馈模型能够使星系符合当地的比例关系，并且产生了与观测一致的星系形态和星系星的停止形成现象。然而，当反馈参数保持恒定时，模型并不能产生一致的实际星系，表明需进一步完善AGN建模。 <div>
Feedback from supermassive black holes is believed to be a critical driver of the observed color bimodality of galaxies above the Milky Way mass scale. Active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback has been modeled in many galaxy formation simulations, but most implementations have involved simplified prescriptions or a coarse-grained interstellar medium (ISM). We present the first set of Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE)-3 cosmological zoom-in simulations with AGN feedback evolved to z ∼ 0, examining the impact of AGN feedback on a set of galaxies with halos in the mass range 1012–1013M⊙. These simulations combine detailed stellar and ISM physics with multichannel AGN feedback including radiative feedback, mechanical outflows, and, in some simulations, cosmic rays (CRs). We find that massive (>L*) galaxies in these simulations can match local scaling relations including the stellar mass–halo mass relation and the MBH–σ relation; in the stronger model with CRs, they also match the size–mass relation and the Faber–Jackson relation. Many of the massive galaxies in the simulations with AGN feedback have quenched star formation and elliptical morphologies, in qualitative agreement with observations. In contrast, simulations at the massive end without AGN feedback produce galaxies that are too massive and form stars too rapidly, are order-of-magnitude too compact, and have velocity dispersions well above Faber–Jackson. Despite these successes, the AGN models analyzed do not produce uniformly realistic galaxies when the feedback parameters are held constant: While the stronger model produces the most realistic massive galaxies, it tends to overquench the lower-mass galaxies. This indicates that further refinements of the AGN modeling are needed.

Pulsars in binary systems with strong companion winds can have the magnetopause separating their magnetosphere from the wind located well within their light cylinder. This bow-like enclosure effectively creates a waveguide that confines the pulsar’s electromagnetic fields and can significantly alter its spindown. In this paper, we study the spindown of compressed pulsar magnetospheres in such systems. We parameterize the confinement as the ratio between the equatorial position of the magnetopause (or standoff distance) Rm and the pulsar’s light cylinder RLC. Using particle-in-cell simulations, we quantify the pulsar spindown for a range of compressions, Rm/RLC = 1/3–1, and inclination angles, χ = 0°…90°, between magnetic and rotation axes. Our strongly confined models (Rm/RLC = 1/3) show two distinct limits. For χ = 0°, the spindown of a compressed pulsar magnetosphere is enhanced by approximately a factor of three compared to an isolated pulsar due to the increased number of open magnetic field lines. Conversely, for χ = 90°, the compressed pulsar spins down at less than 40% of the rate of an isolated reference pulsar due to the mismatch between the pulsar wind stripe wavelength and the waveguide size. We apply our analysis to the 2.77 s oblique rotator (χ = 60°) in the double-pulsar system PSR J0737-3039. With the numerically derived spindown estimate, we constrain its surface magnetic field to B* ≈ (7.3 ± 0.2) × 1011 G. We discuss the time modulation of its period derivative, the effects of compression on its braking index, and implications for the radio eclipse in PSR J0737-3039.

在这篇文章中，研究了simba宇宙水动力模拟中尘埃阻碍的星形成的演化。得到了以下几点结论：在z=3之前，结果与观测结果基本一致，显示出星形成没有明显变化；然而在z>3时，发现在固定的星系恒星质量情况下，尘埃遮蔽的星形成有明显变化，与高红移观测结果存在矛盾。这种在更高红移处逐渐增加的遮蔽现象是由于星尘几何形状的演化导致的，因为灰尘与恒星质量之比在宇宙时空中保持相对恒定。此外，固定红移时，质量更大的星系有更高比例的星形成受到遮蔽，这可以通过更高的恒星质量和灰尘质量之比来解释。最后，估计了尘埃遮蔽的星形成对总体星形成率的贡献，发现尘埃遮蔽的星形成历史在z∼2−3附近达到峰值，并在z≳5时不再是主导因素。在z≲4时，尘埃遮蔽的星形成统治着星系形成的历史，这与在更高红移情况下固定星系质量的尘埃遮蔽星形成比例逐渐增加的结果一致，因为在高红移情况下存在着较少数量的大质量、高度遮蔽的星系。 <br /><br />总结: 星系在不同红移时的尘埃遮蔽星形成情况、质量更大的星系尘埃遮蔽星形成比例较高、尘埃遮蔽星形成对总体星形成率的贡献情况。 <div>
We explore the cosmic evolution of the fraction of dust-obscured star formation predicted by the simba cosmological hydrodynamic simulations featuring an on-the-fly model for dust formation, evolution, and destruction. We find that up to z = 3, our results are broadly consistent with previous observational results of little to no evolution in obscured star formation. However, at z > 3 we find strong evolution at fixed galaxy stellar mass toward greater amounts of obscured star formation, in tension with high-redshift observations. We explain the trend of increasing obscuration at higher redshifts by evolving star-dust geometry, as the dust-to-stellar mass ratios remain relatively constant across cosmic time. We additionally see that at a fixed redshift, more massive galaxies have a higher fraction of their star formation obscured, which is explained by increased dust-to-stellar mass ratios at higher stellar masses. Finally, we estimate the contribution of dust-obscured star formation to the total star formation rate budget and find that the dust-obscured star formation history peaks around z ∼ 2−3, and becomes subdominant at z ≳ 5. The dominance of obscured star formation at redshifts z ≲ 4 is consistent with our results for the evolution of the obscured star formation fraction at fixed stellar mass to higher values at higher redshift because there exist fewer massive, heavily obscured galaxies at high redshift.

<div> 强引力透镜，后蓝块星系，结构和恒星族群特性，光学和近红外波段，紧凑星形成。<br />
​<br />总结:
这项研究发现了六个强引力透镜后蓝块星系，它们的大小小于1.3 kpc，质量密度高，具有较低的特定星形成率。这些星系的大小-质量和表面密度-质量关系与红色块星系一致，但其特定星形成率接近相同红移下紧凑星形成的蓝块系统的下限，表明它们之间存在明显的演化联系。 <div>
During the early stages of galaxy evolution, a significant fraction of galaxies undergo a transitional phase between the “blue nugget” systems, which arise from the compaction of large, active star-forming disks, and the “red nuggets,” which are red and passive compact galaxies. These objects are typically only observable with space telescopes, and detailed studies of their size, mass, and stellar population parameters have been conducted on relatively small samples. Strong gravitational lensing can offer a new opportunity to study them in detail, even with ground-based observations. In this study, we present the first six bona fide samples of strongly lensed post-blue nugget (pBN) galaxies, which were discovered in the Kilo Degree Survey. By using the lensing-magnified luminosity from optical and near-infrared bands, we have derived robust structural and stellar population properties of the multiple images of the background sources. The pBN galaxies have very small sizes of Reff < 1.3 kpc, high mass density inside 1 kpc of , and low specific star formation rates of , The size–mass and Σ1–mass relations of this sample are consistent with those of the red nuggets, while their sSFR is close to the lower end of compact star-forming blue nugget systems at the same redshift, suggesting a clear evolutionary link between them.

总结: 研究发现，M87星系中的经典新星主要集中在星系的喷流附近，而且这种分布概率性极低。这些新星在喷流附近的特征与远离喷流的新星没有区别。研究探讨了新星分布的可能解释，但发现目前的解释都无法完全解释喷流附近新星的增加。因此，M87星系喷流附近新星的增加现象尚未得到合理解释。 <div>
The 135 classical novae that we have discovered in M87 with two Hubble Space Telescope imaging surveys appear to be strongly concentrated along that galaxy’s jet. Detailed simulations show that the likelihood that this distribution occurred by chance is of order 0.3%. The novae near the jet display outburst characteristics (peak luminosities, colors, and decline rates) that are indistinguishable from novae far from the jet. We explore whether the remarkable nova distribution could be caused by the jet’s irradiation of the hydrogen-rich donors in M87's cataclysmic binaries. This explanation, and others extant in the literature that rely on increased binary mass transfer rates, fail by orders of magnitude in explaining the enhanced nova rate near the jet. An alternate explanation is the presence of a genuine surplus of nova binary systems near the jet, perhaps due to jet-induced star formation. This explanation fails to explain the lack of nova enhancement along M87's counterjet. The enhanced rate of novae along M87's jet is now firmly established, and unexplained.

总结:
该研究通过LIGO和Virgo探测器在第三次观测运行（O3）期间，提出了一种对偏心黑洞合并敏感的波形独立搜索方法。结果显示未发现新的高显著性候选事件。研究确定了搜索对高质量（总源框架质量M>70 M⊙）的偏心二进制系统的灵敏度，并将模型预测与搜索结果进行比较。基于预设的人口模型，假设所有探测结果都是准圆的，该研究在90%置信水平下对具有偏心度0< e ≤ 0.3的高质量二进制系统的合并率密度放置了保守上限为16.9 Gpc−3 yr−1。<br /><br /> <div>
Despite the growing number of binary black hole coalescences confidently observed through gravitational waves so far, the astrophysical origin of these binaries remains uncertain. Orbital eccentricity is one of the clearest tracers of binary formation channels. Identifying binary eccentricity, however, remains challenging due to the limited availability of gravitational waveforms that include the effects of eccentricity. Here, we present observational results for a waveform-independent search sensitive to eccentric black hole coalescences, covering the third observing run (O3) of the LIGO and Virgo detectors. We identified no new high-significance candidates beyond those that have already been identified with searches focusing on quasi-circular binaries. We determine the sensitivity of our search to high-mass (total source-frame mass M > 70 M⊙) binaries covering eccentricities up to 0.3 at 15 Hz emitted gravitational-wave frequency, and use this to compare model predictions to search results. Assuming all detections are indeed quasi-circular, for our fiducial population model, we place a conservative upper limit for the merger rate density of high-mass binaries with eccentricities 0 < e ≤ 0.3 at 16.9 Gpc−3 yr−1 at the 90% confidence level.

<title>A Novel Method to Constrain Tidal Quality Factor from A Nonsynchronized Exoplanetary System</title>

<div> 星球系统，潮汐质量因子，角动量，系统演化，NGTS-10

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章提出了一种新的方法，通过观察非同步星球系统来限制潮汐质量因子。文章基于动力系统理论，指出了星球系统角动量共同演化轨迹在Ωorb-Ωspin平面存在一个禁区，该禁区主要由潮汐相互作用的强度决定。通过比较单个星球系统的(Ωorb, Ωspin)与禁区，可以确定潮汐质量因子，无需考虑系统的演化历史。应用该方法于NGTS-10-NGTS-10 b系统，得到的潮汐质量因子为，从而得到了潮汐力的严格上限。由于这不能被之前的理论预测解释，表明非同步星球系统中存在抑制潮汐作用的机制。 <div>
We propose a novel method to constrain the tidal quality factor, , from an observed nonsynchronized star–planet system consisting of a slowly rotating low-mass star and a close-in Jovian planet, taking into account the coevolution of stellar spin and planetary orbit due to the tidal interaction and the magnetic braking. On the basis of dynamical system theory, the track of the coevolution of angular momentum from the fast-rotator regime for such a system exhibits the existence of a forbidden region in the Ωorb–Ωspin plane, where Ωspin and Ωorb denote the angular velocity of the stellar spin and planetary orbit, respectively. The forbidden region is determined primarily by the strength of the tidal interaction. By comparing the (Ωorb, Ωspin) of a single star–planet system to the forbidden region, we can constrain the tidal quality factor regardless of the evolutionary history of the system. The application of this method to the star–planet system NGTS-10–NGTS-10 b gives , leading to a tight upper bound on the tidal torque. Since this cannot be explained by previous theoretical predictions for nonsynchronized star–planet systems, our result requires mechanisms that suppress the tidal interaction in such systems.

该研究使用Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array对七个附近云（南冕座、天鹰座、卡龙座I和II、蛇发座北、蛇发座、蛇夫座）中的几乎所有嵌入式原生恒星进行了观测。研究发现在各种原生恒星演化阶段，存在大量磁盘尺度的变化。此外，作者还发现尘埃盘和气体盘半径之比与辐射温度成正比的趋势。此外，在Class 0阶段，尘埃盘和气体盘尺度相似，这为早期原生恒星演化阶段的模型和观测数据提供了直接比较。但是，研究还指出，在52个Class 0磁盘的尺度分布与各种磁盘形成模型存在高度紧张，表明原生恒星磁盘形成仍然是一个未解决的问题。 <div>
We surveyed nearly all the embedded protostars in seven nearby clouds (Corona Australis, Aquila, Chamaeleon I and II, Ophiuchus North, Ophiuchus, Serpens) with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array at 1.3 mm observations with a resolution of 0.″1. This survey detected 184 protostellar disks, 90 of which were observed at a resolution of 14–18 au, making it one of the most comprehensive high-resolution disk samples across various protostellar evolutionary stages to date. Our key findings include the detection of new annular substructures in two Class I and two flat-spectrum sources, while 21 embedded protostars exhibit distinct asymmetries or substructures in their disks. We find that protostellar disks have a substantially large variability in their radii across all evolutionary classes. In particular, the fraction of large disks with sizes above 60 au decreases as the protostar evolves from Class 0 to Class I. Compiling the literature data, we discovered an increasing trend of the gas disk radii to dust disk radii ratio (Rgas,Kep/Rmm) with increasing bolometric temperature (Tbol). Our results indicate that the dust and gas disk radii decouple during the early Class I stage. However, in the Class 0 stage, the dust and gas disk sizes are similar, which allows for a direct comparison between models and observational data at the earliest stages of protostellar evolution. We show that the distribution of radii in the 52 Class 0 disks in our sample is in high tension with various disk formation models, indicating that protostellar disk formation remains an unsolved question.

SUSPENSE项目利用JWST上的NIRSpec进行了深空探测，以研究在宇宙午时期的巨大静止星系的恒星、化学和动力学特性为主要目标。通过观测远距离的静止星系和星系形成过程中的吸收线，得出了这些星系的恒星质量和详细的恒星形成历史。研究发现这些星系在不同红移下形成的方式和时间尺度存在差异，由此推测合并和/或后期恒星形成也对星系演化产生影响。未来的研究将会进一步探究这些星系的化学丰度、解析的恒星群体和动力学的早期形成、静止和后期演化。 <div>
We present an overview and first results from the Spectroscopic Ultradeep Survey Probing Extragalactic Near-infrared Stellar Emission (SUSPENSE), executed with NIRSpec on JWST. The primary goal of the SUSPENSE program is to characterize the stellar, chemical, and kinematic properties of massive quiescent galaxies at cosmic noon. In a single deep NIRSpec/MSA configuration, we target 20 distant quiescent galaxy candidates (z = 1–3, HAB ≤ 23), as well as 53 star-forming galaxies at z = 1–4. With 16 hr of integration and the G140M-F100LP dispersion-filter combination, we observe numerous Balmer and metal absorption lines for all quiescent candidates. We derive stellar masses (logM*/M⊙ ∼ 10.2–11.5) and detailed star formation histories (SFHs) and show that all 20 candidate quiescent galaxies indeed have quenched stellar populations. These galaxies show a variety of mass-weighted ages (0.8–3.3 Gyr) and star formation timescales (∼0.5–4 Gyr), and four out of 20 galaxies were already quiescent by z = 3. On average, the z > 1.75 [z < 1.75] galaxies formed 50% of their stellar mass before z = 4 [z = 3]. Furthermore, the typical SFHs of the galaxies in these two redshift bins (zmean = 2.2 [1.3]) indicate that galaxies at higher redshift formed earlier and over shorter star formation timescales compared to lower redshifts. Although this evolution is naturally explained by the growth of the quiescent galaxy population over cosmic time, number density calculations imply that mergers and/or late-time star formation also contribute to the evolution. In future work, we will further unravel the early formation, quenching, and late-time evolution of these galaxies by extending this work with studies on their chemical abundances, resolved stellar populations, and kinematics.

We present the discovery of 2MASS J05241392−0336543 (hereafter J0524−0336), a very metal-poor ([Fe/H] = −2.43 ± 0.16), highly r-process-enhanced ([Eu/Fe] = +1.34 ± 0.10) Milky Way halo field red giant star, with an ultrahigh Li abundance of A(Li, 3D, NLTE) = 6.15 ± 0.25 and [Li/Fe] = +7.64 ± 0.25, respectively. This makes J0524−0336 the most lithium-enhanced giant star discovered to date. We present a detailed analysis of the star’s atmospheric stellar parameters and chemical abundance determinations. Additionally, we detect indications of infrared excess, as well as observe variable emission in the wings of the Hα absorption line across multiple epochs, indicative of a potential enhanced mass-loss event with possible outflows. Our analysis reveals that J0524−0336 lies either between the bump and the tip of the red giant branch (RGB), or on the early asymptotic giant branch (e-AGB). We investigate the possible sources of lithium enrichment in J0524−0336, including both internal and external sources. Based on current models and on the observational evidence we have collected, our study shows that J0524−0336 may be undergoing the so-called lithium flash that is expected to occur in low-mass stars when they reach the RGB bump and/or the e-AGB.

Preceding a core-collapse supernova (CCSN), various processes produce an increasing amount of neutrinos of all flavors characterized by mounting energies from the interior of massive stars. Among them, the electron antineutrinos are potentially detectable by terrestrial neutrino experiments such as KamLAND and Super-Kamiokande (SK) via inverse beta decay interactions. Once these pre-supernova (pre-SN) neutrinos are observed, an early warning of the upcoming CCSN can be provided. In light of this, KamLAND and SK, both located in the Kamioka mine in Japan, have been monitoring pre-SN neutrinos since 2015 and 2021, respectively. Recently, we performed a joint study between KamLAND and SK on pre-SN neutrino detection. A pre-SN alert system combining the KamLAND detector and the SK detector was developed and put into operation, which can provide a supernova alert to the astrophysics community. Fully leveraging the complementary properties of these two detectors, the combined alert is expected to resolve a pre-SN neutrino signal from a 15 M⊙ star within 510 pc of the Earth at a significance level corresponding to a false alarm rate of no more than 1 per century. For a Betelgeuse-like model with optimistic parameters, it can provide early warnings up to 12 hr in advance.

总结：<br /><br />2023年1月，利用JWST的MIRI中分辨率光谱仪对β Pic周围的典型碎片盘进行了观测。与Spitzer上的红外光谱观测相比，发现了明显的差异。在5-15μm范围内建模的明亮连续谱已经消失，以约600K的黑体模型。之前显著的18和23μm结晶辉石发射特征也消失了，被来自更热的500K尘埃成分的非常微弱的特征所取代。此外，10μm硅酸盐特征的形状发生了变化，与温暖尘埃成分的温度从约300K升至约500K以及温暖的硅酸盐尘埃的结晶分数增加一致。这些结果表明β Pic系统具有动态的星周环境，增强的碰撞可能导致大量尘埃在行星系统中形成大云团。20年间，恒星辐射压可能已经将Spitzer光谱中观测到的热和冷结晶尘埃粒子吹出行星系统。 <div>
Modeling observations of the archetypal debris disk around β Pic, obtained in 2023 January with the MIRI Medium Resolution Spectrograph on board JWST, reveals significant differences compared with that obtained with the Infrared Spectrograph on board Spitzer. The bright 5–15 μm continuum excess modeled using a ∼600 K black body has disappeared. The previously prominent 18 and 23 μm crystalline forsterite emission features, arising from cold dust (∼100 K) in the Rayleigh limit, have disappeared and been replaced by very weak features arising from the hotter 500 K dust population. Finally, the shape of the 10 μm silicate feature has changed, consistent with a shift in the temperature of the warm dust population from ∼300 to ∼500 K and an increase in the crystalline fraction of the warm, silicate dust. Stellar radiation pressure may have blown both the hot and the cold crystalline dust particles observed in the Spitzer spectra out of the planetary system during the intervening 20 yr between the Spitzer and JWST observations. These results indicate that the β Pic system has a dynamic circumstellar environment, and that periods of enhanced collisions can create large clouds of dust that sweep through the planetary system.

We test the influence of spiral arms on the star formation activity of disk galaxies by constructing and fitting multiwavelength spectral energy distributions for the two nearby spiral galaxies NGC 628 and NGC 4321, at a spatial scale of 1–1.5 kpc. Recent results in the literature support the “gatherers” picture, i.e., that spiral arms gather material but do not trigger star formation. However, ambiguities in the diagnostics used to measure star formation rates (SFRs) and other quantities have hampered attempts at reaching definite conclusions. We approach this problem by utilizing the physical parameters output of the Multi-wavelength Analysis of Galaxy Physical Properties fitting code, which we apply to the ultraviolet-to-far infrared photometry, in ≥20 bands, of spatially resolved regions in the two galaxies. We separate the regions into arm and interarm, and study the distributions of the specific SFRs (sSFR = SFR/Mstar), stellar ages, and star formation efficiencies (SFE = SFR/Mgas). We find that the distributions of these parameters in the arm regions are almost indistinguishable from those in the interarm regions, with typical differences of a factor of 2 or less in the medians. These results support the “gatherer” scenario of spiral arms, which we plan to test with a larger sample in the near future.

We find that the surface of the Local Bubble is highly irregular in shape, with its peak extinction surface falling at an average distance of 170 pc from the Sun (spanning 70–600+ pc) with a typical thickness of 35 pc and a total dust-traced mass of (6.0 ± 0.7) × 105M⊙. The Local Bubble displays an extension in the Galactic northern hemisphere that is morphologically consistent with representing a “local chimney.” We argue this chimney was likely created by the “bursting” of this supernova-driven superbubble, leading to the funneling of interstellar medium (ISM) ejecta into the lower Galactic halo. We find that many well-known dust features and molecular clouds fall on the surface of the Local Bubble and that several tunnels to other adjacent cavities in the ISM may be present. Our new, parsec-resolution view of the Local Bubble may be used to inform future analysis of the evolution of nearby gas and young stars, the investigation of direct links between the solar neighborhood and the Milky Way’s lower halo, and numerous other applications.

<div> blazar OJ 287, multiwavelength activity, soft X-ray peak, VHE γ-ray outburst, spectral energy distributions

总结: 
本文研究了2017年2月发生在OJ 287上的多波段活动，发现其在软X射线和极高能γ射线波段都经历了复杂的闪耀行为。研究聚焦于活动前、中、后三个状态，发现至少有两个非热辐射区域参与了这次闪耀事件，其中一个更紧凑的区域导致了观测到的耀斑。宽带建模结果和对2017年OJ 287射电喷流中的一个新射电节的观察与一次源自射电核外强再压缩激波的闪耀事件是一致的。 <div>
In 2017 February, the blazar OJ 287 underwent a period of intense multiwavelength activity. It reached a new historic peak in the soft X-ray (0.3–10 keV) band, as measured by the Swift X-ray Telescope. This event coincides with a very-high-energy (VHE) γ-ray outburst that led VERITAS to detect emission above 100 GeV, with a detection significance of 10σ (from 2016 December 9 to 2017 March 31). The time-averaged VHE γ-ray spectrum was consistent with a soft power law (Γ = −3.81 ± 0.26) and an integral flux corresponding to ∼2.4% that of the Crab Nebula above the same energy. Contemporaneous data from multiple instruments across the electromagnetic spectrum reveal a complex flaring behavior, primarily in the soft X-ray and VHE bands. To investigate the possible origin of such an event, our study focuses on three distinct activity states: before, during, and after the 2017 February peak. The spectral energy distributions during these periods suggest the presence of at least two nonthermal emission zones, with the more compact one responsible for the observed flare. Broadband modeling results and observations of a new radio knot in the jet of OJ 287 in 2017 are consistent with a flare originating from a strong recollimation shock outside the radio core.

<div> persistent radio sources, dwarf galaxies, fast radio burst, neutron star wind nebula, massive black holes
<br /><br />总结: 本研究使用Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array观测了九个近邻（z≲0.055）矮星系中非核心持续性射电源（PRS），并对其中一个进行了1.7 GHz的高分辨率欧洲VLBI网络观测。研究比较了这些PRS的物理特性（如尺寸、频谱能量分布、射电亮度和光变曲线）与已知活动星系核（AGN）相关的PRS，发现J1136+2643是最有希望与快速射电暴（FRB）源相关的PRS。此外，还针对J1136+2643进行了中子星风星云和超星云模型的验证，发现其物理尺寸、亮度和SED与这些模型基本一致。最后，讨论了这些射电源可能由不断吸积的超大质量黑洞所驱动的替代解释，并概述了区分这些场景的未来展望和跟进观测。 <div>
We present 1–12 GHz Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array observations of nine off-nuclear persistent radio sources (PRSs) in nearby (z ≲ 0.055) dwarf galaxies, along with high-resolution European VLBI Network observations for one of them at 1.7 GHz. We explore the plausibility that these PRSs are associated with fast radio burst (FRB) sources by examining their properties—physical sizes, host-normalized offsets, spectral energy distributions (SEDs), radio luminosities, and light curves—and compare them to those of the PRSs associated with FRB 20121102A and FRB 20190520B, two known active galactic nuclei (AGN), and one likely AGN in our sample with comparable data, as well as other radio transients exhibiting characteristics analogous to FRB-PRSs. We identify a single source in our sample, J1136+2643, as the most promising FRB-PRS, based on its compact physical size and host-normalized offset. We further identify two sources, J0019+1507 and J0909+5655, with physical sizes comparable to FRB-PRSs, but which exhibit large offsets and flat spectral indices potentially indicative of a background AGN origin. We test the viability of neutron star wind nebula and hypernebula models for J1136+2643 and find that the physical size, luminosity, and SED of J1136+2643 are broadly consistent with these models. Finally, we discuss the alternative interpretation that the radio sources are instead powered by accreting massive black holes, and we outline future prospects and follow-up observations for differentiating between these scenarios.

<div> 高度-时间，太阳最小活动期，STEREO，太阳物理，太阳风
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了2008年1月期间的太阳活动最低期，跟踪了来自STEREO/EUVI的次级流干扰（PD）在扩展的日冕中的传播过程，并通过非径向路径在STEREO/COR1和STEREO/COR2中追踪其结构。通过对417个独特的OPD进行分析，发现了两类PD：慢速OPD和快速OPD。慢速OPD更倾向于在大约1.6R⊙处形成，速度大约为每秒1.5R⊙，并且在7.5R⊙时加速。快速OPD主要在1.6R⊙和3.0R⊙处形成，并且速度也在7.5R⊙时。IPD在大约1.8R⊙处形成，速度约为每秒数十千米，主要集中在日冕物质抛射爆发后。最后，文章还展示了与OPD相关的周期性亮度变化，在2.0R⊙范围内持续存在，速度与通过行星际闪烁获得的太阳风速度相吻合。 <div>
We revisit a quiet 14 day period of solar minimum during 2008 January and track substreamer propagating disturbances (PDs) from low heights in STEREO/EUVI to the extended corona through STEREO/COR1 and into STEREO/COR2 along nonradial paths that trace the structure of the underlying streamers. Using our recently developed method for generating nonradial height–time profiles of outward PDs (OPDs) and inward PDs (IPDs), we obtained their velocities along the radial and position angle directions. Our analysis of 417 unique OPDs revealed two classes: slow and fast OPDs. Slow OPDs form preferentially at ≈1.6 R⊙ closer to the streamer boundaries, with asymmetric occurrence rates, and show speeds of at 1.5 R⊙ and accelerate up to at 7.5 R⊙. Fast OPDs form preferentially at ≈1.6 R⊙ and at ≈3.0 R⊙ both at the streamer boundaries and slightly more often within them. They show speeds of at 1.5 R⊙ up to at 7.5 R⊙. IPDs are observed forming at ≈1.8 R⊙ with speeds of tens of kilometers per second, mostly concentrated in the aftermath of a coronal mass ejection eruption. We present an example in which we show that periodic brightness variations related to OPDs remained in the range of 98 to 128 minutes, down to ≈2.0 R⊙, well within the field of view of COR1. The velocity profiles of slow OPDs for a heliocentric height below 3.0 R⊙ show good agreement with speeds more closely related to the bulk solar wind obtained via interplanetary scintillation.

<div> 关键词: 钻石星系观测-IV、棒状结构、星形成、星系、动力学
总结: 针对使用MaNGA数据从不同角度研究了棒状强度和运动学如何影响星系中的星形成。通过Galaxy Zoo DESI对棒状进行分类，以及使用MaNGA调查的星动力学数据上使用Tremaine–Weinberg方法对其进行分类。研究发现，在星形成星系中强棒状结构会导致中心和棒状末端区域的星形成增强，而在棒状臂部分却会导致星形成受到抑制。相反，对于弱棒状星系，其星形成的径向分布与无棒状星系非常相似。此外，研究还发现，在星形成星系中，缓慢的棒状结构会导致沿着棒状的星形成显著增加，然而全局的星形成率在有快速和缓慢棒状结构的星系中并没有显著差异。这表明棒状结构的动力学不会全局影响星形成，而是改变了星系中的星形成位置。因此，研究发现如果棒状结构既强又缓慢，它将对其主星系产生最大影响。 <br /><br /> <div>
We study how bar strength and bar kinematics affect star formation in different regions of the bar by creating radial profiles of EW[Hα] and Dn4000 using data from Sloan Digital Sky Survey-IV Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA). Bars in galaxies are classified as strong or weak using Galaxy Zoo DESI, and they are classified as fast and slow bars using the Tremaine–Weinberg method on stellar kinematic data from the MaNGA survey. In agreement with previous studies, we find that strong bars in star-forming (SF) galaxies have enhanced star formation in their center and beyond the bar-end region, while star formation is suppressed in the arms of the bar. This is not found for weakly barred galaxies, which have very similar radial profiles to unbarred galaxies. In addition, we find that slow bars in SF galaxies have significantly higher star formation along the bar than fast bars. However, the global star formation rate is not significantly different between galaxies with fast and slow bars. This suggests that the kinematics of the bar do not affect star formation globally, but changes where star formation occurs in the galaxy. Thus, we find that a bar will influence its host the most if it is both strong and slow.

总结: 一项关于银河恒星系统中伽马射线发射的研究偶然发现了一个名为IRC-10412的冷却和演化恒星，其强烈的无线电发射级别引起了人们的关注。随后的观测分析表明，IRC-10412被归类为半规则变星SRb型，处于渐近巨星分支。研究提出了其质量流失参数的不同但一致的估计值。研究人员认为其异常高的无线电发射可能源自于受到外部光子电离源的影响，可能来自附近的OB星团。<br /><br /> <div>
As a byproduct of our search for Galactic stellar systems with gamma-ray emission, we have identified an unrelated cool and evolved star (IRC-10412) that attracted our attention due to its strong radio emission level with a spectral index matching, almost perfectly, the canonical +0.6 value expected from an ionized stellar wind. A follow-up observational analysis was undertaken given that these two properties are hard to reconcile as originating in the same stellar object. As a result, IRC-10412 has been classified as a new semiregular variable of SRb type in the asymptotic giant branch, and different but consistent estimates of its mass-loss parameter are reported. We propose that its unusually high radio emission arises from a ∼10−5M⊙ yr−1 stellar wind exposed to an external source of ionizing photons, possibly coming from nearby OB associations.

<title>Quasiperiodic Oscillations in GRB 210514A: a Case of a Newborn Supramassive Precessing Magnetar Collapsing into a Black Hole?</title>

<div> 关键词: Magnetar, gamma-ray burst (GRB), quasiperiodic oscillation (QPO), Swift observations, supramassive magnetar (SMM)

总结:
本文利用Swift观测GRB的数据，发现GRB 210514A具有大约11秒的QPO信号，信号的置信水平超过3σ。该GRB的全局光变曲线呈现双平台结构，在平台间有明显的衰减段。作者提出了一个超质量磁星模型来解释这一现象，其中第一个平台的QPO信号是由经历进动运动的超质量磁星的偶极辐射产生的，急剧衰减是因为超质量磁星坍缩成黑洞，第二个平台可能是由新生黑洞的回落吸积产生的。作者利用贝叶斯统计学对进动模型进行了拟合，并讨论了最佳拟合磁星参数。其他关于黑洞中心引擎的替代模型也可以解释这次爆发，但在这种情况下，QPO信号可能仅仅是巧合。 <br /><br /> <div>
Magnetar is proposed as one of the possible central engines for a gamma-ray burst (GRB). Recent studies show that if a magnetar has a rotational axis misaligned from the magnetic one, a periodic lightcurve pattern is expected with a period of seconds to minutes. Inspired by this unique feature, in this paper, we search for the quasiperiodic oscillation (QPO) signals in the Swift observations of GRBs. Using the Lomb–Scargle periodogram and the weighted wavelet Z-transform algorithms, we find that the Swift Burst Alert Telescope data of GRB 210514A has a QPO signal with a period ∼11 s. The estimated confidence level of the signal is over 3σ. The global lightcurve of this GRB exhibits a double-plateau structure with a sharp decay segment between plateaus. The lightcurve feature resembles those of GRBs that were reported to have internal plateaus. We explain the observations of GRB 210514A with a supramassive magnetar (SMM) model, where the QPO signal in the first plateau is produced via the dipole radiation of the SMM experiencing a precession motion, the sharp decay is due to the collapse of the SMM into a black hole (BH), and the second plateau could be produced via the fallback accretion of the newborn BH. We fit the precession model to the observations using the Bayesian statistic and the best-fit magnetar parameters are discussed. Alternative models concerning a BH central engine may also provide reasonable explanations for this burst, only in this case the QPO signal could merely be a coincidence.

总结:
红外脉冲星PSR J1622-0315是已知紧凑红背毫秒脉冲星中的一员，其伴星表现出极低的辐射，尽管轨道周期很短。研究者使用2017年新技术望远镜和2022年北欧光学望远镜的光学观测数据，结合ICARUS二进制建模代码进行模拟，确定了该系统的二进制参数。他们发现，该红外脉冲星的最佳拟合中子星质量为2.3 ± 0.4 M⊙，伴星质量为0.15 ± 0.02 M⊙。研究还首次探测到了来自最小值的不对称低水平辐射以及其光曲线在五年内最大值的不对称性变化。通过恒星黑斑模型，研究者发现与对称直接加热模型相比，能够更好地拟合观测数据，并且得到了一致的轨道参数。最后，他们讨论了一个替代场景，即变化的不对称性是由可变的星际冲击产生的。综上所述，研究者发现PSR J1622-0315将低辐射与可变的光曲线不对称性以及相对较高的中子星质量相结合。 <div>
The companion to PSR J1622-0315, one of the most compact known redback millisecond pulsars, shows extremely low irradiation despite its short orbital period. We model this system to determine the binary parameters, combining optical observations from the New Technology Telescope in 2017 and the Nordic Optical Telescope in 2022 with the binary modeling code ICARUS. We find a best-fit neutron star mass of 2.3 ± 0.4 M⊙, and a companion mass of 0.15 ± 0.02 M⊙. We detect for the first time low-level irradiation from asymmetry in the minima as well as a change in the asymmetry of the maxima of its light curves over five years. Using starspot models, we find better fits than those from symmetric direct heating models, with consistent orbital parameters. We discuss an alternative scenario where the changing asymmetry is produced by a variable intrabinary shock. In summary, we find that PSR J1622-0315 combines low irradiation with variable light-curve asymmetry and a relatively high neutron star mass.

<div> Poynting-flux-dominated jet, magnetic field, turbulence, polarization degree, X-ray
<br /><br />总结:
在Poynting-flux-dominated jet中，经过磁重联和能量耗散后，有序磁场逐渐转变为湍流和磁场无序。通过引入一个包括随机磁场和有序磁场的简化模型，发现随机磁场对低能X射线的极化度结果有显著影响。随着电子注入停止，有序磁场下X射线段的极化度仍有显著值，更易于通过偏振测量检测。然而，引入随机磁场后，低能段和高能段的极化度呈现类似趋势，且X射线段的极化度低于高能段。此外，会出现两种未曾出现的偏振角旋转，并且高能段的旋转略早于之前。这些结果与有序磁场的结构无关。 <div>
In a Poynting-flux-dominated jet that exhibits an ordered magnetic field, a transition toward turbulence and magnetic disorder follows after magnetic reconnection and energy dissipation during the prompt emission phase. In this process, the configuration of the magnetic field evolves with time, rendering it impossible to entirely categorize the magnetic field as ordered. Therefore, we assumed a crude model that incorporates a random magnetic field and an ordered magnetic field, and takes into account the proportionality of the random magnetic field strength to the ordered magnetic field, in order to compute the polarization degree (PD) curve for an individual pulse. It has been discovered that the random magnetic field has a significant impact on the PD results of the low-energy X-ray. In an ordered magnetic field, the X-ray segment maintains a significant PD compared to those in the hundreds of keV and MeV ranges even after electron injection ceases, making PD easier to detect by polarimetry. However, when the random magnetic field is introduced, the low-energy and high-energy PDs exhibit a similar trend, with the X-ray PD being lower than that of the high-energy segment. Of course, this is related to the rate of disorder in the magnetic field. Additionally, there are two rotations of the polarization angles (PAs) that were not present previously, and the rotation of the PA in the high-energy segment occurs slightly earlier. These results are unrelated to the structure of the ordered magnetic field.

<div> T Tauri Stars, Exoplanets, Spectroscopic Survey, Near-infrared, Spot Variability
<br /><br />总结:
这项研究通过分析T Tauri Stars（TTSs）的近红外H波段光谱，使用来自Immersion GRating INfrared Spectrometer的光谱，探索了13颗T Tauri Stars（TTSs）的斑点变异性。通过分析原子Fe i在∼1.56259 μm和∼1.56362 μm处以及分子OH在∼1.56310和∼1.56317 μm处的有效温度（Teff）敏感线的等效宽度比（EWR）关系，我们建立了Teff在3400–5000 K范围内的经验EWR关系，从而实现了精确的Teff相对估计，达到几十K的范围，并表明与太阳金属丰度目标模型兼容。然而，观测数据与模型预测之间的差异限制了Teff–EWR关系向更广泛参数空间的推广。我们的研究揭示了经典和弱线TTSs可以表现出超过2年内超过150 K的Teff变化。在TTSs中检测到EWR和径向速度相位曲线之间的四分之一相位延迟表明受斑点驱动的信号。然而，CI Tau的相位延迟为0.06 ± 0.13，这表明额外的动力学，可能是由行星相互作用引起的，推测出旋转周期和轨道周期之间的1：1共振。此外，Teff变化幅度与恒星倾角之间的正相关性支持TTSs上存在高纬度斑点的存在，进一步丰富了我们对年轻恒星表面活动的理解。 <div>
As part of the Young Exoplanets Spectroscopic Survey, this study explores the spot variability of 13 T Tauri Stars (TTSs) in the near-infrared H band, using spectra from the Immersion GRating INfrared Spectrometer. By analyzing effective temperature (Teff) sensitive lines of atomic Fe i at ∼1.56259 μm and ∼1.56362 μm, and molecular OH at ∼1.56310 and ∼1.56317 μm, we develop an empirical equivalent width ratio (EWR) relationship for Teff in the range of 3400–5000 K. This relationship allows for precise relative Teff estimates to within tens of Kelvin and demonstrates compatibility with solar metallicity target models. However, discrepancies between observational data and model predictions limit the extension of the Teff–EWR relationship to a broader parameter space. Our study reveals that both classical and weak-line TTSs can exhibit Teff variations exceeding 150 K over a span of 2 yr. The detection of a quarter-phase delay between the EWR and radial velocity phase curves in TTSs indicates spot-driven signals. A phase delay of 0.06 ± 0.13 for CI Tau, however, suggests additional dynamics, potentially caused by planetary interaction, inferred from a posited 1:1 commensurability between the rotation period and orbital period. Moreover, a positive correlation between Teff variation amplitude and stellar inclination angle supports the existence of high-latitude spots on TTSs, further enriching our understanding of stellar surface activity in young stars.

<div> 关键词: 快速射电暴发, 强磁体星, 脉冲能量分布, 中子星磁层, 引力自透镜效应

总结:
快速射电暴发（FRBs）是宇宙中短暂的相干射电发射，其来源尚不明确。目前，银河系磁星SGR 1935 + 2154是唯一已知发射类似FRBs的天体物体，这支持了FRBs可能源自磁星的假设。然而，FRBs的许多性质，如重复发生和一次性源之间的二分法，以及它们的功率能量分布等，仍不够理解。本文假设FRBs起源于锚定在中子星磁层中的共转热点，并且偶尔通过中子星引力自透镜效应得到大幅度放大。我们评估了这种放大的概率，并表明：（i）事件的能量分布通常遵循E−(2−3)的幂律；（ii）所有FRB源可以看作是重复发生的，其一次性源或重复发生的外观取决于放大概率对发射几何和源相对地球的定向的关键依赖；（iii）最活跃的重复发生者对应于极其罕见和精密调整的定向（约1/106），导致放大概率大，从而使它们的暴发经常可检测。同时，它们的能量释放似乎增强，通常大于10倍，缓解了它们的能量预算问题。 <br /><br /> <div>
Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are cosmological subsecond bursts of coherent radio emission, whose source is still unknown. To date, the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935 + 2154 is the only astrophysical object known to emit radio bursts akin to FRBs, albeit less powerful, supporting suggestions that FRBs originate from magnetars. Many remarkable properties of FRBs—e.g., the dichotomy between repeaters and one-off sources, and their power-law energy distributions (with typical index ∼2–3)—are not well understood yet. Moreover, the huge radio power released by the most active repeaters is challenging even for the magnetic energy reservoir of magnetars. Here, we assume that FRBs originate from corotating hotspots anchored in neutron star (NS) magnetospheres and occasionally get amplified by large factors via gravitational self-lensing in the strong NS field. We evaluate the probability of amplification and show that: (i) a power-law energy distribution of events ∝E−(2−3) is generally expected; (ii) all FRB sources may be regarded as repeating, their appearance as one-off sources or repeaters being determined by the critical dependence of the amplification probability on the emission geometry and source orientation relative to Earth; and (iii) the most active repeaters, in particular, correspond to extremely rare and finely tuned orientations (∼1 in 106), leading to large probabilities of amplification that make their bursts frequently detectable. At the same time, their power release appears enhanced, typically by factors ≳10, easing their energy budget problem.

在这项研究中，通过利用近期对核心坍缩超新星的铁平均产量的测量结果，研究人员推断出α元素的产量。他们假设观测到的低金属丰度恒星中观测到的[α/Fe]比例平台代表了核心坍缩超新星的产量比率。研究发现，推断出的氧和铁的产量与一些核心坍缩超新星模型的预测相吻合，并且比很多星系质量-金属丰度关系模型中的假设值要低。他们的化学演化模型最终演化到太阳金属丰度，并且进一步要求在晚期达到[α/Fe]≈ 0，从而推断出与超新星调查估计相一致的Ia型超新星速率。总结: <br /><br />研究人员通过核心坍缩超新星的铁平均产量测量推断出α元素的产量，并发现与部分模型预测相吻合。他们的化学演化模型最终演化到太阳金属丰度，并且推断出与超新星调查估计相一致的Ia型超新星速率。 <div>
The scale of α-element yields is difficult to predict from theory because of uncertainties in massive star evolution, supernova physics, and black hole formation, and it is difficult to constrain empirically because the impact of higher yields can be compensated by greater metal loss in galactic winds. We use a recent measurement of the mean iron yield of core collapse supernovae (CCSN) by Rodriguez et al., , to infer the scale of α-element yields by assuming that the plateau of [α/Fe] abundance ratios observed in low-metallicity stars represents the yield ratio of CCSN. For a plateau at [α/Fe]cc = 0.45, we find that the population-averaged yields of O and Mg are about equal to the solar abundance of these elements, , where is the mass of element X produced by massive stars per unit mass of star formation. The inferred O and Fe yields agree with predictions of the Sukhbold et al. CCSN models assuming their Z9.6+N20 neutrino-driven engine, a scenario in which many progenitors with M < 40M⊙ implode to black holes rather than exploding. The yields are lower than assumed in many models of the galaxy mass–metallicity relation, reducing the level of outflows needed to match observed abundances. Our one-zone chemical evolution models with evolve to solar metallicity at late times. By further requiring that models reach [α/Fe] ≈ 0 at late times, we infer a Hubble-time integrated Type Ia supernova rate of , compatible with estimates from supernova surveys.

<div> AGN, neutrinos, IceCube, correlation study, upper limits
<br /><br />总结:
这篇文章讨论了活动星系核（AGN）可能是IceCube探测到的高能宇宙中微子的主要来源，并提出了AGN中宇宙中微子的产生机制尚未建立的问题。研究通过对AGN的15 GHz无线电观测数据和IceCube的10年中微子数据进行相关性分析，并采用了时间相关的方法来提高统计功效。研究发现在两种分析中均未发现明显的相关性，并报告了上限。与IceCube的漫射通量相比，对于能量为100 TeV，谱指数为2.5的情况，得到的上限分别约为3%和9%。 <div>
Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are prime candidate sources of the high-energy, astrophysical neutrinos detected by IceCube. This is demonstrated by the real-time multimessenger detection of the blazar TXS 0506+056 and the recent evidence of neutrino emission from NGC 1068 from a separate time-averaged study. However, the production mechanism of the astrophysical neutrinos in AGN is not well established, which can be resolved via correlation studies with photon observations. For neutrinos produced due to photohadronic interactions in AGN, in addition to a correlation of neutrinos with high-energy photons, there would also be a correlation of neutrinos with photons emitted at radio wavelengths. In this work, we perform an in-depth stacking study of the correlation between 15 GHz radio observations of AGN reported in the MOJAVE XV catalog, and 10 yr of neutrino data from IceCube. We also use a time-dependent approach, which improves the statistical power of the stacking analysis. No significant correlation was found for both analyses, and upper limits are reported. When compared to the IceCube diffuse flux, at 100 TeV and for a spectral index of 2.5, the upper limits derived are ∼3% and ∼9% for the time-averaged and time-dependent cases, respectively.

Very Large Telescope/UVES spectroscopic and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) photometric observations for WASP 0346-21 allow the direct determination of its physical properties, along with the detection of a circumbinary object and oscillating signals. The high-resolution spectra yielded the radial velocities of all three stars and the atmospheric parameters of Teff,A = 7225 ± 42 K, [M/H] = 0.30 ± 0.03 dex, and vA = 78 ± 5 km s−1 of the primary component. The combined analysis of these observations resulted in the fundamental parameters of the eclipsing components and the third light of l3 = 0.043 ± 0.004, which is consistent with the light contribution of the tertiary star observed in the echelle spectra. WASP 0346-21 A resides within the overlapping main-sequence domain of δ Sct and γ Dor variables, while the secondary component of MB = 0.185 ± 0.013 M⊙, RB = 0.308 ± 0.023 R⊙, Teff,B = 10,655 ± 146 K, and LB = 1.09 ± 0.17 L⊙ matches well with the low-mass white dwarf (WD) model for Z = 0.01, corresponding to the thick disk population classified by the Galactic kinematics. Multifrequency analyses were performed on the residual TESS data after removing the binarity effects. The low frequencies around 26.348 day−1 and 17.683 day−1 are δ Sct pulsations originating from WASP 0346-21 A, and the high frequencies of 97.996 day−1 and 90.460 day−1 are considered to be extremely low-mass WD oscillations. These results demonstrate that WASP 0346-21 is a hierarchical triple system, consisting of an EL CVn binary with multiperiodic pulsations in each component and a distant outer tertiary.

总结:<br />
这篇文章介绍了一种快速可靠的基于深度学习的方法，用于从LIGO数据中重建晦涩的通用二进制黑洞合并引力波（GW）信号。作者展示了他们的模型AWaRe能够有效地恢复在训练中未遇到过的具有不同参数的GW信号，包括较大的黑洞质量、附加谐波、离心率和变化的波形系统性，这些特性在波形的幅度和相位中引入了复杂的调制。作者还展示了AWaRe模型对真实GW事件的稳健性，以及其在未知数据中的外推能力，为GW天体物理学和数据分析的各个方面开辟了新的研究途径，包括广义相对论的测试和当前GW搜索方法的增强。 <div>
We present a rapid and reliable deep-learning-based method for gravitational-wave (GW) signal reconstruction from elusive, generic binary black hole mergers in LIGO data. We demonstrate that our model, AWaRe, effectively recovers GWs with parameters it has not encountered during training. This includes features like higher black hole masses, additional harmonics, eccentricity, and varied waveform systematics, which introduce complex modulations in the waveform’s amplitudes and phases. The accurate reconstructions of these unseen signal characteristics demonstrate AWaRe's ability to handle complex features in the waveforms. By directly incorporating waveform reconstruction uncertainty estimation into the AWaRe framework, we show that for real GW events, the uncertainties in AWaRe's reconstructions align closely with those achieved by benchmark algorithms like BayesWave and coherent WaveBurst. The robustness of our model to real GW events and its ability to extrapolate to unseen data open new avenues for investigations in various aspects of GW astrophysics and data analysis, including tests of general relativity and the enhancement of current GW search methodologies.

总结：<br /><br />这篇文章使用近红外相机（NIRCam）成像从JWST解析恒星人口早期释放的科学项目中进行了对WLM星系中演化星的调查。文章发现，结合F090W、F150W、F250M和F430M滤镜可以有效地将红超巨星和热脉冲AGB星相互隔离，同时合理地区分主要的TP-AGB亚类型：富碳C型星和富氧M型星。文章还表示，93%的尘埃星是碳丰富的，这表明碳质尘埃在WLM星系的尘埃产生中占主导地位。PARSEC + COLIBRI恒星演化模型与演化星色彩的预测结果取得了良好的一致性，这些模型还表明，演化星在NIRCam的鉴定可能在低金属丰度下更加困难。文章的结果证明了NIRCam在识别和分类产尘星时的实用性，无需中红外数据。 <div>
We present an investigation of evolved stars in the nearby star-forming galaxy Wolf–Lundmark–Melotte (WLM), using Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) imaging from the JWST Resolved Stellar Populations Early Release Science program. We find that various combinations of the F090W, F150W, F250M, and F430M filters can effectively isolate red supergiants and thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) stars from one another, while also providing a reasonable separation of the primary TP-AGB subtypes: carbon-rich C-type stars and oxygen-rich M-type stars. The classification scheme we present here agrees very well with the well-established Hubble Space Telescope (HST) medium-band filter technique. The ratio of C to M-type stars is 0.8 ± 0.1 for both the new JWST and the HST classifications, which is within 1σ of empirical predictions from optical narrowband CN and TiO filters. The evolved star colors show good agreement with the predictions from the PARSEC + COLIBRI stellar evolutionary models, and the models indicate a strong metallicity dependence that makes stellar identification even more effective at higher metallicity. However, the models also indicate that evolved star identification with NIRCam may be more difficult at lower metallicities. We test every combination of NIRCam filters using the models and present additional filters that are also useful for evolved star studies. We also find that ≈90% of the dusty evolved stars are carbon rich, suggesting that carbonaceous dust dominates the present-day dust production in WLM, similar to the findings in the Magellanic Clouds. These results demonstrate the usefulness of NIRCam in identifying and classifying dust-producing stars without the need for mid-infrared data.

Brown dwarfs (BDs) are model degenerate in age and mass. High-contrast imaging and spectroscopy of BD companions to host stars where the mass and age can be independently constrained by dynamics and stellar age indicators, respectively, provide valuable tests of BD evolution models. In this paper, we present a new epoch of Subaru/CHARIS H- and K-band observations of one such previously discovered system, HD 33632 Ab. We reanalyze the mass and orbit using our new epoch of extracted relative astrometry and fit extracted spectra to the newest generation of equilibrium, disequilibrium, and cloudy spectral and evolution models for BDs. No spectral model perfectly agrees with evolutionary tracks and the derived mass and age, instead favoring a somewhat younger BD than the host star’s inferred age. This tension can potentially be resolved using atmosphere and evolution models that consider both clouds and disequilibrium chemistry simultaneously or by additional future spectra at higher resolution or in other band passes. Photometric measurements alone remain consistent with the luminosity predicted by evolutionary tracks. Our work highlights the importance of considering complexities like clouds, disequilibrium chemistry, and composition when comparing spectral models to evolutionary tracks.

总结:<br /><br />这项研究关注于太阳低光球闭合磁场结构对观测到的伽马射线通量的影响。研究使用PLUTO代码对在静态磁弧旁的∼20 Mm规模高度磁场中的试验粒子质子轨迹进行数值追踪。利用数值密度剖面，模拟铬层/光球高度注入粒子，模拟来自相邻磁通管的GCRs向闭合磁弧的迁移。模型成功复现了Fermi-LAT观测中的低于∼33 GeV的平坦伽马射线光谱和∼10 GeV附近的几乎各向同性辐射，以及∼1 TeV的近边太阳发射。模型还可以重现HAWC在∼1 TeV探测到的通量下降。最后，文章认为∼40 GeV的谱线下降可能是由于横向扩散引起的低能流量抑制导致的，这将产生一个截止。这些发现强调了闭合磁场结构在塑造太阳盘伽马射线发射中的至关重要作用。 <div>
The interpretation of gamma-ray emission originating from the solar disk (0.5° in angular size) as due to the interaction of Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) with the solar atmosphere has remained a central challenge in solar physics. After the seminal work by Seckel, Stanev, and Gaisser based on GCRs’ magnetic mirroring, discrepancies between models and observations persist, indicating the need for a novel approach. The present work focuses on exploring the impact of a closed magnetic field geometry in the low photosphere on the observed gamma-ray flux. We track numerically with the PLUTO code the trajectories of test-particle protons within a static ∼20 Mm scale height magnetic arcade adjacent to jets. By making use of numerical vertical density profiles, we inject particles at distinct chromospheric/photospheric altitudes, mimicking the migration of GCRs from neighboring flux tubes into closed arcades. Remarkably, our model reproduces a flat gamma-ray spectrum below ∼33 GeV, a nearly isotropic emission at ∼10 GeV, both consistent with Fermi-LAT observations, and a near-limb emission at ∼1 TeV. Our model can also reproduce the flux-drop detected by HAWC (∼1 TeV). Finally, we argue that the spectral dip observed at ∼40 GeV may result from the flux suppression at low energy due to the cross-field diffusion, which would produce a cutoff. These findings underscore the pivotal role of closed magnetic field structures in shaping the solar disk gamma-ray emission.

总结:
photometric 和 spectroscopic 观测显示了距离约 40 Mpc 的附近 Type Ia 超新星 SN 2023wrk。观测到超新星爆发后几小时内的早期检测，光变曲线在最初几天显示出一个颠簸特征，而 B − V 颜色呈蓝色并保持几乎恒定。光谱演化整体上与 SN 1991T/SN 1999aa 型 SN Ia 类似，而在最大光度后 t ≈ -15.4 天拍摄的第一张光谱中 C iiλ6580 吸收线显得异常强烈。这种碳特征在随后的演化中迅速消失，但在光度峰值左右再次出现。碳线的复杂演化以及最早光谱中可能检测到的4700 Å 和5300 Å周围的 Ni iii 吸收表明燃料和残余物质的宏观混合。强烈的碳线可能与 SN 释放物与无捆绑碳的碰撞有关，这与脉动延迟爆炸或碳富周围星际物质相互作用模型的预测一致。在这些最初时期具有强烈 C iiλ6580 吸收线的碳富 SNe Ia 中，C ii 和 Si ii 的线强比以及 B − V 颜色的演化显示出较大的多样性，这可能归因于不同性质的无捆绑碳和外向混合的 56Ni。 <div>
We present extensive photometric and spectroscopic observations of the nearby Type Ia supernova (SN) 2023wrk at a distance of about 40 Mpc. The earliest detection of this SN can be traced back to a few hours after the explosion. Within the first few days, the light curve shows a bump feature, while the B − V color is blue and remains nearly constant. The overall spectral evolution is similar to that of an SN 1991T/SN 1999aa-like SN Ia, while the C iiλ6580 absorption line appears to be unusually strong in the first spectrum taken at t ≈ −15.4 days after the maximum light. This carbon feature disappears quickly in subsequent evolution but it reappears at around the time of peak brightness. The complex evolution of the carbon line and the possible detection of Ni iii absorption around 4700 Å and 5300 Å in the earliest spectra indicate macroscopic mixing of fuel and ash. The strong carbon lines are likely related to the collision of SN ejecta with unbound carbon, consistent with the predictions of pulsational delayed-detonation or carbon-rich circumstellar-matter interaction models. Among those carbon-rich SNe Ia with strong C iiλ6580 absorption at very early times, the line-strength ratio of C ii to Si ii and the B − V color evolution are found to exhibit large diversity, which may be attributed to different properties of unbound carbon and outward-mixing 56Ni.

The Sloan Digital Sky Survey-IV/Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) Survey data provide an unprecedented opportunity to study the internal motions of galaxies and, in particular, represent the largest sample of barred galaxy kinematic maps obtained to date. We present results from Nirvana, our nonaxisymmetric kinematic modeling code built with a physically motivated Bayesian forward modeling approach, which decomposes MaNGA velocity fields into first- and second-order radial and tangential rotational modes in a generalized and minimally supervised fashion. We use Nirvana to produce models and rotation curves for 1263 unique barred MaNGA galaxies and a matched unbarred control sample. We present our modeling approach, tests of its efficacy, and validation against existing visual bar classifications. Nirvana finds elevated noncircular motions in galaxies identified as bars in imaging, and bar position angles that agree well with visual measurements. The Nirvana-MaNGA barred and control samples provide a new opportunity for studying the influence of nonaxisymmetric internal disk kinematics in a large statistical sample.

<div> 高红移、流动速度、星团形成、模拟、星系形成
<br />
在高红移（z ≳ 12）时，流动速度在低质量天体中明显影响星团形成，减少低质量气体天体的丰度，同时促进了超声速诱导的气体天体（SIGO）和其中的星团在暗物质暗流外的形成。研究了在带有和不带流动速度的一组模拟中，流动对星团在暗物质暗流及SIGO内的形成的群体级影响。结果显示，流动实际上增强了所有质量的单个暗流内的星团形成，在z = 12和z = 20之间。这表现为每个天体的增加的星团形成率，以及Kennicutt–Schmidt关系在有流动天体中的增强。模拟结果与一些高红移观测一致，但在群体级别上，相对于大部分观测，仍然低估了星团形成。模拟结果没有包括反馈，因此可以视为星团形成率的上限，加剧了这些差异。然而，超密度区域的模拟（有和无流动速度）与观测一致，为未来观测中提取关于超密度和流动速度信息的策略提供了参考。 
<br /><br />总结:在高红移时，流动速度显著影响星团的形成，尤其是减少了低质量气体天体的丰度。模拟结果显示流动实际上会增强暗流内星团的形成率，并且Kennicutt–Schmidt关系也会得到加强。然而，模拟结果在群体级别上仍然低估了星团形成率，这可能是由于模拟未考虑反馈效应所致。对于超密度区域的模拟结果与观测一致，为未来观测提取超密度和流动速度信息提供了策略。 <div>
At high redshifts (z ≳ 12), the relative velocity between baryons and dark matter (the so-called streaming velocity) significantly affects star formation in low-mass objects. Streaming substantially reduces the abundance of low-mass gas objects while simultaneously allowing for the formation of supersonically induced gas objects (SIGOs) and their associated star clusters outside of dark matter halos. Here, we present a study of the population-level effects of streaming on star formation within both halos and SIGOs in a set of simulations with and without streaming. Notably, we find that streaming actually enhances star formation within individual halos of all masses at redshifts between z = 12 and z = 20. This is demonstrated both as an increased star formation rate per object as well as an enhancement of the Kennicutt–Schmidt relation for objects with streaming. We find that our simulations are consistent with some observations at high redshift, but on a population level, they continue to underpredict star formation relative to the majority of observations. Notably, our simulations do not include feedback and so can be taken as an upper limit on the star formation rate, exacerbating these differences. However, simulations of overdense regions (both with and without streaming) agree with observations, suggesting a strategy for extracting information about the overdensity and streaming velocity in a given survey volume in future observations.

The central regions of the Milky Way constitute a unique laboratory for a wide swath of astrophysical studies; consequently, the inner ∼400 pc have been the target of numerous large surveys at all accessible wavelengths. In this paper, we present a catalog of sources at 25 and 37 μm located within all of the regions observed with the SOFIA/FORCAST instrument in the inner ∼200 pc of the Galaxy. The majority of the observations were obtained as part of the SOFIA Cycle 7 Galactic Center Legacy program survey, which was designed to complement the Spitzer/MIPS 24 μm catalog in regions saturated in the MIPS observations. Due to the wide variety of source types captured by our observations at 25 and 37 μm, we do not limit the FORCAST source catalog to unresolved point sources, or treat all sources as if they are pointlike sources. The catalog includes all detectable sources in the regions, resulting in a catalog of 950 sources, including point sources, compact sources, and extended sources. We also provide the user with metrics to discriminate between the source types.

Connecting these observed populations to the process of reionization requires understanding how efficiently they produce Lyman continuum (LyC) photons and what fraction (fesc) of these photons escape into the intergalactic medium. By applying the Cox proportional hazards model, a survival analysis technique, to the Low-redshift Lyman Continuum Survey (LzLCS), we develop new, empirical, multivariate predictions for fesc. The models developed from the LzLCS reproduce the observed fesc for z ∼ 3 samples, which suggests that LyC emitters may share similar properties at low and high redshift. Our best-performing models for the z ∼ 3 galaxies include information about dust attenuation, ionization, and/or morphology. We then apply these models to z ≳ 6 galaxies. For large photometric samples, we find a median predicted fesc = 0.047–0.14. For smaller spectroscopic samples, which may include stronger emission-line galaxies, we find that ≥33% of the galaxies have fesc > 0.2, and we identify several candidate extreme leakers with fesc ≥ 0.5. The current samples show no strong trend between predicted fesc and UV magnitude, but limited spectroscopic information makes this result uncertain. Multivariate predictions can give significantly different results from single-variable predictions, and the predicted fesc for high-redshift galaxies can differ significantly depending on whether star formation rate surface density or radius is used as a measure of galaxy morphology. We provide all parameters necessary to predict fesc for additional samples of high-redshift galaxies using these models.

<div> 关键词: 太阳耀斑, 监督机器学习, 特征分类, 非线性核, 分类准确度<br />
总结:<br />
本文介绍了一种使用监督机器学习来分类太阳耀斑的标准化程序。研究使用来自RHESSI任务的耀斑数据和来自HARPS-N仪器的太阳光谱进行训练，并发现表现最好的算法是具有非线性核（特别是径向基函数RBF）的C-支持向量分类（SVC）。最佳训练模型SVC与RBF核的平均综合准确度得分为0.65，对于无耀斑和弱耀斑类别的分类准确度得分分别超过0.70。测试表明该模型能够在不同特征和分布的全新数据中检测和分类太阳耀斑。未来的努力可以集中在提高分类准确度，探索替代模型的有效性（特别是深度学习模型），并加入更多数据集，以扩展该框架在宿主系外行星的恒星上的应用。 <div>
Flares are a well-studied aspect of the Sun’s magnetic activity. Detecting and classifying solar flares can inform the analysis of contamination caused by stellar flares in exoplanet transmission spectra. In this paper, we present a standardized procedure to classify solar flares with the aid of supervised machine learning. Using flare data from the RHESSI mission and solar spectra from the HARPS-N instrument, we trained several supervised machine-learning models, and found that the best-performing algorithm is C-Support Vector Classification (SVC) with nonlinear kernels, specifically radial basis functions (RBF). The best-trained model, SVC with RBF kernels, achieves an average aggregate accuracy score of 0.65, and categorical accuracy scores of over 0.70 for the no-flare and weak-flare classes, respectively. In comparison, a blind classification algorithm would have an accuracy score of 0.33. Testing showed that the model is able to detect and classify solar flares in entirely new data with different characteristics and distributions from those of the training set. Future efforts could focus on enhancing classification accuracy, investigating the efficacy of alternative models, particularly deep learning models, and incorporating more data sets to extend the application of this framework to stars that host exoplanets.

<div> 关键词：磁流体力学、离心盘、磁旋不稳定性、垂直重力、MHD湍流

总结：<br /><br />本研究探讨了垂直重力对离心磁旋不稳定性所激发的磁流体力学湍流的影响。与无垂直重力的离心盘类似，Maxwell应力与压力之比保持在10^-2左右，而Maxwell应力中的局部反转也持续存在。垂直重力引入了两种新效应：近近心点区域的垂直压缩加剧了重连和耗散，削弱了磁场。磁流体力学应力对角动量传输加速了密度分布的广度，在大约5到10轨道内使质量和离心率的空间分布发生了显著改变。离心碎片中的MHD应力可能在撕裂事件后1年以上的时间里产生辐射。 <div>
Previously we demonstrated that the magnetorotational instability (MRI) grows vigorously in eccentric disks, much as it does in circular disks, and we investigated the nonlinear development of the eccentric MRI without vertical gravity. Here we explore how vertical gravity influences the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence stirred by the eccentric MRI. Similar to eccentric disks without vertical gravity, the ratio of Maxwell stress to pressure, or the Shakura–Sunyaev α parameter, remains ∼10−2, and the local sign flip in the Maxwell stress persists. Vertical gravity also introduces two new effects. Strong vertical compression near pericenter amplifies reconnection and dissipation, weakening the magnetic field. Angular momentum transport by MHD stresses broadens the mass distribution over eccentricity at much faster rates than without vertical gravity; as a result, spatial distributions of mass and eccentricity can be substantially modified in just ∼5 to 10 orbits. MHD stresses in the eccentric debris of tidal disruption events may power emission ≳1 yr after disruption.

<div> 稳定性条件, 两星系统, 初始相互倾角, 椭圆轨道, 非共面配置<br />
<br />总结: 本研究推导了一个半解析的稳定性条件，适用于具有任意倾角的两星系统，其中内部行星是一个测试粒子。研究使用微扰理论计算了外伴对内部二进制的半长轴的特征分数变化β = δa1/a1，由此可以得出稳定性条件。研究发现，环形轨道下，逆行轨道一般比顺行轨道更稳定；中间相互倾角的系统由于von Ziepel–Lidov–Kozai (vZLK)动力学而不太稳定；平均运动共振可以通过抑制vZLK渐进过程来稳定相互倾角渐进不稳定的区域；共振可以破坏一些动力学稳定区域。这些稳定性条件还可用于约束观测系统的轨道特性和它们的年龄。 <div>
Multiple analytical, semi-analytical, and empirical stability criteria have been derived in the literature for two-planet systems. But, the dependence of the stability limit on the initial mutual inclination between the inner and outer orbits is not well modeled by previous stability criteria. Here, we derive a semi-analytical stability criteria for two-planet systems, at arbitrary inclinations, in which the inner planet is a test particle. Using perturbation theory we calculate the characteristic fractional change in the semimajor axis of the inner binary β = δa1/a1 caused by perturbations from the companion. Stability criteria can be derived by setting a threshold on β. Focusing initially on circular orbits, we derive an analytical expression for β for coplanar prograde and retrograde orbits. For noncoplanar configurations, we evaluate a semi-analytical expression. We then generalize to orbits with arbitrary eccentricities and account for the secular effects. Our analytical and semi-analytical results are in excellent agreement with direct N-body simulations. In addition, we show that contours of β ∼ 0.01 can serve as criteria for stability. More specifically, we show that (1) retrograde orbits are generally more stable than prograde ones; (2) systems with intermediate mutual inclination are less stable due to von Ziepel–Lidov–Kozai (vZLK) dynamics; and (3) mean motion resonances (MMRs) can stabilize intermediate inclination secularly unstable regions in phase space, by quenching vZLK secular processes (4) MMRs can destabilize some of the dynamically stable regions. We also point out that these stability criteria can be used to constrain the orbital properties of observed systems and their age.

<div> late-type T and Y dwarfs, spectral energy distributions, James Webb Space Telescope, infrared, bolometric fluxes

<br /><br />总结:
这篇文章利用詹姆斯·韦伯太空望远镜获取了23个晚型T和Y矮星的红外光谱能量分布。它包括NIRSpec PRISM和MIRI低分辨率光谱仪在λ/Δλ≈100处覆盖了1-12μm波长范围的光谱和15、18和21μm的宽带光度测量。它展示了这些对象常见的吸收特征，包括H2O、CH4、CO、CO2和NH3。文章中还计算出了冷棕矮星的首次准确的辐射通量，并通过Spitzer和哈勃空间望远镜的视差获得了这些冷矮星的首次准确辐射通量。同时使用Sonora Bobcat太阳金属丰度演化模型估计了矮星的半径，得出了有效温度估计，范围从∼1000到350K，中位误差为±20K，几乎比以前的工作提高了一个数量级。文章还讨论了光谱的各个部分在按有效温度排序时是不是都清晰地呈现出一个序列。 <div>
We present infrared spectral energy distributions of 23 late-type T and Y dwarfs obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope. The spectral energy distributions consist of NIRSpec PRISM and MIRI low-resolution spectrometer spectra covering the ∼1–12 μm wavelength range at λ/Δλ ≈ 100 and broadband photometry at 15, 18, and 21 μm. The spectra exhibit absorption features common to these objects including H2O, CH4, CO, CO2, and NH3. Interestingly, while the spectral morphology changes relatively smoothly with spectral type at λ < 3 μm and λ > 8 μm, it shows no clear trend in the 5 μm region where a large fraction of the flux emerges. The broad-wavelength coverage of the data enables us to compute the first accurate measurements of the bolometric fluxes of cool brown dwarfs. Combining these bolometric fluxes with parallaxes from Spitzer and Hubble Space Telescope, we also obtain the first accurate bolometric luminosities of these cool dwarfs. We then used the Sonora Bobcat solar-metallicity evolutionary models to estimate the radii of the dwarfs, which results in effective temperature estimates ranging from ∼1000 to 350 K with a median uncertainty of ± 20 K, which is nearly an order of magnitude improvement over previous work. We also discuss how various portions of the spectra either do or do not exhibit a clear sequence when ordered by their effective temperatures.

<div> Gaia Data Release 3, ultra-cool dwarfs, TESS light curves, rotation signatures, color-magnitude diagram<br />
总结:<br />
本研究通过对250颗Gaia Data Release 3超冷矮星（UCDs）进行TESS光变曲线（LCs）的搜索，发现了61颗具有明显周期性和单一行为的旋转标志。另外，还发现了5颗具有双峰特征的UCDs，以及20颗LCs显示出复杂行为。通过颜色-星等图的分布，发现了两个不同的UCD旋转分布模式，表明旋转速度和年龄有关。这一研究结果为未来的研究提供了重要参考，但是样本分隔引起的物理趋势还需要进一步验证。 <div>
This study presents the results of a search for rotation signatures in 250 Gaia Data Release 3 ultra-cool dwarfs (UCDs) with TESS light curves (LCs). We identified 71 targets with unambiguous periodicities, of which 61 present rotation signatures and a single-source behavior, with periods between 0.133 and 5.81 days. Five UCDs show double-dip features, namely variations with two periods, one approximately double or half the other. The remaining 10 UCDs with unambiguous variability present a likely nonsingle behavior. We also found 20 UCDs showing complex behavior in their LCs, with noticeable fluctuations and irregular structure, with a few exhibiting apparent changes in their temporal structure. The remaining 159 targets show noisy LCs corresponding to low-amplitude signals, whose temporal variation cannot be easily identified. The distribution of the UCDs with rotation signature in a color–magnitude diagram points to a lack of rotating objects within about 11.5 < MG < 12.5 and G–GRP < 1.5, separating them into two regimes, one mainly composed of less massive late-M stars with Prot ≥ 1.0 day, and another mainly composed of more massive early-M stars with Prot < 1.0 day. It is important to emphasize that by separating stars into age intervals, one observes that UCDs with Prot ≥ 1.0 day tend to be located in regions of younger objects, and, in contrast, those with Prot < 1.0 day are mainly concentrated in regions of older objects. Whether this trend of stars contrasting the sample separation is physical or produced by observational biases is a question to be verified in future studies.

<div> 关键词: 超新星遗迹，电子加速，同步辐射，尘埃密集介质，X射线辐射

总结: 
本研究对Kepler超新星遗迹中的电子加速现象进行了分析。研究表明，在遗迹的北部壳层，电子加速受到周围尘埃密集介质的影响而得到提升。通过对X射线辐射的观测和分析，发现在大多数的细丝结构中，电子加速效率受到了复杂的影响，但在一个特定区域中，电子加速时间超出了同步辐射的时间，导致了非热X射线辐射的明显减弱。这些发现为我们提供了对Kepler超新星遗迹中电子加速现象的深入理解。 <div>
The maximum energy of electrons in supernova remnant (SNR) shocks is typically limited by radiative losses, where the synchrotron cooling time equals the acceleration time. The low speed of shocks in a dense medium increases the acceleration time, leading to lower maximum electron energies and fainter X-ray emissions. However, in Kepler’s SNR, an enhanced electron acceleration, which proceeds close to the Bohm limit, occurs in the north of its shell, where the shock is slowed by a dense circumstellar medium (CSM). To investigate whether this scenario still holds at smaller scales, we analyzed the temporal evolution of the X-ray synchrotron flux in filamentary structures using the two deepest Chandra/ACIS X-ray observations, performed in 2006 and 2014. We examined spectra from different filaments, measured their proper motion, and calculated the acceleration to synchrotron timescale ratios. The interaction with the turbulent and dense northern CSM induces competing effects on electron acceleration: on one hand, turbulence reduces the electron mean free path enhancing the acceleration efficiency, and on the other hand, lower shock velocities increase the acceleration timescale. In most filaments, these effects compensate each other, but in one region, the acceleration timescale exceeds the synchrotron timescale, resulting in a significant decrease in nonthermal X-ray emission from 2006 to 2014, indicating fading synchrotron emission. Our findings provide a coherent understanding of the different regimes of electron acceleration observed in Kepler’s SNR through various diagnostics.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了∼L*星系周围的暖热气体的特性，通过高度电离金属的吸收线进行研究。通过在质量约为∼1012和∼1013M☉的晕内进行宇宙学的局部缩放模拟，来预测Ne viii的柱密度。研究发现在∼1012M☉晕内，Ne viii追踪填充体积、维里温度的气体。在∼1013M☉晕内，Ne viii气体更为凝聚，并倾向于处于暖-热相的较冷部分。研究还将模拟结果与COS吸收调查和COS紫外线重子调查的观测进行了对比。同时，文章强调了从恒星质量推断晕质量时考虑到恒星质量-晕质量关系的离散度是很重要的。总体而言，模拟结果与观测结果基本一致，但模拟可能低估了离散度。这些结果对模拟提供了有价值的限制条件，有助于更准确地预测星系的性质。 <div>
The properties of warm-hot gas around ∼L* galaxies can be studied with absorption lines from highly ionized metals. We predict Ne viii column densities from cosmological zoom-in simulations of halos with masses in ∼1012 and ∼1013M☉ from the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) project. Ne viii traces the volume-filling, virial-temperature gas in ∼1012M☉ halos. In ∼1013M☉ halos the Ne viii gas is clumpier, and biased toward the cooler part of the warm-hot phase. We compare the simulations to observations from the COS Absorption Survey of Baryon Harbors (or CASBaH) and COS Ultraviolet Baryon Survey (or CUBS). We show that when inferring halo masses from stellar masses to compare simulated and observed halos, it is important to account for the scatter in the stellar-mass–halo-mass relation, especially at M⋆ ≳ 1010.5M☉. Median Ne viii columns in the fiducial FIRE-2 model are about as high as observed upper limits allow, while the simulations analyzed do not reproduce the highest observed columns. This suggests that the median Ne viii profiles predicted by the simulations are consistent with observations, but that the simulations may underpredict the scatter. We find similar agreement with analytical models that assume a product of the halo gas fraction and metallicity (relative to solar) ∼0.1, indicating that observations are consistent with plausible circumgalactic medium temperatures, metallicities, and gas masses. Variants of the FIRE simulations with a modified supernova feedback model and/or active galactic nuclei feedback included (as well as some other cosmological simulations from the literature) more systematically underpredict Ne viii columns. The circumgalactic Ne viii observations therefore provide valuable constraints on simulations that otherwise predict realistic galaxy properties.

We present a detailed study of three-dimensional (3D) thermodynamic structures of the intracluster medium (ICM) across edges in the X-ray surface brightness of four massive, bright, dynamically active galaxy clusters (A3667, A2319, A520, and A2146), with the Chandra X-ray Observatory. Based on a forward modeling approach developed in previous work, we extend this approach with more generalized ICM density and temperature profiles, allowing us to apply uniformly to the observed X-ray surface brightness profiles to detect edges and measure the 3D thermodynamic profiles of the ICM simultaneously and self-consistently. With the forward modeling analysis, we find, in agreement with previous works, that the obtained 3D thermodynamic structures of the ICM across the edges in A3667 and A2319 are consistent with the characteristics of cold fronts, whereas those in A520 and A2146 are consistent with the nature of shock fronts. We find that the azimuthal distribution of the pressure ratio at the cold front in A3667 shows a different trend from that in A2319. For the shock fronts in A520 and A2146, the observed 3D temperature profiles of the ICM indicate that the temperature is highest at the position of the shock front. In the case of the sector exhibiting in A520, the ICM temperature appears isothermal with a temperature of ∼10 keV until ∼300 kpc away from the shock front in the post-shock region, being consistent with the hypothesis of the instant-equilibration model for shock heating.

We present a systematic search for tidal disruption events (TDEs) using radio data from the Variables and Slow Transients (VAST) Pilot Survey conducted using the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder. Historically, TDEs have been identified using observations at X-ray, optical, and ultraviolet wavelengths. After discovery, a few dozen TDEs have been shown to have radio counterparts through follow-up observations. With systematic time-domain radio surveys becoming available, we can now identify new TDEs in the radio regime. A population of radio-discovered TDEs has the potential to provide several key insights including an independent constraint on their volumetric rate. We conducted a search to select variable radio sources with a single prominent radio flare and a position consistent within 2σ of the nucleus of a known galaxy. While TDEs were the primary target of our search, sources identified in this search may also be consistent with active galactic nuclei exhibiting unusual flux density changes at the timescales probed, uncharacteristically bright supernovae, or a population of gamma-ray bursts. We identify a sample of 12 radio-bright candidate TDEs. The timescales and luminosities range from ∼6 to 230 days and ∼1038 to 1041 erg s−1, respectively, consistent with models of radio emission from TDEs that launch relativistic jets. After calculating the detection efficiency of our search using a Monte Carlo simulation of TDEs, and assuming all 12 sources are jetted TDEs, we derive a volumetric rate for jetted TDEs of Gpc−3 yr−1, consistent with previous empirically estimated rates.

The excess broadening of high-temperature spectral lines, long observed near the tops of flare arcades, is widely considered to result from magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. According to different theories, plasma turbulence is also believed to be a candidate mechanism for particle acceleration during solar flares. However, the degree to which this broadening is connected to the acceleration of nonthermal electrons remains largely unexplored outside of recent work, and many observations have been limited by limited spatial resolution and cadence. Using the Interface Region Imaging Spectrometer, we present spatially resolved observations of loop-top (LT) broadenings using hot (≈11 MK) Fe xxi 1354.1 Å line emission at ≈9 s cadence during the 2022 March 30 X1.3 flare. We find nonthermal velocities upward of 65 km s−1 that decay linearly with time, indicating the presence and subsequent dissipation of plasma turbulence. Moreover, the initial Fe xxi signal was found to be cospatial and cotemporal with microwave emission measured by the Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array, placing a population of nonthermal electrons in the same region as the LT turbulence. Evidence of electron acceleration at this time is further supported by hard X-ray measurements from the Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays on board Solar Orbiter. Using the decay of nonthermal broadenings as a proxy for turbulent dissipation, we found the rate of energy dissipation to be consistent with the power of nonthermal electrons deposited into the chromosphere, suggesting a possible connection between turbulence and electron acceleration.

JWST spectroscopy has revolutionized our understanding of galaxies in the early Universe. Covering wavelengths up to 5.3 μm, NIRSpec can detect rest-frame optical Hα emission lines out to z = 7 and [O iii] to z = 9.5. Observing these lines in more distant galaxies requires longer wavelength spectroscopy with MIRI. Here we present MIRI Medium Resolution Spectrograph integral field unit observations of the lensed galaxy merger MACS0647–JD at z = 10.165. With exposure times of 4.2 hr in each of two bands (SHORT and LONG), we detect Hα at 9σ, [O iii] λ5008 at 11σ, and [O iii] λ4960 at 3σ. Combined with previously reported NIRSpec spectroscopy that yielded seven emission lines including the auroral line [O iii] λ4363, we present the first direct metallicity measurement of a z > 10 galaxy: , or . This is similar to galaxies at z ∼ 4–9 with direct metallicity measurements, though higher than expected given the high specific star formation rate log(sSFR/yr−1) = −7.4 ± 0.3. We further constrain the ionization parameter = −1.9 ± 0.1, ionizing photon production efficiency log(ξion) = 25.3 ± 0.1, and SFR = 5.0 ± 0.6 M⊙ yr−1 within the past 10 Myr. These observations demonstrate the combined power of JWST NIRSpec and MIRI for studying galaxies in the first 500 million years.

总结: 本研究使用了独立的放大测量来补充并验证了剪切的引力透镜效应。研究开发了一种新方法，可以准确而稳健地测量BOSS CMASS星系周围的放大效应。研究通过对深度DECaLS光度目录中受CMASS星系引力透镜的源星系的过量总荧光密度进行测量，并利用更深的光度样本建立了δμ–δM关系，进而将过量总荧光密度转换为放大效应μ。研究发现了CMASS星系周围介星介质中的陡峭尘埃衰减曲线及其径向分布，同时通过对比三个光学波段（grz）的放大测量，限制了尘埃衰减曲线。此外，对比尘埃校正的放大测量和不同宇宙学模型的模拟预测，发现了小尺度上的放大信号超出了模拟，这对暗物质性质和星系形成过程有重要影响。对此潜在的小尺度差异的影响进行了讨论。<br /><br />总结: <div>
Magnification serves as an independent and complementary gravitational lensing measurement to shear. We develop a novel method to achieve an accurate and robust magnification measurement around BOSS CMASS galaxies across physical scales of 0.016h−1 Mpc < rp < 10h−1 Mpc. We first measure the excess total flux density δM of the source galaxies in the deep DECaLS photometric catalog that are lensed by CMASS galaxies. We convert δM to magnification μ by establishing the δμ–δM relation using a deeper photometric sample. By comparing magnification measurements in three optical bands (grz), we constrain the dust attenuation curve and its radial distribution, discovering a steep attenuation curve in the circumgalactic medium of CMASS galaxies. We further compare dust-corrected magnification measurements to model predictions from high-resolution dark matter-only (DMO) simulations in Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) and Planck cosmologies, as well as the hydrodynamic simulation TNG300-1, using precise galaxy–halo connections from the Photometric objects Around Cosmic webs method and the accurate ray-tracing algorithm P3MLens. For rp > 70h−1 kpc, our magnification measurements are in good agreement with both WMAP and Planck cosmologies, resulting in an estimation of the matter fluctuation amplitude of S8 = 0.816 ± 0.024. However, at rp < 70h−1 kpc, we observe an excess magnification signal, which is higher than the DMO model in Planck cosmology at 2.8σ and would be exacerbated if significant baryon feedback is included. Implications of the potential small scale discrepancy for the nature of dark matter and for the processes governing galaxy formation are discussed.

<div> EMRI, gravitational-wave radiation, gaseous accretion disk, star-disk collisions, quasiperiodic eruption

总结:
本文研究了在星系核心中，一小部分星体向中心的超大质量黑洞运动，其轨道呈现低偏心率，被引力波辐射驱动。在这种缓慢的螺旋吸积过程中，很可能会形成一个气态吸积盘。如果这期间发生了恒星和盘的碰撞，就会产生符合观测到的准周期性喷发现象的短暂耀斑。研究者建立了星-盘耦合演化的模型，自洽地考虑了从恒星碰撞和相关物质剥离进入盘中所注入的质量和热能。对于弱碰撞/剥离加热，盘具有热不稳定性，并且经历极限循环振荡，从而调制其性质，并导致持续数年到数十年的以太循环发作。强烈的碰撞/剥离加热则稳定了盘，使其以接近EMRI剥离速率的大致恒定速率进行吸积。无论哪种情况，通过剥离的恒星破坏时间，因此最大的QPE寿命，大约是102到103年，远远长于TDE后的回流吸积。QPE源的平静吸积盘在目前阶段可能是自持续的，主要由EMRI剥离提供。实际上，观测到的长期变化范围与碰撞提供的盘预测相当。QPE重现模式的改变，类似于在GSN 069中观察到的，可能是由于在状态转换后EMRI供盘和SMBH赤道面之间暂时的错位所引起的。 <div>
A modest fraction of the stars in galactic nuclei fed toward the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) approach on low-eccentricity orbits driven by gravitational-wave radiation (extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI)). In the likely event that a gaseous accretion disk is created in the nucleus during this slow inspiral (e.g., via an independent tidal disruption event (TDE)), star–disk collisions generate regular short-lived flares consistent with the observed quasiperiodic eruption (QPE) sources. We present a model for the coupled star-disk evolution, which self-consistently accounts for mass and thermal energy injected into the disk from stellar collisions and associated mass ablation. For weak collision/ablation heating, the disk is thermally unstable and undergoes limit-cycle oscillations, which modulate its properties and lead to accretion-powered outbursts on timescales of years to decades, with a time-averaged accretion rate ∼0.1Ṁ Edd. Stronger collision/ablation heating acts to stabilize the disk, enabling roughly steady accretion at the EMRI-stripping rate. In either case, the stellar destruction time through ablation, and hence the maximum QPE lifetime, is ∼102–103 yr, far longer than fallback accretion after a TDE. The quiescent accretion disks in QPE sources may at the present epoch be self-sustaining and fed primarily by EMRI ablation. Indeed, the observed range of secular variability broadly matches those predicted for collision-fed disks. Changes in the QPE recurrence pattern following such outbursts, similar to that observed in GSN 069, could arise from temporary misalignment between the EMRI-fed disk and the SMBH equatorial plane as the former regrows its mass after a state transition.

<div> NGC 315, magnetic field strength, jet, black hole, magnetohydrodynamic model
<br /><br />总结:
本文研究了NGC 315射流中的磁场强度。首先，通过比较NGC 315的测量速度剖面与Tomimatsu和Takahashi提出的磁流体力学射流模型，估计了射流磁层中的角速度。类似于M87，我们发现该模型可以重现速度剖面的对数特征，并建议NGC 315具有一个缓慢旋转的黑洞磁层。通过将估计的ΩF代入Blandford-Znajek机制预测的射流功率中，我们估计了中心黑洞事件视界附近的磁场强度为5×10^3 G≲ BH ≲2×10^4 G。然后，通过比较通过长基线干涉测量（VLBI）观测获得的光谱指数分布与一个同步辐射射流模型，我们估计了射流中的磁场强度。然后，我们限制了离黑洞的去投影距离z的磁场强度在5.2×10^3 rg≲z≲4.9×10^4 rg范围内为0.06 G≲B(z)≲0.9 G，其中rg代表引力半径。通过结合事件视界和射流下游部分的获得的磁场强度，我们发现射流基部的吸积流与磁场阻滞盘一致。我们讨论了NGC 315和M87中射流功率和事件视界上锚定的磁通量的比较。 <div>
We study magnetic field strengths along the jet in NGC 315. First, we estimated the angular velocity of rotation in the jet magnetosphere by comparing the measured velocity profile of NGC 315 with the magnetohydrodynamic jet model proposed by Tomimatsu and Takahashi. Similar to the case of M87, we find that the model can reproduce the logarithmic feature of the velocity profile and suggest a slowly rotating black hole magnetosphere for NGC 315. By substituting the estimated ΩF into the jet power predicted by the Blandford–Znajek mechanism, we estimate the magnetic field strength near the event horizon of the central black hole as 5 × 103 G ≲ BH ≲ 2 × 104 G. We then estimate magnetic field strengths along the jet by comparing the spectral index distribution obtained from very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations with a synchrotron-emitting jet model. Then we constrain the magnetic field strength at a deprojected distance z from the black hole to be in the range 0.06 G ≲ B(z) ≲ 0.9 G for 5.2 × 103rg ≲ z ≲ 4.9 × 104rg, where rg represents the gravitational radius. By combining the obtained field strengths at the event horizon and the downstream section of the jet, we find that the accretion flow at the jet base is consistent with a magnetically arrested disk. We discuss a comparison of the jet power and the magnetic flux anchored to the event horizon in NGC 315 and M87.

<div> 关键词: 单光纤光谱学, 积分场光谱单元, 星系光谱, SF和NonSF成分, BPT图谱

总结:<br /><br />本文介绍了传统的单光纤光谱学在参数估计中可能存在的精度问题，以及积分场光谱单元（IFU）调查对减少污染的解决方案。通过使用从Apache Point Observatory IFU调查获得的见解，研究引入了一个新颖的模型，可以将星系光谱分解为SF和NonSF成分。将这一模型应用到Sloan Digital Sky Survey的数据集中，产生了两个独立的光谱。然后将这些分解后的光谱可视化在Baldwin、Phillips和Terlevich（BPT）图上，发现了有趣的模式。在BPT图上出现了非常显著的NonSF分解光谱的位置偏移，以及出现了两个明显的聚类。这一偏移突出了SF“污染”在影响NonSF光谱在BPT图上的位置上所扮演的关键角色。 <div>
Traditional single-fiber spectroscopy provides a single galaxy spectrum, forming the basis for crucial parameter estimation. However, its accuracy can be compromised by various sources of contamination, such as the prominent Hα emission line originating from both star-forming (SF) regions and non-star-forming (NonSF) regions, including active galactic nuclei. The potential to dissect a spectrum into its SF and NonSF constituents holds the promise of significantly enhancing precision in parameter estimates. In contrast, integral field unit (IFU) surveys present a solution to minimize contamination. These surveys examine spatially localized regions within galaxies, reducing the impact of mixed sources. Although an IFU survey’s resulting spectrum covers a smaller region of a galaxy than single-fiber spectroscopy, it can still encompass a blend of heterogeneous sources. Our study introduces an innovative model informed by insights from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory IFU survey. This model enables the decomposition of galaxy spectra, including those from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, into SF and NonSF components. Applying our model to these survey data sets produces two distinct spectra, one for SF and another for NonSF components, while conserving flux across wavelength bins. When these decomposed spectra are visualized on a Baldwin, Phillips, and Terlevich (BPT) diagram, interesting patterns emerge. There is a significant shift in the placement of the NonSF decomposed spectra, as well as the emergence of two distinct clusters in the Low-ionization Nuclear Emission-line Region and the Seyfert region. This shift highlights the key role of SF “contamination” in influencing the positioning of NonSF spectra within the BPT diagram.

这篇论文研究了利用Murriyang 64 m CSIRO Parkes射电望远镜进行的9.6年毫秒脉冲星观测的最新仪器校准技术对到达时间精度的影响。研究集中在对25颗高优先级的脉冲星进行的21厘米观测，采用测量方程模板匹配（METM）进行仪器校准，矩阵模板匹配（MTM）进行到达时间估计，结果表明，与使用标量模板匹配和基于理想馈源假设的传统校准得到的到达时间相比，时间残差显著改善，白噪声降低了长达六倍。白噪声的中位相对降低值为33％，最大绝对降低值为4.5微秒。对于PSR J0437−4715，METM和MTM降低了到达时间残余中红噪声的最佳拟合幂律振幅（2.7σ）和谱指数（1.7σ），这可以暂时解释为减轻了由于未建模的偏振响应步骤而产生的1/f噪声。这些发现表明，通过更准确的仪器校准和到达时间估计方法，可以直接提高脉冲星定时阵列实验的灵敏度。<br /><br />总结: 这篇简报对使用先进的仪器校准技术对毫秒脉冲星的观测进行了研究。通过测量方程模板匹配和矩阵模板匹配，能显著改善到达时间的精度，并大幅降低白噪声，进而提高脉冲星定时阵列实验的灵敏度。 <div>
This paper demonstrates the impact of state-of-the-art instrumental calibration techniques on the precision of arrival times obtained from 9.6 yr of observations of millisecond pulsars using the Murriyang 64 m CSIRO Parkes Radio Telescope. Our study focuses on 21 cm observations of 25 high-priority pulsars that are regularly observed as part of the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array project, including those predicted to be the most susceptible to calibration errors. We employ measurement equation template matching (METM) for instrumental calibration and matrix template matching (MTM) for arrival time estimation, resulting in significantly improved timing residuals with up to a sixfold reduction in white noise compared to arrival times estimated using scalar template matching and conventional calibration based on the ideal feed assumption. The median relative reduction in white noise is 33%, and the maximum absolute reduction is 4.5 μs. For PSR J0437−4715, METM and MTM reduce the best-fit power-law amplitude (2.7σ) and spectral index (1.7σ) of the red noise in the arrival time residuals, which can be tentatively interpreted as mitigation of 1/f noise due to otherwise unmodeled steps in polarimetric response. These findings demonstrate the potential to directly enhance the sensitivity of pulsar timing array experiments through more accurate methods of instrumental calibration and arrival time estimation.

<br /><br />总结:
18O(p, α)15N反应对19F、18O和15N等重要同位素的丰度有着重要影响。天体巨星产生的光谱或陨石颗粒中观察到这些核素的异常丰度，而18O(p, α)15N反应可能有助于解释观测结果与模型预测之间的差异。研究通过综合考虑其他反应通道的约束条件，特别是首次纳入了15N+α散射数据进行了对18O(p, α)15N反应的全面R-矩阵分析。所有可用数据被编制并用于R-矩阵分析。拟合得到的共振参数与先前的研究进行了比较。基于目前的拟合参数，提取出了修订后的反应速率确定。然后通过蒙特卡罗分析获得了相应反应速率的不确定性。 <div>
The 18O(p, α)15N reaction is of particular importance for influencing the abundances of key isotopes such as 19F, 18O, and 15N. Peculiar abundances for these nuclei are observed from spectra or meteorite grains originating in asymptotic giant branch stars. The 18O(p, α)15N could provide a way to explain the discrepancy between the observations and model predictions. A comprehensive R-matrix analysis has been performed for the 18O(p, α)15N reaction by including additional constraints from other reaction channels; in particular, the 15N+α scattering data were involved in the analysis for the first time. All available data were compiled and used in the R-matrix analysis. The fitted resonance parameters are compared with previous works. A revised determination of reaction rate has been extracted, relying on the present fitting parameters. The uncertainties on the corresponding reaction rates were then obtained by a Monte Carlo analysis.

本研究对IGR J17091–3624在2022年的爆发期间进行了详细的相位分析，发现软X射线闪耀在峰值相位存在∼15σ的高能量缺失。同时，光谱分析显示，盘温度和流量与计数率呈现显著的同步变化，暗示着闪耀主要由于黑洞周围的不稳定引起，这与之前对GRS 1915+105的研究结果一致。然而，我们观察到盘温度和流量之间存在正相关关系，这与Class ρ变化中发现的参数之间的环路关系不同，这可能暗示着两种变化类别之间的物理过程存在差异。此外，在闪耀期间还观察到Compton散射组件的变化：电子温度和覆盖分数与盘流量呈反相关，显示出盘和顶盖之间潜在的相互作用。 <div>
IGR J17091–3624, in addition to GRS 1915 + 105, is the only black hole X-ray binary that displays “heartbeat”-like variability, characterized by structured flares with high amplitudes. In this study, we conduct a detailed phase-resolved analysis of the recently identified “heartbeat”-like Class X variability in IGR J17091–3624 during its 2022 outburst, utilizing data from NICER and NuSTAR observations. A shortage in the high-energy (>20 keV) X-ray flux is detected at peak phases of the soft-X-ray flare at a ∼15σ confidence level from the phase-folded light curves. Furthermore, our phase-resolved spectral analysis reveals variations in the spectral shape, particularly showing significant synchronous variations in the disk temperature and flux with the count rate. These findings imply that the flare is primarily driven by instabilities within the accretion disk, consistent with previous studies of the well-known Class ρ variability in GRS 1915+105. However, we also observe a positive correlation between the disk temperature and flux over the flare cycle, which differs from the loop relation between the two parameters found in the Class ρ variability. This could suggest differences in the underlying physical processes between the two variability classes. Variations in the Comptonization component during flares are also observed: the electron temperature and covering fraction show anticorrelations with the disk flux, revealing potential interactions between the accretion disk and the corona during these flares.

这篇文章研究了四颗环绕M矮星的系外行星，即TOI-1685, GJ 436, GJ 3470, 和 TOI-2445，并使用Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV APOGEE调查的高分辨率近红外光谱进行了详细的恒星参数和元素丰度分析。从28颗M矮星的分析结果中发现，环绕系外行星的M矮星表现出略高的C/O丰度比，表明这些M矮星可能更适合于观测地球类和超地球行星的大气。此外，通过C/Mg、Si/Mg、Al/Mg和Fe/Mg的丰度比，确定了TOI-2445 b的质量，并发现其密度和核心质量分数与地球非常相似。文章还提供了M矮星在H波段的113条明确定义的光谱线图谱和各种不确定性的综合评估。 <br /><br />总结: <div>
Exoplanets hosting M dwarfs are the best targets to characterize Earth-like or super-Earth planetary atmospheres with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We determine detailed stellar parameters (Teff, logg, and ξ) and individual abundances of 12 elements for four cool M dwarfs hosting exoplanets TOI-1685, GJ 436, GJ 3470, and TOI-2445, scheduled for future observations by the JWST. The analysis utilizes high-resolution near-infrared spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV APOGEE survey between 1.51 and 1.69 μm. Based on 1D LTE plane-parallel models, we find that TOI-2445 is slightly metal poor ([Fe/H] = −0.16 ± 0.09 dex), while TOI-1685, GJ 436, and GJ 3470 are more metal rich ([Fe/H] = 0.06 ± 0.18, 0.10 ± 0.20, and 0.25 ± 0.15 dex, respectively). The derived C/O ratios for TOI-2445, TOI-1685, GJ 436, and GJ 3470 are 0.526 ± 0.027, 0.558 ± 0.097, 0.561 ± 0.029, and 0.638 ± 0.015, respectively. From the results for 28 M dwarfs analyzed homogeneously from Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) spectra, we find exoplanet-hosting M dwarfs exhibit a C/O abundance ratio approximately 0.01–0.05 higher than those with nondetected exoplanets, at limits of a statistically significant offset. A linear regression of the [Fe/H] versus C/O distribution reveals a noticeable difference in the angular coefficient between FGK dwarfs (0.27) and M dwarfs (0.13). Assuming our abundance ratios of Ca/Mg, Si/Mg, Al/Mg, and Fe/Mg, we determine a mass of M⊕ for TOI-2445 b, which has a density (6.793 g cm−3) and core mass fraction (0.329 ) very similar to Earth’s. We also present an atlas of 113 well-defined spectral lines to analyze M dwarfs in the H band and a comprehensive evaluation of uncertainties from variations in the atmospheric parameters, signal-to-noise ratio, and pseudocontinuum.

通过对弥散的北方扩展毫米阵列天文台观测CH3OH和CH3CN进行分析，研究人员发现这两种分子在中等质量原恒星周围的原行星盘中的空间分布不同。CH3OH和CH3CN的旋转图表分析表明，它们具有不同的旋转温度，分别为198 ± 1.2 K和448 ± 19 K，这暗示着它们的空间分布不同。进一步的3D LTE辐射传输模型表明，CH3OH的空间分布均匀，且丰度为4×10−8。相比之下，CH3CN的空间分布要么更加紧凑（在∼120 au内），要么在内∼55 au的地方丰度增加了≳15倍。这种CH3OH和CH3CN空间丰度分布差异的可能解释是碳颗粒的升华。 <br /><br />总结:CH3OH和CH3CN的旋转温度不同，表明它们在原行星盘中的空间分布不同；CH3OH的空间分布均匀，丰度为4×10−8；相比之下，CH3CN的空间分布要么更加紧凑，要么在内∼55 au的地方丰度增加了≳15倍；这种差异可能是由碳颗粒的升华引起的。 <div>
Observations of low-mass protostellar systems show evidence of rich, complex organic chemistry. Their low luminosity, however, makes determining abundance distributions of complex organic molecules within the water snowline challenging. However, the excitation conditions sampled by differing molecular distributions may produce substantive changes in the resulting emission. Thus, molecular excitation may recover spatial information from spatially unresolved data. By analyzing spatially unresolved NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array observations of CH3OH and CH3CN, we aim to determine if CH3OH and CH3CN are distributed differently in the protostellar disk around HOPS-370, a highly luminous intermediate-mass protostar. Rotational diagram analysis of CH3OH and CH3CN yields rotational temperatures of 198 ± 1.2 K and 448 ± 19 K, respectively, suggesting the two molecules have different spatial distributions. Source-specific 3D LTE radiative transfer models are used to constrain the spatial distribution of CH3OH and CH3CN within the disk. A uniform distribution with an abundance of 4 × 10−8 reproduces the CH3OH observations. In contrast, the spatial distribution of CH3CN needs to be either more compact (within ∼120 au versus ∼240 au for CH3OH) or exhibit a factor of ≳15 increase in abundance in the inner ∼55 au. A possible explanation for the difference in spatial abundance distributions of CH3OH and CH3CN is carbon-grain sublimation.

Abell 514 (A514) at z = 0.071 is an intriguing merging system exhibiting highly elongated (∼1 Mpc) X-ray features and three large-scale (300 ∼ 500 kpc) bent radio jets. To dissect this system with its multiwavelength data, it is critical to robustly identify and quantify its dark matter substructures. We present a weak-lensing analysis of A514 using deep Magellan/Megacam observations. Combining two optical band filter imaging data obtained under optimal seeing (∼0.″6) and leveraging the proximity of A514, we achieve a high source density of or ∼6940 Mpc−2, which enables high-resolution mass reconstruction. We unveil the complex dark matter substructures of A514, which are characterized by the NW and SE subclusters separated by ∼0.7 Mpc, each exhibiting a bimodal mass distribution. The total mass of the NW subcluster is estimated to be and is further resolved into the eastern ( and western ( ) components. The mass of the SE subcluster is , which is also further resolved into the northern ( ) and southern ( ) components. These four substructures coincide with the A514 brightest galaxies and are detected with significances ranging from 3.3σ to 4.7σ. Comparison of the dark matter substructures with the X-ray distribution suggests that A514 might have experienced an off-axis collision, and the NW and SE subclusters are currently near their apocenters.

总结: 
本文报道了对太阳日冕的超高分辨率观测，发现了持续约20小时的等离子体/电流层以及太阳日冕中的准周期磁重联现象。研究观察到的电流层出现在一个风扇-脊拓扑结构的无故障点附近，并持续存在。这个电流层的长度约为6″，宽度约2″，等离子体温度约为10-20MK。研究还观察到在磁重联点/电流层处有准周期的等离子体流入和流出。此外，长时间的准周期磁重联产生了反复爆发 (小型耀斑和喷流)，并对活跃区域的脉冲加热产生了显著影响。这些前所未有的观察为太阳耀斑通用模型（即断层模型）提供了有力证据，并对活跃区域通过无故障点附近的反复磁重联产生脉冲加热有重要意义。这条持续约20小时的断层电流层上的延续和持续磁重联为太阳日冕的动力学和能量释放过程提供了新的见解。 <br /><br /> <div>
Magnetic reconnection is widely believed to be the fundamental process in the solar atmosphere that underlies magnetic energy release and particle acceleration. This process is responsible for the onset of solar flares, coronal mass ejections, and other explosive events (e.g., jets). Here, we report direct imaging of a prolonged plasma/current sheet along with quasiperiodic magnetic reconnection in the solar corona using ultra-high-resolution observations from the 1.6 m Goode Solar Telescope at the Big Bear Solar Observatory and the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly. The current sheet appeared near a null point in the fan–spine topology and persisted over an extended period (≈20 hr). The length and apparent width of the current sheet were about 6″ and 2″, respectively, and the plasma temperature was ≈10–20 MK. We observed quasiperiodic plasma inflows and outflows (bidirectional jets with plasmoids) at the reconnection site/current sheet. Furthermore, quasiperiodic reconnection at the long-lasting current sheet produced recurrent eruptions (small flares and jets) and contributed significantly to the recurrent impulsive heating of the active region. Direct imaging of a plasma/current sheet and recurrent null-point reconnection for such an extended period has not been reported previously. These unprecedented observations provide compelling evidence that supports the universal model for solar eruptions (i.e., the breakout model) and have implications for impulsive heating of active regions by recurrent reconnection near null points. The prolonged and sustained reconnection for about 20 hr at the breakout current sheet provides new insights into the dynamics and energy release processes in the solar corona.

The neutrino-driven wind cooling phase of proto-neutron stars (PNSs) follows successful supernovae. Wind models without magnetic fields or rotation fail to achieve the necessary conditions for production of the third r-process peak, but robustly produce a weak r-process in neutron-rich winds. Using 2D magnetohydrodynamic simulations with magnetar-strength magnetic fields and rotation, we show that the PNS rotation rate significantly affects the thermodynamic conditions of the wind. We show that high-entropy material is quasiperiodically ejected from the closed zone of the PNS magnetosphere with the required thermodynamic conditions to produce heavy elements. We show that maximum entropy S of the material ejected depends systematically on the magnetar spin period P⋆ and scales as for sufficiently rapid rotation. We present results from simulations at a constant neutrino luminosity representative of ∼1–2 s after the onset of cooling for P⋆ ranging from 5–200 ms and a few simulations with evolving neutrino luminosity where we follow the evolution of the magnetar wind until 10–14 s after the onset of cooling. We estimate at magnetar polar magnetic field strength B0 = 3 × 1015 G and 1015 G that neutron-rich magnetar winds can, respectively, produce at least ∼1–5 × 10−5M⊙ and ∼1–4 × 10−7M⊙ of material with the required parameters for synthesis of the third r-process peak, within 1–2 s and 10 s, respectively, in that order after the onset of cooling. We show that proton-rich magnetar winds can have favorable conditions for production of p-nuclei, even at a modest B0 = 5 × 1014 G.

通过对银河系内氢原子的辐射重新组合线和离子化氮的远红外调查，结合现有的太阳邻域和外星系N/H丰度测定，首次研究了这一数量在银河系内部17千秒差距范围内的分布。我们发现，在银河平面上从4-17千秒差距范围存在氮丰度梯度，而在0-4千秒差距范围内N/H分布保持平稳。我们还观察了[N iii] 57μm线以追踪部分视线上双电离气体的贡献，并发现在这些视线上N++贡献微乎其微，这表明主要是来自于低电离H ii区外围的单电离氮。这些概述支持了太阳系的内外成长过程以及银河盘内径向流的可变星形成效率。<br /><br />总结: Galactic plane survey 和离子化氮远红外调查的结合，研究了银河系内氮丰度的分布，发现了太阳系内外成长和银河盘内径向流的影响。观察 N 过程的产物 [N iii] ，以及分析其来源和贡献。通过这些研究，我们得出了一些对银河系内部成长和形成历史的见解。 <div>
We combine a new Galactic plane survey of hydrogen radio recombination lines (RRLs) with far-infrared surveys of ionized nitrogen, N+, to determine nitrogen abundance across Galactic radius. RRLs were observed with the NASA Deep Space Network Station 43 70 m antenna and the Green Bank Telescope in 108 lines of sight spanning −135°< l < 60°, at b = 0°. These positions were also observed in [N ii] 122 μm and 205 μm lines with the Herschel Space Observatory. Combining RRL and [N ii] 122 μm and 205 μm observations in 41 of 108 samples with high signal-to-noise ratio, we studied the ionized nitrogen abundance distribution across Galactocentric distances of 0–8 kpc. Combined with existing solar neighborhood and outer Galaxy N/H abundance determinations, we studied this quantity’s distribution within the Milky Way’s inner 17 kpc for the first time. We found a nitrogen abundance gradient extending from Galactocentric radii of 4–17 kpc in the Galactic plane, while within 0–4 kpc the N/H distribution remained flat. The gradient observed at large Galactocentric distances supports inside-out galaxy growth, with the additional steepening resulting from variable star formation efficiency and/or radial flows in the Galactic disk, while the inner 4 kpc flattening, coinciding with the Galactic bar’s onset, may be linked to radial flows induced by the bar potential. Using SOFIA/FIFI-LS and Herschel/PACS, we observed the [N iii] 57 μm line to trace doubly ionized gas contribution in a subsample of sight lines. We found negligible N++ contributions along these sight lines, suggesting mostly singly ionized nitrogen originating from low-ionization H ii region outskirts.

We present follow-up spectroscopy and a detailed model atmosphere analysis of 29 wide double white dwarfs, including eight systems with a crystallized C/O core member. We use the state-of-the-art evolutionary models to constrain the physical parameters of each star, including the total age. Assuming that the members of wide binaries are coeval, any age difference between the binary members can be used to test the cooling physics for white dwarf stars, including potential delays due to crystallization and 22Ne distillation. We use our control sample of 14 wide binaries with noncrystallized members to show that this method works well; the control sample shows an age difference of only ΔAge = −0.03 ± 0.15 Gyr between its members. For the eight crystallized C/O core systems we find a cooling anomaly of ΔAge = Gyr. Even though our results are consistent with a small additional cooling delay (∼1 Gyr) from 22Ne distillation and other neutron-rich impurities, the large uncertainties make this result not statistically significant. Nevertheless, we rule out cooling delays longer than 3.6 Gyr at the 99.7% (3σ) confidence level for 0.6–0.9 M⊙ white dwarfs. Further progress requires larger samples of wide binaries with crystallized massive white dwarf members. We provide a list of subgiant + white dwarf binaries that could be used for this purpose in the future.

A small number of pulsars are known to emit giant pulses (GPs), single pulses much brighter than average. Among these is PSR J0534+2200, also known as the Crab pulsar, a young pulsar with high GP rates. Long-term monitoring of the Crab pulsar presents an excellent opportunity to perform statistical studies of its GPs and the processes affecting them, potentially providing insight into the behavior of other neutron stars that emit bright single pulses. Here, we present an analysis of a set of 24,985 Crab GPs obtained from 88 hr of daily observations at a center frequency of 1.55 GHz by the 20 m telescope at the Green Bank Observatory, spread over 461 days. We study the effects of refractive scintillation at higher frequencies than previous studies and compare methods of correcting for this effect. We also search for deterministic patterns seen in other single-pulse sources, possible periodicities seen in several rotating radio transients and fast radio bursts, and clustering of GPs like that seen in the repeating fast radio burst FRB 121102.

Summary:<br />
研究认为伽马射线暴（GRB）的中心引擎会产生一对相对运动的喷射流，即朝向我们的向前喷射流和远离我们的逆向喷射流。GRB 170817A是一个与双中子星合并事件相关的短爆发，具有非常适合搜索逆向喷射流辐射的能量向前喷射流。然而，目前对逆向喷射流的检测前景并不乐观。如果逆向喷射流的冲击参数（ϵe和ϵB）比向前冲击的要高，逆向喷射流的余辉辐射将会增强，可能会被检测到。未来，JWST在F356W波段的几小时曝光将严格测试这种情景。 <br />总结: <br />GRB中心引擎产生对向喷射流，GRB 170817A是一个适合研究的事件，但逆向喷射流的检测前景不明朗，通过调整冲击参数或许可以增强探测逆向喷射流的可能性，未来JWST观测将有望提供更多证据。 <div>
The central engine of a gamma-ray burst (GRB) is widely believed to launch a pair of oppositely moving jets, i.e., the forward jet moving toward us and the counter jet regressing away. The forward jet generates the radiation typically observed in GRBs, while the counter jet has not been detected yet due to its dimness. GRB 170817A, a short burst associated with a binary neutron star merger event, is a nearby event (z = 0.0097) with an off-axis structured energetic forward jet and hence probably the most suitable target for searching the counter jet radiation. Assuming the same properties for the forward and counter jet components as well as the shock parameters, the fit to the multiwavelength afterglow emission of GRB 170817A suggests a peak time ∼quite a few ×103 day of the counter jet radiation, but the detection prospect of this new component is not promising. Anyhow, if the shock parameters (ϵe and ϵB) of the counter jet component are (a few times) higher than that of the forward shock, e.g., the posterior results of the magnetic energy fraction of the forward shock and the counter jet are and , respectively, as still allowed by the current data, the counter jet afterglow emission will be enhanced and hence may be detected. A few hours of exposure by JWST in the F356W band will stringently test such a scenario.

<br /><br />总结:
本文讨论了超地球和迷你海王星这两种最常见的系外行星类型的形成物理学问题。研究发现，标准的核心聚集模型在富气环境中预测，典型的迷你海王星质量的行星在基础盘气体消散之前会膨胀成类木行星。最新提出的从原行星盘向形成的气态包层注入的熵机制被认为能延迟这种失控的吸积过程，尤其是在短轨道距离上。然而，通过数值一维热力学模型重新评估这一推理时发现，如果可以将气体再循环流量渗透到行星重力范围的约0.25以下，那么在0.1天文单位处，这些对流流量只能产生迷你海王星。否则，气体对核心质量比（GCR）将超过约10%，这太大了，不能解释迷你海王星的测量特性，必须有其他限制气体的过程，比如在后期核聚集过程中。熵对气体吸积的影响在0.1天文单位以外进一步减弱。文章还提出了GCR和对流流量渗透深度之间的更新比例关系，这个关系随着轨道距离、核质量和含尘与无尘的不透明度变化而呈现出复杂的变化。我们进一步展示了如何利用未来的仪器（如南茜·格雷斯·罗曼空间望远镜）对1天文单位以外的行星质量分布进行测量，以将不同形成条件下的低气体行星区分开来。 <div>
Super-Earths and mini-Neptunes are the most common types of exoplanets discovered, yet the physics of their formation are still debated. Standard core accretion models in gas-rich environments find that typical mini-Neptune mass planets would blow up into Jupiters before the underlying disk gas dissipates away. The injection of entropy from the protoplanetary disk into forming gaseous envelopes has recently been put forward as a mechanism to delay this runaway accretion, specifically at short orbital distances. Here, we reevaluate this line of reasoning by incorporating recycling flows of gas into a numerical one-dimensional thermodynamic model with a more realistic equation of state and opacities and the thermal state of the advective flow. At 0.1 au, we find that advective flows are only able to produce mini-Neptunes if they can penetrate below ∼0.25 of the planet’s gravitational sphere of influence. Otherwise, the gas-to-core mass ratio (GCR) reaches above ∼10%, which is too large to explain the measured properties of mini-Neptunes, necessitating other gas-limiting processes such as late-time core assembly. The effect of entropy advection on gas accretion weakens even further beyond 0.1 au. We present an updated scaling relation between GCR and the penetration depth of the advective flows, which varies nontrivially with orbital distances, core masses, and dusty versus dust-free opacity. We further demonstrate how measurements of planet mass distribution beyond ∼1 au using future instruments such as the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope could be used to disambiguate between different formation conditions of gas-poor planets.

Hubble常数的局部值通过距离梯子与基于标准ΛCDM模型的宇宙微波背景推断的值之间的差异已经达到5σ显著性。为了确定这一差异是由新物理还是更平凡的系统误差造成的，必须尽可能多地消除系统性不确定性，通过建立独立于传统Cepheid和Ia超新星路径的高精度距离梯子。在本文中，我们展示了对三个Fornax星系团早型星系的JWST观测，这是来自Cycle 2 JWST计划的14次观测中的第一次。我们的适度积分时间使我们能够测量高精度的红巨星分支尖端（TRGB）距离，它们还将用于进行表面亮度波动（SBF）的测量。从这三个星系中，我们确定了Fornax星系团的TRGB平均距离模数为μ = 31.424 ± 0.077等或D = 19.3 ± 0.7 Mpc。随着其他11次观测计划在附近的椭圆星系中，我们的计划将使我们能够将SBF比例的零点调整到更远距离的测量中的不到2％，为独立于传统Cepheid–超新星Ia距离梯子的高精度H0测量打下基础。 <br /><br />总结: Hubble常数的局部值与宇宙微波背景推断的值之间存在显著差异，通过JWST观测，我们得到了Fornax星系团的TRGB距离，这将为独立于传统距离梯子的高精度H0测量奠定基础。 <div>
Differences between the local value of the Hubble constant measured via the distance ladder versus the value inferred from the cosmic microwave background with the assumption of the standard ΛCDM model have reached over 5σ significance. To determine if this discrepancy is due to new physics or more mundane systematic errors, it is essential to remove as many sources of systematic uncertainty as possible, by developing high-precision distance ladders that are independent of the traditional Cepheid and Type Ia supernova route. Here, we present JWST observations of three early-type Fornax Cluster galaxies, the first of 14 observations from a Cycle 2 JWST program. Our modest integration times allow us to measure highly precise tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) distances and they will also be used to perform measurements of surface brightness fluctuations (SBFs). From these three galaxies, we determine an average TRGB distance modulus to the Fornax Cluster of μ = 31.424 ± 0.077 mag or D = 19.3 ± 0.7 Mpc. With 11 more scheduled observations in nearby elliptical galaxies, our program will allow us to set the zero-point of the SBF scale to better than 2% for more distant measurements, charting a path toward a high-precision measurement of H0 that is independent of the traditional Cepheid–supernova Ia distance ladder.

If using true bound satellites as tracers, the best constrained total mass within the half-mass radius of satellites, M(<rhalf); yet most of the best constraints are still consistent with the true profiles within 1σ statistical uncertainties for the three circumstances. Using a mock DESI Bright Galaxy Survey catalog with the effect of fiber incompleteness, we find DESI fiber assignments and the choice of flux limits barely modify the velocity dispersion profiles and are thus unlikely to affect the dynamical modeling outcomes. Our results show that with current and future deep spectroscopic surveys, JAM can be a powerful tool to constrain the underlying density profiles of individual massive galaxy clusters.

Methane (CH4) is one of the major components of the icy mantle of cosmic dust prevalent in cold, dense regions of interstellar media, playing an important role in the synthesis of complex organic molecules and prebiotic molecules. Solid CH4 is considered to be formed via the successive hydrogenation of C atoms accreting onto dust: C + 4H → CH4. However, most astrochemical models assume this reaction on the ice mantles of dust to be barrierless and efficient, without considering the states of adsorption. Recently, we found that C atoms exist in either the physisorbed or chemisorbed state on compact amorphous solid water, which is analogous to an interstellar ice mantle. These distinct adsorption states considerably affect the hydrogenation reactivity of the C atom. Herein, we elucidate the reactivities of physisorbed and chemisorbed C atoms with H atoms via sequential deposition and codeposition processes. The results indicate that only physisorbed C atoms can produce CH4 on ice. Combining this finding with a previous estimate for the fraction of physisorbed C atoms on ice, we determined the upper limit for the conversion of C atoms into CH4 to be 30%.

Fermi和eROSITA泡泡是银河系中的大型弥散结构，可能是稳定恒星形成活动的副产品。为了同时解释银河系的恒星形成历史和银河盘的金属丰度约为Z⊙，需要由宇宙射线驱动的稳定银河风。该风动力学模型符合银河演化场景，表明泡泡是持久存在的银河结构，而不是非同寻常的、约10百万年前的银心瞬变活动形成的短暂结构。风的一部分回落到盘上，形成银河喷泉流，其X射线和强子伽马射线的尺度高度和表面亮度与观测到的Fermi和eROSITA泡泡的性质一致。 <div>
The Fermi and eROSITA bubbles (FBs and eRBs), large diffuse structures in our Galaxy, can be the by-products of steady star formation activity. To simultaneously explain the star formation history of the Milky Way (MW) and the metallicity of ∼Z⊙ at the Galactic disk, a steady Galactic wind driven by cosmic rays (CRs) is required. For tenuous gases with a density of ≲10−3 cm−3, CR heating dominates over radiative cooling, and the gas can maintain the virial temperature of ∼0.3 keV, ideal for escape from the Galactic system as the wind. A part of the wind falls back onto the disk like a Galactic fountain flow. We model the wind dynamics according to the Galactic evolution scenario and find that the scale height and surface brightness of the X-ray and the hadronic gamma-ray emissions from such fountain flow region can be consistent with the observed properties of the FBs and eRBs. This implies that the bubbles are persistent structures of the MW existing over (at least) the last ∼1 Gyr rather than evanescent structures formed by nontrivial, ∼10 Myr past Galactic center transient activities.

<title>CANUCS: An Updated Mass and Magnification Model of A370 with JWST</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad684a</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present an updated mass and magnification model of galaxy cluster A370 using new NIRCam, NIRISS, and NIRSpec data from the Canadian NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS). Using Lenstool and a combination of archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and MUSE data with new JWST data as constraints, we derive an improved gravitational lensing model and extract magnifications of background galaxies with uncertainties. Using our best fit model, we perform a search for new multiply imaged systems via predicted positions. We report no new multiply imaged systems with identifiable redshifts, likely due to already very deep HST and Spitzer data but confirm a z ∼ 8 multiply imaged system by measuring its redshift with NIRISS and NIRSpec spectra. We find that the overall shape of the critical curve for a source at z = 9.0 is similar to previous models of A370, with small changes. We investigate the z ∼ 8 galaxy with two images observable with an apparent magnitude in the F125W band of 26.0 ± 0.2 and 25.6 ± 0.1. After correcting for the magnifications of the images, and , we use spectral energy distribution fitting to find an intrinsic stellar mass of log(M*/M⊙) = , intrinsic star formation rate of M⊙ yr−1, and MUV of −21.3 , which is close to the knee of the luminosity function at that redshift. Our model, and corresponding magnification, shear, and convergence maps are available on request and will be made publicly available on MAST in a CANUCS data release (doi:10.17909/ph4n-6n76).

<title>Observations of Kappa Distributions in Solar Energetic Protons and Derived Thermodynamic Properties</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this paper, we model the high-energy tail of observed solar energetic proton energy distributions with a kappa distribution function. We employ a technique for deriving the thermodynamic parameters of solar energetic proton populations measured by the Parker Solar Probe Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun EPI-Hi high-energy telescope, over energies from 10 to 60 MeV. With this technique, we explore, for the first time, the characteristic thermodynamic properties of the solar energetic protons associated with an interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) and its driven shock. We find that: (1) the spectral index or, equivalently, the thermodynamic parameter kappa of solar energetic protons (κEP) gradually increases, starting from the pre-ICME region (upstream of the CME-driven shock), reaching a maximum in the CME ejecta (κEP ≈ 3.5), followed by a gradual decrease throughout the trailing portion of the CME; (2) the solar energetic proton temperature and density (TEP and nEP) appear anticorrelated, a behavior consistent with subisothermal polytropic processes; and (3) values of TEP and κEP appear to be positively correlated, indicating an increasing entropy with time. Therefore, these proton populations are characterized by a complex and evolving thermodynamic behavior, consisting of multiple subisothermal polytropic processes, and a large-scale trend of increasing temperature, kappa, and entropy. This study and its companion study by Livadiotis et al. open up a new set of procedures for investigating the thermodynamic behavior of energetic particles and their shared thermal properties.

<title>Constraining Wind-driven Accretion onto Gaia BH3 with Chandra</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Gaia BH3 is the most massive known stellar-origin black hole in the Milky Way, with a mass M• ≈ 33 M⊙. Detected from Gaia’s astrometry, this black hole is in the mass range of those observed via gravitational waves, whose nature is still highly debated. Hosted in a binary system with a companion giant star that is too far away for Roche-lobe mass transfer, this black hole could nonetheless accrete at low levels due to wind-driven mass loss from its companion star, thus accreting in advection-dominated accretion flow, or ADAF, mode. Using stellar wind models, we constrain its Eddington ratio in the range 10−9 < fEdd < 10−7, corresponding to radiative efficiencies 5 × 10−5 < ϵ < 10−3, compatible with radiatively inefficient accretion modes. Chandra ACIS-S observed this object and obtained the most sensitive upper bound of its [2–10] keV flux: FX < 3.25 × 10−15 erg s−1 cm−2 at 90% confidence level corresponding to L[2–10] < 2.10 × 1029 erg s−1. Using ADAF emission models, we constrained its accretion rate to fEdd < 4.91 × 10−7 at the apastron, in agreement with our theoretical estimate. At the periastron, we expect fluxes ∼50 times larger. Because of the inferred low rates, accretion did not significantly contribute to black hole growth over the system’s lifetime. Detecting the electromagnetic emission from Gaia BH3 will be fundamental to informing stellar wind and accretion disk models.

该研究利用AGILE空间任务获取的数据，包括了2019年1月1日至2022年12月31日的ACS反差计数系统数据。该系统旨在通过使用深度学习模型预测AGILE ACS顶部面板的背景计数率，并利用预测和获取的计数率之间的差异来检测伽马射线暴（GRB）。使用卫星轨道参数作为输入，训练模型的背景数据集。在此训练后，模型可以以3.8%的平均重建误差预测ACS计数率。研究人员使用GRBweb目录中列出的GRBs，从AGILE ACS中提取出包含每个GRB的1.024秒的光变曲线，涵盖了GRBs的触发时间。模型检测到39个显著度为σ≥3的GRBs，其中包括四个在AGILE数据中首次探测到的GRBs。

总结: 该研究利用AGILE卫星采集的X射线和伽马射线天体物理数据，通过深度学习模型预测背景计数率，并发现了39个GRBs，其中包括四个是AGILE数据中首次探测到的。 <div>
The AGILE space mission was launched in 2007 to study X-ray and gamma-ray astrophysics. AGILE operated in spinning mode from 2009 until 2024 February 14, when it re-entered the Earth’s atmosphere. This work uses data acquired from the AGILE anticoincidence system (ACS) from 2019 January 1 to 2022 December 31. The ACS is designed to reject charged background particles. It also detects X-ray photons in the 50–200 KeV energy range and saves each panel count rate in the telemetry as ratemeter data, a time series with a resolution of 1.024 s. We developed a method that uses a deep learning model to predict the background count rates of the AGILE ACS top panel (perpendicular to the pointing direction of the payload detectors) using the satellite’s orbital parameters as input. Then, we use the difference between predicted and acquired count rates to detect gamma-ray bursts (GRB). We trained the model with a background-only data set. After the training, the model can predict the ACS count rates with a mean reconstruction error of 3.8%. We used the GRBs listed in the GRBweb catalog to search for significant anomalies in the ACS data. We extracted light curves of 140 bins of 1.024 s for each GRB from the AGILE ACS to cover the trigger time of the GRBs. The model detected 39 GRBs with a significance of σ ≥ 3. The results contain four GRBs detected for the first time in the AGILE data.

本研究通过对亮度GRB 160625B和GRB 160509A的脉冲特性进行全面分析，首次从能谱Ep和Ecut的演化行为中找到了相对论磁重联加速粒子的证据。同时，磁重联区域内发射粒子的绝热冷却过程产生了能谱指数和通量之间的关系。我们还讨论了能谱能量相关性背后的物理学。最后，我们认为Ecut和Liso之间的反相关性的发现可能为多种天体物理源中粒子加速和辐射物理的诊断开辟了新途径。 <br /><br /> <div>
Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) as the most energetic explosions in the modern universe have been studied for over half a century, but the physics of the particle acceleration and radiation responsible for their observed spectral behaviors are still not well understood. Based on the comprehensive analysis of the pulse properties in both bright GRB 160625B and GRB 160509A, for the first time, we identify evidence of particle acceleration by relativistic magnetic reconnection from the evolutionary behavior of the two spectral breaks Ep and Ecut. Meanwhile, the adiabatic cooling process of the emitting particles in the magnetic reconnection regions produces a relation between the spectral index and the flux. We also discuss the physics behind spectral energy correlations. Finally, we argue that the identification of an anticorrelation between Ecut and Liso may open a new avenue for diagnostics of the physics of the particle acceleration and radiation in a variety of astrophysical sources.

Solar spicules are plasma jets observed in the interface region between the visible solar surface and the corona. At any given time, there is a forest of spicules originating in the chromosphere of the Sun. While various models attempt to elucidate their origin and characteristics, here, we consider the one driven by the magnetoconvection undulations. The radiative magnetohydrodynamic (rMHD) equations are solved using Pencil Code with a spatial resolution of 16 km using various magnetic field strengths. The obtained rMHD simulation data are investigated to unveil the various trends in spicular properties as a function of the applied magnetic fields. The important outcome of this study is the finding of a consistent reduction in both the number density and the maximum height reached by spicules as magnetic field strength increases. We also use parabolic fitting on time–distance curves of spicules that are taller than the 75th percentile in the distribution, in order to find a relation between the deceleration of the spicule tip and the magnetic field strength. Our results offer insights into the response of solar spicules to magnetic field strength.

Understanding the mechanisms underlying the heating of the solar atmosphere is a fundamental problem in solar physics. The lower atmosphere of the Sun (i.e., photosphere and chromosphere) is composed of weakly ionized plasma. This results in anisotropic dissipation of electric currents by Coulomb and Cowling resistivities. Joule heating due to dissipation of currents perpendicular to the magnetic field by Cowling resistivity has been demonstrated to be the main mechanism for the heating of a sunspot umbral light bridge located in NOAA AR 12002 on 2014 March 13. Here, we focus on the same target region and demonstrate the importance of further constraining our Joule heating model using observational data in addition to magnetic field, namely plasma temperature calculated from the inversion of spectroscopic data obtained from the Interferometric BI-dimensional Spectrometer instrument of the ground-based Dunn Solar Telescope. As a parameter in our analysis, temperature is demonstrated to have the highest sensitivity after magnetic field. We show that the heating of the light bridge is a highly dynamic event that necessitates utilization of 3D spatially resolved observational data for temperature rather than a 1D temperature stratification based on theoretical/semiempirical solar atmosphere models. Our improved data-constrained analysis using spatially resolved temperatures shows that the entire light bridge is heated by the proposed mechanism, and yields heating rate values that are consistent with our previous study.

In our first paper, we laid out our pipeline and presented seven new gravitationally lensed supernovae candidates in a retrospective search. In this companion paper, we apply a modified version of that pipeline to search for gravitationally lensed quasars. From a sample of 5807 strong lenses, we have identified 13 new gravitationally lensed quasar candidates (three of them quadruply lensed). We note that our methodology differs from most lensed quasar search algorithms that solely rely on the morphology, location, and color of the candidate systems. By also accounting for the temporal photometric variability of the posited lensed images in our search via difference imaging, we have discovered new lensed quasar candidates. While variability searches using difference imaging algorithms have been done in the past, they are typically performed over vast swathes of the sky, whereas we specifically target strong gravitationally lensed candidates. We also have applied our pipeline to 655 known gravitationally lensed quasar candidates from past lensed quasar searches, of which we identified 13 that display significant variability (one of them quadruply lensed). This pipeline demonstrates a promising search strategy to discover gravitationally lensed quasars in other existing and upcoming surveys.

<div> FRB, Gemini South, Host galaxies, Spatial distributions, Stellar mass surface densities
<br /><br />总结:
本研究使用了Gemini South的自适应光学系统对五个快速射电暴（FRB）的宿主星系进行了观测，并研究了这些FRB与宿主星系光分布的空间分布和位置关系。研究发现，FRB与宿主星系的中位偏移距离为2.09个半光半径（re），并且这些FRB在宿主星系中出现在较暗的区域。进一步分析发现，大多数FRB出现在高局部恒星质量表面密度区域，与宿主星系的平均全局值相比显著升高。此外，四个宿主星系都有明显的螺旋臂特征，而从这些宿主星系发出的爆发往往出现在或靠近宿主的螺旋结构上。未来更多定位准确的FRB检测结果可能会更好地揭示FRB环境与宿主星系和其他瞬变类的特性。 <div>
We present observations from the Gemini Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics System/Gemini South Adaptive Optics Imager at Gemini South of five fast radio burst (FRB) host galaxies of FRBs with subarcsecond localizations. We examine and quantify the spatial distributions and locations of the FRBs with respect to their host galaxy light distributions, finding a median host-normalized offset of 2.09 half-light radii (re) and the trend that these FRBs occur in fainter regions of their host galaxies. When combined with the FRB host galaxy sample from Mannings et al., we find that FRBs are statistically distinct from Ca-rich transients in terms of light at the source location and from SGRBs and LGRBs in terms of host-normalized offset. We further find that most FRBs are in regions of elevated local stellar mass surface densities in comparison to the mean global values of their hosts. This, along with the finding that the FRB locations trace the distribution of stellar mass, points toward a possible similarity of the environments of CCSNe and FRBs. We also find that four out of five FRB hosts exhibit distinct spiral arm features, and the bursts originating from such hosts tend to appear on or close to their host’s spiral structure, with a median distance of 0.53 ± 0.27 kpc. With many well-localized FRB detections looming on the horizon, we will be able to better characterize the properties of FRB environments relative to their host galaxies and other transient classes. Such insights may only require us to double the number of FRBs with subarcsecond localizations.

<div> 关键词: 五百米口径球面射电望远镜，H i 21厘米辐射，Cloud-9，暗物质，星系。  
总结: 五百米口径球面射电望远镜最近在M94附近探测到H i 21厘米辐射，揭示了一个有趣的物体Cloud-9，它没有光学对应物。进一步分析表明Cloud-9与一个富含气体的暗物质晕（MH I ≈ 10^6M⊙，M200 ≈ 5 × 10^9M⊙）相一致。Karl G. Jansky超大阵的观测显示了Cloud-9的一些特征，表明它可能是一个星暗的ΛCDM暗物质晕。亚利安特望远镜（Hubble Space Telescope）的进一步观测将有助于确定Cloud-9是否是一个星系。Cloud-9可以说是迄今为止最坚实的无星暗物质晕候选者，或者是距离最远的已知最微弱的星系。 <br /><br /> <div>
Observations with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope recently detected H i 21 cm emission near M94, revealing an intriguing object, Cloud-9, without an optical counterpart. Subsequent analysis suggests that Cloud-9 is consistent with a gas-rich (MH I ≈ 106M⊙), starless, dark matter (DM) halo of mass M200 ≈ 5 × 109M⊙. Using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array in D-array configuration, we present interferometric observations of Cloud-9, revealing it as a dynamically cold (W50 ≈ 12 km s−1), nonrotating, and spatially asymmetric system, exhibiting gas compression on one side and a tail-like structure toward the other—features likely originating from ram pressure. Our observations suggest Cloud-9 is consistent with a starless ΛCDM DM halo if the gas is largely isothermal. If interpreted as a faint dwarf, Cloud-9 is similar to Leo T, a nearby gas-rich galaxy that would fall below current optical detection limits at Cloud-9's distance (d ≈ 5 Mpc). Further observations with the Hubble Space Telescope reaching magnitudes mg ≈ 30 would help identify such a galaxy or dramatically lower the current limits on its stellar mass (Mgal ≲ 105M⊙). Cloud-9 thus stands as the firmest starless DM halo candidate to date or the faintest galaxy known at its distance.

这篇论文利用JWST的灵敏度和光谱覆盖能力，通过对四个晚期T和Y矮星的PRISM光谱进行分析，表明标准亚恒星大气模型难以复制4.1−4.4μm波长范围的特征。研究使用了基于Elf Owl化学和温度剖面的PICASO模型，并发现对于PH3和CO2的丰度存在数量级上的差异。由此推断，在UNCOVER−BD−3中所宣称的PH3检测可能可以用高于标准大气模型预测的CO2丰度来解释。但是，由于光谱的信噪比不够高，无法区分这两种情况。文章还讨论了解释观测到的PH3欠丰度和CO2过量的大气机制，包括垂直湍流扩散系数（Kzz）随高度变化、错误的化学途径以及元素以NH4H2PO4等形式凝结。作者认为，CO2增加的最佳解释是淬火近似不能准确预测CO2的丰度，因为CO在淬火后仍然与CO2保持化学平衡。 <br /><br />总结: 这篇论文使用JWST观测了晚期T和Y矮星的大气化学成分，发现标准大气模型难以复制观测结果，提出了CO2和PH3丰度不匹配的问题，并通过PICASO模型的拟合得出高于预期的CO2丰度。此外，还讨论了大气机制可能的解释。 <div>
The sensitivity and spectral coverage of JWST are enabling us to test our assumptions of ultracool dwarf atmospheric chemistry, especially with regards to the abundances of phosphine (PH3) and carbon dioxide (CO2). In this paper, we use Near Infrared Spectrograph PRISM spectra (∼0.8−5.5 μm, R ∼ 100) of four late T and Y dwarfs to show that standard substellar atmosphere models have difficulty replicating the 4.1−4.4 μm wavelength range, as they predict an overabundance of phosphine and an underabundance of carbon dioxide. To help quantify this discrepancy, we generate a grid of models using PICASO, based on the Elf Owl chemical and temperature profiles, where we include the abundances of these two molecules as parameters. The fits to these PICASO models show a consistent preference for orders-of-magnitude higher CO2 abundances and a reduction in PH3 abundance as compared to the nominal models. This tendency means that the claimed phosphine detection in UNCOVER−BD−3 could instead be explained by a CO2 abundance in excess of standard atmospheric model predictions; however, the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectrum is not high enough to discriminate between these cases. We discuss atmospheric mechanisms that could explain the observed underabundance of PH3 and overabundance of CO2, including a vertical eddy diffusion coefficient (Kzz) that varies with altitude, incorrect chemical pathways, or elements condensing out in forms such as NH4H2PO4. However, our favored explanation for the required CO2 enhancement is that the quench approximation does not accurately predict the CO2 abundance, as CO2 remains in chemical equilibrium with CO after CO quenches.

这篇文章利用Hilbert–Huang变换技术对新发现的BHXRB Swift J1727.8–1613中的LFQPO进行了相位分辨光谱学研究。研究揭示了非热和盘-黑体组分在QPO时间尺度上的变化，前者在QPO变异性中占据主导地位。对于光谱参数，我们观察到盘温度、光谱指数和反射分数随QPO相位的高统计学显着性（≳5σ）调制。值得注意的是，盘温度的变化发生在非热和盘流量变化之前，大约是∼0.4–0.5个QPO周期。我们认为这些发现进一步证明了C型QPO变异性是由于围绕着黑洞的吸积流的几何效应。 
<br /> <div>
Low-frequency quasiperiodic oscillations (LFQPOs) are commonly observed in X-ray light curves of black hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs); however, their origin remains a topic of debate. In order to thoroughly investigate variations in spectral properties on the quasiperiodic oscillation (QPO) timescale, we utilized the Hilbert–Huang transform technique to conduct phase-resolved spectroscopy across a broad energy band for LFQPOs in the newly discovered BHXRB Swift J1727.8–1613. This is achieved through quasi-simultaneous observations from Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer, Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array, and Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope. Our analysis reveals that both the nonthermal and disk–blackbody components exhibit variations on the quasiperiodic oscillation (QPO) timescale, with the former dominating the QPO variability. For the spectral parameters, we observe modulation of the disk temperature, spectral indices, and reflection fraction with the QPO phase with high statistical significance (≳5σ). Notably, the variation in the disk temperature is found to precede the variations in the nonthermal and disk fluxes by ∼0.4–0.5 QPO cycles. We suggest that these findings offer further evidence that the type-C QPO variability is a result of geometric effects of the accretion flow.

总结: 本文研究了Ia型超新星的形成机制，发现了一颗氦次矮星US 708以及七颗高速星，这支持了捐赠者是低质量氦星或白矮星的假设。通过水动力学模拟，发现在超新星爆发后，捐赠星会剥离大约0.01-0.02太阳质量的物质，并解释了剥离物在膨胀的超新星喷发中的位置。随后使用MESA模拟了受冲击的捐赠星的后爆炸演化，发现它们会保持明亮和膨胀约10^5-10^6年。最后发现氦白矮星的后爆炸性质与一个高速星D6-2相一致。 <div>
Type Ia supernovae arise from thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs accreting from a binary companion. Following the explosion, the surviving donor star leaves at roughly its orbital velocity. The discovery of the runaway helium subdwarf star US 708, and seven hypervelocity stars from Gaia data, all with spatial velocities ≳900 km s−1, strongly support a scenario in which the donor is a low-mass helium star or a white dwarf. Motivated by these discoveries, we perform three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with the Athena++ code, modeling the hydrodynamical interaction between a helium star or helium white dwarf and the supernova ejecta. We find that ≈0.01–0.02 M⊙ of donor material is stripped, and explain the location of the stripped material within the expanding supernova ejecta. We continue the postexplosion evolution of the shocked donor stars with the MESA code. As a result of entropy deposition, they remain luminous and expanded for ≈105–106 yr. We show that the postexplosion properties of our helium white dwarf donor agree reasonably with one of the best-studied hypervelocity stars, D6-2.

Coronal rain (CR) is a crucial part of the mass cycle between the corona and chromosphere. It includes flare-driven CR and two types of quiescent CR, along nonflaring active region closed loops and along open structures, separately, labeled as type I, type II, and type III CR, respectively. Among them, type I and type III CR are generally associated with magnetic reconnection. In this study, employing data taken by the Solar Dynamics Observatory and the Solar Upper Transition Region Imager on 2022 October 11, we report three types of CR during an interchange reconnection between open and closed magnetic field structures above the southeastern solar limb. The open and closed structures converge, with the formation of the current sheet at the interface, and reconnect. The newly formed closed and open structures then recede from the reconnection region. During the reconnection, coronal condensation occurs along the reconnecting closed loops and falls toward the solar surface along both loop legs, as type II CR. Subsequently, condensation happens in the newly formed closed loops and moves down toward the solar surface along both loop legs, as type I CR. Magnetic dips of the reconnecting open structures form during the reconnection. In the dips, condensation occurs and propagates along the open structures toward the solar surface as type III CR. Our results suggest that the reconnection rate may be crucial for the formation of type I and type III CR during reconnection.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章使用了3D尘埃地图和Planck极化尘埃发射数据，研究了附近星际介质的3D几何形状对大尺度尘埃极化统计的影响。研究发现，极化尘埃发射所探测到的磁场趋向于局部泡泡壁，但并未发现局部泡泡几何形状对尘埃极化分数的影响。另外，研究还发现，当尘埃在不同距离上分布较多时，平均尘埃极化分数会下降；相反，当尘埃在3D空间中更集中时，尘埃极化分数会更高。在1.25千秒差距内，这一发现是具有统计显著性的，但如果只考虑270秒差距内的尘埃，则这一效应消失。最终研究得出结论，扩展的3D尘埃分布，而不仅仅是局部泡泡中的尘埃，对观测到的80′处的尘埃极化分数起到决定作用。 这一结论符合简单的分析预测，并在各种分析修改下保持稳健。这些结果揭示了星际介质的3D几何形状与星际磁场示踪剂之间的关系，对我们对宇宙微波背景极化尘埃前景的理解有重要意义。 <div>
Using 3D dust maps and Planck polarized dust emission data, we investigate the influence of the 3D geometry of the nearby interstellar medium (ISM) on the statistics of the dust polarization on large ( ) scales. We test recent models that assume that the magnetic field probed by the polarized dust emission is preferentially tangential to the Local Bubble wall, but we do not find an imprint of the Local Bubble geometry on the dust polarization fraction. We also test the hypothesis that the complexity of the 3D dust distribution drives some of the measured variation of the dust polarization fraction. We compare sight lines with similar total column densities and find that, on average, the dust polarization fraction decreases when the dust column is substantially distributed among multiple components at different distances. Conversely, the dust polarization fraction is higher for sight lines where the dust is more concentrated in 3D space. This finding is statistically significant for the dust within 1.25 kpc, but the effect disappears if we only consider dust within 270 pc. In conclusion, we find that the extended 3D dust distribution, rather than solely the dust associated with the Local Bubble, plays a role in determining the observed dust polarization fraction at 80′. This conclusion is consistent with a simple analytical prediction and remains robust under various modifications to the analysis. These results illuminate the relationship between the 3D geometry of the ISM and tracers of the interstellar magnetic field. We discuss implications for our understanding of the polarized dust foreground to the cosmic microwave background.

总结:
脉冲星PSR B0943+10是研究脉冲星磁层动力学的典型范例，显示了模式切换、正交偏振和亚脉冲漂移等特征，研究频率通常在600MHz以下。本研究使用FAST在1.25 GHz高频率下进行综合和单脉冲研究，发现模式切换具有类似奇异吸引子的相空间演化模式。通过拟合偏振位置角和旋转矢量模型，提出了辐射几何学。此外，对B0943+10的正交极化辐射进行了详细研究，揭示了可能支持极化发射辐射传输模型的一些模式。Q模式的脉冲轮廓表明前驱和主脉冲组分具有正交极化，并可能来源于磁层不同深度。这些发现对脉冲星电动力学和相关辐射机制具有重要影响。 <div>
As one of the paradigm examples to probe into pulsar magnetospheric dynamics, PSR B0943+10 (J0946+0951) manifests representatively, showing a mode switch, orthogonal polarization, and subpulse drifting, frequently studied below 600 MHz. Here, both integrated and single pulses are studied at a high frequency (1.25 GHz) with FAST. The mode switch is studied using a profile decomposition method. A phase space evolution for the pulsar’s mode switch shows a strange-attractor-like pattern. The radiative geometry is proposed by fitting polarization position angles with the rotating vector model. The pulsar pulse profile is then mapped to the sparking locations on the pulsar surface, and the differences between the main pulse’s and the precursor component’s radiative processes may explain the X-ray’s synchronization with radio mode switch. Detailed single pulse studies on B0943+10's orthogonally polarized radiation are presented, which may support certain models of radiative transfer of polarized emission. In particular, the difference in orthogonal polarization modes’ circular polarization might reflect the cyclotron absorption in pulsar magnetospheres. B0943+10's B and Q modes evolve differently with frequency and have different proportions of orthogonal modes, which indicates possible magnetospheric changes during mode switch. For Q mode pulse profile, the precursor and the main pulse components are orthogonally polarized, and are probably originated from different depths in the magnetosphere. The findings could impact significantly on the pulsar electrodynamics and the radiative mechanism related.

<div> 关键词: Type Ia supernovae, delay-time distribution (DTD), chemical evolution models, Milky Way, stellar abundance distribution

总结:
Type Ia超新星在宇宙中产生了大部分的Fe峰元素，对星系化学演化模型至关重要。它们不会在恒星形成后立即爆炸，因此延迟时间分布（DTD）对化学演化模型中年龄、[Fe/H]和[α/Fe]之间的关系有重要影响。研究人员在多区域化学演化模型中实现了几种流行的DTD形式，并与银河系的多次星形成历史相结合。他们发现DTD对[α/Fe]分布有最大影响，符合更迅速的Type Ia超新星爆发DTD会产生偏向较低[α/Fe]比率的星际丰度分布。他们的模型结果支持DTD延长，具有较少的迅速Type Ia超新星，而不是经典的t−1幂律。这项研究对观测到的星际丰度轨迹、恒星丰度分布和恒星年龄分布进行了验证。 <br /><br /> <div>
Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) produce most of the Fe-peak elements in the Universe and therefore are a crucial ingredient in galactic chemical evolution models. SNe Ia do not explode immediately after star formation, and the delay-time distribution (DTD) has not been definitively determined by supernova surveys or theoretical models. Because the DTD also affects the relationship among age, [Fe/H], and [α/Fe] in chemical evolution models, comparison with observations of stars in the Milky Way is an important consistency check for any proposed DTD. We implement several popular forms of the DTD in combination with multiple star formation histories for the Milky Way in multizone chemical evolution models that include radial stellar migration. We compare our predicted interstellar medium abundance tracks, stellar abundance distributions, and stellar age distributions to the final data release of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment. We find that the DTD has the largest effect on the [α/Fe] distribution: a DTD with more prompt SNe Ia produces a stellar abundance distribution that is skewed toward a lower [α/Fe] ratio. While the DTD alone cannot explain the observed bimodality in the [α/Fe] distribution, in combination with an appropriate star formation history it affects the goodness of fit between the predicted and observed high-α sequence. Our model results favor an extended DTD with fewer prompt SNe Ia than the fiducial t−1 power law.

<div> 关键词: Galactic centers, compact object binaries, tidal field, flyby interactions, merger rates
总结: 本文研究了星系中心环境中紧密天体双星的演化和并合率，首次重点关注星团潮汐场和飞越相互作用的综合效应。研究发现，这两种过程之间存在显著的协同作用，使得并合率相较于仅考虑飞越或潮汐的模型增加了约10-30倍。这种协同作用的结果是潮汐驱动的近似离心率激励受到飞越所推动的jz扩散的增强。并合效率在扩散速率大约比潮汐驱动扭矩速率慢10-100倍时达到峰值。此外，逐渐软化的双星也能解除最初紧密双星的相对论耗散作用，从而扩大了并合的相空间。综上所述，尽管飞越导致双星逐渐软化，但它们通过促进潮汐场驱动的离心率激发，大大增加了星系中心的并合率。 <br /><br /> <div>
Galactic centers (GCs) are very dynamically active environments, often harboring a nuclear star cluster and supermassive black hole at their cores. Binaries in these environments are subject to strong tidal fields that can efficiently torque its orbit, exciting near-unity eccentricities that ultimately lead to their merger. In turn, frequent close interactions with passing stars impulsively perturb the orbit of the binary, generally softening their orbit until their evaporation, potentially hindering the role of tides to drive these mergers. In this work, we study the evolution of compact object binaries in the GC and their merger rates, focusing for the first time on the combined effect of the cluster’s tidal field and flyby interactions. We find a significant synergy between both processes, where merger rates increase by a factor of ∼10−30 compared to models in which only flybys or tides are taken into account. This synergy is a consequence of the persistent tides-driven eccentricity excitation that is enhanced by the gradual diffusion of jz driven by flybys. The merger efficiency peaks when the diffusion rate is ∼10−100 slower than the tides-driven torquing. Added to this synergy, we also find that the gradual softening of the binary can lift the relativistic quenching of initially tight binaries, otherwise unable to reach extreme eccentricities, and thus expanding the available phase space for mergers. Cumulatively, we conclude that despite the gradual softening of binaries due to flybys, these greatly enhance their merger rates in GCs by promoting the tidal-field-driven eccentricity excitation.

这项研究发现了一类罕见的大型盘状寂静星系，它们在红序列中出现，并且并未破坏基础恒星盘。研究识别了48个红移在0.5到1.0之间、质量大于10^10太阳质量的盘状寂静星系。研究显示，这些星系通常具有广阔的恒星盘和微小的球状组分。通过研究其颜色梯度，发现这些星系的恒星盘在各个半径上都基本停止了星形成活动。研究还提出了一种可能的形成机制，即通过一种渐近的盘状褪色过程形成这些大质量寂静盘状星系。 <br /><br />总结: 这项研究发现了罕见的大质量盘状寂静星系，它们具有广阔的恒星盘和微小的球状组分。通过研究其颜色梯度，发现这些星系的恒星盘在各个半径上都基本停止了星形成活动。研究还提出了一种可能的形成机制——渐近的盘状褪色过程。 <div>
A rare population of massive disk-dominated quiescent galaxies has recently drawn much attention, which intrudes the red sequence (RS) population without destroying the underlying stellar disks. In this study, we have carefully identified 48 RS, disk-dominated galaxies with M* > 1010M⊙ between redshift 0.5 and 1.0 in all five CANDELS fields. These galaxies are well fitted by a two-component bulge plus disk model, and have the bulge-to-total ratio B/T < 0.4 in the both F814W and F160W bands. The fitting results indicate that these galaxies generally have extended stellar disks (∼3 kpc on average) and tiny bulge components (∼0.5 kpc on average). To understand their possible origins, we have also selected two control samples of 156 green valley (GV) and 309 blue cloud (BC) disk-dominated galaxies according to the same selection criteria. We study the UVI(U − V versus V − I) color gradients of these galaxies to infer their specific star formation rate (sSFR) gradients out to the maximum acceptable radii. We show that on average the disks in disk-dominated RS galaxies are fully quenched at all radii, whereas both the BC and GV disks are not fully quenched at any radii. We find that all the BC, GV, and RS disk galaxies generally have nearly flat sSFR profiles. We propose a potential formation mechanism, acknowledging that various other mechanisms (e.g., central compaction and active galactic nucleus feedback) might contribute, where massive quiescent disk-dominated galaxies are predominantly formed via a process of secular disk fading.

在这篇文章中，研究人员使用PSP和SolO卫星对2022年9月5日的日冕物质抛射事件进行了分析。他们比较了在PSP和SolO处的原位磁场测量，以确定全球和局部扩展度量，发现磁场与太阳离心距之间的关系存在一致性，但在磁通绳大小方面存在显著差异。他们使用PSP/Wide-Field Imager for Solar Probe图像作为ELEvoHI模型的输入，发现到达时间的建模存在较大偏差，这表明模型假设可能不适用于距离太阳较近的数据。最后，他们独立使用SolO的磁强计和PSP的FIELDS数据对3DCORE模型进行拟合，发现许多参数在两个卫星间是一致的，但在重建与PSP和SolO到达时间一致的全球3D结构时存在挑战，这可能是由于卫星之间的大径向和纵向分离。从模型结果来看，太阳风的背景速度和阻力机制强烈影响CME的扩展和传播建模，需要加以考虑。

As both Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar Orbiter (SolO) reach heliocentric distances closer to the Sun, they present an exciting opportunity to study the structure of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in the inner heliosphere. We present an analysis of the global flux rope structure of the 2022 September 5 CME event that impacted PSP at a heliocentric distance of only 0.07 au and SolO at 0.69 au. We compare in situ measurements at PSP and SolO to determine global and local expansion measures, finding a good agreement between magnetic field relationships with heliocentric distance, but significant differences with respect to flux rope size. We use PSP/Wide-Field Imager for Solar Probe images as input to the ELlipse Evolution model based on Heliospheric Imager data (or ELEvoHI), providing a direct link between remote and in situ observations; we find a large discrepancy between the resulting modeled arrival times, suggesting that the underlying model assumptions may not be suitable when using data obtained close to the Sun, where the drag regime is markedly different in comparison to larger heliocentric distances. Finally, we fit the SolO's magnetometer and PSP's FIELDS data independently with the 3D Coronal ROpe Ejection (or 3DCORE) model, and find that many parameters are consistent between spacecraft. However, challenges are apparent when reconstructing a global 3D structure that aligns with arrival times at PSP and SolO, likely due to the large radial and longitudinal separations between spacecraft. From our model results, it is clear the solar wind background speed and drag regime strongly affect the modeled expansion and propagation of CMEs and need to be taken into consideration.

总结:
磁层太阳大气中是否携带中性电流存在争议，本研究通过对28个喷发磁通绳的磁场和电流进行研究，确认了在同一磁通绳的对应磁场点之间不存在显著差异，并证实了通过日冕变暗来识别磁通绳的方法的有效性。研究还发现，携带大量净电流的磁通绳与产生喷发前变暗有中等程度的关联，这可以通过电流通道的洛伦兹自力作用来解释。测试还表明，在估计磁通绳的磁扭曲时，必须考虑电流密度和磁场的空间不均匀分布。 <div>
It is under debate whether the magnetic field in the solar atmosphere carries neutralized electric currents, in particular, whether a magnetic flux rope (MFR), which is considered the core structure of coronal mass ejections, carries neutralized electric currents. Recently Wang et al. (2023) studied magnetic flux and electric current measured at the footpoints of 28 eruptive MFRs from 2010 to 2015. Because of the small sample size, no rigorous statistical analysis has been done. Here, we include nine more events from 2016 to 2023 and perform a series of nonparametric statistical tests at a significance level of 5%. The tests confirm that there exist no significant differences in magnetic properties between conjugated footpoints of the same MFR, which justifies the method of identifying the MFR footpoints through coronal dimming. The tests demonstrate that there exist no significant differences between MFRs with preeruption dimming and those with only posteruption dimming. However, there is a medium level of association between MFRs carrying substantial net current and those producing preeruption dimming, which can be understood by the Lorentz self-force of the current channel. The tests also suggest that in estimating the magnetic twist of MFRs, it is necessary to take into account the spatially inhomogeneous distribution of electric current density and magnetic field.

We present JWST/NIRSpec high-resolution G395H/F290LP spectroscopy of MACS0647−JD, a gravitationally lensed galaxy merger at z = 10.167. The new spectroscopy, which is acquired for the two lensed images (JD1 and JD2), detects and resolves emission lines in the rest-frame ultraviolet and blue optical, including the resolved [O ii] λλ3726, 3729 doublet, [Ne iii] λ3870, He iλ3890, Hδ, Hγ, and [O iii] λ4363. This is the first observation of the resolved [O ii] λλ3726, 3729 doublet for a galaxy at z > 8. We measure a line flux ratio [O ii] λ3729/λ3726 = 0.9 ± 0.3, which corresponds to an estimated electron density of . This is significantly higher than the electron densities of local galaxies reported in the literature. We compile measurements from the literature and further analyze the redshift evolution of ne. We find that the redshift evolution follows the power-law form of ne = A × (1 + z)p with cm−3 and . This power-law form may be explained by a combination of metallicity and morphological evolution of galaxies, which become, on average, more metal poor and more compact with increasing redshift.

Neutral atomic hydrogen and molecular gas in the host galaxies of radio active galactic nuclei can be traced using H i 21 cm and OH-1667 MHz absorption lines to understand the fueling and feedback processes. We present the results of an H i and OH absorption survey with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope toward 40 radio sources of low–intermediate radio luminosity (∼1023–1026 W Hz−1 at 1.4 GHz), red mid-infrared color (W2[4.6 μm]–W3[12 μm] > 2.5 mag), and redshift up to 0.35. From 13 sources with good data at H i observing frequencies, we report the detection of H i absorption toward eight sources, five of which are new detections, including four in the redshift range 0.25–0.35. Our detection rates are consistent with our previous results, with the dependence on the star formation history of the host galaxies reflected in the mid-infrared Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer W2−W3 colors and the compactness of the radio sources. We find no significant dependence of the detection rates on radio luminosity or redshift. We also find that the H i column densities are anticorrelated with the low-frequency spectral indices ( , Sν ∝ ν−α). We do not have any detections from 23 sources with good data at OH observing frequencies. However, by stacking the spectra, we estimate the 3σ upper limit of the OH column density to be 2.27 × 1014Tex/10 K × 1/fc cm−2. By stacking the OH spectra for seven associated H i absorbers, we get a 3σ upper limit of 3.47 × 1014Tex/10 K × 1/fc cm−2 on the OH column density and 1.78 × 10−7 on the [OH]/[H i] ratio.

The charge exchange between the interstellar medium and the solar wind plasma is crucial for determining the structures of the heliosphere. Since both the neutral-ion and neutral–neutral collision mean free paths are either comparable to or larger than the size of the heliosphere, the neutral phase space distribution can deviate far away from the Maxwellian distribution. A kinetic description for the neutrals is crucial for accurately modeling the heliosphere. It is computationally challenging to run three-dimensional time-dependent kinetic simulations due to the large number of macroparticles. In this paper, we present the new highly efficient Solar Wind with Hydrogen Ion Exchange and Large-scale Dynamics-2 model with a kinetic model of neutrals and a magnetohydrodynamic model for the ions and electrons. To improve the simulation efficiency, we implement adaptive mesh refinement and particle splitting and merging algorithms for the neutral particles to reduce the particle number that is required for an accurate simulation. We present several tests to verify and demonstrate the capabilities of the model.

这篇文章中进行了一个三维的广义相对论辐射磁流体动力学模拟，模拟了一个倾斜的超艾丁顿吸积盘环绕自转黑洞的情况。盘会倾斜和扭曲，并在维持形状的同时进动。气体主要是在外部盘环绕的自转轴向外喷射，而不是在黑洞的自转轴向外喷射。盘的进动会随时间改变气体的喷射方向。辐射能量也在大致相同的方向释放，所以进动会导致观测到的光度产生准周期的时间变化。对于10太阳质量的黑洞和数十个引力半径范围内的盘径，进动的时间尺度约为10秒。这个时间尺度与一些超强X射线源观测到的低频准周期振荡（0.01-1赫兹）的频率是一致的。

<br />总结: 该研究通过模拟发现，倾斜的超艾丁顿吸积盘环绕自转黑洞，导致气体喷射方向的准周期性变化，也会引起观测到的光度产生时间变化。这对于解释一些超强X射线源观测到的低频准周期振荡提供了可行的机制。 <div>
We perform a three-dimensional general relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulation of a tilted super-Eddington accretion disk around a spinning black hole (BH). The disk, which tilts and twists as it approaches the BH, precesses while maintaining its shape. The gas is mainly ejected around the rotation axis of the outer part of the disk rather than around the spin axis of the BH. The disk precession changes the ejection direction of the gas with time. The radiation energy is also released in approximately the same direction as the outflow, so the precession is expected to cause a quasiperiodic time variation of the observed luminosity. The timescale of the precession is about 10 s for a 10 M⊙ BH and for the radial extent of a disk of several tens of gravitational radii, where M⊙ is the solar mass. This timescale is consistent with the frequency of the low-frequency quasiperiodic oscillation (0.01–1 Hz) observed in some ultraluminous X-ray sources.

总结:
红巨星HD 49385内存在小尺度磁场的研究取得了突破，研究人员通过引入修正的Eddington T-τ方程，模拟了磁场对恒星大气中振荡的影响，并推断出磁场约80G的强度，高度约1850km。研究人员还通过将计算频率与观测频率进行对比，选择了两个最佳模型，确认了避免交叉模式与恒星的氦核密切相关，并确定了HD 49385的质量为1.25M⊙，年龄分别为4.1Gyr和4.5Gyr。这些结果提供了关于HD 49385内部结构和恒星参数的重要信息。<br /><br /> <div>
Recent asteroseismic studies have shown convincing evidence that magnetic fields may exist in the interior of some pulsating red giants. Inspired by this breakthrough, we explored the effect of small-scale magnetic fields on the p-mode oscillations in an evolved star, HD 49385. We incorporate a modified Eddington T–τ equation that phenomenologically mimics the effect of the magnetic fields in the atmosphere of HD 49385, and calculate the frequencies of p-modes with l = 0, 1, and 2. By comparing the calculated frequencies with the observed ones, we select two best-fit models with either GS98 or A09 chemical composition. Our best-fit models not only fit satisfactorily the observed frequencies but also well reproduce some spectroscopically observed stellar parameters such as effective temperature and log g. Based on the two best-fit models, we have estimated that the small-scale magnetic fields possess a strength of approximately 80 G and spread concentratively at approximately a height of 1850 km in the atmosphere. By selecting the best-fit models with a special requirement on the avoided-crossing mode, we have confirmed that the frequency of the avoided-crossing mode is tightly related to the helium core of the star, and determined the size of the helium core as 0.117 M⊙ in mass and 0.078 R⊙ in radius. Based on the improvements of the previous two sides, we can accurately determine the mass of HD 49385 to be 1.25 ± 0.02 M⊙ with an age of 4.1 Gyr for GS98 composition and 4.5 Gyr for A09 composition.

总结:
本研究使用第二代FIRE-2模拟框架，通过终止反馈来研究其对银河质量星系的影响。结果显示，终止反馈导致星际湍流速度下降，密集物质增加，星形成率增加超过一个数量级。此外，研究发现，反馈对巨分子云的影响也表现在多个方面，包括新的束缚云的增多，松散云的湍流支撑减少，云的密度整体增加以及内部星形成的激增。此外，通过计算云集成的星形成率，发现现有的湍流调控理论对于星形成率的激增预测存在至少3倍的低估。综上所述，该研究表明星系中的星形成受到反馈调控，而星际介质对巨分子云的影响也是多方面的。 <div>
Stellar feedback influences the star formation rate (SFR) and the interstellar medium of galaxies in ways that are difficult to quantify numerically, because feedback is an essential ingredient of realistic simulations. To overcome this, we conduct a feedback-halting experiment starting with a Milky Way–mass galaxy in the second-generation Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE-2) simulation framework. By terminating feedback, and comparing to a simulation in which feedback is maintained, we monitor how the runs diverge. We find that without feedback, the interstellar turbulent velocities decay. There is a marked increase of dense material, while the SFR increases by over an order of magnitude. Importantly, this SFR boost is a factor of ∼15–20 larger than is accounted for by the increased freefall rate caused by higher densities. This implies that feedback moderates the star formation efficiency per freefall time more directly than simply through the density distribution. To probe changes at the scale of giant molecular clouds (GMCs), we identify GMCs using density and virial parameter thresholds, tracking clouds as the galaxy evolves. Halting feedback stimulates rapid changes, including a proliferation of new bound clouds, a decrease of turbulent support in loosely bound clouds, an overall increase in cloud densities, and a surge of internal star formation. Computing the cloud-integrated SFR using several theories of turbulence regulation, we show that these theories underpredict the surge in SFR by at least a factor of 3. We conclude that galactic star formation is essentially feedback regulated on scales that include GMCs, and that stellar feedback affects GMCs in multiple ways.

Recently, the first pulsating ultraluminous X-ray source M82 X-2 was reported to be experiencing a rapid orbital decay at a rate of based on 7 yr NuSTAR data. To account for the observed orbital-period derivative, it requires a mass transfer rate of ( is the Eddington accretion rate) from the donor star to the accreting neutron star. However, other potential models cannot be completely excluded. In this work, we propose an anomalous magnetic braking (AMB) model to interpret the detected orbital decay of M82 X-2. If the donor star is an Ap/Bp star with an anomalously strong magnetic field, the magnetic coupling between strong surface magnetic field and irradiation-driven wind from the surface of the donor star could cause an efficient angular-momentum loss, driving a rapid orbital decay observed in M82 X-2. The AMB mechanism of an Ap/Bp star with a mass of 5.0–15.0 M⊙ and a surface magnetic field of 3000–4500 G could produce the observed of M82 X-2. We also discuss the possibility of other alternative models including the companion star expansion and a surrounding circumbinary disk.

We report the discovery of jets emanating from pre-main-sequence objects exclusively at mid-infrared wavelengths, enabled by the superb sensitivity of JWST’s Mid-Infrared Instrument Medium-Resolution Spectrometer. These jets are observed only in lines of [Ni ii], [Fe ii], [Ar ii], and [Ne ii]. The H2 emission, imaged in eight distinct transitions, has a completely different morphology, exhibiting a wide-angled, biconical shape, symmetrically distributed about the jet axes. Synergistic high-resolution Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations resolve a pair of side-by-side edge-on accretion disks lying at the origin of the twin mid-infrared jets. Assuming coevality of the components of the young multiple system under investigation, the system age is at least (2–2.5) × 106 yr, despite the discrepantly younger age inferred from the spectral energy distribution of the combined edge-on disk sources. The later system evolutionary stage is corroborated by ALMA observations of CO(2−1), 13CO(2−1), and C18O(2−1), which show no traces of molecular outflows or remnant cavity walls. Consequently, the observed H2 structures must have their origins in wide-angled disk winds, in the absence of any ambient, swept-up gas. In the context of recent studies of protostars, we propose an outflow evolutionary scenario in which the molecular gas component dominates in the youngest sources, whereas the fast, ionized jets dominate in the oldest sources, as is the case for the twin jets discovered in the WL 20 system.

通过对重离子化时期的三维21厘米图像进行分析，研究人员使用密度估计似然无需推断（DELFI）来进行贝叶斯推断，以探索星际介质如何被天体物理源重离子化的参数。研究人员在之前的研究中使用了经过训练的三维卷积神经网络（CNN）来压缩数据，但本文介绍了一种新的数据压缩方法——固体谐波小波散射变换（WST）。他们发现，使用WST结合DELFI的方法在参数的可信区间方面优于之前的方法。此外，他们还应用了热噪声和残余前景去除等影响，证明了新方法的有效性。最后，研究表明，使用固体谐波WST进行21厘米图像分析的效果优于使用21厘米功率谱分析的方法。这项研究为未来利用WST和基于模拟的推断从21厘米光锥图像数据中获得洞见的潜力提供了一个概念验证。 <br /><br />总结: <br />通过对三维21厘米图像进行分析，使用DELFI进行贝叶斯推断以探索重离子化的天体物理源。引入了固体谐波小波散射变换作为数据压缩方法，优于之前的方法。研究还证明了该方法优于使用21厘米功率谱分析。这项研究表明了WST和模拟推断的潜力。 <div>
The information regarding how the intergalactic medium is reionized by astrophysical sources is contained in the tomographic three-dimensional 21 cm images from the epoch of reionization. In Zhao et al. (“Paper I”), we demonstrated for the first time that density estimation likelihood-free inference (DELFI) can be applied efficiently to perform a Bayesian inference of the reionization parameters from the 21 cm images. Nevertheless, the 3D image data needs to be compressed into informative summaries as the input of DELFI by, e.g., a trained 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) as in Paper I (DELFI-3D CNN). Here in this paper, we introduce an alternative data compressor, the solid harmonic wavelet scattering transform (WST), which has a similar, yet fixed (i.e., no training), architecture to CNN, but we show that this approach (i.e., solid harmonic WST with DELFI) outperforms earlier analyses based on 3D 21 cm images using DELFI-3D CNN in terms of credible regions of parameters. Realistic effects, including thermal noise and residual foreground after removal, are also applied to the mock observations from the Square Kilometre Array. We show that under the same inference strategy using DELFI, the 21 cm image analysis with solid harmonic WST outperforms the 21 cm power spectrum analysis. This research serves as a proof of concept, demonstrating the potential to harness the strengths of WST and simulation-based inference to derive insights from future 21 cm light-cone image data.

这项研究介绍了一种基于小波的环形识别方法，并评估了其在二维情景下的可行性。研究首先利用SIMBA暗物质模拟生成了四个伪二维数据集，然后直接计算了连续小波变换（CWT），识别局部最大值代表实际的环形，并对CWT进行分割以勾画环形边界。与传统的朋友-朋友（FOF）方法相比，CWT识别的环形含有的粒子稍少，但在密集区域中具有更光滑的边界和更紧凑的形状。相反，在稀疏区域，CWT方法可以连接更远距离的粒子以形成环形，因为其具有空间分割方案。CWT和FOF环形的空间分布和环形功率谱表明了显著的一致性，验证了CWT在环形检测方面在二维情景下的适用性。虽然该识别方案仅在有限的二维情境下测试，并显示了一些性能限制，但其线性时间复杂度和与FOF方法的一致性表明了其适用于未来分析更大数据集，并有潜力扩展到三维情况。 <br /><br />总结: 连续小波分析在二维环境中被用于暗物质环形识别并在稠密区域具有更光滑和紧凑的边界，对比传统方法具有一定优势。虽然在2D环境中表现良好，但也存在一定的性能限制，但具有线性时间复杂度和与传统方法的一致性，适用于分析更大的数据集，并有潜力扩展到3D情况。 <div>
Continuous wavelet analysis is gaining popularity in science and engineering for its ability to analyze data across both spatial and scale domains simultaneously. In this study, we introduce a wavelet-based method for halo identification and assess its feasibility in two-dimensional (2D) scenarios. We begin by generating four pseudo-2D data sets from the SIMBA dark matter simulation by compressing thin slices of three-dimensional (3D) data into 2D. Subsequently, we calculate the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) directly from the particle distributions, identify local maxima that represent actual halos, and segment the CWT to delineate halo boundaries. A comparison with the traditional friends-of-friends (FOF) method shows that while our CWT-identified halos contain slightly fewer particles, they have smoother boundaries and are more compact in dense regions. In contrast, the CWT method can link particles over greater distances to form halos in sparse regions due to its spatial segmentation scheme. The spatial distribution and halo power spectrum of both CWT and FOF halos demonstrate substantial consistency, validating the 2D applicability of CWT for halo detection. While our identification scheme has been tested solely in a limited 2D context and has shown some performance limitations, its linear time complexity of and consistency with the FOF method suggest its suitability for analyzing significantly larger data sets in the future and its potential to be extended to the 3D case.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章讨论了高银纬度的21厘米H i发射，并指出了它对气尘比的重要性。文章还提到了银河盘外物质的贡献以及其不确定性，以及在小平均红化的视线上它们的存在。文章强调了这些物质对气体浓度和红化的影响，最后得出在高银纬度的合适气体浓度和红化值。 <div>
The λ21 cm H i emission that is used to trace the gas-to-dust ratio at high Galactic latitudes has contributions from material beyond the Milky Way disk, with uncertain and likely subsolar metallicity and dust content. These contributions can be isolated kinematically and their presence is clear for sightlines with small mean reddening 〈E(B − V)〉 ≲ 0.03 mag, which have mean ratios 〈N(H i)〉/〈E(B − V)〉 that are 20%–50% above the high-latitude Galactic average 〈N(H i)〉/〈E(B − V)〉 = 8.3 × 1021 cm−2 mag−1. By mapping N(H i) and E(B − V) across H i high-velocity cloud complexes and the Magellanic Clouds, we show that the reddening of this kinematically isolated gas is on average 5 times smaller per H i than the high-latitude average. However, the aggregate contribution of this gas is small and 〈N(H i)〉/〈E(B − V)〉 = 8.3 × 1021 cm−2 mag−1 is the appropriate value for Galactic gas seen at high latitude using the H i and reddening measures employed here and in our previous work.

总结:<br /><br />
这篇文章介绍了使用哈勃空间望远镜对小麦哲伦星云核心的88颗Cepheid变星进行相位校正的光度测量，将其纳入了与之前测量的Cepheid变星在SH0ES距离梯度上相同的光度系统中。研究限制在内核区域，并对其几何特性进行建模，以减少由于该云的非平凡深度而导致的误差。得到了前所未有的低离散度值为0.102等 mag 的 P-L 关系。通过对15个晚期分离的SMC双星的新几何距离的测量，将星系标示的数量从三个增加到了四个。将SMC纳入到距离梯度中，得到的H0 = 73.17 ± 0.86 km s^-1 Mpc^-1。该基于Cepheid和Ia型超新星的本地H0测量与基于ΛCDM宇宙学的宇宙微波背景得出的值存在5.8σ的张力，加强了ΛCDM以外的物理可能性。 <div>
We present phase-corrected photometric measurements of 88 Cepheid variables in the core of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), the first sample obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope's (HST) Wide Field Camera 3, in the same homogeneous photometric system as past measurements of all Cepheids on the SH0ES distance ladder. We limit the sample to the inner core and model the geometry to reduce errors in prior studies due to the nontrivial depth of this cloud. Without crowding present in ground-based studies, we obtain an unprecedentedly low dispersion of 0.102 mag for a period–luminosity (P–L) relation in the SMC, approaching the width of the Cepheid instability strip. The new geometric distance to 15 late-type detached eclipsing binaries in the SMC offers a rare opportunity to improve the foundation of the distance ladder, increasing the number of calibrating galaxies from three to four. With the SMC as the only anchor, we find H0 = 74.1 ± 2.1 km s−1 Mpc−1. Combining these four geometric distances with our HST photometry of SMC Cepheids, we obtain H0 = 73.17 ± 0.86 km s−1 Mpc−1. By including the SMC in the distance ladder, we also double the range where the metallicity ([Fe/H]) dependence of the Cepheid P–L relation can be calibrated, and we find γ = −0.234 ± 0.052 mag dex−1. Our local measurement of H0 based on Cepheids and Type Ia supernovae shows a 5.8σ tension with the value inferred from the cosmic microwave background assuming a Lambda cold dark matter (ΛCDM) cosmology, reinforcing the possibility of physics beyond ΛCDM.

Solar differential rotation exhibits a prominent feature: its cyclic variations over the solar cycle, referred to as zonal flows or torsional oscillations, are observed throughout the convection zone. Given the challenge of measuring magnetic fields in subsurface layers, understanding deep torsional oscillations becomes pivotal in deciphering the underlying solar dynamo mechanism. In this study, we address the critical question of identifying specific signatures within helioseismic frequency-splitting data associated with the torsional oscillations. To achieve this, a comprehensive forward modeling approach is employed to simulate the helioseismic data for a dynamo model that, to some extent, reproduces solar-cycle variations of magnetic fields and flows. We provide a comprehensive derivation of the forward modeling process utilizing generalized spherical harmonics, as it involves intricate algebraic computations. All estimated frequency-splitting coefficients from the model display an 11 yr periodicity. Using the simulated splitting coefficients and realistic noise, we show that it is possible to identify the dynamo wave signal present in the solar zonal flow from the tachocline to the solar surface. By analyzing observed data, we find similar dynamo wave patterns in the observational data from the Michelson Doppler Imager, Helioseismic Magnetic Imager, and Global Oscillation Network Group. This validates the earlier detection of dynamo waves and holds potential implications for the solar dynamo theory models.

这篇文章研究了低表面亮度星系中螺旋臂的形成和演化。通过使用解析模型和N体+流体动力学模拟，研究了FGC 568-VI和FGC 568-01两个典型低表面亮度星系中螺旋臂的动力学。首先将星盘和气体看作是受球形暗物质晕影响的双组分系统，但没有形成局部的螺旋结构。接下来假设星盘是受到全局m=2不稳定性的影响，螺旋形成的时间较短，对应于这些星系的几个动力学时间。最后使用N体+流体动力学模拟代码RAMSES进行了模拟，结果显示需要一个轴比为0.7的扁平暗物质晕来驱动低表面亮度星系中的长寿命全局螺旋结构。此外，反馈效应对符合观测到的恒星表面密度也是至关重要的。所形成的螺旋臂是受到扁平暗物质晕的潮汐场驱动的瞬态全局结构。 <div>
The formation and evolution of spiral arms in low surface brightness galaxies (LSBs) are not well understood. We study the dynamics of spiral arms in two prototypical LSBs, FGC 568-VI and FGC 568-01, using both analytical models and N-body + hydrodynamical simulations. We first consider the disk as a two-component system of gravitationally coupled stars and gas in the force field of a spherical dark matter halo, subjected to local, nonaxisymmetric perturbations. However, no local spirals are formed. We next assume the disk to be a one-component system of stars in the net gravitational potential of a galaxy with a spherical dark matter halo perturbed by a global m = 2 instability. In this case, the growth time for spiral formation was low, equal to 0.78 and 0.96 Gyr, respectively, corresponding to a few dynamical times of the galaxies. Finally, we simulate the LSBs using the N-body + hydrodynamical simulation code RAMSES. Our results show that a quadrupolar field associated with an oblate halo with an axial ratio of 0.7 is necessary to drive a long-lived global spiral in the LSB disks. Further, feedback corresponding to a supernova mass fraction of ∼0.05 is essential to comply with the observed stellar surface density. The simulated spirals survive for about 10 dynamical times and the average pattern speed lies between 10 and 15 km s−1 kpc−1. The spiral arms thus formed are therefore a transient global pattern driven by the tidal field of the oblate dark matter halo.

With the aid of high-resolution spatial and temporal observations from the Goode Solar Telescope, we present an investigation of the emergence, coalescence, and submergence of a moving magnetic feature (MMF) in the region surrounding a magnetic pore located at the periphery of a large sunspot. The results show that the MMF has a magnetic field strength greater than 500 G and is dominated by the horizontal magnetic component. We observe upflow at the inner part and downflow at the outer part, indicating a pattern of Evershed flow. The MMF emergence is accompanied by the expansion of a granule, which has several striations inside just like the twisted features found in the penumbra filament. Our analysis shows that although these striations have different properties of magnetic field and kinematics during the expansion of the granule, the overall magnetic and dynamic properties of the MMF remain stable. We find that the region where the MMF emerges and submerges becomes more penumbra-like, i.e., adjacent positive and negative values of elongated magnetic features that are parallel to each other, while the optical penumbra-like features are not apparent at the same time. Our work indicates that the dynamics of the MMF near the magnetic pore is important for the development of filamentary structure. The magnetic configuration produced by an MMF together with the elongation of a granule could thus be key to understand the formation of penumbra filaments.

We present an in-depth, high-resolution spectroscopic analysis of the M dwarf K2-18, which hosts a sub-Neptune exoplanet in its habitable zone. We show our technique to accurately normalize the observed spectrum, which is crucial for a proper spectral fitting. We also introduce a new automatic, line-by-line, model-fitting code, AutoSpecFit, which performs an iterative χ2 minimization process to measure individual elemental abundances of cool dwarfs. We apply this code to the star K2-18, and measure the abundance of 10 elements: C, O, Na, Mg, Al, K, Ca, Sc, Ti, and Fe. We find these abundances to be moderately supersolar, except for Fe, with a slightly subsolar abundance. The accuracy of the inferred abundances is limited by the systematic errors due to uncertain stellar parameters. We also derive the abundance ratios associated with several planet-building elements such as Al/Mg, Ca/Mg, Fe/Mg, and (a solar-like) C/O = 0.568 ± 0.026, which can be used to constrain the chemical composition and the formation location of the exoplanet. On the other hand, the planet K2-18 b has attracted considerable interest, given the JWST measurements of its atmospheric composition. Early JWST studies reveal an unusual chemistry for the atmosphere of this planet, which is unlikely to be driven by formation in a disk of unusual composition. The comparison between the chemical abundances of K2-18 b from future JWST analyses and those of the host star can provide fundamental insights into the formation of this planetary system.

<div> 关键词: 极化观测, 脉冲星, 模式转换, 结果模型, 偏振分数

总结:
极化观测显示，射电脉冲星的极化矢量位置角度会出现突然转变，伴随着偏振矢量的椭圆度角度大幅变化，表明矢量经过了Poincaré球的右或左圆极点附近。这些角度的行为可以通过正交极化模式的支配权的转变或者相位差变化导致的矢量旋转来解释。研究了四种极化模型以量化和理解在模式转换时角度的行为。结果表明，模型的结果可能相似，表示在特定模型背景下对观测到的转变的解释并不唯一。发射的极化分数和平均椭圆度角取决于模式强度波动的统计特性。偏振分数随着波动的增加而增加。当模式强度近似稳定时，椭圆度角的变化会很大，而当强度波动较大时则会被抑制。 <div>
Polarization observations of radio pulsars show that abrupt transitions in the polarization vector’s position angle can be accompanied by large excursions in the vector’s ellipticity angle, suggesting the vector passes near the right or left circular pole of the Poincaré sphere. The behavior of the angles can be explained by a transition in dominance of the orthogonal polarization modes or a vector rotation caused by a change in the phase difference between the modes. Four polarization models are examined to quantify and understand the behavior of the angles at a mode transition: coherent polarization modes, partially coherent modes, incoherent modes with nonorthogonal polarization vectors, and incoherent orthogonal modes with an elliptically polarized emission component. In all four models, the trajectory of the mode transition on the Poincaré sphere follows the geodesic that connects the orientations of the mode polarization vectors. The results from the models can be similar, indicating that the interpretation of an observed transition within the context of a particular model is not necessarily unique. The polarization fraction of the emission and the average ellipticity angle depend upon the statistical character of the mode intensity fluctuations. The polarization fraction increases as the fluctuations increase. The excursion in ellipticity angle can be large when the mode intensities are quasi-stable and is suppressed when the intensity fluctuations are large.

Turbulent diffuse molecular clouds can exhibit complicated morphologies caused by the interactions among radiation, chemistry, fluids, and fields. We performed full 3D simulations for turbulent diffuse molecular interstellar media, featuring time-dependent nonequilibrium thermochemistry coevolved with magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). Simulation results exhibit the relative abundances of key chemical species (e.g., C, CO, OH) vary by more than one order of magnitude for the “premature” epoch of chemical evolution (t ≲ 2 × 105 yr). Various simulations are also conducted to study the impacts of physical parameters. Nonideal MHD effects are essential in shaping the behavior of gases, and strong magnetic fields (∼10 μG) tend to inhibit vigorous compressions and thus reduce the fraction of warm gases (T ≳ 102 K). Thermodynamical and chemical conditions of the gas are sensitive to modulation by dynamic conditions, especially the energy injection by turbulence. Chemical features, including ionization (cosmic ray and diffuse interstellar radiation), would not directly affect the turbulence power spectra. Nonetheless, their effects are prominent in the distribution profiles of temperatures and gas densities. Comprehensive observations are necessary and useful to eliminate the degeneracies of physical parameters and constrain the properties of diffuse molecular clouds with confidence.

这篇文章研究了早期年轻太阳活动所产生的宇宙射线通量。通过测量在陨石中保存的宇宙射线产生核素的浓度，以及早期原行星盘中尘埃传输的物理模型，科学家们确定了早期宇宙射线通量的大小。他们发现，在早期形成的耐烧矿物独居石中，年轻太阳的宇宙射线通量高达约7个数量级。这一估计结果与天文观测数据一致，进一步证实了早期年轻太阳产生的宇宙射线通量显著增加。这项研究有助于解释原始行星材料中超量的宇宙射裂缝核素，并加深了对早期太阳活动的认识。
<br /><br />总结: 该研究确定了早期太阳活动所产生的宇宙射线通量的大小，并发现年轻太阳的宇宙射线通量比当今水平高出约7个数量级。这一估计结果与天文观测数据一致，进一步证实了早期年轻太阳产生的宇宙射线通量显著增加。 <div>
An enhancement in the activity of the early young Sun resulting in a high charged particle flux has been invoked to explain excesses in spallation-induced nuclides in primitive planetary materials. Astronomical observations of energetic outbursts of young stellar objects (YSOs) also support the idea of an active young Sun. However, the early solar cosmic-ray (SCR) flux has not been well constrained. Here we use measured concentrations of SCR-produced nuclides that formed and are preserved in meteoritical hibonite and spinel, some of the solar system’s oldest solids, and physical models for dust transport in the early protoplanetary disk to determine the magnitude of the early SCR flux. We focus our attention on cosmogenic neon, which cannot have been inherited from precursors and can only be produced in situ in solids. Our modeled effective exposure time to SCRs for these solids is very short, on the order of years. This indicates that the young Sun’s SCR flux recorded in refractory mineral hibonite was up to ∼7 orders of magnitude higher than the contemporary level. Our flux estimate is consistent with the >105× enhanced flux inferred from astronomical observations of greatly enhanced flare activities of YSOs.

<br />主序星在中等光谱类型的中转时，从缓慢旋转（较冷的恒星）向快速旋转（较热的恒星）转变，这一转变被称为克拉夫特断裂，归因于外对流包层的消失，导致磁制动变得无效。研究汇总了405颗距离为33.33 pc的F型恒星的光谱测量数据。在剔除了年轻、进化和候选双星后，投影旋转速度的分布表明断裂是明确定义并相对明显的。几乎所有红于GBP − GRP = 0.60 mag的恒星都是缓慢旋转的（vsini ≲20 km s−1），而比GBP − GRP = 0.54 mag更蓝的32颗恒星中只有4颗是缓慢旋转的，与随机倾斜分布的预期一致。断裂点位于有效温度为6550 K处，宽度约为200 K，相当于1.32–1.41 M⊙的质量范围。断裂点比热木星显示出倾斜分布变化的恒星温度高约450 K，后者通常被归因于潮汐重新定位。上述定义的断裂点在大约650百万年的昴星团中几乎但并非完全建立；它应在1亿年以上的星团中确立。我们建议，克拉夫特断裂为所谓的低质量恒星和中质量恒星之间提供了更有用的划分，无论从专业或教学的目的来看，克拉夫特断裂都有明确的观测定义，并与恒星结构的变化有关。<br /><br />总结: 主序星在中等光谱类型的中转时，从缓慢旋转（较冷的恒星）向快速旋转（较热的恒星）转变，这一转变被称为克拉夫特断裂。在特定的有效温度和质量范围内，这一断裂点是明确定义的。克拉夫特断裂提供了一个更有用的划分，可以用于区分低质量恒星和中质量恒星，并与恒星结构的变化有关。 <div>
Main-sequence stars transition at mid-F spectral types from slowly rotating (cooler stars) to rapidly rotating (hotter stars), a transition known as the Kraft Break and attributed to the disappearance of the outer convective envelope, causing magnetic braking to become ineffective. To define this Break more precisely, we assembled spectroscopic measurements of 405 F stars within 33.33 pc. Once young, evolved, and candidate binary stars are removed, the distribution of projected rotational velocities shows the Break to be well defined and relatively sharp. Nearly all stars redder than GBP − GRP = 0.60 mag are slowly rotating (vsini ≲20 km s−1), while only 4 of 32 stars bluer than GBP − GRP = 0.54 mag are slowly rotating, consistent with that expected for a random distribution of inclinations. The Break is centered at an effective temperature of 6550 K and has a width of about 200 K, corresponding to a mass range of 1.32–1.41 M⊙. The Break is ∼450 K hotter than the stellar temperature at which hot Jupiters show a change in their obliquity distribution, often attributed to tidal realignment. The Break, as defined above, is nearly but not fully established in the ∼650 Myr Hyades cluster; it should be established in populations older than 1 Gyr. We propose that the Kraft Break provides a more useful division, for both professional and pedagogical purposes, between what are called low-mass stars and intermediate-mass stars; the Kraft Break is observationally well defined and is linked to a change in stellar structure.

<br />总结:
恒星形成星系和非恒星形成星系都有反转的恒星盘结构。通过DESI g、r、z彩色图像不显示星系合并的迹象，暗示了气体吸积是形成反转恒星盘的动力源。对恒星速度场的可见反转，可以确定内外两个主要恒星盘的边界。在恒星形成星系的内区，恒星和电离气体是共转的，并且恒星群是较年轻的。比较内外两个区域的恒星形成主序关系显示出内区域的增强恒星形成活动。而在非恒星形成星系的外区，恒星和电离气体也是共转的，恒星群也是较年轻的。比较内外两个区域的恒星质量-金属丰度关系表明了外区域的气体相对富含金属。考虑到非恒星形成星系中较为不充分的既有气体，外部吸积的气体可以保存角动量，从而促进了外区域的恒星形成。总的来说，气体吸积对恒星形成星系和非恒星形成星系的演化产生了不同的影响。 <div>
Using integral field spectroscopic data from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory survey, we investigate the spatially resolved properties and empirical relations of a star-forming galaxy and a non-star-forming galaxy hosting counterrotating stellar disks (CRDs). The DESI g, r, z color images reveal no evidence of merger remnants in either galaxy, suggesting that gas accretion fuels the formation of CRDs. Based on the visible counterrotation in the stellar velocity field, we can fit a spatial boundary to distinguish the inner and outer regions dominated by two stellar disks in each galaxy. In the inner region of the star-forming CRDs, stars are corotating with ionized gas, and the stellar population is younger. Comparison of the star-forming main-sequence relations between the inner and outer regions reveals enhanced star formation in the inner region. Given the abundant preexisting gas in the star-forming galaxy, collisions between preexisting and external gas efficiently consume angular momentum, triggering star formation in the inner region. Conversely, in the outer region of the non-star-forming CRDs, stars are corotating with ionized gas, and the stellar population is younger. Comparison of the stellar mass–metallicity relations between the inner and outer regions indicates enriched gas-phase metallicity in the outer region. Considering the less abundant preexisting gas in the non-star-forming galaxy, external gas could preserve angular momentum, fueling star formation in the outer region. Overall, gas accretion exhibits different influences on the evolution of star-forming and non-star-forming galaxies.

总结: <br />
本研究提出了一个新的参数化透镜模型，用于G165.7+67.0星系团。通过Planck发现了这个星系团，其亮子毫米通量来自一对非同寻常的尘埃星系形成星系(DSFGs)，它们的红移约为2.2。通过JWST和干涉毫米/射电观测，我们表征了DSFGs的内在物理性质，它们在源平面上仅相隔约1″(8千秒差距)，速度差ΔV ≲ 600 km s−1，因此可能正在经历一次重要的合并。拥有内在星形成速率SFRIR = 320 ± 70和400 ± 80 M⊙ yr−1，恒星质量为10.3 ± 0.1，尘埃衰减为AV = 1.5 ± 0.3和1.2 ± 0.3，它们是非常相似的天体。我们使用JWST/NIRCam的近似UV至近IR成像进行像素级别的空间分辨光谱能量分布(SED)拟合，解析了一些恒星结构，达到100光差距的尺度。基于其解析的比星形成速率(SFRs)和UVJ颜色，两个DSFGs都正在经历重大的星系规模的星形成事件。如果它们确实在引力上相互作用，这种强烈的星暴可能是气体已经被初次接近的通道破坏的标志。相比之下，SN H0pe的宿主星系其SFR比DSFGs低得多，并且我们呈现了在低比星形成速率区域内内向外熄灭和大尘埃柱密度的证据。基于从UV到远红外SED建模推断的DSFGs的内在SFRs，单单这对物体预计每年将产生可观测的1.1 ± 0.2个核心坍缩超新星，使得该星团领域适合持续监测。 <div>
We present a new parametric lens model for the G165.7+67.0 galaxy cluster, which was discovered with Planck through its bright submillimeter flux, originating from a pair of extraordinary dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at z ≈ 2.2. Using JWST and interferometric mm/radio observations, we characterize the intrinsic physical properties of the DSFGs, which are separated by only ∼1″ (8 kpc) and a velocity difference ΔV ≲ 600 km s−1 in the source plane, and thus are likely undergoing a major merger. Boasting intrinsic star formation rates SFRIR = 320 ± 70 and 400 ± 80 M⊙ yr−1, stellar masses of and 10.3 ± 0.1, and dust attenuations of AV = 1.5 ± 0.3 and 1.2 ± 0.3, they are remarkably similar objects. We perform spatially resolved pixel-by-pixel spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting using rest-frame near-UV to near-IR imaging from JWST/NIRCam for both galaxies, resolving some stellar structures down to 100 pc scales. Based on their resolved specific star formation rates (SFRs) and UVJ colors, both DSFGs are experiencing significant galaxy-scale star formation events. If they are indeed interacting gravitationally, this strong starburst could be the hallmark of gas that has been disrupted by an initial close passage. In contrast, the host galaxy of SN H0pe has a much lower SFR than the DSFGs, and we present evidence for the onset of inside-out quenching and large column densities of dust even in regions of low specific SFR. Based on the intrinsic SFRs of the DSFGs inferred from UV through far-infrared SED modeling, this pair of objects alone is predicted to yield an observable 1.1 ± 0.2 core-collapse supernovae per year, making this cluster field ripe for continued monitoring.

<div> 磁场波动，行星间空间，太阳风，湍流，频率-波数谱模型

总结:<br /><br />本文研究了通过Voyager航天器在行星间空间中测量的磁场波动。研究发现，由于太阳风速度变得次音速并且慢于快磁音速，标准的Taylor假设不再适用。为了解决这一问题，引入了一个4D频率-波数谱模型以分解不同的波模式。研究考虑了各种波模式，包括等离子体阿尔文模式、快磁模式和通过三流体理论得到的两种色散快磁波模式。研究发现，内部行星间空间的磁场波动并不像之前认为的那样压缩，而具有大约25%的可压缩波动能量。同时，热揽收离子和相对较冷的太阳风离子在垂直传播限制下引起了两种色散快磁波模式，其中揽收离子快波可能解释了可观测频谱中质子旋频率附近的谱凸起。最后，研究指出湍流波数谱可能并非Kolmogorov样式，而是依赖于各种波模式之间的功率分配，这种分配可能随着波数的变化而改变。 <div>
Magnetic field fluctuations measured in the heliosheath by the Voyager spacecraft are often characterized as compressible, as indicated by a strong fluctuating component parallel to the mean magnetic field. However, the interpretation of the turbulence data faces the caveat that the standard Taylor’s hypothesis is invalid because the solar wind flow velocity in the heliosheath becomes subsonic and slower than the fast magnetosonic speed, given the contributions from hot pickup ions (PUIs) in the heliosheath. We attempt to overcome this caveat by introducing a 4D frequency-wavenumber spectral modeling of turbulence, which is essentially a decomposition of different wave modes following their respective dispersion relations. Isotropic Alfvén and fast mode turbulence are considered to represent the heliosheath fluctuations. We also include two dispersive fast wave modes derived from a three-fluid theory. We find that (1) magnetic fluctuations in the inner heliosheath are less compressible than previously thought, an isotropic turbulence spectral model with about 25% in compressible fluctuation power is consistent with the observed magnetic compressibility in the heliosheath; (2) the hot PUI component and the relatively cold solar wind ions induce two dispersive fast magnetosonic wave branches in the perpendicular propagation limit, PUI fast wave may account for the spectral bump near the proton gyrofrequency in the observable spectrum; (3) it is possible that the turbulence wavenumber spectrum is not Kolmogorov-like although the observed frequency spectrum has a −5/3 power-law index, depending on the partitioning of power among the various wave modes, and this partitioning may change with wavenumber.

<div> 星际射线，离子化，模拟，星团形成，宇宙射线传输
<br />
在这项研究中，我们进行了包括宇宙射线传输（CRT）的星团形成的数值模拟。我们发现，在类似银河系的环境中，宇宙射线在主要的星形成时期对云的离子化率影响有限。然而，在高宇宙射线环境中，云中的宇宙射线分布升高，导致云的较早坍缩和星形成效率增加约50％至约13％。初始质量函数在所有情况下都相似，但在高宇宙射线环境中可能会有变化。需要进一步的研究来解释观察到的分子云中的离子化率范围，并探索极端宇宙射线环境中的星形成情况。
<br /><br />总结： <div>
Cosmic rays (CRs) are the primary driver of ionization in star-forming molecular clouds (MCs). Despite their potential impacts on gas dynamics and chemistry, no simulations of star cluster formation following the creation of individual stars have included explicit cosmic-ray transport (CRT) to date. We conduct the first numerical simulations following the collapse of a 2000M⊙ MC and the subsequent star formation including CRT using the STAR FORmation in Gaseous Environments framework implemented in the GIZMO code. We show that when CRT is streaming-dominated, the CR energy in the cloud is strongly attenuated due to energy losses from the streaming instability. Consequently, in a Milky Way–like environment the median CR ionization rate in the cloud is low (ζ ≲ 2 × 10−19 s−1) during the main star-forming epoch of the calculation and the impact of CRs on the star formation in the cloud is limited. However, in high-CR environments, the CR distribution in the cloud is elevated (ζ ≲ 6 × 10−18), and the relatively higher CR pressure outside the cloud causes slightly earlier cloud collapse and increases the star formation efficiency by 50% to ∼13%. The initial mass function is similar in all cases except with possible variations in a high-CR environment. Further studies are needed to explain the range of ionization rates observed in MCs and explore star formation in extreme CR environments.

We report the identification of 15 galaxy candidates at z ≥ 9 using the initial COSMOS-Web JWST observations over 77 arcmin2 through four Near Infrared Camera filters (F115W, F150W, F277W, and F444W) with an overlap with the Mid-Infrared Imager (F770W) of 8.7 arcmin2. We fit the sample using several publicly available spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting and photometric redshift codes and determine their redshifts between z = 9.3 and z = 10.9 (〈z〉 = 10.0), UV magnitudes between MUV = −21.2 and −19.5 (with 〈MUV〉 = −20.2), and rest-frame UV slopes (〈β〉 = −2.4). These galaxies are, on average, more luminous than most z ≥ 9 candidates discovered by JWST so far in the literature, while exhibiting similar blue colors in their rest-frame UV. The rest-frame UV slopes derived from SED fitting are blue (β ∼ [−2.0, −2.7]) without reaching extremely blue values as reported in other recent studies at these redshifts. The blue color is consistent with models that suggest the underlying stellar population is not yet fully enriched in metals like similarly luminous galaxies in the lower-redshift Universe. The derived stellar masses with M⋆/M⊙)〉 ≈ 8–9 are not in tension with the standard Lambda cold dark matter (ΛCDM) model, and our measurement of the volume density of such UV-luminous galaxies aligns well with previously measured values presented in the literature at z ∼ 9–10. Our sample of galaxies, although compact, is significantly resolved.

Photons that decouple from a relativistic jet do so over a range of radii, leading to a spreading in arrival times at the observer. Therefore, changes to the comoving photon distribution across the decoupling zone are encoded in the emitted signal. In this paper, we study such spectral evolution occurring across a pulse. We track the radiation from the deep subphotospheric regions all the way to the observed time-resolved signal, accounting for emission at various angles and radii. We assume a simple power-law photon spectrum injection over a range of optical depths and let the photons interact with the local plasma. At high optical depths, we find that the radiation exists in one of three characteristic regimes, two of which exhibit a high-energy power law. Depending on the nature of the injection, this power law can persist to low optical depths and manifest itself during the rise time of the pulse with a spectral index β ≈ α − 1, where α is the low-energy spectral index. The results are given in the context of a gamma-ray burst jet, but are general to optically thick, relativistic outflows.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章讨论了行星际激波加速粒子的观测能谱与理论预测之间的不匹配问题。研究发现，在某些情况下，粒子通量在广泛能量范围内形成一个高原，延伸到激波上游长达七个通量倍数，然后消失在背景谱中。此外，在激波处和下游，粒子通量按能量的倒数下降，与激波加速理论的预测一致。这表明了一种与传统激波加速模型中的粒子输运机制不同的现象。研究者对激波加速理论进行了修改，包括引入粒子扩散率与粒子通量的依赖关系（非线性输运）以及磁场扰动的作用。这些修改使得模型能够解释观测到的上游高原能谱现象。他们还推测，除了时间相关性之外，上游能谱的非单调空间变化可能还来自于非激波加速机制的作用，例如随机费米加速或磁泵加速。 <div>
The observed energy spectra of accelerated particles at interplanetary shocks often do not match the diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) theory predictions. In some cases, the particle flux forms a plateau over a wide range of energies, extending upstream of the shock for up to seven flux e-folds before submerging into the background spectrum. Remarkably, at and downstream of the shock we have studied in detail, the flux falls off in energy as ϵ−1, consistent with the DSA prediction for a strong shock. The upstream plateau suggests a particle transport mechanism different from those traditionally employed in DSA models. We show that a standard (linear) DSA solution based on a widely accepted diffusive particle transport with an underlying resonant wave–particle interaction is inconsistent with the plateau in the particle flux. To resolve this contradiction, we modify the DSA theory in two ways. First, we include a dependence of the particle diffusivity κ on the particle flux F (nonlinear particle transport). Second, we invoke short-scale magnetic perturbations that are self-consistently generated by, but not resonant with, accelerated particles. They lead to the particle diffusivity increasing with the particle energy as ∝ϵ3/2 that simultaneously decreases with the particle flux as 1/F. The combination of these two trends results in the flat spectrum upstream. We speculate that nonmonotonic spatial variations of the upstream spectrum, apart from being time-dependent, may also result from non-DSA acceleration mechanisms at work upstream, such as stochastic Fermi or magnetic pumping acceleration.

总结: 本文报告了在太阳冠中电流片动态变薄过程中，通过三维磁流体力学模拟首次观测到磁重连接通过撕裂不稳定性开始的初始结果。在所有模拟中，非线性撕裂不稳定性的发生都要在不稳定增长时间比动态变薄时间更快之后才会出现，进而导致电流片的破裂。此外，与之前对太阳冠静态电流片的三维磁流体力学模拟结果相似，对于一些参数来说，磁场的剪切程度是一个重要的开关参数，这对于太阳冠加热模型有重要意义。这些结果可能为利用可观测的太阳冠电流片的数量来预测它们何时会破裂并释放磁能以驱动各种活跃现象和/或加热大气层提供了可能。 <div>
We present the first results of three-dimensional (3D) numerical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the onset of magnetic reconnection via the tearing instability in dynamically thinning current sheets in the solar corona. In all our simulations, the onset of the nonlinear tearing instability, which leads to the breakup of the thinning current sheet, does not occur until after the instability growth time becomes faster than the dynamic thinning time. Furthermore, as in previous 3D MHD simulations of static current sheets in the corona, for some parameters the amount of magnetic shear is a fundamental switch-on parameter, which has consequences for coronal heating models. These results open up the possibility of using observable quantities of coronal current sheets to predict when they will break up and release magnetic energy to power various energetic phenomena and/or heat the atmosphere.

Circularly polarized waves consistent with parallel-propagating ion cyclotron waves (ICWs) and fast magnetosonic waves (FMWs) are often observed by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) at ion kinetic scales. Such waves damp energy via cyclotron resonance, and cyclotron damping is expected to play a significant role in the enhanced, anisotropic heating of the solar wind observed in the inner heliosphere. We employ a linear plasma dispersion solver, PLUME, to evaluate the frequencies of ICWs and FMWs in the plasma rest frame and Doppler-shift them to the spacecraft frame, calculating their damping rates at frequencies where persistently high values of circular polarization are observed. We find that such ion-scale waves are observed during 20.37% of PSP Encounters 1 and 2 observations and their plasma frame frequencies are consistent with them being transient ICWs. We estimate significant ICW dissipation onto protons, consistent with previous empirical estimates for the total turbulent damping rates, indicating that ICW dissipation could account for the observed enhancements in the proton temperature and its anisotropy with respect to the mean magnetic field.

<div> 黑寡妇蜘蛛毫秒脉冲星，轨道相位依赖分析，磁场环境调查，偏振观测，射电望远镜，J0024−7204J，J1431−4715，J1959+2048，脉冲辐射去极化，转动测量值，脉冲截止频率。
<br /><br />总结:
本研究利用Parkes Murriyang射电望远镜的超宽带低频接收机进行了三颗黑寡妇蜘蛛毫秒脉冲星（BW MSPs）的轨道相位依赖分析，旨在调查日食环境中的磁场。观测到了J0024−7204J，J1431−4715和J1959+2048三个BW MSPs的脉冲辐射在日食相位出现了去极化现象，与其他BW MSPs的先前研究结果一致。我们估计了这些MSPs的轨道相位依赖旋转测量值。宽带观测还为这些BW MSPs的日食截止频率提供了限制。对于J0024−7204J，我们报告了日食截止频率的时间变化，并伴随观察到的六次日食中电子柱密度的变化。此外，对于J1431−4715，确定了1251±80 MHz的截止频率，得出了电子在日食过程中的主要吸收机制为同步辐射。此外，对于J1959+2048，估计的截止频率超过了1400 MHz，与先前的研究结果一致。通过这项调查，我们将具有轨道相位分辨率研究的BW MSPs样本数量增加了一倍，从而更好地探测了日食环境。 <div>
This study presents an orbital-phase-dependent analysis of three black widow spider millisecond pulsars (BW MSPs), aiming to investigate the magnetic field within the eclipse environment. The ultrawide-bandwidth low-frequency receiver of the Parkes Murriyang radio telescope is utilized for full polarization observations covering frequencies from 704−4032 MHz. Depolarization of pulsed emission is observed during the eclipse phase of three BW MSPs, namely PSR J0024−7204J, PSR J1431−4715, and PSR J1959+2048, consistent with previous studies of other BW MSPs. We estimated orbital-phase-dependent rotation measure values for these MSPs. The wide bandwidth observations also provided constraints on the eclipse cutoff frequency for these BW MSPs. For PSR J0024−7204J, we report temporal variation of the eclipse cutoff frequency coupled with changes in the electron column density within the eclipse medium across six observed eclipses. Moreover, the eclipse cutoff frequency for PSR J1431−4715 is determined to be 1251 ± 80 MHz, leading to the conclusion that synchrotron absorption is the primary mechanism responsible for the eclipsing. Additionally, for PSR J1959+2048, the estimated cutoff frequency exceeded 1400 MHz, consistent with previous studies. With this investigation, we have doubled the sample size of BW MSPs with orbital-phase-resolved studies, allowing a better probe of the eclipse environment.

总结:
本文对由恒星双体和质量可忽略的局部等温粘性吸积盘构成的系统进行了分析和数值研究。我们在短时间尺度上通过周期轨道的稳定性以及长时间尺度上通过共振扭矩的概念研究了双星引力势对系统的影响。通过二维牛顿模拟，我们发现数值模拟的结果与先前研究一致。此外，我们通过比较分析和数值结果表明，圆环间隙在轨道时间尺度上通过周期性不稳定性的驱动而维持，而不依赖于共振扭矩，与标准传统看法相反。尽管我们的结果适用于任何粘性吸积盘系统，但我们强调了这个结果在寻找超大质量黑洞双星的电磁和引力波特征上的重要性。<br /><br /> <div>
We present an analytical and numerical study of a system composed of a stellar binary pair and a massless, locally isothermal viscous accretion disk that is coplanar to the binary orbital plane. Analytically, we study the effect of the binary’s gravitational potential over short timescales through the stability of epicyclic orbits, and over long timescales by revisiting the concept of resonant torques. Numerically, we perform two-dimensional Newtonian simulations of the disk-binary system over a range of binary mass ratios. We find that the results of our simulations are consistent with those of previous numerical studies. We additionally show, by comparison of the analytical and numerical results, that the circumbinary gap is maintained on the orbital timescale through the driving of epicyclic instabilities, and does not depend on resonant torquing, contrary to the standard lore. While our results are applicable to any disk-binary system, we highlight the importance of this result in the search for electromagnetic and gravitational-wave signatures from supermassive black hole binaries.

<div> potential energy surface, ab initio, quasi-classical trajectory, interstellar medium, reaction rate coefficients
<br /><br />总结:
本文讨论了HCN + H−反应作为形成CN−的途径，以及在数个星际环境中观察到的最小的氰多炔负离子。首先通过完整的5D表示得到了新的从头算反应势能面，其中只保持C-N键不变，讨论了用于得到动力学精确拟合的神经网络程序。然后利用准经典轨迹方法研究了反应在暗分子云的低温范围内的情况，并将计算扩展到室温以成功地与现有的实验数据进行比较。我们进一步介绍了反应的降维建模，将其作为包含长程力的2D过渡态处理，并讨论了这些力在产生大的反应速率系数方面的主导作用，这两种处理方法得到的反应速率系数在50至300K温度范围内的大小和行为非常相似。我们讨论了这些结果对于CN−物种在星际介质中通过这种化学途径形成的影响，并建议它相对于最近计算得到的辐射电子附着途径的速率系数来说更为重要，后者的速率系数小得多。 <div>
We discuss the HCN + H− reaction as a path to the formation of CN−, the smallest cyanopolyyne anion observed in several interstellar environments. We first obtain the new ab initio reactive potential energy surface using a full 5D representation, where only the C–N bond is kept fixed, and discuss the neural network procedure employed to yield an accurate fit for the dynamics. The reaction is then investigated by using a quasi-classical trajectory approach to scan the low-temperature range of the dark molecular clouds where the anion has been sighted. Calculations are extended to room temperature to make a successful comparison with existing experimental data. We further present reduced dimensionality modeling of the reaction as a 2D process within a variational-transition state treatment with the inclusion of long-range forces. The dominant role of such forces in producing large reaction rate coefficients is discussed for both treatments, which yield very similar sizes and behavior of such coefficients from 50 to 300 K. The implications of our results for the interstellar medium formation of the CN− species via this chemical route are discussed, suggesting its greater significance over the radiative electron attachment paths, whose rate coefficients were found by recent calculations to be orders of magnitude smaller.

<div> 关键词: THINGS galaxies, H i surface densities, star formation rate, outer disks, Very Large Array

总结: 
本研究更新了17个THINGS星系的H i表面密度测量，通过解决原始Very Large Array (VLA) H i图像的短间距问题。更新基于将原始THINGS VLA H i图像与FEASTS项目中FAST单天线接收器拍摄的H i图像相结合。在外部盘中，H i表面密度的中位数增量为0.15–0.4 dex。一些星系的径向剖面H i表面密度发生显著变化，七个星系的H i尺寸-质量关系现在低于1σ。更新了外部盘中的H i星形成定律，H i表面密度和星形成速率表面密度的中位数关系下移约0.15 dex，散射显著增加。星形成效率的散射与恒星质量面密度的相关性更强。因此，探测到以前由于Very Large Array观测的短间距问题而未能检测到的弥散H i对于揭示由外部盘的局部环境中可能受到星际反馈调节的星际物质的真实状态和变化很重要。 <div>
We update the H i surface density measurements for a subset of 17 THINGS galaxies by dealing with the short-spacing problem of the original Very Large Array (VLA) H i images. It is the same sample that Bigiel et al. used to study the relation between H i surface densities and star formation (SF) rate surface densities in galaxy outer disks, which are beyond the optical radius r25. For 10 galaxies, the update is based on combining original THINGS VLA H i images with H i images taken by the single-dish FAST in the FEASTS program. The median increment of H i surface densities in outer disks is 0.15–0.4 dex at a given new H i surface density. Several galaxies change significantly in the shape of radial profiles H i surface densities, and seven galaxies are now more than 1σ below the H i size–mass relation. We update the H i star formation laws in outer disks. The median relation between the H i surface densities and SF rate surface densities based on pixel-wise measurements shifts downward by around 0.15 dex because the H i surface density values shift rightward, and the scatter increases significantly. The scatter of the relation, indicating the star-forming efficiency, exhibits a much stronger positive correlation with the stellar mass surface density than before. Thus, detecting the previously missed, diffuse H i due to the short-spacing problem of the Very Large Array observations is important in revealing the true condition and variation in SF possibly regulated by stellar feedbacks in the localized environment of outer disks.

<br />总结:<br />这篇文章研究了超新星与密度均匀的环绕介质相互作用的光度曲线模型。研究发现，激波爆发、逆激波向内部超新星喷发的传播和激波脱离密集环绕介质是决定光度曲线特征的关键过程。基于这些过程的存在和优先级，研究将相互作用超新星的光度曲线分类为五种不同的形态。研究还表明，环绕介质的密度分布对相互作用超新星光度曲线的多样性起着重要作用。此外，模型还能够定性地重现光度曲线具有两个峰值且相距几十天的双峰超新星，如SN 2005bf和SN 2022xxf。 <div>
Interaction between supernova (SN) ejecta and dense circumstellar medium (CSM) with a flat density structure (ρ ∝ r−s, s < 1.5) was recently proposed as a possible mechanism behind interacting SNe that exhibit exceptionally long rise times exceeding 100 days. In such a configuration, the interaction luminosity keeps rising until the reverse shock propagates into the inner layers of the SN ejecta. We investigate the light curves of SNe interacting with a flatly distributed CSM in detail, incorporating the effects of photon diffusion inside the CSM into the model. We show that three physical processes—the shock breakout, the propagation of the reverse shock into the inner ejecta, and the departure of the shock from the dense CSM—predominantly determine the qualitative behavior of the light curves. Based on the presence and precedence of these processes, the light curves of SNe interacting with flatly distributed CSM can be classified into five distinct morphological classes. We also show that our model can qualitatively reproduce doubly peaked SNe whose peaks are a few tens of days apart, such as SN 2005bf and SN 2022xxf. Our results show that the density distribution of the CSM is an important property of CSM that contributes to the diversity in light curves of interacting SNe.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了小行星龙宫的遥感观测和实验室测量，发现其含水硅酸盐因太空风化而脱水/脱羟化。通过反应性分子动力学模拟，发现在没有行星间磁场的情况下，小行星撞击可以使富镁蛇纹石发生脱羟化，甚至2纳米大小的微流星体就能够造成这种影响。当纳米尺寸的尘埃颗粒被太阳风等离子体的磁场加速至约300公里/秒时，脱羟化反应数量增加了一个数量级。此外，即使1纳米大小的尘埃颗粒也能促成龙宫小行星的太空风化。总的来说，这些研究表明微小的流星体轰击可能对小行星的太空风化产生影响。 <div>
Remote sensing observations by Hayabusa2 and laboratory measurements have revealed that the phyllosilicates on asteroid (162173) Ryugu are dehydrated/dehydroxylated due to space weathering. Reactive molecular dynamics simulations were performed to evaluate the magnitude of the dehydroxylation of Mg-rich serpentine by micrometeoroid impacts. When micrometeoroids were not coupled with interplanetary magnetic fields, serpentine could be dehydroxylated by micrometeoroids as small as 2 nm in size. In particular, ∼200 O–H bonds dissociated when the meteoroids were derived from cometary activity (the impact velocity was ∼20 km s−1). When nano-sized dust particles were accelerated to ∼300 km s−1 by the magnetic fields of solar wind plasma, the number of dissociated O–H bonds increased by 1 order of magnitude. Consequently, even 1 nm-sized dust particles can contribute to the space weathering of Ryugu. In all cases, Si–OH, H2O, and free OH were generated from the hydroxyls initially connected to Mg, which could partially offset dehydration. Despite the limitations of our computational resources, which restricted the simulation timescale to 1 ps, reactive molecular dynamic simulations demonstrated that micrometeoroid bombardment could influence the space weathering of asteroids.

在过去几十年中，近百万个类星体被研究，以阐明超大质量黑洞和星系的演化过程。其中，一型类星体的紫外至光学光谱特别能够揭示它们的黑洞活动情况。然而，最近的发现引发了对红色一型类星体普遍性的质疑，它们的颜色可能是由于尘埃遮挡，并且可能影响类星体的光度相关特性。本文研究了红移范围为0.68 ≤ z < 2.20的一型类星体中红色类星体的比例，应用了斯隆数字化巡天数据第14版的光学至中红外光度数据进行光谱能量分布拟合。大约10%的一型类星体呈现红色，暗示存在尘埃遮挡。我们发现中红外光度与红色一型类星体的比例存在关联，尽管红移进化较小。通过使用SED拟合得到的E(B−V)值，我们获得了红色一型类星体的消光光度，重新评估了类星体光度函数（QLF）和黑洞质量（MBH）的估计。结果显示明亮类星体的数量密度适度增加，与QLF的明亮端坡度更加平缓相关，而MBH的调整则很小。目前的SDSS选择与光学颜色可能忽略了大量严重遮挡的类星体。随着未来MIR（中红外）调查的扩展，如“宇宙历史、再电离时期和冰冰探索者的光谱光度计”，它们可能会揭示足够多的遮挡类星体，促使对基本类星体特性进行更深入的修订。

Over the past decades, nearly a million quasars have been explored to shed light on the evolution of supermassive black holes and galaxies. The ultraviolet-to-optical spectra of type-1 quasars particularly offer insights into their black hole activities. Recent findings, however, raise questions about the prevalence of red type-1 quasars of which colors might be due to dust obscuration and their potential influence on luminosity-related properties of quasars. We examine the fraction of red type-1 quasars within the redshift range of 0.68 ≤ z < 2.20, applying a spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting using optical-to-mid-infrared (MIR) photometric data of Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 14 quasars. Approximately 10% of the type-1 quasars exhibit red colors suggestive of dust obscuration. There is an association between the brightness of the MIR luminosity and a higher fraction of red type-1 quasars, albeit with negligible redshift evolution. By employing E(B − V) values from the SED fitting, we obtained dereddened luminosity of the red type-1 quasars and reassess the quasar luminosity function (QLF) and black hole mass (MBH) estimates. Result shows a modest increase in the number density of bright quasars, linking to more flatten bright-end slope of QLFs, while MBH adjustments are minimal. Current SDSS selections with optical colors could miss a significant population of heavily dust-obscured quasars. As future MIR surveys like Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization, and Ices Explorer expand, they may reveal enough obscured quasars to prompt a more profound revision of fundamental quasar properties.

We forecast constraints on cosmological parameters enabled by three surveys conducted with SPT-3G, the third-generation camera on the South Pole Telescope. The surveys cover separate regions of 1500, 2650, and 6000 deg2 to different depths, in total observing 25% of the sky. These regions will be measured to white noise levels of roughly 2.5, 9, and -armin, respectively, in cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature units at 150 GHz by the end of 2024. The survey also includes measurements at 95 and 220 GHz, which have noise levels a factor of ∼1.2 and 3.5 times higher than 150 GHz, respectively, with each band having a polarization noise level times higher than the temperature noise. We use a novel approach to obtain the covariance matrices for jointly and optimally estimated gravitational lensing potential band powers and unlensed CMB temperature and polarization band powers. We demonstrate the ability to test the ΛCDM model via the consistency of cosmological parameters constrained independently from SPT-3G and Planck data, and consider the improvement in constraints on ΛCDM extension parameters from a joint analysis of SPT-3G and Planck data. The ΛCDM cosmological parameters are typically constrained with uncertainties up to ∼2 times smaller with SPT-3G data, compared to Planck, with the two data sets measuring significantly different angular scales and polarization levels, providing additional tests of the standard cosmological model.

<br />总结:
本研究使用磁重联模型研究了伽马射线暴（GRB）的偏振角旋转对光变曲线和能谱推断的影响。发现喷流的半张角θj、观测角θV和洛伦兹因子Γ对偏振角旋转有显著影响，且受到θjΓ0乘积值影响，与具体数值关系不大。对于典型参数，偏离轴的观测变化范围在T90内的偏振角变化△PA为（12°，66°）。当θjΓ0 > 50且1.0 < q ≤ 1.2时，最显著的PA旋转将发生，△PA约为90°。 <div>
In addition to the light curve and energy spectrum, polarization is also important for inferring the physical properties of the gamma-ray burst (GRB). Rotation of the polarization angle (PA) with time will cause depolarization of the time-integrated polarization degree. However, it has rarely been studied before. Here, we use a magnetic reconnection model with a large-scale ordered aligned magnetic field in the emitting region to study the influence of the parameters on the PA rotations in the GRB prompt phase. We find that the half-opening angle of the jet θj, the observational angle θV, and the bulk Lorentz factor Γ all have significant impacts on the PA rotations. The PA rotations are affected by the product value of θjΓ0 (Γ0 is the normalization factor of Γ with ), but are roughly independent of the concrete values of both θj and Γ0. For the typical parameters, the changes of the PA within T90 (△PA) would be within (12°, 66°) for slight off-axis observations, where T90 is the duration of the burst with the accumulated flux density ranging from 5% to 95%. The q range for △PA > 10° becomes smaller with the increase of the product value of θjΓ0. The most significant PA rotation with △PA ∼ 90° will happen when θjΓ0 > 50 and 1.0 < q ≤ 1.2.

The LHS 6343 system consists of a resolved M-dwarf binary with an evolved, negligibly irradiated brown dwarf (BD), LHS 6343 C, orbiting the primary star. Such BD eclipsing binaries present rare and unique opportunities to calibrate substellar evolutionary and atmosphere models since mass, radius, temperature, and luminosity can be directly measured. We update this BD’s mass (62.6 ± 2.2 MJup) and radius (0.788 ± 0.043 RJup) using empirical stellar relations and a Gaia Data Release 3 distance. We use Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) observations of an LHS 6343 C secondary eclipse to obtain a near-IR emission spectrum, which matches to a spectral type of T1.5 ± 1. We combine this spectrum with existing Kepler and Spitzer/IRAC secondary-eclipse photometry to perform atmospheric characterization using the ATMO-2020, Sonora-Bobcat, and BT-Settl model grids. ATMO-2020 models with strong nonequilibrium chemistry yield the best fit to observations across all modeled bandpasses while predicting physical parameters consistent with Gaia-dependent analogs. BT-Settl predicts values slightly more consistent with such analogs but offers a significantly poorer fit to the WFC3 spectrum. Finally, we obtain a semi-empirical measurement of LHS 6343 C’s apparent luminosity by integrating its observed and modeled spectral energy distribution. Applying knowledge of the system’s distance yields a bolometric luminosity of log(Lbol/L☉) = −4.77 ± 0.03 and, applying the Stefan–Boltzmann law for the known radius, an effective temperature of 1303 ± 29 K. We also use the ATMO-2020 and Sonora-Bobcat evolutionary model grids to infer an age for LHS 6343 C of and respectively.

<div> millisecond pulsars, globular clusters, pulsar timing observations, core-collapse GC NGC 6752, nonluminous mass

总结：<br /><br />本文报告了对NGC 6752核心内五颗毫秒射电脉冲星进行了20多年的脉冲星定时观测。研究发现，在GC NGC 6752的核心脉冲星经历了加速度和抖动，这表明核心内至少有2.56 × 103M⊙的非发光物质存在。另外，研究排除了在星团中央存在质量大于或等于∼3000M⊙的中等质量黑洞的可能性。 <div>
Millisecond pulsars are subject to accelerations in globular clusters (GCs) that manifest themselves in both the first and second spin period time derivatives, and can be used to explore the mass distribution of the potentials they inhabit. Here we report on over 20 yr of pulsar timing observations of five millisecond radio pulsars in the core of the core-collapse GC NGC 6752 with the Parkes (Murriyang) and MeerKAT radio telescopes, which have allowed us to measure the proper motions, positions, and first and second time derivatives of the pulsars. The pulsar timing parameters indicate that all the pulsars in the core experience accelerations and jerks that can be explained only if an amount of nonluminous mass of at least 2.56 × 103M⊙ is present in the core of NGC 6752. On the other hand, our studies highly disfavor the presence of an intermediate-mass black hole at the center of the cluster, with a mass equal to or greater than ∼3000M⊙.

<div> 黑洞、动摩擦、双星形成、星际气体、模拟研究
总结:
本文主要研究星际气体和星团的动摩擦对黑洞双星形成的影响。首先提出了简单的无量纲摩擦系数来近似描述动摩擦的影响，进行了大量的模拟研究，发现在摩擦较弱时，局部双星形成速率与摩擦系数成线性关系。这些研究结果对于不同尺度上的双星形成具有普遍适用性，如星团中的中等质量黑洞、星际盘中的行星体等。 <div>
Using the equations of motion from Hill’s problem, with added accelerations for different forms of dynamical friction, we provide the (to-date) broadest scale-free study of friction-driven binary formation in gaseous disks and stellar clusters. We focus mainly on binary formation between stellar-mass black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), considering both gas dynamical friction (GDF) from AGN disks and stellar dynamical friction (SDF) from the nuclear star cluster. We first find simple, dimensionless friction coefficients that approximate the effects of standard models for GDF and SDF. We perform extensive simulations of Hill’s problem under such friction, and we present a picture of binary formation through encounters between single stars on nearby orbits, as a function of friction parameter, eccentricity, and inclination. Notably, we find that the local binary formation rate is a linear function of the friction coefficient so long as the friction is weak. Due to the dimensionless nature of our model problem, our findings are generalizable to binary formation at all scales (e.g., intermediate-mass black holes in a star cluster, planetesimals in a gaseous disk).

<br />
该研究利用TESS卫星的高频率、高精度的光变曲线对南天67个类星体进行了研究。研究提供了描述性的通量统计、功率谱密度(PSD)模型参数和特征变化时间尺度。结果显示，仅有15个BL Lacertae对象和18个平谱射电类星体表现出统计学上显著的变化。研究表明，在这一样本中，BL Lacertae对象和平谱射电类星体的超额方差或均方根散射之间没有显著差异。光变曲线中显示出 ∼69% 的样本具有线性均方根–通量关系，其中 ∼20% 显示出强相关性。另外，这些物体的特征时间尺度范围从 ∼0.8 天到 8 天不等，与光学变化起源于射流的观测结果一致。

We present a study of high-cadence, high-precision optical light curves from the TESS satellite of 67 blazars in the southern sky. We provide descriptive flux statistics, power spectral density (PSD) model parameters, and characteristic variability timescales. We find that only 15 BL Lacertae objects (BLLs) and 18 flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) from the initial 26 and 41, respectively, exhibit statistically significant variability. We employ an adapted power spectral response method to test the goodness of fit for the PSD function to three power-law variant models. From our best-fitting description of the PSD, we extract the high-frequency power-spectral slopes, and if present, determine the significant bend or break in the model to identify characteristic timescales. We find no significant difference in the excess variance or rms scatter between blazar subpopulations. We identify a linear rms–flux relation in ∼69% of our sample, in which ∼20% show a strong correlation. We find that both subpopulations of blazars show power spectral slopes of α ∼ 2 in which a broken power-law best fits five BLLs and six FSRQs and a bending power-law best fits one BLL and five FSRQs. The shortest timescales of variability in each light-curve range widely from minutes to weeks. Additionally, these objects’ characteristic timescales range from ∼0.8 to 8 days, consistent with optical variability originating in the jet.

We develop the kappa-tail fitting technique, which analyzes observations of power-law tails of distributions and energy flux spectra, and connects them to theoretical modeling of kappa distributions, to determine the thermodynamics of the examined space plasma. In particular, we (i) construct the associated mathematical formulation; (ii) prove its decisive lead for determining whether the observed power-law is associated with kappa distributions; and (iii) provide a validation of the technique using pseudo-observations of typical input plasma parameters. Then, we apply this technique to a case study by determining the thermodynamics of solar energetic particle (SEP) protons, for an SEP event observed on 2021 April 17, by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP)/Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun instrument suite on board PSP. The results show SEP temperatures and densities of the order of ∼1 MeV and ∼5 × 10−7 cm−3, respectively.

总结: 
本研究分析了太阳表面的不均匀性对径向速度的影响，发现各种不同的太阳表面特征会对观测到的速度产生复杂的变化，包括与边缘角度相关的减小。通过对Solar Dynamics Observatory的观测数据进行分类和分析，发现太阳黑子的本影和半影、宁静太阳的磁流体细胞、磁网络和日珥等特征都表现出不同的速度变化特征。研究强调了理解这些特征对径向速度的影响的重要性，以及将其视为天体物理信号而非简单的噪声过程。这些发现对于使用径向速度方法探测类太阳恒星的地球质量行星具有重要意义。 <br /> <div>
Stellar photospheric inhomogeneities are a significant source of noise, which currently precludes the discovery of Earth-mass planets orbiting Sun-like stars with the radial-velocity (RV) method. To complement several previous studies that have used ground- and spaced-based facilities to characterize the RV of the Sun, here we characterize the center-to-limb variability (CLV) of solar RVs arising from various solar-surface inhomogeneities observed by the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/Helioseismic Magnetic Imager and SDO/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly. By using various SDO observables to classify pixels and calculate line-of-sight velocities as a function of pixel classification and limb angle, we show that each identified feature type, including the umbrae and penumbrae of sunspots, quiet-Sun magnetoconvective cells, magnetic network, and plage, exhibit distinct and complex CLV signatures, including a notable limb-angle dependence in the observed suppression of convective blueshift for magnetically active regions. We discuss the observed distributions of velocities by identified region type and limb angle, offer interpretations of the physical phenomena that shape these distributions, and emphasize the need to understand the RV signatures of these regions as astrophysical signals, rather than simple (un)correlated noise processes.

<div> 关键词: 双层丝状通道, 日冕, 哈氏α波长, 磁结构, 等离子体流

总结:
观测证实了双层丝状通道的存在，该通道由两个丝状结构组成，根源于活跃区和远离的安静区。底层通道表现为间歇性的丝状物质，而上层通道则部分充满暗等离子体，呈现为一个小的丝状物质。通过观测还发现，底层通道的部分爆发是由于重连触发的，随之伴随着明亮的等离子体流向远离的根源。观测结果显示了在充满热/冷等离子体前，双层丝状通道作为一种磁结构的存在。 <div>
We present the observational evidence of the existence of a double-decker filament channel (FC) by using observations in extreme ultraviolet and Hα wavelengths. For both FCs, the east foot-point roots in the active region (AR), while the west one roots in the remote quiet region. The bottom FC (FC1) appears as intermittent filaments. Within the AR, the FC1 appears as an S-shaped filament (F1), which consisted of two J-shaped filaments (F1S/F1N for the south/north one). For the upper one (FC2), only the east part is filled with dark plasma and visible as a small filament (F2). Its east foot-point roots around the junction of F1S and F1N. Initially, due to the recurrent reconnections, F1N and F1S link to each other and form a new filament (F3) thread by thread. Meanwhile, the heated plasma, which appears as brightening features, flows from the east foot-point of F2 to the west, and becomes invisible about 1.1 × 105 km away. The failed eruption of F1S is triggered by the reconnection, which appears as the brightening threads changing their configuration from crossed to quasiparallel in between the F1S and F3, and is confined by the upper magnetic field. Associated with the eruption, the distant invisible plasma becomes visible as a brightening feature. It continuously flows to the remote foot-point, and becomes invisible before reaching it. The brightening plasma flow outlines the skeleton of FC2 gradually. The observations show the existence of a double-decker FC, as a magnetic structure, before they appear as a brightening/dark feature when fully filled with hot/cool plasma.

MACS0647−JD是一个三重透镜z ∼ 11候选星系，经JWST/NIRSpec棱镜光谱分析后发现，其中A星系的光谱红移z = 10.17，具有丰富的发射线，推测气相金属丰度为12 + log(O/H) ∼ 7.5–8.0，具有柔和的Lyα断裂和强烈的Lyα阻尼翼，该星系可能是目前已知的最遥远的星系并可能处于合并过程中。具有星际质量为log(M/M⊙) = 8.1 ± 0.3，主要在20百万年内形成，星际质量∼ 2 ± 1 M⊙ yr−1，都在一个有效半径70 ± 24 pc内。此外，测量了距离约3 kpc处的另一个星系C，其莱曼断点与z ∼ 10.17一致。<br /><br />总结:MACS0647−JD是一个具有丰富发射线和气相金属的远距离星系，可能是最遥远的星系合并事件。 <div>
We present JWST/NIRSpec prism spectroscopy of MACS0647−JD, a triply lensed z ∼ 11 candidate discovered in Hubble Space Telescope imaging and spatially resolved by JWST imaging into two components, A and B. Spectroscopy of component A yields a spectroscopic redshift z = 10.17 based on seven detected emission lines: C iii] λλ1907, 1909, [O ii] λ3727, [Ne iii] λ3869, [Ne iii] λ3968, Hδλ4101, Hγλ4340, and [O iii] λ4363. These are the second-most distant detections of these emission lines to date, in a galaxy observed just 460 million years after the Big Bang. Based on observed and extrapolated line flux ratios we derive a gas-phase metallicity 12 + log(O/H) ∼ 7.5–8.0, or Z ∼ (0.06–0.2) Z⊙, ionization parameter = −1.9 ± 0.2, and an ionizing photon production efficiency erg−1 Hz. The spectrum has a softened Lyα break, evidence for a strong Lyα damping wing. The Lyα damping wing also suppresses the F150W photometry, explaining the slightly overestimated photometric redshift z = 10.6 ± 0.3. MACS0647−JD has a stellar mass log(M/M⊙) = 8.1 ± 0.3, including ∼6 × 107M⊙ in component A, most of which formed recently (within ∼20 Myr) with a star formation rate ∼ 2 ± 1 M⊙ yr−1, all within an effective radius 70 ± 24 pc. Spectroscopy of a fainter companion galaxy C separated by a distance of ∼ 3 kpc reveals a Lyman break consistent with z ∼ 10.17. MACS0647−JD is likely the most distant galaxy merger known.

<div> Seyfert-type AGN, star formation, Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope, surface density, Eddington ratio
总结:
本研究使用AstroSat上的紫外成像望远镜对七个Seyfert型AGN和一个低电离核发射线区域的星系进行了观测，发现1742个星形成区域，大小在0.010-63.642kpc2之间。研究发现星系的总表面密度与灭光度呈正相关，并且在五个星系中，从中心到外部，灭光度和总表面密度都逐渐减少。四个星系处于主序星系形成区域，另外四个偏离主序。研究还发现核区的星形成率与总星形成率的比值与Eddington比例呈正相关，表明AGN对宿主星系的星形成特征有影响，但主要集中在中心核区，对其他尺度的影响不显著。 <br /><br /> <div>
Circumnuclear star formation (SF) is generally seen in galaxies hosting active galactic nuclei (AGN); however, the connection between the AGN activity and SF in them is less well understood. To explore this connection on scales of a few tens of parsecs to a few tens of kiloparsecs and larger, we carried out an investigation of SF in seven Seyfert-type AGN and one low-ionization nuclear emission-line region galaxy, using observations with the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope on board AstroSat in the near-ultraviolet (2000–3000 Å) and far-ultraviolet (1300−1800 Å) bands. A total of 1742 star-forming regions were identified, having size scales of 0.010–63.642 kpc2. Considering all the galaxies, we found a positive correlation between their total surface density of SF (ΣSFR) and extinction. For five galaxies, namely NGC 1365, NGC 4051, NGC 4321, NGC 5033, and NGC 6814, we found a gradual decrease of both extinction and ΣSFR from the centre to the outer regions. Four sources are found to lie in the main sequence of star-forming galaxies, and the other four lie away from it. We found the ratio of the star formation rate (SFR) in the nuclear region to the total SFR to be positively correlated with the Eddington ratio. This points to the influence of AGN in enhancing the SF characteristics of the hosts. However, the impact is dominant only in the central nuclear region and has no significant effect on the larger scales probed in this work.

<div> 磁岛，WISPR，帕克太阳探测器，太阳风，磁重联
总结:<br /><br />本研究利用帕克太阳探测器的WISPR观测到了可能的磁岛特征，并进行了物理分析。磁岛的平均速度约为334 km s−1，加速度约为−0.64 m s−2，表明该磁岛可能被慢太阳风所带动。磁岛呈椭圆形，中心存在密度缺陷，暗示可能存在磁场引导。研究认为这一特征与带状电流层中的重联相关。磁岛的横纵轴比（计算为次轴与主轴的比值）在WISPR观测过程中发生变化，从椭圆形逐渐变为更加圆形。相比于其他白光观测，WISPR的高灵敏度和观测角度使得对这一磁岛特征的观测成为可能。 <div>
We present the identification and physical analysis of a possible magnetic island feature seen in white-light images observed by the Wide-field Imager for Solar Probe (WISPR) on board the Parker Solar Probe. The island is imaged by WISPR during Parker's second solar encounter on 2019 April 6, when Parker was ∼38 R⊙ from the Sun's center. We report that the average velocity and acceleration of the feature are approximately 334 km s−1 and −0.64 m s−2. The kinematics of the island feature, coupled with its direction of propagation, indicate that the island is likely entrained in the slow solar wind. The island is elliptical in shape with a density deficit in its center, suggesting the presence of a magnetic guide field. We argue that this feature is consistent with the formation of this island via reconnection in the current sheet of the streamer. The feature's aspect ratio (calculated as the ratio of its minor to major axis) evolves from an elliptical to a more circular shape that approximately doubles during its propagation through WISPR’s field of view. The island is not distinct in other white-light observations from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory and the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory coronagraphs, suggesting that this is a comparatively faint heliospheric feature and that viewing perspective and WISPR’s enhanced sensitivity are key to observing the magnetic island.

<br /><br />
本研究调查了银河系中的黑洞对微透镜事件率分布的影响。研究考虑了不同平均脉冲速度的Maxwell分布，以及黑洞的空间分布的相应变化。研究发现，朝向银河系星系核的黑洞透镜事件率随着平均速度的增加而减少，主要是由于尺度高度的膨胀。重点关注了OB110462的独特微透镜参数，其微透镜视差πE超过0.06，持续时间超过200天。我们计算了OB110462类似参数的黑洞事件在OGLE-IV调查中的预期数量，并将其与实际发生的事件数量进行了比较。我们的模型预测，在vavg = 25, 50, 100, 200和400 km s-1的情况下，预期发生的事件数量分别为0.52, 0.38, 0.18, 0.042和4.0×10^-3。这表明平均脉冲速度可能小于100 km s-1。即使在最大情况下，预期数量也小于单位，这可能表明我们在发现OB110462方面的运气，这可以通过未来的调查，例如罗马空间望远镜加以测试。 
<br />总结:研究调查了银河系中的黑洞对微透镜事件率分布的影响，发现平均脉冲速度可能小于100 km s-1，通过未来的调查可以进一步验证发现OB110462的概率。 <div>
The natal kick velocity distribution for black holes (BHs) is unknown regardless of its importance for understanding the BH formation process. Gravitational microlensing is a unique tool for studying the distribution of BHs in our Galaxy, and the first isolated stellar-mass BH event, OGLE-2011-BLG-0462/MOA-2011-BLG-191 (OB110462), was recently identified by astrometric microlensing. This study investigates how the natal kick velocity for Galactic BHs affects the microlensing event rate distribution. We consider a Maxwell distribution with various average kick velocities, as well as the consequent variation of the spatial distribution of BHs. We find that the event rate for the BH lenses toward the Galactic bulge decreases as vavg increases, mainly due to the scale height inflation. We focus on the unique microlensing parameters measured for OB110462, with microlens parallax πE larger than 0.06 for its long timescale of tE > 200 days. We calculate the expected number of BH events occurring with parameters similar to OB110462 during the OGLE-IV survey by Mróz et al. and compare it with the actual number that occurred, at least one. Our fiducial model predicts 0.52, 0.38, 0.18, 0.042, and 4.0 × 10−3 events occurring for vavg = 25, 50, 100, 200, and 400 km s−1, respectively, which suggests that the average kick velocity is likely to be vavg ≲ 100 km s−1. The expected number smaller than unity even at maximum might indicate our luck in finding OB110462, which can be tested with future surveys by, e.g., the Roman Space Telescope.

Over the past few years alone, the lensing community has discovered thousands of strong lens candidates, and spectroscopically confirmed hundreds of them. In this time of abundance, it becomes pragmatic to focus our time and resources on the few extraordinary systems, in order to most efficiently study the Universe. In this paper, we present such a system: DESI-090.9854-35.9683, a cluster-scale lens at zl = 0.49, with seven observed lensed sources around the core, and additional lensed sources further out in the cluster. From the number and the textbook configuration of the lensed images, a tight constraint on the mass potential of the lens is possible. This would allow for detailed analysis on the dark and luminous matter content within galaxy clusters, as well as a probe into dark energy and high-redshift galaxies. We present our spatially resolved kinematic measurements of this system from the Very Large Telescope Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer, which confirm five of these source galaxies (in ascending order, at zs = 0.962, 0.962, 1.166, 1.432, and 1.432). With previous Hubble Space Telescope imaging in the F140W and F200LP bands, we also present a simple flux-based lens model consisting of two power-law profiles that, for a cluster lens, well models the five lensed arc families with redshifts. We determine the mass to be M(< θE) = 4.78 × 1013M⊙ for the primary mass potential. From the model, we extrapolate the redshift of one of the two source galaxies not yet spectroscopically confirmed to be at .

<div> Gaia DR3, photometry, BP, RP, spectra
<br /><br />总结:
本研究旨在检查Gaia DR3光度测量和BP/RP光谱的空间均匀性，发现了小的偏差离散度，但存在明显的空间模式，这与Gaia的扫描规律有关。BP和G波段的模式相似，并且比RP波段的模式更明显。进一步独立测试显示，空间模式很可能是由于Gaia DR3 BP/RP光谱引起的。研究证实了Gaia数据在毫星等级上的高空间一致性，但也暗示了Gaia DR3 BP/RP光谱的空间一致性不如光度测量，未来有进一步的改进空间。 <div>
Gaia DR3 photometry and Blue Photometer (BP) and Red Photometer (RP) spectra have been widely used as reference in photometric calibrations. In this work, we check the spatial uniformity of Gaia DR3 photometry and BP/RP spectra by comparing the BP, RP, and G-band photometry with the synthetic ones from the BP/RP spectra. The discrepancies have a small dispersion of 1.07, 0.55, and 1.02 mmag for the BP, RP, and G bands, respectively. However, the discrepancies exhibit obvious spatial patterns, which are clearly associated with Gaia’s scanning law. The patterns observed in the BP and G bands are similar, with discrepancies between photometry and spectra being more pronounced in these bands compared to the RP band. A further independent test with the Dark Energy Survey DR2 photometry reveals that the spatial patterns are more likely attributed to the Gaia DR3 BP/RP spectra, particularly in the BP band. On one hand, our results confirm the high spatial uniformity of Gaia data at the mmag level. On the other hand, our results suggest that the spatial uniformity of Gaia DR3 BP/RP spectra is not as good as that of Gaia DR3 photometry, and could be further improved in the future.

<br /><br />总结:
本研究利用Horizon Run 5宇宙学热力学模拟，测试了LAEs和LBGs作为高红移大尺度结构的有效跟踪者。通过比较LAEs和LBGs在暗物质纤维结构周围的空间分布，发现它们比暗物质更集中于纤维结构附近。此外，他们也发现了纤维的垂直密度剖面的经验拟合公式，以及LAEs、LBGs和暗物质定义的纤维结构在空间分布上的一致性。这些结果支持了LAEs和LBGs在高红移时期作为大尺度结构的良好跟踪者的观点。 <div>
We test whether Lyα emitters (LAEs) and Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) can be good tracers of high-z large-scale structures, using the Horizon Run 5 cosmological hydrodynamical simulation. We identify LAEs using the Lyα emission line luminosity and its equivalent width, and LBGs using the broadband magnitudes at z ∼ 2.4, 3.1, and 4.5. We first compare the spatial distributions of LAEs, LBGs, all galaxies, and dark matter around the filamentary structures defined by dark matter. The comparison shows that both LAEs and LBGs are more concentrated toward the dark matter filaments than dark matter. We also find an empirical fitting formula for the vertical density profile of filaments as a binomial power-law relation of the distance to the filaments. We then compare the spatial distributions of the samples around the filaments defined by themselves. LAEs and LBGs are again more concentrated toward their filaments than dark matter. We also find the overall consistency between filamentary structures defined by LAEs, LBGs, and dark matter, with the median spatial offsets that are smaller than the mean separation of the sample. These results support the idea that the LAEs and LBGs could be good tracers of large-scale structures of dark matter at high redshifts.

<title>Time Series of Magnetic Field Parameters of Merged MDI and HMI Space-weather Active Region Patches as Potential Tool for Solar Flare Forecasting</title>

这篇文章介绍了最近利用Space-Weather MDI和Space-Weather HMI的数据来进行太阳耀斑预测的研究。研究将这两种数据进行了合并，进行了初步的统计分析，以扩大它们在太空天气预报中的应用。通过滤波、重新调整和合并SMARP和SHARP参数，得出了一组多变量时间序列数据。通过时间滞后交叉相关分析表明，太阳活动区的某些磁场特性可能领先于耀斑指数。滚动窗口技术的初步结果显示，高相关性的区域通常对应于太阳活动周期的高峰期。这个组合的MDI-HMI数据集对于研究太阳耀斑预测具有重要意义。 
<br /><br />总结: 
太阳耀斑预测的最新研究使用了Space-Weather MDI和SHARP数据，并将它们合并成一种数据产品。通过时间序列分析发现，太阳活动区的磁场特性可能领先于耀斑指数。研究结果显示，在太阳活动周期的高峰期，太阳活动区的高相关性区域对应于耀斑活动的增加。这对于太阳耀斑的预测具有重要意义。 <div>
Solar flare prediction studies have been recently conducted with the use of Space-Weather MDI (Michelson Doppler Imager on board Solar and Heliospheric Observatory) Active Region Patches (SMARPs) and Space-Weather HMI (Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board Solar Dynamics Observatory) Active Region Patches (SHARPs), which are two currently available data products containing magnetic field characteristics of solar active regions (ARs). The present work is an effort to combine them into one data product, and perform some initial statistical analyses in order to further expand their application in space-weather forecasting. The combined data are derived by filtering, rescaling, and merging the SMARP and SHARP parameters, which can then be spatially reduced to create uniform multivariate time series. The resulting combined MDI–HMI data set currently spans the period between 1996 April 4 and 2022 December 13, and may be extended to a more recent date. This provides an opportunity to correlate and compare it with other space-weather time series, such as the daily solar flare index or the statistical properties of the soft X-ray flux measured by the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites. Time-lagged cross correlation indicates that a relationship may exist, where some magnetic field properties of ARs lead the flare index in time. Applying the rolling-window technique makes it possible to see how this leader–follower dynamic varies with time. Preliminary results indicate that areas of high correlation generally correspond to increased flare activity during the peak solar cycle.

<title>GRB 190114C: Fireball Energy Budget and Radiative Efficiency Revisited</title>

<div> TeV-emitting, GRB 190114C, temporal and spectral analysis, fireball parameters, radiative efficiency
<br />
通过对TeV辐射明亮的GRB 190114C进行综合的时域和频谱分析，研究了其高能量释放以及辐射转换的效率。发现其快速射流在不同脉冲间有独立的热成分，且整体辐射效率较高。通过结合不同观测情况，测量了火球参数和GRB辐射效率，并发现尽管观测参数有所不同，但从P1和P2获得的辐射效率大致相同，这意味着相同GRB的中心引擎具有一些共同的特性。  <br /><br />总结: <div>
The jet composition of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), as well as how efficiently the jet converts its energy to radiation, are long-standing problems in GRB physics. Here, we reported a comprehensive temporal and spectral analysis of the TeV-emitting bright GRB 190114C. Its high fluence (∼4.4 × 10−4 erg cm−2) allows us to conduct the time-resolved spectral analysis in great detail and study their variations down to a very short timescale (∼0.1 s) while preserving a high significance. Its prompt emission consists of three well-separated pulses. The first two main pulses (P1 and P2) exhibit independently strong thermal components, starting from the third pulse (P3) and extending to the entire afterglow, the spectra are all nonthermal, and the synchrotron plus Compton upscattering model well interprets the observation. By combining the thermal (P1 and P2) and the nonthermal (P3) observations based on two different scenarios (global and pulse properties) and following the method described in Zhang et al., we measure the fireball parameters and GRB radiative efficiency with little uncertainties for this GRB. A relevantly high GRB radiative efficiency is obtained based on both the global and pulse properties, suggesting that if GRBs are powered by fireballs, the efficiency can sometimes be high. More interestingly, though the observed parameters are individually different (e.g., the amount of mass loading M), the radiative efficiency obtained from P1 (ηγ = 36.0% ± 6.5%) and P2 (ηγ = 41.1% ± 1.9%) is roughly the same, which implies that the central engine of the same GRB has some common properties.

<div> 关键词: 太阳系, 星际介质, 北领域, 地质证据, 磁流体力学模型

总结: 
太阳系在星际介质中运动，被太阳风形成的日晕保护着。根据地质证据，地球在2-3和5-7百万年前直接接触星际介质。最近的研究表明，太阳在2百万年前经历了一次冷云的遭遇，导致日晕缩小，使得地球暴露在星际介质之下。磁流体力学模型显示，这次经历导致日晕缩小到比地球轨道还要小，从而让地球暴露在寒冷而密集的星际介质之下。这次事件的时间与地质纪录中观测到的波动相匹配，表明太阳经过北领域表面并收缩的日晕可能显著影响了气候和生物圈，这可能是地球历史上的一个新的重要驱动因素。 <div>
The Sun moves through the interstellar medium (ISM) at a velocity of ∼19 pc Myr−1, making the conditions outside the solar system vary with time over millions of years. Today’s solar system is protected from interstellar particles by the heliosphere, the bubble formed by the solar wind as the Sun moves through the ISM, which engulfs the planets. There is geological evidence from 60Fe that Earth was in direct contact with the ISM 2–3 and 5–7 million years ago (MYA). Recent work argues that the Sun encountered a massive cold cloud 2 MYA as part of the Local Ribbon of Cold Clouds that shrunk the heliosphere and exposed Earth to the ISM. Here, we consider the effects of the passage of the Sun through the edge of the Local Bubble occurring at MYA assuming that the Sun encountered a cloud with a density of 900 cm−3. If we consider additional turbulent motion within the cloud due to shocks, the density encountered can be as low as 283 cm−3. Clouds of this density cover a small but nonzero (≲4.6%) fraction of the surface of the Local Bubble, making an encounter plausible. Using a state-of-the art magnetohydrodynamic model, we show that the heliosphere shrank to a scale smaller than Earth’s orbit, thereby exposing Earth to cold dense ISM, consistent with 60Fe evidence. The timing of the event matches perturbations observed in the paleoclimate record recovered from deep-sea sediments. The passage through the Local Bubble’s surface and contraction of the heliosphere therefore may have impacted the climate and biosphere significantly, suggesting a new driver of major events in Earth’s history.

<br />
这篇文章讨论了SNe Ia的起源问题。虽然一直以来认为它们来自碳/氧白矮星的爆炸，但确切的祖先构造和导致SNe Ia的爆炸机制仍存在争议。其中一种流行的理论是双重爆炸，即通过二元伴星积累的氦层在主星表面爆炸，导致下面的核心受到收敛的冲击诱发爆炸。研究发现，氦丰富的退化伴星可能会受到主星喷出的物质冲击而引发自己的爆炸。他们还展示了2D模拟，模拟了白矮星进行双重爆炸，触发了退化伴星的爆炸，导致三重或四重爆炸。结果表明，在一定范围内的退化双星质量配置下，这些事件的合成光变曲线和光谱与观测一样好，甚至与独立双重爆炸的理论模型一样。需要进一步了解这种情景，以确定至少一些观测到的SNe Ia是否实际上来自两颗恒星的爆炸。<br /><br />总结: SNe Ia的起源问题是个争议性话题，文章讨论了双重爆炸理论及退化伴星的爆炸，提出了具体研究结果，并强调了对这种场景的进一步理解的必要性。 <div>
The precise origin of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is unknown despite their value to numerous areas in astronomy. While it is a long-standing consensus that they arise from the explosion of a carbon/oxygen white dwarf, the exact progenitor configurations and explosion mechanisms that lead to SNe Ia are still debated. One popular theory is the double detonation, in which a helium layer, accreted from a binary companion, detonates on the surface of the primary star, leading to a converging shock-induced detonation of the underlying core. It has recently been seen in simulations that a helium-rich degenerate companion may undergo its own explosion triggered by the impact from the ejecta of the primary star. We show 2D simulations that approximate a white dwarf undergoing a double detonation, which triggers the explosion of the degenerate companion, leading to either a triple or quadruple detonation. We also present the first multidimensional radiative transfer results from the triple and quadruple detonation scenario. We find that within a range of mass configurations of the degenerate binary, the synthetic light curves and spectra of these events match observations as well as theoretical models of isolated double detonations do. Notably, double and quadruple detonations that are spectrally similar and reach the same peak brightnesses have drastically different ejecta masses and produce different amounts of Si- and Fe-group elements. Further understanding of this scenario is needed in order to determine if at least some observed SNe Ia actually originate from two stars exploding.

总结: <br />
本文针对热隔离中子星RX J0806.4–4123进行了定制的X射线定时观测，利用傅里叶系数的统计特性和ZK2测试来找到整个数据集的定时解。我们还开发了一种简单且通用的方法，来估计自旋频率ν及其导数的不确定性，考虑自旋频率的所有重要谐波。应用这一方法，我们确定了RX J0806.4–4123的自旋衰减率。结果表明，其自旋衰减功率是热隔离中子星中最低的之一，比该中子星的X射线光度低出60倍，并且其自旋衰减率也是已测量中最低的之一。 <div>
The X-ray thermal isolated neutron star (XTINS) RX J0806.4–4123 shows interesting multiwavelength properties that seemingly deviate from those of similar neutron stars. An accurate determination of the spin frequency change over time can assist in interpreting RX J0806.4–4123's properties in comparison to those of other XTINSs and the wider pulsar population. From 2019 to 2023 we carried out a tailored X-ray timing campaign of RX J0806.4–4123 with the NICER instrument. We used statistical properties of the Fourier coefficients and the ZK2 test for phase connecting separate observations and finding a timing solution for the entire data set. We also developed a simple and universal method for estimating the uncertainties of the frequency ν and its derivative from the empirical dependencies of ZK2 on trial values of these parameters, with account of all significant harmonics of the frequency. Applying this method, we determined a spin-down rate . The resulting spin-down power erg s−1 is the lowest among the XTINSs, and it is a factor of 60 lower than the X-ray luminosity of this neutron star. RX J0806.4–4123 is also among the pulsars with the lowest measured in general.

总结:<br />
本文提出了一个关于热而稀薄的麦克斯韦分布的质子环以及冷等离子体和电子背景的均匀等离子体系统的全面理论模型，用于研究磁体声波的共振不稳定性。文章通过数值方法解决与麦克斯韦环分布相关的垂直速度积分问题，同时通过调用等离子体色散函数的级数展开解析地解决了平行速度积分问题。对于地球内磁层相关的等离子体参数，理论模型产生了频率从本地质子回旋频率的5倍到低杂波频率以上的磁体声波，传播角度为89.5°。对于相同的等离子体参数，麦克斯韦环质子还激发了氢（H+）带电磁离子回旋波。详细分析表明，足够大的环速度以及较小的垂直和平行热速度可以增强磁体声波的增长。该研究还探讨了背景等离子体参数在调制波动中的作用。当前的理论模型重现了Van Allen Probes在地球内磁层观测到的磁体声波的谐波。此外，该模型还可以在其他等离子体环境中产生磁体声波，例如火星，在这里，MAVEN已经确认了环质子与磁体声波观测的关联。 <div>
A comprehensive theoretical model for a homogeneous plasma system of hot, tenuous Maxwellian ring-distributed protons and the cold background of Maxwellian ions and electrons is used to study the resonant instabilities of magnetosonic (MS) waves. The perpendicular velocity integrals associated with the Maxwellian ring distribution have no analytical solution, hence, are solved numerically, while the parallel velocity integrals are solved analytically by invoking series expansion of the plasma dispersion function. For the plasma parameters relevant to Earth’s inner magnetosphere, the theoretical model generates MS waves with frequencies from 5 times the local proton cyclotron frequency to above the lower hybrid frequency for a propagation angle of 89.5°. Hydrogen (H+) band electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves are also excited by the Maxwellian ring protons for the same set of plasma parameters. A detailed analysis reveals that a sufficiently large ring velocity, as well as a smaller perpendicular and parallel thermal velocity, can enhance the MS wave growth. The study also explores the role of background plasma parameters in modulating the waves. The present theoretical model reproduces the harmonics of the MS waves observed by the Van Allen Probes in the Earth’s inner magnetosphere. Further, the model can generate MS waves in other plasma environments, e.g., Mars, where the presence of ring protons has been established by MAVEN in connection with the MS wave observations.

<br /><br />总结: 本研究提出了一种新的方法来研究重力异常，通过分析双星的速度剖面，并测量了重力异常因子γg。研究结果表明牛顿重力被排除，而米尔格罗米安AQUAL理论被证明是可接受的。 <div>
Low-acceleration gravitational anomaly is investigated with a new method of exploiting the normalized velocity profile of wide binary stars as a function of the normalized sky-projected radius s/rM, where vp is the sky-projected relative velocity between the pair, vc is the Newtonian circular velocity at the sky-projected separation s, and rM is the MOND radius. With a Monte Carlo method, Gaia observed binaries and their virtual Newtonian counterparts are probabilistically distributed on the s/rM versus plane, and a logarithmic velocity ratio parameter Γ is measured in the bins of s/rM. With three samples of binaries covering a broad range in size, data quality, and implied fraction of hierarchical systems including a new sample of 6389 binaries selected with accurate distances and radial velocities, I find a unanimous systematic variation from the Newtonian flat line. With Γ = 0 at s/rM ≲ 0.15 or s ≲ 1 kau, I get Γ = 0.068 ± 0.015 (stat) (syst) for s/rM ≳ 0.7 or s ≳ 5 kau. The gravitational anomaly (i.e., acceleration boost) factor given by γg = 102Γ is measured to be (stat) (syst). With a reduced χ2 test of Newtonian and Milgromian nonrelativistic theories, I find that Newtonian gravity is ruled out at 5.8σ ( ) by the new sample (and 9.2σ by the largest sample used). The Milgromian AQUAL theory is acceptable with . These results agree well with earlier results with the “acceleration-plane analysis” for a variety of samples and the “stacked velocity profile analysis” for a pure binary sample.

<br />总结:
本文研究了SN 2022oqm的光度和光谱演化，发现它是一个多峰值的氢和氦贫钙丰富的瞬变事件（CaRT）。该事件距离其宿主星系NGC 5875有13.1 kpc。研究发现SN 2022oqm的峰值亮度相对较高（MB = −17 mag），是CaRT中的异常值。研究表明，需要三种不同的能量源来解释光度曲线的演化，分别对应于三个峰值。通过光度曲线的推导，得出了喷射物质和56Ni的质量，以及氢和氦缺乏的CSM。光谱建模显示约0.6 M⊙的喷射物质，并且其中充满了良好混合的Fe峰元素。作者讨论了SN 2022oqm的几种物理起源，认为一个大质量的白矮星前体或一个特殊的剥离包络模型可以解释SN 2022oqm。一个在稠密的、缺乏氢和氦的CSM内发生的剥离包络爆炸，类似于SNe Icn，但具有大质量的56Ni和小质量的CSM可以解释SN 2022oqm。另外，对于一个意外大质量的白矮星发生的氦爆也能解释SN 2022oqm。 <div>
We present the photometric and spectroscopic evolution of SN 2022oqm, a nearby multipeaked hydrogen- and helium-weak calcium-rich transient (CaRT). SN 2022oqm was detected 13.1 kpc from its host galaxy, the face-on spiral galaxy NGC 5875. Extensive spectroscopic coverage reveals an early hot (T ≥ 40,000 K) continuum and carbon features observed ∼1 day after discovery, SN Ic-like photospheric-phase spectra, and strong forbidden calcium emission starting 38 days after discovery. SN 2022oqm has a relatively high peak luminosity (MB = −17 mag) for CaRTs, making it an outlier in the population. We determine that three power sources are necessary to explain the light curve (LC), with each corresponding to a distinct peak. The first peak is powered by an expanding blackbody with a power-law luminosity, suggesting shock cooling by circumstellar material (CSM). Subsequent LC evolution is powered by a double radioactive decay model, consistent with two sources of photons diffusing through optically thick ejecta. From the LC, we derive an ejecta mass and 56Ni mass of ∼0.6 M⊙ and ∼0.09 M⊙. Spectroscopic modeling ∼0.6 M⊙ of ejecta, and with well-mixed Fe-peak elements throughout. We discuss several physical origins for SN 2022oqm and find either a surprisingly massive white dwarf progenitor or a peculiar stripped envelope model could explain SN 2022oqm. A stripped envelope explosion inside a dense, hydrogen- and helium-poor CSM, akin to SNe Icn, but with a large 56Ni mass and small CSM mass could explain SN 2022oqm. Alternatively, helium detonation on an unexpectedly massive white dwarf could also explain SN 2022oqm.

We report the serendipitous multiwavelength discovery of a candidate dual black hole system with a separation of ∼100 pc, in the gas-rich luminous infrared galaxy MCG-03-34-64 (z = 0.016). Hubble Space Telescope/Advanced Camera for Surveys observations show three distinct optical centroids in the [O iii] narrow-band and F814W images. Subsequent analysis of Chandra/ACIS data shows two spatially resolved peaks of equal intensity in the neutral Fe Kα (6.2–6.6 keV) band, while high-resolution radio continuum observations with the Very Large Array at 8.46 GHz (3.6 cm band) show two spatially coincident radio peaks. Fast shocks as the ionizing source seem unlikely, given the energies required for the production of Fe Kα. If confirmed, the separation of ∼100 pc would represent the closest dual active galactic nuclei reported to date with spatially resolved, multiwavelength observations.

We present near-infrared spectroscopy of 10 weak emission-line quasars (WLQs) at redshifts of z ∼ 2, obtained with the Palomar 200 inch Hale Telescope. WLQs are an exceptional population of type 1 quasars that exhibit weak or no broad emission lines in the ultraviolet (e.g., the C ivλ1549 line), and they display remarkable X-ray properties. We derive Hβ-based single-epoch virial black hole masses (median value 1.7 × 109M⊙) and Eddington ratios (median value 0.5) for our sources. We confirm the previous finding that WLQ Hβ lines, as a major low-ionization line, are not significantly weak compared to typical quasars. The most prominent feature of the WLQ optical spectra is the universally weak/absent [O iii] λ5007 emission. They also display stronger optical Fe ii emission than typical quasars. Our results favor the super-Eddington accretion scenario for WLQs, where the weak lines are a result of a soft ionizing continuum; the geometrically thick inner accretion disk and/or its associated outflow is responsible for obscuring the nuclear high-energy radiation and producing the soft ionizing continuum. We also report candidate extreme [O iii] outflows (blueshifts of ≈500 and 4900 km s−1) in one object.

这篇文章使用绿岸望远镜对银河系两个视线进行了无线再组合线观测。观测结果显示每个视线有两个高斯形状的光谱分量，其发射测量范围在约100至300厘米^-6 pc之间。在光度学选择速率（LSR）速度为负时，没有可检测到的RRL发射，这表明辐射等离子体必须位于太阳轨道内部。G20和G45的发射测量暗示如果这些视线充满均匀等离子体，其均方根密度分别为0.15和0.18厘米^-3。观测到的Hnβ/Hnα线比与LTE激发的最强分量一致。G20的高速度分量具有较窄的线宽（13.5 km s^-1），这为等离子体电子温度设置了上限（≲4000 K），这与普遍存在的低密度约为10,000 K的WIM等离子体的假设不一致。
<br /><br />总结: 该研究使用绿岸望远镜观测了银河系中的离子化气体，发现了两个视线中的RRL发射，并推测了等离子体发射测量的均方根密度。观测结果还表明，高速度分量的等离子体电子温度上限低于10,000 K的普遍假设。 <div>
Diffuse ionized gas pervades the disk of the Milky Way. We detect extremely faint emission from this Galactic warm ionized medium (WIM) using the Green Bank Telescope to make radio recombination line (RRL) observations toward two Milky Way sight lines: G20, (ℓ, b) = (20°, 0°), and G45, (ℓ, b) = (45°, 0°). We stack 18 consecutive Hnα transitions between 4.3 and 7.1 GHz to derive 〈Hnα〉 spectra that are sensitive to RRL emission from plasmas with emission measures EM ≳ 10 cm−6 pc. Each sight line has two Gaussian-shaped spectral components with emission measures that range between ∼100 and ∼300 cm−6 pc. Because there is no detectable RRL emission at negative LSR velocities, the emitting plasma must be located interior to the solar orbit. The G20 and G45 emission measures imply rms densities of 0.15 and 0.18 cm−3, respectively, if these sight lines are filled with homogeneous plasma. The observed 〈Hnβ〉/〈Hnα〉 line ratios are consistent with LTE excitation for the strongest components. The high-velocity component of G20 has a narrow line width, 13.5 km s−1, that sets an upper limit of ≲4000 K for the plasma electron temperature. This is inconsistent with the ansatz of a canonically pervasive, low-density, ∼10,000 K WIM plasma.

总结:
该研究使用了PDS来研究伽马射线暴（GRB）的光变曲线，利用了Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope（Insight-HXMT）的数据。对长暴和短暴分别进行了能谱指数的分析，结果显示长暴和短暴的能谱指数相似，表明它们可能是相似的随机过程的结果。此外，研究还发现伽马射线暴的光变曲线可能是由多个具有不同时间尺度的脉冲叠加而成。在样本中没有发现高于3σ显著性阈值的周期性或准周期性信号。伽马射线暴的光变曲线与能谱的关系也被研究出来，有助于对伽马射线暴的物理过程进行更深入的理解。 <br /><br /> <div>
The power density spectrum (PDS) is a powerful tool to study light curves of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We show the average PDS and individual PDS analysis with GRB data from the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (also named Insight-HXMT). The values of the power-law index of the average PDS ( ) for long GRBs (LGRBs) vary from 1.58 to 1.29 (for 100–245, 245–600, and 600–2000 keV). The Insight-HXMT data allow us to extend the energy of the LGRBs up to 2000 keV, and a relation between and energy E is obtained: (8–2000 keV). We first systematically investigate the average PDS and individual PDSs for short GRBs (SGRBs), and obtain (8–1000 keV), where the values of vary from 1.86 to 1.34. The distribution of the power-law index of an individual PDS (α) of an SGRB is consistent with that of an LGRB, and the α value for the group with a dominant timescale (the bent power law) is higher than that for the group with no dominant timescale (the single power law). Both LGRBs and SGRBs show similar α and , which indicates that they may be the result of similar stochastic processes. Typical values of the dominant timescale τ for LGRBs and SGRBs are 1.58 s and 0.02 s, respectively. It seems that τ varies in proportion to the duration of GRBs T90, with a relation . The GRB light curve may result from superposing a number of pulses with different timescales. No periodic or quasi-periodic signal above the 3σ significance threshold is found in our sample.

在这项研究中，研究人员调查了在不同温度和混合比下沉积的多组分水冰混合物中的四种高挥发性物质（CH4，CO，N2和Ar）的捕获效率。结果表明，在低冰沉积温度下，各种物质的捕获效率存在较小差异（CH4>CO>N2∼Ar），差异最多不超过两倍。随着沉积温度的升高，物质之间的捕获差异最多增加一个数量级。此外，冰混合物的总高挥发性物质浓度的变化也会影响相对捕获效率。这些实验结果有助于更好地解释彗星及相关天体观测中的高挥发性物质。 <br /><br />总结: 本研究调查了原行星盘中冰的混合物中高挥发性物质的捕获效率。研究发现，捕获效率受到冰矩阵结合能的影响，同时在浓缩冰中也存在最佳位置的竞争。这些结果有助于解释太空天体观测中的相关现象。 <div>
The distribution of chemical species in protoplanetary disks around young stars, especially their division between gas and solid phases, fundamentally shapes the composition of future planets and planetesimals. This distribution is likely affected by entrapment, a mechanism whereby volatile species are mechanically or chemically bound within a less volatile ice. In this study, we investigate the entrapment efficiencies of four hypervolatiles (CH4, CO, N2, and Ar) in multicomponent water ice mixtures deposited at different temperatures and mixture ratios. At low ice deposition temperatures, we observe small differences in entrapment efficiency (CH4>CO>N2∼Ar) up to a factor of two across species. The differences in entrapment between species increase by up to an order of magnitude with increasing deposition temperature. The relative entrapment efficiencies are also impacted by changes in the overall hypervolatile concentration of the ice mixtures. Collectively, these experiments suggest that relative entrapment efficiencies are mainly regulated by small differences in binding energies to the ice matrix, though competition for the best sites also influences entrapment in more concentrated ices. We use these results to better inform interpretations of hypervolatile observations in comets and related objects.

Coronal jets are one of the most common eruptive activities in the solar atmosphere. They are related to rich physics processes, including, but not limited to, magnetic reconnection, flaring, instabilities, and plasma heating. Automated identification of off-limb coronal jets has been difficult due to their abundant nature, complex appearance, and relatively small size compared to other features in the corona. In this paper, we present an automated jet identification algorithm (AJIA) that utilizes true and fake jets previously detected by a laborious semiautomated jet detection algorithm (SAJIA) as the input of an image segmentation neural network U-NET. It is found that AJIA can achieve a much higher (0.81) detecting precision than SAJIA (0.34) while giving the possibility of whether each pixel in an input image belongs to a jet. We demonstrate that with the aid of artificial neural networks, AJIA can enable fast, accurate, and real-time off-limb coronal jet identification from Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly 304 Å observations, which are essential in studying the collective and long-term behavior of coronal jets and their relation to the solar activity cycles.

We present a rigorous study of compact objects within f(Q) gravity where electrical fields and dark matter are studied and provide novel mass–radius relations with models falling in the mass gap of the events GW190814 and GW200210. After formulating the basic equations and finding their relevant solutions, we impose the boundary conditions on the system under treatment. The decoupled solution for the strange stellar model with the dark matter density profile is obtained. The distribution patterns of the effective energy density and the radial as well as the tangential pressure and anisotropy in the system are intensively examined. The stability properties of the stellar configuration and the influence of dark matter are studied. The recent observations of supermassive compact star candidates such as PSR J1614–2230 and PSR J0952–0607 with observed masses greater than or equal to 2 M⊙ have been employed in our study. Interestingly, the present study predicts the constraints on mass–radius measurements of the observed stars satisfying the equation of state based on the MIT bag model and employing the condition of mimicking, i.e., ρθ = in f(Q) gravity. Our graphical results exhibit that for a particular M–R curve with fixed values of the parameters, neutron stars having mass less than Mmax exist with larger radii within the context of the f(Q) formalism.

研究发现，在对B3 1343+451进行14年的Fermi望远镜观测的基础上，提取了0.1-500 GeV能量范围内的γ射线光变曲线，并确定了七次爆发期。在了解遥远类星体射流特性的基础上，采用标准的一区域亚电子模型对七次爆发期和一个平静期的多波段光谱能量分布进行了建模。研究还推测了B3 1343+451的射流可能不完全由Blandford–Payne过程解释，具有比较大的动能，而辐射功率较小，并且需要降低吸积效率。综合这些结果可以暗示B3 1343+451可能拥有环绕其质量黑洞的标准薄盘。<br /><br />总结: 高红移blazar B3 1343+451的Fermi望远镜长时间观测发现了七次爆发期，利用标准模型建模发现射流可能具有更大的动能，需要降低吸积效率，可能存在着标准薄盘。 <div>
High-redshift blazars are the most powerful extragalactic astrophysical sources ever detected in the high-energy γ-ray band. In this study, we present a temporal and spectral analysis of the high-redshift blazar B3 1343+451 based on 14 yr of the Fermi Large Area Telescope observations, spanning from 2008 August 4 to 2022 June 6 (MJD = 54686–59733). We extract a 7 day binned γ-ray light curve in the energy range 0.1–500 GeV and identify seven outburst periods with a peak flux of >4.32 × 10−7 ph cm−2 s−1. The highest 7 day flux (above 100 MeV) reaches (8.06 ± 0.56) × 10−7 erg cm−2 s−1 on MJD = 56177.16, which is 10 times higher than the flux in the quiescent period. To understand the properties of distant blazar jets, we employ a standard one-zone leptonic scenario and model the multiwavelength spectral energy distributions of one quiescent and seven flaring periods. We find that the γ-ray spectrum is better reproduced when the dissipation region of the jet, Rdiss, is located within the molecular torus, where infrared emission is the dominant external photon field. We infer that the jets in higher-redshift blazars have larger power and kinetic energy, where the kinetic energy is significantly greater than the radiation power, and the jet production efficiency suggests that we need to lower the accretion efficiency. These results imply that B3 1343+451 may have a standard thin disk surrounding its massive black hole, and the jets of B3 1343+451 may not be fully explained by the Blandford–Payne process.

总结:
本研究使用Keck Cosmic Web Imager观测46个低红移、低质量恒星形成星系和两个质量为10^8.8M⊙的静止星系，旨在探讨介于本地星系群卫星星系和大质量场星系之间的星系化学演化。我们开发了一种新的方法，同时确定了恒星中的铁和镁丰度。利用强线法测量气相氧丰度(O/H)g，我们首次能够对星际介质和恒星中的α元素进行直接比较。我们发现[Mg/H]*–[O/H]g关系比[Fe/H]*–[O/H]g关系更紧密，这可以通过α元素的类似产生过程来解释。我们的样本中大多数星系的[O/H]g都高于[Fe/H]*和[Mg/H]*。此外，我们构建了作为三种不同元素(Fe*, Mg*, Og)的质量-金属丰度关系(MZR)。与气体O-MZR相比，恒星Fe-MZR和Mg-MZR显示出更大的离散度，这是由于特定星形成率(sSFR)的变化所驱动的，具有较高sSFR的恒星形成星系在固定质量下显示出较高的sSFR和较低的恒星丰度。[O/H]g相对于恒星丰度的过量以及sSFR与恒星丰度的反相关暗示，M* ∼ 10^8−10M⊙的中等质量星系的淘汰主要是由于饥饿驱动的。<br /><br /> <div>
Understanding the chemical enrichment of different elements is crucial to gaining a complete picture of galaxy chemical evolution. In this study, we present a new sample of 46 low-redshift, low-mass star-forming galaxies at M* ∼ 108−10M⊙ along with two quiescent galaxies at M* ∼ 108.8M⊙ observed with the Keck Cosmic Web Imager, aiming to investigate the chemical evolution of galaxies in the transition zone between Local Group satellites and massive field galaxies. We develop a novel method to simultaneously determine stellar abundances of iron and magnesium in star-forming galaxies. With the gas-phase oxygen abundance (O/H)g measured using the strong-line method, we are able to make the first-ever apples-to-apples comparison of α elements in the stars and the interstellar medium. We find that the [Mg/H]*–[O/H]g relation is much tighter than the [Fe/H]*–[O/H]g relation, which can be explained by the similar production processes of α elements. Most galaxies in our sample exhibit higher [O/H]g than [Fe/H]* and [Mg/H]*. In addition, we construct mass–metallicity relations (MZRs) measured as three different elements (Fe*, Mg*, Og). Compared to the gas O-MZR, the stellar Fe- and Mg-MZRs show larger scatter driven by variations in specific star formation rates (sSFR), with star-forming galaxies exhibiting higher sSFR and lower stellar abundances at fixed mass. The excess of [O/H]g compared to stellar abundances as well as the anticorrelation between sSFR and stellar abundance suggests that galaxy quenching of intermediate-mass galaxies at M* ∼ 108−10M⊙ is primarily driven by starvation.

<div> 天体行星形成，太阳系，盘状模型，N体模拟，内迁
总结:
天体行星形成，包括太阳系中的地球和超地球/亚类海王星系统，可以通过模拟在一个盘状模型中进行。N体模拟表明，质量小于地球质量的行星形成于离太阳1天文单位远的区域，不会向内偏移，保持高的径向质量浓度。质量大于地球质量的行星则会在盘状模型的外迁区域缓慢向内迁移，最终可能移动到大约10天的轨道上。这一模型预测，来自离太阳1天文单位远附近的环内迁形成的地球和次地球在近内迁区域不会很常见。 <div>
For the origin of the radially concentrated solar system’s terrestrial planets, planet formation from a ring of solids at about 1 au from the Sun with convergent/suppressed type I migration is preferred. On the other hand, many super-Earths and sub-Neptunes are found in the close-in region with orbital periods of 10–100 days, so that planet formation from rings in the 1 au region would require some degree of inward migration. One way to realize these different formation scenarios is to use different gas disk models. In this study, we investigate whether different scenarios can be realized within a single framework. We consider a disk model that evolves via disk winds and develops a density peak, and study planet formation and orbital evolution using N-body simulations. Planets with masses less than an Earth mass formed from a low-mass ring resembling the solar system do not migrate inward even in the evolving disk and remain near 1 au orbits, maintaining a high radial mass concentration. On the other hand, planets with masses greater than an Earth mass formed from a massive ring slowly migrate inward above the outward migration region. As a result, the innermost planet can move to an orbit of about 10 days. The simulation results also reproduce the characteristics (e.g., mass distribution, eccentricity, orbital separation) of the solar system and super-Earth/sub-Neptune systems. Our model predicts that Earths and sub-Earths formed by migration from rings near the 1 au region are less abundant in the close-in region.

<br />
这项研究通过对低频射电星系的聚类和宇宙微波背景透镜效应的测量，来限制超大质量黑洞产生的喷流与周围气体介质相互作用的环境。研究发现这些系统位于类似于星系团的暗物质晕的内部，并且这些暗物质晕的增长速率与过去约100亿年暗物质晕平均增长速率一致。聚类和光度函数的共同演变表明这些系统的工作周期大约为10％，但自大约z∼2以来略有增加，而类星体的工作周期却在下降。在动力学上，强大的喷流加热优于类星体风对于暗物质晕和星系团质量的作用，这与星系演化的范式一致，其中机械喷流能量反馈是团和星系团中气体含量的主要加热机制。
<br /><br />总结: 超大质量黑洞形成的相对论性喷流对于星系演化具有重要影响，在过去100亿年里，这些系统占据着类星体质量为1013–1014太阳质量的暗物质晕，呈现出工作周期大约为10％的特征，而且在过去的演化过程中有所增加。与此同时，它们在质量大于1013太阳质量的暗物质晕内的加热作用也优于类星体。 <div>
Coupling between relativistic jets launched by accreting supermassive black holes and the surrounding gaseous media is a vital ingredient in galaxy evolution models. To constrain the environments in which this feedback takes place over cosmic time, we study the host-halo properties of luminous low-frequency radio galaxies (L150 MHz ≳ 1025.25 W Hz−1) selected with the International Low-Frequency Array Telescope out to z ∼ 2 through tomographic clustering and cosmic microwave background lensing measurements. We find that these systems occupy halos characteristic of galaxy groups (Mh = 1013–1014h−1 M⊙), evolving at a rate consistent with the mean growth rate of halos over the past ∼10 Gyr. The coevolution of the clustering and the luminosity function reveals that the duty cycle of these systems is of order ∼10% but has been mildly increasing since z ∼ 2, while the duty cycle of quasars has been declining. We estimate the characteristic kinetic heating power injected by powerful jets per halo as a function of mass, and compare to the same quantity injected by quasar winds. We find that powerful jet heating dominates over quasar winds in halos Mh ≳ 1013 h−1 M⊙ at z < 2. These results conform to the paradigm of galaxy evolution in which mechanical jet power feedback is the dominant heating mechanism of the gas content of groups and clusters.

本文研究了等离子湍流的动力学模型，在模拟实验中系统地变化了离子-电子质量比，发现质量比对动力学范围的动态和等离子体加热都有重要影响。对离子和电子而言，质量比的改变导致了加热/耗散过程的本质巨大变化，同时也对加热过程产生了显著影响。最终发现，离子-电子质量比约为250时，可以捕捉到电子加热的渐近行为。本研究揭示了等离子体湍流动力学中质量比的重要影响。 <div>
Understanding plasma turbulence requires a synthesis of experiments, observations, theory, and simulations. In the case of kinetic plasmas such as the solar wind, the lack of collisions renders the fluid closures such as viscosity meaningless and one needs to resort to higher-order fluid models or kinetic models. Typically, the computational expense in such models is managed by simulating artificial values of certain parameters such as the ratio of the Alfvén speed to the speed of light (vA/c) or the relative mass ratio of ions and electrons (mi/me). Although, typically care is taken to use values as close as possible to realistic values within the computational constraints, these artificial values could potentially introduce unphysical effects. These unphysical effects could be significant at sub-ion scales, where kinetic effects are the most important. In this paper, we use the 10-moment fluid model in the Gkeyll framework to perform controlled numerical experiments, systematically varying the ion–electron mass ratio from a small value down to the realistic proton–electron mass ratio. We show that the unphysical mass ratio has a significant effect on the kinetic range dynamics as well as the heating of both plasma species. The dissipative process for both ions and electrons becomes more compressive in nature, although the ions remain nearly incompressible in all cases. The electrons move from being dominated by incompressive viscous-like heating/dissipation to very compressive heating/dissipation dominated by compressions/rarefactions. While the heating change is significant for the electrons, a mass ratio of mi/me ∼ 250 captures the asymptotic behavior of electron heating.

<div> Andromeda XVIII, dwarf galaxy, spectroscopy, metallicity, quenching<br />
<br />总结:<br />Andromeda XVIII是一种孤立的矮星系，可能受到M31近距离经过的影响，其金属丰度分布不符合简单的化学演化模型，表明星形成可能突然中断。平均速度和金属丰度与M31相对速度表明可能是由于M31的近距离经过导致的气体损失或者内部反馈对星系形成的影响。 <div>
Andromeda XVIII is an isolated dwarf galaxy 579 kpc away from the nearest large galaxy, M31. It is a candidate “backsplash galaxy” that might have been affected by a close passage to M31. We present new Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopy of Andromeda XVIII to assess the likelihood that it is a backsplash galaxy. We estimated the velocities, metallicities ([Fe/H]), and α-enhancements ([α/Fe]) for 56 probable members. Based on the abundances of 38 stars with low errors (δ[Fe/H] < 0.3), parameters for the simplest chemical evolution models were estimated using the maximum likelihood coupled with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. The metallicity distribution is inconsistent with these models, due to a sharp metal-rich cutoff. We estimated Andromeda XVIII’s mean heliocentric velocity, rotation velocity, position angle of the rotation axis, and velocity dispersion using the maximum likelihood coupled with an MCMC. There is no evidence for bulk rotation, though subpopulations might be rotating. The mean heliocentric velocity is −337.2 km s−1, such that the line-of-sight velocity relative to M31 is lower than the escape velocity from M31. Together, the metallicity distribution and the mean velocity are consistent with a sudden interruption of star formation. For possible causes of this quenching, we considered gas loss due to ram pressure stripping during a close passage by M31 or due to a past major merger. However, we cannot rule out internal feedback (i.e., a terminal wind).

Near-Earth supernova blasts which engulf the solar system have left traces of their ejecta in the geological and lunar records. There is now a wealth of data on live radioactive 60Fe pointing to a supernova at 3 Myr ago, as well as the recent discovery of an event at 7 Myr ago. We use the available measurements to evaluate the distances to these events. For the better analyzed supernova at 3 Myr, samples include deep-sea sediments, ferromanganese crusts, and lunar regolith; we explore the consistency among and across these measurements, which depends sensitively on the uptake of iron in the samples as well as possible anisotropies in the 60Fe fallout. There is also significant uncertainty in the astronomical parameters needed for these calculations. We take the opportunity to perform a parameter study on the effects that the ejected 60Fe mass from a core-collapse supernova and the fraction of dust that survives the remnant have on the resulting distance. We find that with an ejected 60Fe mass of 3 × 10−5M⊙ and a dust fraction of 10%, the distance range for the supernova 3 Myr ago is D ∼ 20–140 pc, with the most likely range between 50 and 65 pc. Using the same astrophysical parameters, the distance for the supernova at 7 Myr ago is D ∼ 110 pc. We close with a brief discussion of geological and astronomical measurements that can improve these results.

<div> 关键词: GRBs, 外部冲击模型, 光度曲线, 初能标, 磁场强度
总结:
外部冲击模型在薄壳情景下预测了伽马射线暴（GRBs）光学余辉曲线中的起始颠峰。研究收集了30个GRBs的典型光度曲线样本，并从其X射线和光学余辉曲线的联合拟合中推导了射流特性。结果发现，初始洛伦兹因子（Γ0）、减速半径（Rdec）和磁场强度（B0）的分布是对数正态的，但等离子体动能（Ek,iso）、介质密度（n0）和磁化参数（σB）的分布可能是双峰的。发现了严格的Rdec-B0-σB关系，推测支持先前的观点，即GRB辐射能量在GRBs之间是普遍存在的。模拟了26个GRBs的光度曲线需要喷流折射。射流开角和校正后的动能的分布分别呈对数正态分布（标准差σ=0.27）和（σ=0.54）。那些（19个GRBs）其中，其俄罗斯语报均匀估计出广能量段观测，可满足先前发现的Lγ，p，iso–Ep，z–Γ0关系，并且它们的γ射线辐射效率对数正态地分布在0.04%到10%范围内，中心值为0.42%。这种低效率有利于重子火球模型，并且它们的质子质量加载在GRB抛射物中的分布对数正态地集中在（σ=0.75）。 <div>
The standard external shock model in the thin-shell scenario predicts an onset bump in the early optical afterglow light curves of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We collect such a textbook-version light-curve sample of 30 GRBs and derive the jet properties from our joint fit to their X-ray and optical afterglow light curves. It is found that the distributions of the isotropic initial Lorentz factors (Γ0), the deceleration radii (Rdec), and the magnetic field strength (B0) are log-normal, but the distributions of the isotropic kinetic energy (Ek,iso), medium density (n0), and magnetization parameter (σB ≡ ϵB/ϵe) are tentatively bimodal. A tight Rdec–B0–σB relation is found. It infers a universal ϵeEk,iso among bursts, plausibly supporting the previous argument of a universal GRB radiation energy among GRBs. A jet break is required for modeling the light curves of 26 GRBs. The distributions of the jet opening angles and the jet-corrected kinetic energies log-normally center at (standard deviation σ = 0.27) and (σ = 0.54), respectively. Those GRBs (19 GRBs), whose prompt gamma-ray emission is well estimated with broad energy-band observations, satisfy the previously discovered Lγ,p,iso–Ep,z–Γ0 relation, and their gamma-ray radiation efficiencies log-normally distribute in the range from 0.04% to 10% with a central value of 0.42%. Such a low efficiency favors the baryonic fireball model, and the distribution of their baryon mass loading in the GRB ejecta log-normally centers at (σ = 0.75).

Recently Gagné et al. suggested that young moving groups with similar kinematic properties could be part of larger dissolving structures. One example was IC 2602 as the core of a group of associations, including its corona (CIC 2602), Tucana-Horologium (THA), and parts of Theia 92. We explore this hypothesis by measuring the rotation periods of 953 objects selected using Gaia DR3 kinematics from IC 2602, CIC 2602, Theia 92, and a newly identified group of stars that bridge IC 2602 and THA. We use Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) full frame images to measure new rotation periods and combine these with the rotation periods for THA from Popinchalk et al. to compare their rotation period distributions and other youth indicators where available to examine if the groups could be coeval. We find strong agreement between the rotation distributions of IC 2602, CIC 2602, and THA, suggesting a shared age of ∼40 Myr, and which in combination could serve as an example of a typical distribution at this age. Theia 92 does not agree at the same level, and we explore the potential kinematic reasons it does not match the rotation period distribution of the larger groups. Additionally, in our light curve analysis we identify ∼50 potential binaries, as well as four new M dwarf complex rotators that show major morphological changes between TESS cycles. Finally, using the amplitudes of the rotation periods we measured, we find strong agreement with the amplitude–age relation presented in Morris for our 40 Myr groups.

<div> SN 2024ggi, type II supernova, NGC 3621, UV-optical-near-infrared observations, progenitor mass-loss rate

总结:
SN 2024ggi是位于NGC 3621的II型超新星，通过UV-光学-近红外观测以及建模分析，发现其具有IIn-like特征，暗示其周围存在光电离的厚CSM。在观测的不同时间点上，发现了He ii，C iv，N iv/v和O v的发射线，显示出蓝向偏移的特征，这可能是由于扩展而密集的CSM引起的。此外，SN 2024ggi的峰值UV-光学绝对星等与已知的CSM相互作用的II型超新星的特征一致。建立的辐射流体力学模拟显示，爆发前约3年，SN 2024ggi的前体星经历了增强的质量流失。 <div>
We present UV–optical–near-infrared observations and modeling of supernova (SN) 2024ggi, a type II supernova (SN II) located in NGC 3621 at 7.2 Mpc. Early-time (“flash”) spectroscopy of SN 2024ggi within +0.8 days of discovery shows emission lines of H i, He i, C iii, and N iii with a narrow core and broad, symmetric wings (i.e., “IIn-like”) arising from the photoionized, optically thick, unshocked circumstellar material (CSM) that surrounded the progenitor star at shock breakout (SBO). By the next spectral epoch at +1.5 days, SN 2024ggi showed a rise in ionization as emission lines of He ii, C iv, N iv/v, and O v became visible. This phenomenon is temporally consistent with a blueward shift in the UV–optical colors, both likely the result of SBO in an extended, dense CSM. The IIn-like features in SN 2024ggi persist on a timescale of tIIn = 3.8 ± 1.6 days, at which time a reduction in CSM density allows the detection of Doppler-broadened features from the fastest SN material. SN 2024ggi has peak UV–optical absolute magnitudes of Mw2 = −18.7 mag and Mg = −18.1 mag, respectively, that are consistent with the known population of CSM-interacting SNe II. Comparison of SN 2024ggi with a grid of radiation hydrodynamics and non–local thermodynamic equilibrium radiative-transfer simulations suggests a progenitor mass-loss rate of yr−1 (vw = 50 km s−1), confined to a distance of r < 5 × 1014 cm. Assuming a wind velocity of vw = 50 km s−1, the progenitor star underwent an enhanced mass-loss episode in the last ∼3 yr before explosion.

<div> NDAF, SGWB, neutrino, CCSN, metallicity
<br /><br />总结:
本研究通过对回落型核心坍缩超新星（CCSN）模拟的结果，研究了以中微子为主导的吸积流（NDAFs）产生的随机引力波背景（SGWB）。研究发现，预测的SGWB主要取决于典型CCSN初始爆炸能量和母体金属丰度。在乐观情况下，如果典型的初始爆炸能量较低，则NDAFs产生的SGWB可能会被下一代太空干涉仪（如DECi-hertz干涉引力波观测器和宇宙大爆炸观测器）探测到。在低频领域∼10−3–10−1 Hz，该背景与标准的通货膨胀模型预期的背景相当。因此，NDAFs产生的SGWB可能成为研究通货膨胀时期产生的SGWB的前景。结合NDAF中微子背景和NDAFs产生的SGWB，可以限制CCSNe和NDAFs的属性。 <div>
We investigate the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) from neutrino-dominated accretion flows (NDAFs) based on the results of our fallback core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulations. We find that the predicted SGWB is mainly determined by the typical CCSN initial explosion energy and progenitor metallicity. For the optimistic cases in which the typical initial explosion energy is low, the SGWB from NDAFs without disk outflows might be detected by next-generation space-based interferometers such as DECi-hertz Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory and Big Bang Observer. In the low-frequency regime ∼10−3–10−1 Hz, this background is comparable to that expected from standard inflationary models. Therefore, the SGWB from NDAFs may become a foreground for research of the SGWB generated in the inflationary epoch. Combining the diffuse NDAF neutrino background and SGWB from NDAFs, one may constrain the properties of the CCSNe and NDAFs.

<div> 关键词: JWST, magnetar, MIRI, NIRCam, power-law model<br />
总结: <br />
JWST使用MIRI和NIRCam仪器对磁星4U 0142+61进行了观测。结果显示该磁星的光谱可以用吸收功率模型描述，不支持之前基于Spitzer光度提出的被动盘模型。研究者认为这些发现可能是由于非热源和观测时间的变化。另外，JWST的观测结果与NuSTAR的硬X射线光谱比较显示，X射线和红外非热发射可能来自磁星磁层中的不同区域。 <div>
JWST observed the magnetar 4U 0142+61 with the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) and Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) instruments within a 77 minute time interval on 2022 September 20–21. The low-resolution MIRI spectrum and NIRCam photometry show that the spectrum in the wavelength range 1.4–11 μm range can be satisfactorily described by an absorbed power-law (PL) model, fν ∝ ν−α, with a spectral slope α = 0.96 ± 0.02, interstellar extinction AV = 3.9 ± 0.2, and normalization f0 = 59.4 ± 0.5 μJy at λ = 8 μm. These observations do not support the passive disk model proposed in 2006 by Wang, Chakrabarty and Kaplan, based on Spitzer photometry, which was interpreted as evidence for a fallback disk from debris formed during the supernova explosion. We suggest a nonthermal origin for this emission and source variability as the most likely cause of discrepancies between the JWST data and other IR-optical observing campaigns. However, we cannot firmly exclude the presence of a large disk with a different dependence of the effective disk temperature on distance from the magnetar. Comparison with the PL fit to the hard X-ray spectrum above 10 keV, measured by the NuSTAR contemporaneously with JWST, shows that the X-ray spectrum is significantly harder. This may imply that the X-ray and IR nonthermal emission come from different sites in the magnetosphere of the magnetar.

<div> 关键词: Lagrangian, Gaussian process, Hubble measurements, ΛCDM, f(Q) parameterization

总结: 
该研究探讨了在引力修正理论中选择Lagrangian函数形式的标准程序的差异增加的问题，并提出了使用高斯过程来消除这一问题的方法。研究使用宇宙年代计和径向宇宙学声学振荡的58个哈勃测量来重建Hubble参数H(z)及其导数和H″(z)，从而在不做任何假设的情况下重建了f(Q)的区域。得到的平均曲线沿着Lambda冷暗物质(ΛCDM)常数在重建区域内呈现二次行为，这促使提出了一个新的f(Q)参数化，即f(Q) = −2Λ + ϵQ2，其中ϵ是一个单一参数，表示与ΛCDM宇宙学的偏差。此外，对比重建区域，探讨了广泛研究的幂律和指数f(Q)模型，并且大大改善了对参数空间的观测分析。此外，直接的哈勃测量以及重建的f(Q)函数使得H0张力得以缓解。 <div>
The increase of discrepancy in the standard procedure to choose the arbitrary functional form of the Lagrangian f(Q) motivates us to solve this issue in modified theories of gravity. In this regard, we investigate the Gaussian process, which allows us to eliminate this issue in an f(Q) model-independent way. In particular, we use the 58 Hubble measurements coming from cosmic chronometers and the radial Baryon acoustic oscillations to reconstruct H(z) and its derivatives and H″(z), which leads us to reconstruct the region of f(Q), without any assumptions. The obtained mean curve along the Lambda Cold Dark Matter (ΛCDM) constant in the reconstructed region follows a quadratic behavior. This motivates us to propose a new f(Q) parameterization, i.e., f(Q) = −2Λ + ϵQ2, with the single parameter ϵ, which signifies the deviations from ΛCDM cosmology. Further, we probe the widely studied power-law and exponential f(Q) models against the reconstructed region and can improve the parameter spaces significantly compared with observational analysis. In addition, the direct Hubble measurements, along with the reconstructed f(Q) function, allow the H0 tension to be alleviated.

总结: 
这是一篇关于对年轻的、多云的红色L矮星进行大气检索分析的文章。研究使用了Brewster检索框架，并对年轻K矮星进行了首次元素丰度测量。研究发现在存在凝结云物种的复杂多云L矮星区域，只有近红外数据时，检索分析变得更加困难。尽管测试了三种不同的热剖面参数化，我们仍然无法约束可靠的丰度测量，因此无法确定碳氧比。然而，数据强烈支持云模型而不是无云模型。无论检查的数据的信噪比如何（CWISER BD+60 1417B的S/N约为10，W0047的S/N约为40），检索约束的困难依然存在。这项工作为检索年轻、低表面重力多云L矮星提供了宝贵的经验教训。这项研究进一步证明了模型中存在信息缺失的现象，并迫切需要JWST来指导和提供这一区域的检索分析。 <br /> <div>
We present an atmospheric retrieval analysis on a set of young, cloudy, red L dwarfs—CWISER J124332.12+600126.2 (BD+60 1417B) and WISEP J004701.06+680352.1 (W0047)—using the Brewster retrieval framework. We also present the first elemental abundance measurements of the young K-dwarf (K0) host star, BD+60 1417, using high-resolution (R = 50,000) spectra taken with the Potsdam Echelle Polarimetric and Spectroscopic Instrument on the Large Binocular Telescope. In the complex cloudy L-dwarf regime the emergence of condensate cloud species complicates retrieval analysis when only near-infrared data are available. We find that for both L dwarfs in this work, despite testing three different thermal profile parameterizations we are unable to constrain reliable abundance measurements and thus the carbon-to-oxygen ratio. While we cannot conclude what the abundances are, we can conclude that the data strongly favor a cloud model over a cloudless model. We note that the difficulty in retrieval constraints persists regardless of the signal-to-noise ratio of the data examined (S/N ∼ 10 for CWISER BD+60 1417B and 40 for WISEP W0047). The results presented in this work provide valuable lessons about retrieving young, low-surface-gravity cloudy L dwarfs. This work provides continued evidence of missing information in models and the crucial need for JWST to guide and inform retrieval analysis in this regime.

在这篇文章中，研究了1 AU处的多种能量粒子强度增强事件。识别为一个包括流界面、正反冲击对和嵌入的太阳圈电流片的共旋相互作用区（CIR）结构。文章指出CIR事件的显著特征是：高能（>1 MeV）离子在CIR结构的反波（RW）/冲击处显示了明显的通量增强，这似乎取决于能量。此外，40.5-520 keV能量范围的电子在通过SI和HCS区域后立即加速，并在RW处仅高能电子（约520 keV）显示出明显的局部通量增强。CIR结构后面是由日冕物质抛射（CME）驱动的快速垂直冲击，观察到低能质子和高能电子的通量显著增强。特别地，210-330 keV质子和180-520 keV电子的通量增加了约2个数量级。文章进一步提出，SI和RW处湍流的增加可能是不同物种观察到的通量增强的重要因素。另外，在RW附近存在离子尺度波动，这表明共振波-粒子相互作用可能是高能质子和离子尺度波之间高效的能量转移器。<br /><br />总结：本文研究了1 AU处CIR结构引起的能量粒子强度增强事件。主要观察到高能离子在反波/冲击处通量增强，与能量相关；低能电子通过SI和HCS区域后立即加速，RW处仅高能电子显示通量增强；CIR结构后面的ICME驱动冲击显著增加了低能质子和高能电子的通量。文章进一步指出SI和RW处湍流的增加可能是不同物种通量增强的重要因素，同时离子尺度波动可能是高能质子和离子间高效能量转移的关键。 <div>
A multispecies energetic particle intensity enhancement event at 1 au is analyzed. We identify this event as a corotating interaction region (CIR) structure that includes a stream interface (SI), a forward-reverse shock pair, and an embedded heliospheric current sheet (HCS). The distinct feature of this CIR event is that (1) the high-energy (>1 MeV) ions show significant flux enhancement at the reverse wave (RW)/shock of the CIR structure, following their passage through the SI and HCS. The flux amplification appears to depend on the energy per nucleon. (2) Electrons in the energy range of 40.5–520 keV are accelerated immediately after passing through the SI and HCS regions, and the flux quickly reaches a peak for low-energy electrons. At the RW, only high-energy electrons (∼520 keV) show significant local flux enhancement. The CIR structure is followed by a fast-forward perpendicular shock driven by a coronal mass ejection (CME), and we observed a significant flux enhancement of low-energy protons and high-energy electrons. Specifically, the 210–330 keV proton and 180–520 keV electron fluxes are enhanced by approximately 2 orders of magnitude. This suggests that the later ICME-driven shock may accelerate particles out of the suprathermal pool. In this paper, we further present that for CIR-accelerated particles, the increase in turbulence power at SI and RWs may be an important factor for the observed flux enhancement in different species. The presence of ion-scale waves near the RW, as indicated by the spectral bump near the proton gyrofrequency, suggests that the resonant wave–particle interaction may act as an efficient energy transferrer between energetic protons and ion-scale waves.

总结:
本研究利用AstroSat CZTI、Swift Burst Alert Telescope和Fermi/GBM的档案数据对五个明亮的伽马射线暴进行了光谱、时间和极化特性的研究。我们通过改进的极化技术和增加有效面积和带宽，进行了时间分辨和能量分辨的极化测量，并使用经验和物理的同步辐射模型进行了详细分析。研究结果显示，一些伽马射线暴具有Poynting流主导的喷流，而另一些具有磁化较弱的巴里子喷流。此外，我们观察到一次亮的伽马射线暴中极化角发生了快速变化。这项研究表明，利用光谱极化研究可以揭示伽马射线暴喷流的广泛磁化范围。<br /><br /> <div>
The radiation mechanism underlying the prompt emission remains unresolved and can be resolved using a systematic and uniform time-resolved spectro-polarimetric study. In this paper, we investigated the spectral, temporal, and polarimetric characteristics of five bright gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) using archival data from AstroSat CZTI, Swift Burst Alert Telescope, and Fermi/GBM. These bright GRBs were detected by CZTI in its first year of operation, and their average polarization characteristics have been published in Chattopadhyay et al. In the present work, we examined the time-resolved (in 100–600 keV) and energy-resolved polarization measurements of these GRBs with an improved polarimetric technique such as increasing the effective area and bandwidth (by using data from low-gain pixels), using an improved event selection logic to reduce noise in the double events and extend the spectral bandwidth. In addition, we also separately carried out detailed time-resolved spectral analyses of these GRBs using empirical and physical synchrotron models. By these improved time-resolved and energy-resolved spectral and polarimetric studies (not fully coupled spectro-polarimetric fitting), we could pin down the elusive prompt emission mechanism of these GRBs. Our spectro-polarimetric analysis reveals that GRB 160623A, GRB 160703A, and GRB 160821A have Poynting flux-dominated jets. On the other hand, GRB 160325A and GRB 160802A have baryonic-dominated jets with mild magnetization. Furthermore, we observe a rapid change in polarization angle by ∼90° within the main pulse of very bright GRB 160821A, consistent with our previous results. Our study suggests that the jet composition of GRBs may exhibit a wide range of magnetization, which can be revealed by utilizing spectro-polarimetric investigations of the bright GRBs.

<div> 双星系统，行星轨道，盘面扭曲，耗散性进动，系统的动力学建模<br />
总结:<br />
这项研究发现了一些行星-双星系统会出现行星轨道与双星轨道在同一平面上的趋势。他们提出了一个耗散性进动的模型，该模型将双星系统在原行星盘阶段的动态与盘面扭曲结合起来，指出了系统如何在受到倾斜双星伴星的影响下逐渐趋于轨道对齐。他们的模型显示，初始方向随机的系统在经历耗散性进动后会更加趋于对齐，并且这一过程还能产生与观测相一致的倾斜分布。研究结果表明，耗散性进动可能在一部分中等宽双星-行星系统的轨道配置中起到重要作用，但可能不是观测到的整体对齐趋势的唯一原因。 <div>
Recent observations have demonstrated that some subsets of even moderately wide-separation planet-hosting binaries are preferentially configured such that planetary and binary orbits appear to lie within the same plane. In this work, we explore dissipation during the protoplanetary disk phase, induced by disk warping as the system is forced into nodal recession by an inclined binary companion as a possible avenue of achieving orbit–orbit alignment. We analytically model the coupled evolution of the disk angular momentum vector and stellar spin vector under the influence of a distant binary companion. We find that a population of systems with random initial orientations can appear detectably more aligned after undergoing dissipative precession, and that this process can simultaneously produce an obliquity distribution that is consistent with observations. While dissipative precession proceeds efficiently in close binaries, favorable system properties (e.g., rout ≳ 100 au, α ≳ 0.05, and/or Mb/M* ≳ 1) are required to reproduce observed alignment trends at wider binary separations ab ≳ 450 au. Our framework further predicts that circum-primary planets in systems with high stellar mass ratios should be preferentially less aligned than planets in equal mass stellar binary systems. We discover tentative evidence for this trend in Gaia DR3 and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite data. Our findings suggest that dissipative precession may play a significant role in sculpting orbital configurations in a subset of moderately wide planet-hosting binaries, but is likely not solely responsible for their observed population-level alignment.

<div> gamma-ray bursts, relativistic jet, afterglow, two-component jet, reverse shock<br />电磁爆发、相对论性喷流、余辉、双组分喷流、反冲冲击<br /><br />总结: 本文提出了伽马射线暴余辉的双组分喷流假设，并通过GRB 191221B的观测结果支持了这一假设。光学余辉表现出了一个平台期和陡峭的衰减，这与双组分喷流相互作用产生的特征一致。作者提出了对光学余辉、X射线余辉和射电余辉的解释，表明不同阶段受到不同成分喷流的影响。这一研究为理解伽马射线暴遗留的余辉提供了重要线索。 <div>
The afterglows of gamma-ray bursts are believed to have originated from a relativistic jet, which is driven by the merger of compact binary objects or the core collapse of massive stars. Some of their jets may consist of two components: a faster (but narrower) jet and a slower (but wider) jet. The light curves produced by the interaction between the two-component jet and the surrounding medium typically exhibit a chromatic break in multiple bands. For GRB 191221B, the optical light curve of the afterglow exhibits a plateau from 33 to 143 s, followed by a steeper decay that is consistent with the characteristics of reverse shock from an arbitrarily magnetized ejecta. The flattening at ∼10 ks exhibits chromaticity relative to the X-ray afterglow. We propose that the two-component jet scenario can explain this observational result: For the X-ray afterglow, the narrow jet forward shock is dominated until ∼10 ks, and then both the narrow and wide components contribute comparable flux from the forward shock. For the optical afterglow, the first 2 ks is dominated by the narrow jet reverse shock emission (the plateau from 33 to 143 s is due to the jet being magnetized). Between 2 and 10 ks, the forward shock of the narrow jet dominates the optical afterglow, then transitions to wide component forward shock dominance, causing a chromatic plateau. For radio afterglow, the data are only presented after 105 s, which is dominated by the wide jet forward shock emission.

We present results from the JWST First Reionization Epoch Spectroscopically Complete Observations survey on the star-forming sequence (SFS) of galaxies at 1.0 < z < 1.7, around the peak of the cosmic star formation history. Star formation rates (SFRs) are measured from the redshifted, relatively dust-insensitive Paschen-α emission line, and stellar mass measurements include the F444W (4.4 μm; rest-frame H) band. We find SFRs of galaxies with log(M*/M⊙) > 9.5 that are lower than found in many earlier studies by up to 0.6 dex, but in good agreement with recent results obtained with the Prospector fitting framework. The difference (log(SFR(Paα)-SFR(Prospector)) is −0.09 ± 0.04 dex at 1010−11M⊙. We also measure the empirical relation between Paschen-α luminosity and rest-frame H-band magnitude and find that the scatter is only 0.04 dex lower than that of the SFR–M* relation and is much lower than the systematic differences among relations in the literature due to various methods of converting observed measurements to physical properties. We additionally identify examples of sources—that, with standard cutoffs via the UVJ diagram, would be deemed quiescent—with significant (log(sSFR)> −11 yr−1), typically extended, Paschen-α emission. Our results may be indicative of the potential unification of methods used to derive the SFS with careful selection of star-forming galaxies and independent SFR and stellar mass indicators.

In the era of state-of-the-art space-borne telescopes, high-resolution ground-based observation has emerged as a crucial method for characterizing exoplanets, providing essential insights into their atmospheric compositions. In the optical and near-infrared regions, high-resolution spectroscopy has been powerful for hot Jupiters (HJs) and ultrahot Jupiters (UHJs) during their primary transits, as it can probe molecules with better sensitivity. Here, we focus on a comparative simulation study of WASP-76 b (UHJ) and WASP-77 A b (HJ) for different numbers of transits, utilizing three ground-based spectrographs, GIANO-B (Telescopio Nazionale Galileo), CARMENES (Centro Astronomico Hispano Alemán), and ANDES (European Extremely Large Telescope or E-ELT), with varying instrumental parameters, spectral coverages, and resolutions. We aim to evaluate the feasibility of using the upcoming ground-based E-ELT to probe molecules from planet atmospheres and to show how it surpasses other ground-based observatories in terms of detectability. With the 1D model petitCODE, we have self-consistently simulated the atmospheric pressure–temperature profiles, which are subsequently integrated into the 1D chemical kinetics model, VULCAN, to evolve the atmospheric chemistry. High-resolution spectra are obtained by performing line-by-line radiative transfer using petitRADTRANS. Finally, we use the resulting spectra to assess the detectability ( ) of molecular bands, employing the ground-based noise simulator SPECTR. Utilizing cross-correlation spectroscopy, we have successfully demonstrated the robust consistency between our simulation study and real-time observations for both planets. ANDES excels overall in molecular detection, due to its enhanced instrumental architecture, reinforcing E-ELT’s importance for studying exoplanet atmospheres. Additionally, our theoretical simulations predict the detection of CO, NH3, and H2S in the WASP-76 b atmosphere with > 3.

总结: <br />
该研究利用太阳动力学观测卫星的紫外成像观测了太阳耀斑产生的等离子体片的热特性。结果显示，在耀斑产生的等离子体片中存在着高温区域，这些区域具有等温特性，温度保持稳定且与高度无关。这暗示着在磁重联的过程中，存在着平衡的加热和冷却过程，以维持等离子体片的稳定结构。研究还发现，2017年9月10日X8.2级耀斑的等离子体片温度特性与其他情况略有不同，表现出温度随高度增加而降低的特点。总的来说，这些结果揭示了耀斑磁重联时产生的等离子体片具有稳定且均匀的结构。 <div>
The current sheet is an essential feature in solar flares and is the primary site for magnetic reconnection and energy release. Imaging observations feature a long linear structure above the candle-flame-shaped flare loops, which resembles the standard flare model with the current sheet viewed edge-on. We investigate the thermal properties of plasmas surrounding the linear sheet during flares, using EUV observations from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory. The differential emission measure analyses show evidence of high temperatures in the plasma sheets (PSs), containing hot emissions from only a narrow temperature range, suggestive of an isothermal feature. The sheet temperature remains constant at different heights above the flare arcade, peaking at around = 7.0–7.1; while the well-studied 2017 September 10 X8.2 flare serves as an exception in that the temperature decreases with increasing height and peaks higher ( = 7.25) during the gradual phase. Most PS cases also hold similar emission measures and thicknesses; while the PS emissions drop exponentially above the flare arcade, the sheet thicknesses show no significant height association as for all the measurements. The characteristics of isothermal and steady temperature suggest balanced heating and cooling processes along the current sheet; in particular, additional heating may exist to compensate for the conductive and radiative cooling away from the reconnection site. Our results suggest a steady and uniform sheet structure in the macroscopic scale that results from flare reconnection.

<div> PDS 70, protoplanetary system, gas giants, ALMA, JVLA
总结: 
PDS 70是一个原行星系统，有两颗正在积累气态巨行星PDS 70b和PDS 70c。通过ALMA和JVLA的观测，确定了系统内60-100天文单位以及两颗巨行星周围的尘埃环和环行天体盘。在ALMA观测中发现尘埃环呈现出方位上的不对称性。通过JVLA的观测，确定了在Ka和K波段的辐射，而在Q波段也有辐射信号但较弱，在X波段没有检测到辐射。通过观测得到了在33-44 GHz频率范围的谱指数(α)为5±1，22-33 GHz范围的谱指数为0.6±0.2，认为辐射主要来自于纳米级尘埃颗粒的自旋辐射。这些发现对了解原行星盘的性质有着重要意义，将来需要通过更高分辨率的观测来进一步探索这个问题。 <div>
PDS 70 is a protoplanetary system that hosts two actively accreting gas giants, namely, PDS 70b and PDS 70 c. The system has a ∼60–100 au dusty ring that has been resolved by the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA), along with circumplanetary disks around the two gas giants. Here, we report the first Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) Q- (40–48 GHz), Ka- (29–37 GHz), K- (18–26 GHz), and X- (8–12 GHz) bands' continuum observations, and the complementary ALMA Bands 3 (∼98 GHz) and 4 (∼145 GHz) observations towards PDS 70. The dusty ring appears azimuthally asymmetric in our ALMA images. We obtained firm detections at Ka and K bands without spatially resolving the source; we obtained a marginal detection at Q band, and no detection at X band. The spectral indices (α) are 5 ± 1 at 33–44 GHz and 0.6 ± 0.2 at 22–33 GHz. At 10–22 GHz, the conservative lower limit of α is 1.7. The 33–44 GHz flux density is likely dominated by the optically thin thermal emission of grown dust with ≳1 mm maximum grain sizes, which may be associated with the azimuthally asymmetric substructure induced by planet–disk interaction. Since PDS 70 was not detected at X band, we found it hard to explain the low spectral index at 22–33 GHz only with free–free emission. Hence, we attribute the dominant emission at 22–33 GHz to the emission of spinning nano-meter-sized dust particles, while free–free emission may partly contribute to emission at this frequency range. In some protoplanetary disks, the emission of spinning nano-meter-sized dust particles may resemble the 20–50 GHz excess in the spectra of millimeter-sized dust. The finding of strong continuum emission of spinning nano-meter-sized particles can complicate the procedure of constraining the properties of grown dust. Future high resolution, multifrequency JVLA/Next Generation Very Large Array and Square Kilometer Array observations may shed light on this issue.

Very few detections have been made of optical flashes contemporaneous with prompt high-energy emission from a gamma-ray burst (GRB). In this work, we present and analyze light curves of GRB-associated optical flashes and afterglows from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). Our sample consists of eight GRBs with arcsecond-level localizations from the X-Ray Telescope on board the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (Swift). For each burst, we characterize the prompt optical emission and any observed afterglow, and constrain physical parameters for four of these bursts using their TESS light curves. This work also presents a straightforward method to correct for TESS's cosmic-ray mitigation strategy on 20 s timescales, which allows us to estimate the “true” brightness of optical flashes associated with prompt GRB emission. We also highlight TESS’s continuous wide-field monitoring capability, which provides an efficient means of identifying optical emission from GRBs and characterizing early time afterglow light curves. Based on empirical detection rates from Swift and the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, up to 10 GRBs per year may fall within the contemporaneous TESS field of view.

<div> 磁场、太阳活动周期、表面流动、磁区、太阳地幔震

总结:<br /><br />研究通过使用日磁图识别的太阳地幔震数据，发现磁区仅对太阳活动纬度范围内的太阳表面流动产生大约1m/s的峰值振幅的影响，这只占已知残余经向或纬向流动变化的一小部分。因此，磁活跃区和一般的紧凑磁浓度可能不是全球流动11年变化的主要来源。研究还发现，约为5×1020 Mx的磁通量是观测到重要流动的阈值。此外，大多数磁区周围的进流被限制在其中心周围10°-12°内，与最近发现的更广泛的进流迹象相反。 <div>
We estimate the contributions to the solar-cycle variation of solar meridional and zonal flows near the surface expected solely from local magnetic regions. Maps of flows near magnetic regions are obtained using helioseismic holography and averaged over ensembles of such regions with similar magnetic flux. These averaged flows are assigned to the positions and times of all magnetic regions identified from daily magnetograms over an 11 yr period. Residuals are obtained after averaging both meridional and zonal-flow components over longitude for each Carrington rotation and subtracting the temporal mean at each latitude. Results indicate that magnetic regions produce solar-cycle variations of both components in the active latitude range with peak amplitudes of about 1 m s−1, which represents only a fraction of the known variations in either the residual zonal or meridional flow with amplitudes around 3 and 5 m s−1, respectively. Thus it is unlikely that active regions, and compact magnetic concentrations in general, are the primary source of the 11 yr variation in these global flows. A threshold magnetic flux of 5 × 1020 Mx, below which no significant flows are observed, is identified as a check on the completeness of the set of magnetic regions. We also find that inflows around most magnetic regions are confined to within 10°–12° of their centers, in contrast with recent evidence of more extended inflows.

<title>Are WASP-107-like Systems Consistent with High-eccentricity Migration?</title>

<div> 高离心率迁移，WASP-107 b，WASP-107 c，Tidal Dissipation，Lidov-Kozai Oscillations
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章讨论了WASP-107 b和WASP-107 c的特性以及它们之间的相互关系。WASP-107 b是一个类似木星却密度异常低的行星，它可能在雪线内发生了高离心率迁移。研究表明，这种高离心率迁移可能导致了行星内部加热的大气层和大气侵蚀现象。此外，研究推测目前WASP-107 b和WASP-107 c之间的相互倾斜可能相当大，可以通过未来的Gaia天体测量观测来加以验证。此外，研究还指出高离心率迁移可能适用于其他具有类似轨道结构的行星系统。 <div>
WASP-107 b seems to be a poster child of the long-suspected high-eccentricity migration scenario. It is on a 5.7 day, polar orbit. The planet is Jupiter-like in radius but Neptune-like in mass with exceptionally low density. WASP-107 c is on a 1100 day, e = 0.28 orbit with at least Saturn mass. Planet b may still have a residual eccentricity of 0.06 ± 0.04: the ongoing tidal dissipation leads to the observed internally heated atmosphere and hydrodynamic atmospheric erosion. We present a population synthesis study coupling octupole Lidov–Kozai oscillations with various short-range forces, while simultaneously accounting for the radius inflation and tidal disruption of the planet. We find that a high-eccentricity migration scenario can successfully explain nearly all observed system properties. Our simulations further suggest that the initial location of WASP-107 b at the onset of migration is likely within the snowline (<0.5 au). More distant initial orbits usually lead to tidal disruption or orbit crossing. WASP-107 b most likely lost no more than 20% of its mass during the high-eccentricity migration, i.e., it did not form as a Jupiter-mass object. More vigorous tidally induced mass loss leads to disruption of the planet during migration. We predict that the current-day mutual inclination between the planets b and c is substantial: at least 25°–55°, which may be tested with future Gaia astrometric observations. Knowing the current-day mutual inclination may further constrain the initial orbit of planet b. We suggest that the proposed high-eccentricity migration scenario of WASP-107 may be applicable to HAT-P-11, GJ-3470, HAT-P-18, and GJ-436, which have similar orbital architectures.

本研究通过测量双黑洞合并的引力波，揭示了双黑洞合并率随红移的演化规律。研究发现，在不同红移下，宇宙中星系的数量密度因其物理特性（如恒星质量和恒星形成速率）而有不同的演化趋势。根据这一发现，我们首先假定双黑洞的宿主星系可以用恒星质量或恒星形成速率加权的星系混合模型来描述，并对来自恒星质量加权样本的合并比例进行了上限估计。然后，我们利用GWTC-3数据约束了一个物理上合理的幂律延迟时间分布模型的参数，并用这个延迟时间模型自洽地跟踪了宇宙机器模拟中的星系，推断了一系列红移下双黑洞的可能宿主星系。我们发现，在红移z=0.21时推断得到的宿主星系的平均恒星形成速率约为0.9太阳质量每年，平均恒星质量约为1.9×10^10太阳质量。此外，我们还提供了宿主星系相关的平均恒星年龄、暗物质晕的质量、半径、固有速度和大尺度偏移分布，以及其B和Ks波段的绝对星等分布。我们的研究结果可用于设计最佳的电磁跟踪策略，并且有助于使用统计暗涌方法来测量宇宙参数。 <div>
Observations of gravitational waves from binary black hole (BBH) mergers have measured the redshift evolution of the BBH merger rate. The number density of galaxies in the Universe evolves differently with redshift based on their physical properties, such as their stellar masses and star formation rates. In this work we show that the measured population-level redshift distribution of BBHs sheds light on the properties of their probable host galaxies. We first assume that the hosts of BBHs can be described by a mixture model of galaxies weighted by stellar mass or star formation rate, and find that we can place upper limits on the fraction of mergers coming from a stellar-mass-weighted sample of galaxies. We then constrain the parameters of a physically motivated power-law delay-time distribution using GWTC-3 data, and self-consistently track galaxies in the UniverseMachine simulations with this delay-time model to infer the probable host galaxies of BBHs over a range of redshifts. We find that the inferred host galaxy distribution at redshift z = 0.21 has a median star formation rate ∼ 0.9 M⊙ yr−1 and a median stellar mass of ∼1.9 × 1010M⊙. We also provide distributions for the mean stellar age, halo mass, halo radius, peculiar velocity, and large-scale bias associated with the host galaxies, as well as their absolute magnitudes in the B and Ks bands. Our results can be used to design optimal electromagnetic follow-up strategies for BBHs, and also to aid the measurement of cosmological parameters using the statistical dark-siren method.

该研究使用来自Gaia E/DR3的OBA恒星样本，利用LAMOST的径向速度和年龄τ，研究了年轻恒星在最初几个轨道周期内的垂直运动。研究构建了一个参数模型，描述了恒星轨道的平均垂直动作Jz随银河中心半径RGC的时间演变。考虑数据不确定性，使用马尔可夫链蒙特卡罗分析约束了模型参数。最佳拟合模型显示，在所有考虑的银河中心半径范围内，垂直动作随年龄呈现明显的线性增加趋势。这种趋势可能是随机散射导致的轨道加热所致，但银河盘的各种动力学因素，例如恒星在弯曲盘中出生，也可能提供了未来可以验证的替代解释。 
<br />总结: 使用Gaia E/DR3和LAMOST数据研究了年轻恒星轨道垂直动作随年龄和银河中心半径变化的模式，认为垂直动作随年龄呈线性增加趋势，可能是由于随机散射导致的轨道加热。但也指出了可能的其他动力学因素，需要未来进一步研究验证。 <div>
Stars in the Galactic disk are born on cold, nearly circular orbits with small vertical excursions. After their birth, their orbits evolve, driven by small- or large-scale perturbations in the Galactic disk’s gravitational potential. Here, we study the vertical motions of young stars over their first few orbital periods, using a sample of OBA stars from Gaia E/DR3, which includes radial velocities and ages τ from LAMOST. We construct a parametric model for the time evolution of the stellar orbits’ mean vertical actions Jz as a function of Galactocentric radius, RGC. Accounting for data uncertainties, we use Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis in annuli of Galactocentric radius (RGC) to constrain the model parameters. Our best-fit model shows a remarkably linear increase of vertical actions with age across all Galactocentric radii examined. Orbital heating by random scattering could offer a straightforward interpretation for this trend. However, various other dynamical aspects of the Galactic disk, such as stars being born in a warped disk, might offer alternative explanations that could be tested in the future.

In the planetary magnetosphere, plasma waves act as the medium for particles to transfer energy. Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system, and the giant magnetosphere is full of energetic particles, producing intense radio emissions. When interplanetary shocks in the solar wind interact with the Jovian magnetosphere, magnetospheric conditions change, and the characteristics of Jovian radio emissions show distinct variations accordingly. This study focuses on the morphological characteristics of Jovian broadband kilometric radiation (bKOM) under different magnetospheric conditions, i.e., relaxed and compressed. Using observations from Juno, both the frequency range and duration of Jovian bKOM radio emissions are studied, and we compare their variations during compressed and relaxed magnetospheric conditions. Our results show that under compressed magnetospheric conditions, the observed frequency range of Jovian bKOM generally exceeded 100 kHz, and their duration extended from 0 to 3 hr during uncompressed conditions to about 4–9 hr. The distinct features of radio emissions under different magnetospheric conditions imply that solar wind conditions have important influences on Jovian radio emissions, and thus the radio emissions can be used as a diagnostic tool of solar wind interaction with the Jovian magnetosphere.

<br /><br />总结:
最近的观测发现，地球以外的星球，火星上的电子可以进入地壳磁场，并通过磁漂移运动显示为漂移分散的爆发。然而，这些漂移分散电子的来源和注入地壳磁场的机制仍不清楚。研究团队利用了“火星大气和挥发性物质演化任务”（MAVEN）的数据，并通过测试粒子模拟揭示了这些电子来源于经由开放磁场线注入地壳磁场的沉降电子。这些电子在源位置附近显示为无色散爆发，随着漂移离开源地则呈现为分散的爆发。因此，这些分散电子代表了无色散电子演变的后期阶段。这一演化过程与地球的偶极磁场内观察到的情况非常相似，证实地壳磁场类似于一个微型磁层。 <div>
Mars lacks a global intrinsic dipole field but possesses localized crustal fields, making it unique in the solar system. Recent observations revealed that electrons can be injected into the crustal fields, and exhibit drift-dispersed bursts due to the magnetic drift motion, which are characterized by increases or decreases in energy over time in the energy spectrum. However, the source of the drift-dispersed electrons and the mechanism of their injection into the crustal fields remains unclear. Here, by leveraging data from the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN mission, along with test-particle simulations, we reveal that the source of dispersed electrons is the precipitating electrons injected into the crustal fields via open field lines. These electrons display as dispersionless bursts near the source location, and as dispersed bursts as they drift away from the source. Thus, the dispersed electrons represent a later stage in the evolution of dispersionless electrons. This evolutionary process closely mirrors that observed within Earth’s dipole field, affirming that the crustal fields function similarly to a mini-magnetosphere.

We investigate the migration of low-mass protoplanets embedded in dust–gas coupled protoplanetary disks. Linear calculations are performed with respect to the Nakagawa–Sekiya–Hayashi (NSH) equilibrium within a shearing sheet. We find that the dusty quasi-drift mode dominates the dynamical behaviors in close proximity to the protoplanet. This mode exhibits an extremely short radial wavelength, characterized by a dispersion relation of . The emergence of this mode leads to a wake with a short radial length scale ahead of protoplanets, contributing to a positive torque, termed as “streaming torque” (ST). Furthermore, both Lindblad torque and corotation torque are affected by the NSH velocity. The total torque and planetary migration are contingent upon the coupling strength between dust and gas. In most scenarios, ST predominates, inducing outward migration for planets, thereby addressing the issue of rapid inward migration in their formation paradigm.

<title>Direct Method to Compute Doppler Beaming Factors in Binary Stars</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The Doppler beaming effect, induced by the reflex motion of stars, introduces flux modulations and serves as an efficient method to photometrically determine mass functions for a large number of close binary systems, particularly those involving compact objects. In order to convert observed beaming-flux variations into a radial-velocity curve, precise determination of the beaming factor is essential. Previously, this factor was calculated as a constant, assuming a power-law profile for stellar spectra. In this study, we present a novel approach to directly compute this factor. Our new method not only simplifies the computation, especially for blue bands and cool stars, but also enables us to evaluate whether the relationship between beaming flux and radial velocity can be accurately described as linear. We develop a Python code and compute a comprehensive beaming-factor table for commonly used filter systems covering main-sequence, subgiant, and giant stars, as well as hot subdwarf and white dwarf stars. Both the code and our table are archived and publicly available on Zenodo: doi:10.5281/zenodo.13049419.

<title>The Landscape of Thermal Transients from Supernovae Interacting with a Circumstellar Medium</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The interaction of supernova ejecta with a surrounding circumstellar medium (CSM) generates a strong shock, which can convert ejecta kinetic energy into observable radiation. Given the diversity of potential CSM structures (arising from diverse mass-loss processes such as late-stage stellar outbursts, binary interaction, and winds), the resulting transients can display a wide range of light-curve morphologies. We provide a framework for classifying the transients arising from interaction with a spherical CSM shell. The light curves are decomposed into five consecutive phases, starting from the onset of interaction and extending through shock breakout and subsequent shock cooling. The relative prominence of each phase in the light curve is determined by two dimensionless quantities representing the CSM-to-ejecta mass ratio η, and the breakout parameter ξ. These two parameters define four light-curve morphology classes, where each class is characterized by the location of the shock breakout and the degree of deceleration as the shock sweeps up the CSM. We compile analytic scaling relations connecting the luminosity and duration of each light-curve phase to the physical parameters. We then run a grid of radiation hydrodynamics simulations for a wide range of ejecta and CSM parameters to numerically explore the landscape of interaction light curves, and to calibrate and confirm the analytic scalings. We connect our theoretical framework to several case studies of observed transients, highlighting the relevance in explaining slow-rising and superluminous supernovae, fast blue optical transients, and double-peaked light curves.

该研究提出了一种层次贝叶斯流程BP3M，用于测量Hubble Space Telescope（HST）图像和Gaia之间的跨匹配源的位置、视差和恒星固有运动（PM），甚至对于稀疏的场景（每幅图像的N* < 10）。该技术利用Gaia测量的天文测量作为先验来预测HST图像中源的位置，因此能够在不使用背景星系/QSO的情况下将HST图像放入全局参考框架中。通过在佛莱斯和德拉科矮星系中测试公开可用的代码，我们测量了20.5 < G < 21等级的PM，比Gaia DR3单独测量的PM精度中位数提高了8-13倍。我们能够利用合成数据来探讨BP3M天文测量对观测策略的影响，发现了一种在不增加PM不确定性的情况下改善视差和位置精度的最佳策略。在稀疏的COSMOS场景中使用1619幅HST图像（每幅图像中中位数为九个Gaia源），我们测量了2640个16 < G < 21.5等级范围内独特源的BP3M PM，其中25%没有Gaia PM；20.25 < G < 20.75等级的中位BP3M PM不确定性为0.44 mas yr−1，而Gaia的为1.03 mas yr−1；没有Gaia测量PM的源（20.75 < G < 21.5等级）的中位BP3M PM不确定性为1.16 mas yr−1。支持BP3M流程的统计数据是一种将不同图像、时代和望远镜的位置测量方式进行泛化的方法，这允许信息在调查和档案之间共享，实现比每个目录单独获得的更高天文测量精度。 <br /><br />总结: 本研究提出了一种BP3M层次贝叶斯流程，用来测量Hubble Space Telescope（HST）图像和Gaia之间的跨匹配源的位置、视差和恒星固有运动（PM）。该技术在稀疏场景中也能有效工作，并且通过公开可用的代码进行了测试。使用合成数据，发现了一种改善视差和位置精度的最佳策略。在实际场景中的测试证实，BP3M PM的精度要比 Gaia DR3 高出数倍，尤其在一些等级的情况下差异尤为明显。该技术的统计手段可以将不同来源的数据进行统一处理，从而提高了天文测量的精度。 <div>
We present a hierarchical Bayesian pipeline, BP3M, that measures positions, parallaxes, and proper motions (PMs) for cross-matched sources between Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images and Gaia—even for sparse fields (N* < 10 per image)—expanding from the recent GaiaHub tool. This technique uses Gaia-measured astrometry as priors to predict the locations of sources in HST images, and is therefore able to put the HST images onto a global reference frame without the use of background galaxies/QSOs. Testing our publicly available code in the Fornax and Draco dwarf spheroidal galaxies, we measure PMs that are a median of 8–13 times more precise than Gaia DR3 alone for 20.5 < G < 21 mag. We are able to explore the effect of observation strategies on BP3M astrometry using synthetic data, finding an optimal strategy to improve parallax and position precision at no cost to the PM uncertainty. Using 1619 HST images in the sparse COSMOS field (median nine Gaia sources per HST image), we measure BP3M PMs for 2640 unique sources in the 16 < G < 21.5 mag range, 25% of which have no Gaia PMs; the median BP3M PM uncertainty for 20.25 < G < 20.75 mag sources is 0.44 mas yr−1 compared to 1.03 mas yr−1 from Gaia, while the median BP3M PM uncertainty for sources without Gaia-measured PMs (20.75 < G < 21.5 mag) is 1.16 mas yr−1. The statistics that underpin the BP3M pipeline are a generalized way of combining position measurements from different images, epochs, and telescopes, which allows information to be shared between surveys and archives to achieve higher astrometric precision than that from each catalog alone.

We perform the first magnetic field strength survey of Class I and Flat Spectrum (FS) sources using K-band observations with iSHELL. We obtained new observations of 42 Class I and FS sources and additionally included 10 sources from the archive. We detect photospheric lines in 44 of the sources, in addition to Brγ, H2, and CO emission in several objects. We model the photospheric absorption lines of 32 Class I and FS sources and measure their magnetic field strengths, K-band temperatures, gravities, projected rotational velocities, and infrared veiling values. We put the physical properties of Class I and FS sources in context by comparing them to the values derived for a sample of Class II sources. We find that (a) the average magnetic field strength of Class I and FS sources 〈B〉 = 2.0 ± 0.15 kG is consistent with the average magnetic field strength of Class II sources 〈B〉 = 1.8 ± 0.15 kG, and (b) the average gravity of Class I and FS objects is lower than the average gravity of Class II sources , although there is significant overlap between both gravity distributions. Furthermore, using stellar evolutionary models, we deduce that Class I and FS sources have a median age of ∼0.6 Myr, and are, as a group, younger than the Class II stars with a median age of ∼3 Myr. Our results confirm that Class I and FS sources host strong magnetic fields on their photospheres. Thus, it is likely that these sources accrete disk material through a magnetosphere similar to the more evolved T Tauri stars.

总结:<br /><br />CloudFlex是一个开源工具，用于预测星系暗云中冷气体吸收线的特征，可以根据多个参数设置模拟吸收线的质量、大小和速度分布。使用该工具可以预测在星系周围形成的吸收线分布，得出了一些结论，例如随着云团数密度和复杂结构尺寸的减小，具有相同金属丰度的观测视线中等效宽度小于0.3 Å的出现频率显著增加。这个工具还可以帮助详细约束构成光电离星系周围介质的结构大小和速度分布。 <div>
We present CloudFlex, an open-source tool for predicting absorption-line signatures of cool gas in galaxy halos with small-scale structure. Motivated by analyses of ∼104 K material in hydrodynamical simulations of turbulent, multiphase media, we model cool gas structures as complexes of cloudlets sampled from a power-law distribution of mass with velocities drawn from a turbulent velocity field. The user may specify α, the lower limit of the cloudlet mass distribution ( ), and several other parameters that set the mass, size, and velocity distribution of the complex. This permits investigation of the relation between these parameters and absorption-line observables. As a proof-of-concept, we calculate the Mg iiλ2796 absorption induced by the cloudlets in background quasi-stellar object (QSO) spectra. We demonstrate that, at fixed metallicity, the covering fraction of sight lines with equivalent widths W2796 < 0.3 Å increases significantly with decreasing , cloudlet number density (ncl), and complex size. We then use this framework to predict the halo-scale W2796 distribution around ∼L* galaxies. We show that the observed incidences of W2796 > 0.3 Å sight lines with impact parameters 10 kpc < R⊥ < 50 kpc in projected QSO–galaxy studies are consistent with our model over much of parameter space. However, they are underpredicted by models with and ncl ≥ 0.03 cm−3, in keeping with a picture in which the inner cool circumgalactic medium (CGM) is dominated by numerous low-mass cloudlets (mcl ≲ 100M⊙) with a volume filling factor ≲1%. When used to model absorption-line data sets built from multi-sight line and/or spatially extended background probes, CloudFlex enables detailed constraints on the size and velocity distributions of structures comprising the photoionized CGM.

Crustal quakes of highly magnetized neutron stars can disrupt their magnetospheres, triggering energetic phenomena like X-ray and fast radio bursts. Understanding plasma wave dynamics in these extreme environments is vital for predicting energy transport across scales to the radiation length. This study models relativistic plasma wave interaction in magnetar magnetospheres with force-free electrodynamics simulations. For propagation along curved magnetic field lines, we observe the continuous conversion of Alfvén waves to fast magnetosonic (FMS) waves. The conversion efficiency can be up to three times higher when counter-propagating Alfvén waves interact in the equatorial region. Alfvén waves generate FMS waves of twice their frequency during their first crossing of the magnetosphere. After the initial transient burst of FMS waves, Alfvén waves convert to FMS waves periodically, generating variations on timescales of the magnetospheric Alfvén wave crossing time. This decaying FMS wave tail carries a significant portion (half) of the total energy emitted. Plastic damping of “bouncing” Alfvén waves by the magnetar crust has minimal impact on the FMS efficiency. We discuss the implications of the identified wave phenomena for magnetar observations. Outgoing FMS waves can develop electric zones, potential sources of coherent radiation. Long wavelength FMS waves could generate FRBs through reconnection beyond the light cylinder.

We report new radio observations of SDSS J090122.37+181432.3, a strongly lensed star-forming galaxy at z = 2.26. We image 1.4 GHz (L-band) and 3 GHz (S-band) continuum using the Very Large Array (VLA) and 1.2 mm (band 6) continuum with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, in addition to the CO(7–6) and C i(3P2→3P1) lines, all at ≲1.″7 resolution. Based on the VLA integrated flux densities, we decompose the radio spectrum into its free–free (FF) and nonthermal components. The infrared–radio correlation parameter is consistent with expectations for star-forming galaxies. We obtain radio continuum-derived star formation rates (SFRs) that are free of dust extinction, finding , , and from the FF emission, nonthermal emission, and when accounting for both emission processes, respectively, in agreement with previous results. We estimate the gas mass from the C i(3P2→3P1) line as Mgas = (1.2 ± 0.2) × 1011M☉, which is consistent with prior CO(1–0)-derived gas masses. Using our new IR and radio continuum data to map the SFR, we assess the dependence of the Schmidt–Kennicutt relation on choices of SFR and gas tracer for ∼kpc scales. The different SFR tracers yield different slopes, with the IR being the steepest, potentially due to highly obscured star formation in J0901. The radio continuum maps have the lowest slopes and overall fidelity for mapping the SFR, despite producing consistent total SFRs. We also find that the Schmidt–Kennicutt relation slope is flattest when using CO(7–6) or C i(3P2→3P1) to trace gas mass, suggesting that those transitions are not suitable for tracing the bulk molecular gas in galaxies like J0901.

<div> C2H4O2 isomers, abundance ratios, star-forming regions, gas-grain hot-core chemical model, ice-mantle desorption
总结:
C2H4O2异构体在星形成区域的丰度比通常为甲酸甲酯（MF）、乙二醛（GA）和乙酸（AA）的比值约为100:10:1。但最近在NGC 6334I巨大原核团中观察到了一种未能解释的偏离这种关系的现象，其中一些源显示出极端的MF：GA比率，导致不同源之间产生双峰行为，而MF：AA比率保持稳定。研究使用三相气相-颗粒热核化学模型来研究模拟的C2H4O2丰度对大量参数空间的影响。在冰盖解吸附（∼125–160 K)过程中，高气体密度和长时间尺度似乎是高MF:GA比率的物理原因。在这些条件下，GA破坏的主要化学机制是冰面上原子H的快速吸附和反应，使得它没有时间解吸附。 MF和GA在水冰上的不同结合能对表面破坏机制的选择性至关重要。个别MF分子在水分失去时迅速逃逸冰面，而GA滞留并被H破坏。适度提高宇宙射线电离速率可以增加冰中的“复杂有机分子”（COM）产量并增加MF：GA比率，但极端值对气相COMs有破坏性。我们推测，需要极端MF：GA比率的高密度可能是COM由星周盘中脱附的COM主导的排放的证据。 <div>
Gas-phase abundance ratios between C2H4O2 isomers methyl formate (MF), glycolaldehyde (GA), and acetic acid (AA) are typically on the order of 100:10:1 in star-forming regions. However, an unexplained divergence from this neat relationship was recently observed toward a collection of sources in the massive protocluster NGC 6334I; some sources exhibited extreme MF:GA ratios, producing a bimodal behavior between different sources, while the MF:AA ratio remained stable. Here, we use a three-phase gas-grain hot-core chemical model to study the effects of a large parameter space on the simulated C2H4O2 abundances. A combination of high gas densities and long timescales during ice-mantle desorption (∼125–160 K) appears to be the physical cause of the high MF:GA ratios. The main chemical mechanism for GA destruction occurring under these conditions is the rapid adsorption and reaction of atomic H with GA on the ice surfaces before it has time to desorb. The different binding energies of MF and GA on water ice are crucial to the selectivity of the surface destruction mechanism; individual MF molecules rapidly escape the surface when exposed by water loss, while GA lingers and is destroyed by H. Moderately elevated cosmic-ray ionization rates can increase absolute levels of “complex organic molecule” (COM) production in the ices and increase the MF:GA ratio, but extreme values are destructive for gas-phase COMs. We speculate that the high densities required for extreme MF:GA ratios could be evidence of COM emission dominated by COMs desorbing within a circumstellar disk.

总结:
Cepheid AW Per是多重系统中的一个组件，具有长周期轨道。 Griffin的径向速度很好地覆盖了38年的轨道。在Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy阵列的干涉测量显示了长周期轨道。此外，哈勃太空望远镜在紫外线高分辨率光谱中显示，伴星本身也是一个具有几乎相等质量的双星系统。这些数据结合来自Gaia的距离提供了Cepheid（主星）的质量M1 = 6.79 ± 0.85 M⊙。次星的组合质量为MS = 8.79 ± 0.50 M⊙。在大约两年后预计将根据Gaia第四次数据发布改善质量的精度。 <div>
The Cepheid AW Per is a component in a multiple system with a long-period orbit. The radial velocities of Griffin cover the 38 yr orbit well. An extensive program of interferometry with the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy array is reported here, from which the long-period orbit is determined. In addition, a Hubble Space Telescope high-resolution spectrum in the ultraviolet demonstrates that the companion is itself a binary with nearly equal-mass components. These data combined with a distance from Gaia provide a mass of the Cepheid (primary) of M1 = 6.79 ± 0.85 M⊙. The combined mass of the secondary is MS = 8.79 ± 0.50 M⊙. The accuracy of the mass will be improved after the fourth Gaia data release, expected in approximately two years.

The High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Gamma-Ray Observatory, located on the side of the Sierra Negra volcano in Mexico, has been fully operational since 2015. The HAWC collaboration has recently significantly improved their extensive air shower reconstruction algorithms, which has notably advanced the observatory performance. The energy resolution for primary gamma rays with energies below 1 TeV was improved by including a noise-suppression algorithm. Corrections have also been made to systematic errors in direction fitting related to the detector and shower plane inclinations, biases in highly inclined showers, and enhancements to the core reconstruction. The angular resolution for gamma rays approaching the HAWC array from large zenith angles (>37°) has improved by a factor of 4 at the highest energies (>70 TeV) as compared to previous reconstructions. The inclusion of a lateral distribution function fit to the extensive air shower footprint on the array to separate gamma-ray primaries from cosmic-ray ones based on the resulting χ2 values improved the background rejection performance at all inclinations. At large zenith angles, the improvement in significance is a factor of 4 compared to previous HAWC publications. These enhancements have been verified by observing the Crab Nebula, which is an overhead source for the HAWC Observatory. We show that the sensitivity to Crab-like point sources (E−2.63) with locations overhead to 30° zenith is comparable to or less than 10% of the Crab Nebula’s flux between 2 and 50 TeV. Thanks to these improvements, HAWC can now detect more sources, including the Galactic center.

<div> GHZ2/GLASS-z12, 红移 z = 12.34, NIRSpec PRISM, 光谱线, 星系形成 <br />
总结:
该研究通过NIRCam光度测定和NIRSpec PRISM光谱，确认了红移为z = 12.34的GHZ2/GLASS-z12星系的存在。光谱显示出了N iv, C iv, He ii, O iii, C iii, O ii和Ne iii线的探测，并首次在高红移处探测到3133 Å静止波长的O iii Bowen荧光线。在极端C iv发射体类别中，GHZ2因其明显的C iv线和等效宽度（EW）约为46 Å而被归类为极端C iv发射体。GHZ2显示出的UV线等效宽度只在低/中红移处的活动星系核（AGNs）或复合天体中发现。UV线强度比与低金属环境中的AGNs和星际物质形成具有兼容性，使得[Ne iv]/[N iv]比的下限更加支持光致辐射光子的恒星起源。研究者讨论了一种可能的情景，即高电离输出是由低金属环境中形成的恒星所致。他们估计了金属丰度≲0.1 Z/Z⊙，电离参数log U > −2，氮/氧丰度是太阳值的4-5倍，并且碳/氧比例是类似于最近发现的氮增强天体的次太阳值。考虑其丰度模式和高恒星质量密度（104M⊙ pc−2），GHZ2是今天球状星团的祖先的理想形成地点。GHZ2的显着亮度使其成为了解大爆炸后仅360百万年内星系形成物理学的“罗塞塔石”。 <div>
We spectroscopically confirm the MUV = −20.5 mag galaxy GHZ2/GLASS-z12 to be at redshift z = 12.34. The source was selected via NIRCam photometry in GLASS-JWST Early Release Science data, providing the first evidence of a surprising abundance of bright galaxies at z ≳ 10. The NIRSpec PRISM spectrum shows detections of N iv, C iv, He ii, O iii, C iii, O ii, and Ne iii lines and the first detection at high redshift of the O iii Bowen fluorescence line at 3133 Å rest frame. The prominent C iv line with rest-frame equivalent width (EW) ≈ 46 Å puts GHZ2 in the category of extreme C iv emitters. GHZ2 displays UV lines with EWs that are only found in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) or composite objects at low/intermediate redshifts. The UV line-intensity ratios are compatible with both AGNs and star formation in a low-metallicity environment, with the low limit on the [Ne iv]/[N iv] ratio favoring a stellar origin of the ionizing photons. We discuss a possible scenario in which the high ionizing output is due to low-metallicity stars forming in a dense environment. We estimate a metallicity ≲0.1 Z/Z⊙, a high ionization parameter log U > −2, a N/O abundance 4–5 times the solar value, and a subsolar C/O ratio similar to the recently discovered class of nitrogen-enhanced objects. Considering its abundance patterns and the high stellar mass density (104M⊙ pc−2), GHZ2 is an ideal formation site for the progenitors of today's globular clusters. The remarkable brightness of GHZ2 makes it a “Rosetta stone” for understanding the physics of galaxy formation within just 360 Myr after the Big Bang.

<div> 关键词：磁化盘风，非理想磁流体力学，线性摄动理论，对称模式，反对称模式

总结：
磁化盘风和风驱动堆积是原行星盘的重要且受到密切研究的扩散机制，但这些机制的稳定性尚未得到充分研究。本文利用半解析的线性摄动理论，应用非理想磁流体力学，重点关注磁扩散率在盘面到表面变化几个数量级的盘模型。线性模式通过其相对于中平面的对称性加以区分。这些模式具有定性不同的增长率：对称模式几乎总是衰减，而至少一个反对称模式总是具有正增长率。这一增长率随着盘中柱状半径R的增加快速下降，比开普勒角速度更陡，并且在基准盘模型中比例为R-5/2。反对称模式的增长打破了盘赤道平面的反射对称性，甚至在没有霍尔效应的情况下也可能发生。在完全发展的反对称模式发生的盘区域，只出现在盘的一侧的堆积流，而在另一侧只出现盘风。这可能解释一些观察到的原行星盘流的不对称性。 <br /><br /> <div>
Magnetized disk winds and wind-driven accretion are an essential and intensively studied dispersion mechanism of protoplanetary disks (PPDs). However, the stability of these mechanisms has yet to be adequately examined. This paper employs semi-analytic linear perturbation theories under nonideal magnetohydrodynamics, focusing on disk models whose magnetic diffusivities vary by a few orders of magnitude from the disk midplane to its surface. Linear modes are distinguished by their symmetry with respect to the midplane. These modes have qualitatively different growth rates: symmetric modes almost always decay, while at least one antisymmetric mode always has a positive growth rate. This growth rate decreases faster than the Keplerian angular velocity with cylindrical radius R in the disk and scales steeper than R−5/2 in the fiducial disk model. The growth of antisymmetric modes breaks the reflection symmetry across the disk equatorial plane, and may occur even in the absence of the Hall effect. In the disk regions where fully developed antisymmetric modes occur, accretion flows appear only on one side of the disk, while disk winds occur only on the other. This may explain the asymmetry of some observed PPD outflows.

该研究观察了塞弗特1星系Mrk 817，利用哈勃空间望远镜/宇宙起源光谱仪的光谱数据，对其14年的多个时期进行了观测。研究发现，窄的UV吸收线受到X射线遮挡物影响，但其总柱密度在所有时期都没有改变。根据调整后的电离参数，推测出流离子化参数对氢电离辐射通量的变化幅度为log UH = -1.0。吸收流位于距离中心光源不到38秒差距的位置，暗示氢密度高于3000 cm-3。它仅覆盖连续谱发射源而不覆盖宽发射线区域，这表明其横截面尺寸较小，可能是从球形到沿视线延伸的潜在云几何形态。 
<br /><br />总结: 该研究对Seyfert 1星系Mrk 817进行了多波段观测，发现其窄的UV吸收线受到X射线遮挡物的影响，但总柱密度未发生改变。通过调整后的电离参数推测出流离子化参数对氢电离辐射通量变化的影响，同时确定了吸收流的位置和横截面尺寸。 <div>
We observed the Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk 817 during an intensive multiwavelength reverberation mapping campaign for 16 months. Here, we examine the behavior of narrow UV absorption lines seen in the Hubble Space Telescope/Cosmic Origins Spectrograph spectra, both during the campaign and in other epochs extending over 14 yr. We conclude that, while the narrow absorption outflow system (at −3750 km s−1 with FWHM = 177 km s−1) responds to the variations of the UV continuum as modified by the X-ray obscurer, its total column density (log NH = 19.5 cm−2) did not change across all epochs. The adjusted ionization parameter (scaled with respect to the variations in the hydrogen-ionizing continuum flux) is log UH = −1.0 . The outflow is located at a distance smaller than 38 pc from the central source, which implies a hydrogen density of nH > 3000 cm−3. The absorption outflow system only covers the continuum emission source and not the broad emission line region, which suggests that its transverse size is small (< 1016 cm), with potential cloud geometries ranging from spherical to elongated along the line of sight.

We report the detection of Lyman-continuum (LyC) photons from a massive interacting system at z = 1.097 in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. The LyC detection is made in the far-ultraviolet F154W band of the UVIT telescope on board AstroSat. Both JWST and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging of the system reveal signs that it is a likely merger. In particular, high-resolution imaging in the JWST bands reveals an infrared-luminous object within the system that is faint in the bluer HST bands. The ionized gas kinematics from the MUSE-UDF data supports the merger hypothesis. We estimate that the entire system is leaking more than 8% of its ionizing photons to the intergalactic medium. The spectral-energy-distribution-derived stellar masses of the two components indicate that this is a major merger with a mass ratio of 1.13 ± 0.37. This detection hints at the potential contribution of massive interacting systems at higher redshifts, when major mergers were more frequent, to the ionizing budget of the Universe.

We research the elemental abundances in Galactic planetary nebulae (PNe) compared with those of their stellar progenitors (red giant branch and asymptotic giant branch, AGB, stars), to explore and quantify the expected—i.e., due to AGB evolution or condensation onto grains—differences. We gleaned the current literature for the nebular abundances while we used the APOGEE DR 17 survey data for the stellar sample. We examined the elements in common between the nebular and stellar samples, namely, C, N, O, Fe, and S. We confirm that iron in PNe is mostly entrapped in grains, with an average depletion 〈D[Fe/H]〉 = 1.741 ± 0.486 dex, and we disclose a weak correlation between iron depletion and the [O/H] abundance, D[Fe/H] = (6.6003 ± 2.443) × [O/H] + (1.972 ± 0.199). Sulfur may also be mildly depleted in PNe, with 〈D[S/H]〉 = 0.179 ± 0.291 dex. We also found an indication of nitrogen enrichment for PNe 〈E[N/H]〉 = 0.393 ± 0.421 dex, with maximum enrichment (0.980 ± 0.243) occurring for the PNe whose progenitors have gone through the hot-bottom burning. The carbon enrichment is 〈E[C/H]〉 = 0.337 ± 0.463 dex when measured for the general PN populations. Our results will be relevant for future Galactic and extragalactic studies comparing nebular and stellar samples.

<div> 关键词: Andromeda XIX, Keck II telescope, chemical abundances, tidal stripping, tidal interactions

总结: 
Andromeda XIX是M31的一个异常卫星星系，其光度类似于Sextans等矮球状星系，但空间范围类似于超弥散星系。通过Keck II望远镜上的DEIMOS进行的中分辨率光谱测量，发现Andromeda XIX的金属丰度略高于当今局部星系团矮星系的金属丰度关系。这表明它可能经历了潮汐剥夺。同时，测量的化学丰度还显示出潮汐交互作用可能比星系合并更有可能是其形成的原因。其漫射结构和扰动的动力学特性也支持了这一观点。Overall, 这些研究结果表明了Andromeda XIX的形成可能是由潮汐影响引起的，而非星系合并。<br /><br /> <div>
With a luminosity similar to that of Milky Way dwarf spheroidal systems like Sextans, but a spatial extent similar to that of ultra-diffuse galaxies, Andromeda (And) XIX is an unusual satellite of M31. To investigate the origin of this galaxy, we measure chemical abundances for And XIX derived from medium-resolution (R ∼ 6000) spectra from the Deep Extragalactic Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph on the Keck II telescope. We coadd 79 red giant branch stars, grouped by photometric metallicity, in order to obtain a sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio to measure 20 [Fe/H] and [α/Fe] abundances via spectral synthesis. The latter are the first such measurements for And XIX. The mean metallicity we derive for And XIX places it ∼2σ higher than the present-day stellar mass–metallicity relation for Local Group dwarf galaxies, potentially indicating it has experienced tidal stripping. A loss of gas and associated quenching during such a process, which prevents the extended star formation necessary to produce shallow [α/Fe]–[Fe/H] gradients in massive systems, is also consistent with the steeply decreasing [α/Fe]–[Fe/H] trend we observe. In combination with the diffuse structure and disturbed kinematic properties of And XIX, this suggests tidal interactions, rather than galaxy mergers, are strong contenders for its formation.

<div> 光变星，δ Scuti 变星，光度关系，Gaia光度测量仪，旋转

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了δ Scuti变星与光度关系之间的关联，利用了来自NASA的TESS卫星的光变曲线数据以及Gaia光度测量仪的观测数据。通过对接近10万颗恒星的分析，发现大约15,918颗星符合δ Scuti变星的特征。并且在稳定带内的85%的变星被确认为δ Scuti变星，其余可能是混合型或γ Doradus变星。最后，文章还证实了旋转与δ Scuti星的脉动之间存在着相关性。 <div>
δ Scuti variables are found at the intersection of the classical instability strip and the main sequence on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram. With space-based photometry providing millions of light curves of A-F type stars, we can now probe the occurrence rate of δ Scuti pulsations in detail. Using the 30 minutes cadence light curves from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite's first 26 sectors, we identify variability in 103,810 stars within 5–24 cycles per day down to a magnitude of T = 11.25. We fit the period–luminosity relation of the fundamental radial mode for δ Scuti stars in the Gaia G band, allowing us to distinguish classical pulsators from contaminants for a subset of 39,367 stars. Out of this subset, over 15,918 are found on or above the expected period–luminosity relation. We derive an empirical red edge to the classical instability strip using Gaia photometry. The center where the pulsator fraction peaks at 50%–70%, combined with the red edge, agrees well with previous work in the Kepler field. While many variable sources are found below the period–luminosity relation, over 85% of sources inside of the classical instability strip derived in this work are consistent with being δ Scuti stars. The remaining 15% of variables within the instability strip are likely hybrid or γ Doradus pulsators. Finally, we discover strong evidence for a correlation between pulsator fraction and spectral line broadening from the Radial Velocity Spectrometer on board the Gaia spacecraft, confirming that rotation has a role in driving pulsations in δ Scuti stars.

在这篇文章中，研究人员利用高分辨率光谱技术在M13和M71星团的恒星中测定了锂的丰度。结果显示，这些星团中未演化的恒星的锂丰度范围相差4倍，这种差异被归因于初始角动量的差异，导致自旋减速、相关混合和锂的破坏。与其他星团中的主序星和转向星的类似结果进行了比较。这些星团的年龄跨度为3亿年，[Fe/H]的范围相差30倍。所有这些星团中未演化的恒星的锂丰度的最大值相同，对应于Li/H = 3.16 × 10−10，而根据氘丰度和Big Bang nucleosynthesis的预测，预期的锂丰度为5.24 × 10−10。<br /><br />总结: 文章研究了在宇宙诞生的前15分钟内产生的原始锂丰度，通过在球状星团中测量锂丰度，发现未演化的恒星的锂丰度存在差异，这被归因于初始角动量的不同导致了自旋减速、混合和锂的破坏。研究结果表明，这些星团中未演化的恒星的最大锂丰度相同，而预期的锂丰度却略高。 <div>
During Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) in the first 15 minutes of the Universe, some 7Li was created along with isotopes of H and He. The determination of that primordial value of Li can help constrain the conditions at that time. The oldest stars with known ages can be found in globular clusters which have well-determined ages through stellar evolution models. High-resolution spectra of Li have been obtained with the Keck I Telescope and HIRES in several unevolved stars in the clusters M13 and M71 with V magnitudes of 17.6–17.9. Abundances of Li have been determined with spectrum synthesis techniques and show a range of a factor of 4. We attribute that spread to differences in initial angular momentum resulting in different amounts of spin-down, related mixing, and destruction of Li. Our results are compared with similar results for main-sequence and turnoff stars in other globular clusters. The range in age of these clusters is 11.2–14.2 Gyr for an age span of 3 Gyr. These clusters range in [Fe/H] from −0.75 to −2.24 corresponding to a factor of 30 in metallicity. The maximum in the Li abundance for these unevolved stars in all eight clusters is the same corresponding to Li/H = 3.16 × 10−10, while the predicted Li abundance, based on the deuterium abundance and the BBN predictions, is 5.24 × 10−10.

<div> 星系、质量、尺寸、红移、近红外<br />
在这项研究中，使用JWST/NIRCam F277W和F444W成像数据，测量了约26,000个具有恒星质量M⋆ > 10^9M⊙的星系的Sérsic profile。发现在近红外的波段下，星系的有效半径普遍小于之前在光学波段下的测量结果，平均偏差为0.14 dex，而这种偏差与红移无显著相关性。星系在近红外的质量-尺寸关系比在光学波段下更为平缓，且在0.5 < z < 2.5的所有红移范围内都如此。此外，星系的尺寸演化规律在近红外与光学波段下基本一致，且具有相似的演化速率。具体来说，对于L*星系，尺寸演化速率为Re ∝ (1 + z)−0.7，对于质量较大的（M⋆ > 10^11M⊙）正在形成星系，则其尺寸演化速率几乎与静止星系相当。此外，质量较小的（M⋆ < 10^10M⊙）静止星系的尺寸演化速度则相当于正在形成星系。总的来说，结果表明过去20年来得出的尺寸演化结论，在使用JWST获得的近红外数据时并未发生根本性改变，这些数据更好地反映了恒星质量分布。 <br /><br />总结: 本研究利用JWST数据测量了近红外范围内约26,000个质量大于10^9M⊙的星系的Sérsic profiles，发现尺寸与质量的关系在近红外波段下比在光学波段下更为平缓，且在当前红移范围内这种情况持续存在。此外，研究还发现星系的尺寸演化规律在近红外与光学波段下基本一致，且有相似的演化速率。 <div>
We present the galaxy stellar mass–size relation in the rest-frame near-IR (1.5 μm) and its evolution with redshift up to z = 2.5. Sérsic profiles are measured for ∼26,000 galaxies with stellar masses M⋆ > 109M⊙ from JWST/NIRCam F277W and F444W imaging provided by the COSMOS-WEB and PRIMER surveys using coordinates, redshifts, colors, and stellar mass estimates from the COSMOS2020 catalog. The new rest-frame near-IR effective radii are generally smaller than previously measured rest-frame optical sizes, on average by 0.14 dex, with no significant dependence on redshift. For quiescent galaxies, this size offset does not depend on stellar mass, but for star-forming galaxies, the offset increases from −0.1 dex at M⋆ = 109.5M⊙ to −0.25 dex at M⋆ > 1011M⊙. That is, we find that the near-IR stellar mass–size relation for star-forming galaxies is flatter in the rest-frame near-IR than in the rest-frame optical at all redshifts 0.5 < z < 2.5. The general pace of size evolution is the same in the near-IR as previously demonstrated in the optical, with slower evolution (Re ∝ (1 + z)−0.7) for L* star-forming galaxies and faster evolution (Re ∝ (1 + z)−1.3) for L* quiescent galaxies. Massive (M⋆ > 1011M⊙) star-forming galaxies evolve in size almost as fast as quiescent galaxies. Low-mass (M⋆ < 1010M⊙) quiescent galaxies evolve as slow as star-forming galaxies. Our main conclusion is that the size evolution narrative as it has emerged over the past two decades does not radically change when accessing the rest-frame near-IR with JWST, a better proxy of the underlying stellar mass distribution.

<div> Event Horizon Telescope, EHT, circular polarization, Sgr A*, M87*

这篇文章主要对通过Event Horizon Telescope（EHT）观测到的Sgr A*和M87*等源的模型进行了研究比较。研究使用了多个波长、分辨率、偏振和时间间隔的观测来约束模型。通过对一个包含各种模型的库进行圆偏振测量对比，发现Atacama大型毫米/亚毫米阵列(ALMA)对Sgr A*的观测结果与所有边缘模型都不一致。在研究Sgr A*的MAD模型中，发现只有指向远离观测者的磁偶极矩模型与ALMA数据一致。此外，还发现在27个通过模型中有26个转向顺时针旋转的快速增长模型。研究还提供了所有模型参数均值、标准差及其趋势的表格。

<br /><br />总结:
1. 通过EHT观测的Sgr A*和M87*等源的模型进行了比较。
2. 使用多种观测数据约束模型，包括波长、分辨率、偏振和时间间隔。
3. ALMA观测结果与边缘模型不一致，MAD模型中只有指向远离观测者的磁偶极矩模型与观测数据一致。
4. 26个通过模型中有转向顺时针旋转的快速增长模型。
5. 研究提供了所有模型参数均值、标准差及其趋势的表格。 <div>
Models of the resolved Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) sources Sgr A* and M87* are constrained by observations at multiple wavelengths, resolutions, polarizations, and time cadences. In this paper, we compare unresolved circular polarization (CP) measurements to a library of models, where each model is characterized by a distribution of CP over time. In the library, we vary the spin of the black hole, the magnetic field strength at the horizon (i.e., both SANE and magnetically arrested disk or MAD models), the observer inclination, a parameter for the maximum ion–electron temperature ratio assuming a thermal plasma, and the direction of the magnetic field dipole moment. We find that Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of Sgr A* are inconsistent with all edge-on (i = 90°) models. Restricting attention to the MAD models favored by earlier EHT studies of Sgr A*, we find that only models with magnetic dipole moment pointing away from the observer are consistent with ALMA data. We also note that in 26 of the 27 passing MAD models, the accretion flow rotates clockwise on the sky. We provide a table of the means and standard deviations of the CP distributions for all model parameters, along with their trends.

这篇研究对明亮的GRB 231129C进行了详细的时间综合和时间分辨光谱分析。结果显示其具有独特的光谱特征，具有硬低能谱指数(α)和软高能谱指数(β)，类似于GRB 090902B，表明可能主要是热辐射。进一步分析显示92%的光谱指数超过了同步辐射的“死线”，最硬的指数为α∼+0.44。同时，53%的光谱可以很好地符合非耗散光球模型，支持可能起源于非耗散光球。此外，我们观察到光谱指数α与峰值能量Ep与通量之间存在强相关性。对于α−F关系，我们使用F=F0e(3.00±0.10)α来描述，而Ep−F关系需要一个平滑弯曲的幂律函数。基于Hascoët等人和Gao & Zhang提出的框架，研究了这次爆发的射流特性，结果显示这两种方法都支持纯火球模型在较小的初始射流半径下适用于这次GRB。 
<br /><br />总结: 本研究对明亮的GRB 231129C进行了光谱分析，并发现其可能主要由热辐射组成，以及可能起源于非耗散光球模型。同时，研究还观察到了光谱指数和峰值能量与通量之间的强相关性。通过对射流特性的研究，结果支持纯火球模型在这次GRB中的适用性。 <div>
This study presents detailed time-integrated and time-resolved spectral analysis of the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor observations of the bright GRB 231129C. The results reveal its distinct spectral characteristics, featuring a hard low-energy spectral index (α) and soft high-energy spectral index (β), similar to GRB 090902B, suggesting a possible dominance of thermal emission. Further analysis indicates that 92% of the spectral indices exceed the synchrotron “line of death,” with the hardest index at α ∼ +0.44. Simultaneously, 53% of the spectra can be well fitted by the nondissipative photosphere model, supporting a potential origin from a nondissipative photosphere. Additionally, we observe strong correlations between the spectral index α and peak energy Ep with flux. For the α−F relationship, we employ F = F0e(3.00±0.10)α to describe it, whereas the Ep−F relationship requires a smoothly bending power-law function. Based on the framework proposed by Hascoët et al. and Gao & Zhang, the jet characteristics of this burst were studied, revealing that both methods support the suitability of a pure fireball model for this GRB at small initial jet radii.

<div> M dwarf stars, habitable planets, water loss, super-Earths, planetary mass
<br /><br />总结:
M矮星周围的超级地球可能是宇宙中最常见的适居行星。然而，它们的宜居性受到宿主恒星强烈辐射的威胁，导致水流失并可能导致地表干涸。模拟结果表明，质量为1-8M⊕的地球类行星在M矮星的宜居带中，能量限制性的水流失随着行星质量的增加而减少，而扩散限制性的水流失则随质量增加而增加。初始拥有更多水的行星最终可能成为无暴露大陆的水世界，而初始水更少的行星在5亿年后可能出现地表干涸。此外，更大的行星会在地幔中储存更多的水。处于宜居带内缘的超级地球往往最终成为水世界或干涸的行星，只有初始水储量在一定范围内的情况下才能形成类似地球的地表。 <div>
Super-Earths orbiting M dwarf stars may be the most common habitable planets in the Universe. However, their habitability is threatened by intense irradiation from their host stars, which drives the escape of water to space and can lead to surface desiccation. We present simulation results of a box model incorporating deep-water cycling between interior and atmosphere and water loss to space for terrestrial planets of mass 1–8 M⊕ orbiting in the habitable zone of a late M dwarf. Energy-limited loss decreases with planetary mass, while diffusion-limited loss increases with mass. Depending on where it orbits in the habitable zone, a 1 M⊕ planet that starts with 3–8 Earth Oceans can end up with an Earthlike surface of oceans and exposed continents; for an 8 M⊕ super-Earth, that range is 3–12 Earth Oceans. Planets initialized with more water end up as waterworlds with no exposed continents, while planets that start with less water have desiccated surfaces by 5 Gyr. Since the mantles of terrestrial planets can hold much more water than is currently present in Earth’s atmosphere, none of our simulations result in Dune planets—such planets may be less common than previously thought. Further, more water becomes sequestered within the mantle for larger planets. A super-Earth at the inner edge of the habitable zone tends to end up as either a waterworld or with a desiccated surface; only a narrow range of initial water inventory yields an Earthlike surface.

<div> Parker Solar Probe, Encounter 15, slow-speed solar wind, sub-Alfvénic, coronal heating

总结:<br /><br />在Parker Solar Probe第15次接触期间，观测到了近亚音速和亚阿尔文尼速度的太阳风，具有极端的性质，标志着Parker探测器最深入太阳冠层内部的探测。通过多点观测和宇宙风暴对流分析，确认了这一慢速太阳风是来自活跃区域、持续存在且具有极端空间天气影响潜力的稳定结构。针对该太阳风的湍流分析显示其性质与先前观测到的太阳风相似。因此，这一极端低动压太阳风区间是在至少到达1天文单位距离的大型稳定结构。 <div>
During Parker Solar Probe (Parker) Encounter 15 (E15), we observe an 18 hr period of near-subsonic (MS ∼ 1) and sub-Alfvénic (SA), MA ⋘ 1, slow-speed solar wind from 22 to 15.6 R⊙. As the most extreme SA interval measured to date and skirting the solar wind sonic point, it is the deepest Parker has probed into the formation and acceleration region of the solar wind in the corona. The stream is also measured by Wind and the Magnetosonic Multiscale mission near 1 au at times consistent with ballistic propagation of this slow stream. We investigate the stream source, properties, and potential coronal heating consequences via combining these observations with coronal modeling and turbulence analysis. Through source mapping, in situ evidence, and multipoint arrival time considerations of a candidate coronal mass ejection, we determine the stream is a steady (nontransient), long-lived, and approximately Parker spiral aligned and arises from overexpanded field lines mapping back to an active region. Turbulence analysis of the Elsässer variables shows the inertial range scaling of the z+ mode (f ∼ −3/2) to be dominated by the slab component. We discuss the spectral flattening and difficulties associated with measuring the z− spectra, cautioning against making definitive conclusions from the z− mode. Despite being more extreme than prior SA intervals, its turbulent nature does not appear to be qualitatively different from previously observed streams. We conclude that this extreme low-dynamic-pressure solar wind interval (which has the potential for extreme space-weather conditions) is a large, steady structure spanning at least to 1 au.

<div> 关键词: 涡流、原行星盘、磁场结构、气体动力学、粒子聚集

总结: 
涡流在原行星盘中起着重要作用，对其的存在和程度进行了探讨。研究表明，即使在中心恒星1-30天文单位处，气体湍流可以通过磁场传输角动量。气体速度波动在盘的不同高度呈现不同的范围，且与初始磁场强度有关。然而，湍流速度似乎不强烈依赖于磁场极性，因此对霍尔效应不敏感。盘中面的湍流可以驱动尘埃颗粒达到超过其破碎限的碰撞速度，可能减少了中面粒子聚集的有效性。然而，尚不清楚这种程度的湍流是否在离子化水平较低的盘中持续存在。 <div>
Given the important role turbulence plays in the settling and growth of dust grains in protoplanetary disks, it is crucial that we determine whether these disks are turbulent and to what extent. Protoplanetary disks are weakly ionized near the midplane, which has led to a paradigm in which largely laminar magnetic field structures prevail deeper in the disk, with angular momentum being transported via magnetically launched winds. Yet, there has been little exploration of the precise behavior of the gas within the bulk of the disk. We carry out 3D, local shearing box simulations that include all three low-ionization effects (ohmic diffusion, ambipolar diffusion, and the Hall effect) to probe the nature of magnetically driven gas dynamics 1–30 au from the central star. We find that gas turbulence can persist with a generous yet physically motivated ionization prescription (order unity Elsässer numbers). The gas velocity fluctuations range from 0.03 to 0.09 of the sound speed cs at the disk midplane to ∼cs near the disk surface, and are dependent on the initial magnetic field strength. However, the turbulent velocities do not appear to be strongly dependent on the field polarity, and thus appear to be insensitive to the Hall effect. The midplane turbulence has the potential to drive dust grains to collision velocities exceeding their fragmentation limit, and likely reduces the efficacy of particle clumping in the midplane, though it remains to be seen if this level of turbulence persists in disks with lower ionization levels.

<div> [C ii] 158 μm, quasar, star formation, outflows, ALMA  
总结: 该研究利用ALMA观测了一个z = 6.05的双类星系系统，发现两个暗淡的类星体之间有明亮的[C ii]发射，显示系统中有高达6 × 10^9L⊙的总[C ii]辐射。系统的基于[C ii]的总星形成速率约为550M⊙ yr−1，基于红外辐射的尘埃遮挡星形成速率约为100M⊙ yr−1，气体质量约为10^11M⊙。两个星系的动力学质量分别约为9 × 10^10M⊙和5 × 10^10M⊙。通过[C ii]发现了类星体间的光滑速度梯度，表明它们是一个潮汐相互作用的系统。在C1周围发现了动力学上不同的快速[C ii]成分，显示出约600 km s−1的快速流出。预期的出流质量加载因子介于2-3之间，属于AGN和星暴驱动出流之间的中间水平。文献中的流体动力学模拟预测，这一对星系在合并后将演变成一个光度极高（M1450 ≲ −26 mag），大规模星暴（≳1000 M⊙ yr−1）的类星体，在早期宇宙中属于极端的一种类型。 <div>
We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array [C ii] 158 μm line and underlying far-IR continuum emission observations (0.″57 × 0.″46 resolution) toward a quasar–quasar pair system recently discovered at z = 6.05. The quasar nuclei (C1 and C2) are faint (M1450 ≳ −23 mag), but we detect very bright [C ii] emission bridging the 12 kpc between the two objects and extending beyond them (total luminosity L[C ii] ≃ 6 × 109L⊙). The [C ii]-based total star formation rate of the system is ∼550 M⊙ yr−1 (the IR-based dust-obscured star formation is ∼100 M⊙ yr−1), with a [C ii]-based total gas mass of ∼1011M⊙. The dynamical masses of the two galaxies are large (∼9 × 1010M⊙ for C1 and ∼5 × 1010M⊙ for C2). There is a smooth velocity gradient in [C ii], indicating that these quasars are a tidally interacting system. We identified a dynamically distinct, fast-[C ii] component around C1: detailed inspection of the line spectrum there reveals the presence of a broad-wing component, which we interpret as the indication of fast outflows with a velocity of ∼600 km s−1. The expected mass-loading factor of the outflows, after accounting for multiphase gas, is ≳2 − 3, which is intermediate between AGN-driven and starburst-driven outflows. Hydrodynamic simulations in the literature predict that this pair will evolve to a luminous (M1450 ≲ −26 mag), starbursting (≳1000 M⊙ yr−1) quasar after coalescence, one of the most extreme populations in the early Universe.

<br /><br />总结:
本文研究了在明亮的早期星系中存在的尘埃环绕着的圆盘（CNDs），这些圆盘显示出规则的、动力学冷的分子气体动力学。通过ALMA CO成像和详细的气体动力学建模，确定了多个ETGs的黑洞质量。研究者识别了一组包括26个ETGs的样本，它们具有干净的CO动力学，但之前没有足够高角分辨率的近红外观测数据以减轻在构建恒星亮度模型时的尘埃遮挡问题。他们进行了新的光学和近红外哈勃空间望远镜（HST）图像，补充了存档中的HST数据，并测量了恒星表面亮度分布并使用MGE方法对亮度进行了建模。研究者发现这些CNDs通常在近红外光学上变得光学厚重。此外，他们发现不确定的尘埃对MGE的影响往往在BH质量误差估计中占主导地位。这项工作的延伸将集中在限制CND尘埃衰减上。这些发现将有助于重新审视局部黑洞质量 - 宿主星系比例关系。 <div>
Dusty circumnuclear disks (CNDs) in luminous early-type galaxies (ETGs) show regular, dynamically cold molecular gas kinematics. For a growing number of ETGs, Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) CO imaging and detailed gas-dynamical modeling facilitate moderate-to-high precision black hole (BH) mass (MBH) determinations. From the ALMA archive, we identified a subset of 26 ETGs with estimated MBH/M⊙ ≳ 108 to a few × 109 and clean CO kinematics but that previously did not have sufficiently high-angular-resolution near-IR observations to mitigate dust obscuration when constructing stellar luminosity models. We present new optical and near-IR Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images of this sample to supplement the archival HST data, detailing the sample properties and data-analysis techniques. After masking the most apparent dust features, we measure stellar surface-brightness profiles and model the luminosities using the multi-Gaussian expansion (MGE) formalism. Some of these MGEs have already been used in CO dynamical modeling efforts to secure quality MBH determinations, and the remaining ETG targets here are expected to significantly improve the high-mass end of the current BH census, facilitating new scrutiny of local BH mass–host galaxy scaling relationships. We also explore stellar isophotal behavior and general dust properties, finding these CNDs generally become optically thick in the near-IR (AH ≳ 1 mag). These CNDs are typically well aligned with the larger-scale stellar photometric axes, with a few notable exceptions. Uncertain dust impact on the MGE often dominates the BH mass error budget, so extensions of this work will focus on constraining CND dust attenuation.

Roughly 2% of white dwarfs harbor planetary debris disks detectable via infrared excesses, but only a few percent of these disks show a gaseous component, distinguished by their double-peaked emission at the near-infrared calcium triplet. Previous studies found that most debris disks around white dwarfs are variable at 3.4 and 4.5 μm, but they analyzed only a few of the now 21 published disks showing calcium emission. To test if most published calcium emission disks exhibit large-amplitude stochastic variability in the near-infrared, we use light curves generated from the unWISE images at 3.4 μm that are corrected for proper motion to characterize the near-infrared variability of these disks against samples of disks without calcium emission, highly variable cataclysmic variables, and 3215 isolated white dwarfs. We find that most calcium emission disks are extremely variable: 6/11 with sufficient signal-to-noise show high-amplitude variability in their 3.4 μm light curves. These results lend further credence to the notion that disks showing gaseous debris in emission are the most collisionally active. Under the assumption that 3.4 μm variability is characteristic of white dwarfs with dusty debris disks, we generate a catalog of 104 high-confidence near-infrared variable white dwarfs, 84 of which are published as variable for the first time. We do near-infrared spectroscopic follow-up of seven new candidate 3.4 μm variables, confirming at least one new remnant planetary system, and posit that empirical near-infrared variability can be a discovery engine for debris disks showing gaseous emission.

<div> CHIME, FRB, GRB, SGRB, Radio emission
总结:
加拿大氢强度映射实验(CHIME)快速射电爆发(FRB)项目使用CHIME/FRB搜索2018年7月7日至2023年8月3日之间与伽马射线暴(GRB)在时间和空间上(误差不超过1周和3σ)重合的FRB。然而，未发现任何CHIME/FRB候选者与所有1σ定位误差<1°的GRB同时发生。在此基础上，使用CHIME/FRB对27个与CHIME/FRB子午线在17°内的短伽马射线暴(SGRBs)的可能FRB-like射电发射进行了限制。其中，两个SGRBs，GRB 210909A和GRB 230208A，在它们的高能辐射发生时正好在CHIME的地平线以上，我们对它们同时FRB-like射电发射进行了一些首次约束。尽管这两个SGRBs都没有已知的红移，但我们根据它们的高能辐射和推导的SGRB能量分布构建了一个红移范围。对于GRB 210909A，这个红移范围对应于z=[0.009，1.64]，平均z=0.13。因此，对于GRB 210909A，在高能辐射的时刻，我们将射电亮度限制为L<2×1046 erg s−1，L<5×1044 erg s−1，和L<3×1042 erg s−1，分别假设红移为z=0.85，z=0.16和z=0.013。我们将这些约束与不同紧凑天体并合模型对射电亮度的预测进行了比较。 <div>
We use the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) Fast Radio Burst (FRB) Project to search for FRBs that are temporally and spatially coincident with gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) occurring between 2018 July 7 and 2023 August 3. We do not find any temporal (within 1 week) and spatial (within overlapping 3σ localization regions) coincidences between any CHIME/FRB candidates and all GRBs with 1σ localization uncertainties <1°. As such, we use CHIME/FRB to constrain the possible FRB-like radio emission for 27 short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) that were within 17° of CHIME/FRB’s meridian at a point either 6 hr prior up to 12 hr after the high-energy emission. Two SGRBs, GRB 210909A and GRB 230208A, were above the horizon at CHIME at the time of their high-energy emission and we place some of the first constraints on simultaneous FRB-like radio emission from SGRBs. While neither of these two SGRBs have known redshifts, we construct a redshift range for each GRB based on their high-energy fluence and a derived SGRB energy distribution. For GRB 210909A, this redshift range corresponds to z = [0.009, 1.64] with a mean of z = 0.13. Thus, for GRB 210909A, we constrain the radio luminosity at the time of the high-energy emission to L < 2 × 1046 erg s−1, L < 5 × 1044 erg s−1, and L < 3 × 1042 erg s−1 assuming redshifts of z = 0.85, z = 0.16, and z = 0.013, respectively. We compare these constraints with the predicted simultaneous radio luminosities from different compact object merger models.

总结:<br />
本文研究了快速射电暴（FRBs）的时间、频谱和偏振特性，指出大多数爆发的射电辐射可能是在其中央引擎（可能是一个磁星）的磁层内产生的。文章提出了一种通过低频X模电磁波（快磁声波）的相干逆康普顿散射（ICS）产生FRB的观点，并给出了以下发现：（1）在爆发事件期间，地壳振荡会激发千赫兹的Alfvén波。快磁声波可能直接在较大的半径处产生，其频率与Alfvén波几乎相同，并具有足够大的振幅来通过ICS过程为FRB提供动力。（2）截面随半径迅速增加，可在r≳100R⋆处发生显著的ICS，发射功率远大于曲率辐射功率，但仍处于线性散射状态。（3）低频快磁声波可以自然地重新分布充满涡动的相对论等离子体，在电荷稀疏区形成适当大小的束团，从而为FRB提供动力。（4）所需束团净电荷密度可以低于Goldreich-Julian值，这允许强平行电场加速电荷，维持束团，并持续为FRB辐射提供动力。（5）这个模型可以解释重复快速射电暴爆发的多种观测特性，包括高度线偏振和圆偏振以及窄谱线。 <div>
Growing observations of temporal, spectral, and polarization properties of fast radio bursts (FRBs) indicate that the radio emission of the majority of bursts is likely produced inside the magnetosphere of its central engine, likely a magnetar. We revisit the idea that FRBs are generated via coherent inverse Compton scattering (ICS) off low-frequency X-mode electromagnetic waves (fast magnetosonic waves) by bunches at a distance of a few hundred times the magnetar radius. The following findings are revealed: (1) Crustal oscillations during a flaring event would excite kHz Alfvén waves. Fast magnetosonic waves with essentially the same frequency can be generated directly or be converted from Alfvén waves at a large radius, with an amplitude large enough to power FRBs via the ICS process. (2) The cross section increases rapidly with radius and significant ICS can occur at r ≳ 100R⋆ with emission power much greater than the curvature radiation power but still in the linear scattering regime. (3) The low-frequency fast magnetosonic waves naturally redistribute a fluctuating relativistic plasma in the charge-depleted region to form bunches with the right size to power FRBs. (4) The required bunch net charge density can be sub-Goldreich–Julian, which allows a strong parallel electric field to accelerate the charges, maintain the bunches, and continuously power FRB emission. (5) This model can account for a wide range of observed properties of repeating FRB bursts, including high degrees of linear and circular polarization and narrow spectra as observed in many bursts from repeating FRB sources.

<div> 关键词：太阳耀斑，元素丰度，软X射线，第一电离势，太阳大气层
<br />总结:
太阳耀斑是太阳活动的重要现象，然而关于耀斑过程中元素丰度变化的研究仍然不足。本研究利用嫦娥二号月球探测器获取的太阳X射线监测数据，对太阳活跃区AR 11149和11158的两次耀斑进行了全面的软X射线光谱观测，揭示了不同条件下元素丰度随时间的变化。研究发现铁元素在耀斑过程中呈现出了反向第一电离势效应，硅元素也表现出了该效应。此外，在耀斑减弱阶段观察到了元素丰度稀缺的现象，标志着第二电离势效应的存在。研究还提出了一个基于CSHKP模型的解释，阐明了耀斑动力学中FIP和IFIP效应的形成，同时还将惰性效应引入了ponderomotive力分馏模型中。 <div>
Understanding how elemental abundances evolve during solar flares helps shed light on the mass and energy transfer between different solar atmospheric layers. However, prior studies have mostly concentrated on averaged abundances or specific flare phases, leaving a gap in exploring the comprehensive observations throughout the entire flare process. Consequently, investigations into this area are relatively scarce. Exploiting the Solar X-Ray Monitor data obtained from the Chang’E-2 lunar orbiter, we present two comprehensive soft X-ray spectroscopic observations of flares in active regions, AR 11149 and 11158, demonstrating elemental abundance evolutions under different conditions. Our findings unveil the inverse first ionization potential (IFIP) effect during flares for Fe for the first time, and reaffirm its existence for Si. Additionally, we observed a rare depletion of elemental abundances, marking the second IFIP effect in flare decay phases. Our study offers a CSHKP model-based interpretation to elucidate the formation of both the FIP and IFIP effects in flare dynamics, with the inertia effect being incorporated into the ponderomotive force fractionation model.

<div> 高温耀斑循环、准周期震荡、太阳动力学

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章报告了一个独特的事件，展示了C9.1级耀斑期间耀斑环的长时准周期强度震荡和带状亚结构的准周期滑动运动。耀斑环的高温环根植于带状直部显示出“明亮-暗淡”强度震荡，周期约为4.5分钟。与此同时，带状尖端内的亚结构在1400 Å图像上显示出沿着带状的准周期滑动运动，周期与耀斑环直部的静止强度震荡相似。文章指出，这种准周期模式可能与由重联流出影响耀斑环的环顶动力学有关。 <div>
Quasiperiodic oscillations in solar-flaring emission have been observed over the past few decades. To date, the underpinning processes resulting in the quasiperiodic oscillations remain unknown. In this paper, we report a unique event that exhibits both the long-duration quasiperiodic intensity oscillations of flare loops and the quasiperiodic slipping motion of ribbon substructures during a C9.1-class flare (SOL2015-03-15-T01:15), using the observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory and Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph. The high-temperature flare loops rooted in the straight part of ribbons display a “bright–dim” intensity oscillation, with a period of about 4.5 minutes. The oscillation starts just after the flare onset and lasts over 3 hr. Meanwhile, the substructures within the ribbon tip display the quasiperiodic slipping motion along the ribbon at 1400 Å images, which has a similar periodicity to the stationary intensity oscillation of the flare loops in the straight part of the flare ribbons. We suggest that the quasiperiodic pattern is probably related to the loop-top dynamics caused by the reconnection outflow impinging on the flare loops.

JWST卫星用于测定高红移星系的Lyα发射，本文研究发现采用狭缝光谱测定Lyα逃逸分数会产生偏差。作者以A2744-z6Lya星系为例，发现JWST/NIRSpec棱镜光谱并未检测到MUSE数据中的强烈Lyα发射。经过详细分析，发现光谱中的缝隙区域缺失Lyα发射的原因可能是中性氢的共振散射效应和尘埃消光。这项研究强调了在进行狭缝光谱研究时需要注意的重要细节，特别是在使用JWST的NIRSpec微光栅组件时。 
<br /><br />总结: <br />狭缝光谱测定Lyα逃逸分数可能存在偏差，A2744-z6Lya星系在JWST/NIRSpec光谱中未检测到MUSE数据中的Lyα发射。这是由中性氢的共振散射效应和尘埃消光造成的。这项研究强调了进行光谱研究时需要注意的重要细节，特别是在使用JWST的NIRSpec微光栅组件时。 <div>
The detections of Lyα emission in galaxies with redshifts above 5 are of utmost importance for constraining the cosmic reionization timeline, yet such detections are usually based on slit spectroscopy. Here we investigate the significant bias induced by slit placement on the estimate of Lyα escape fraction ( ) by presenting a galaxy (dubbed A2744-z6Lya) at z = 5.66, where its deep JWST/NIRSpec prism spectroscopy completely misses the strong Lyα emission detected in the MUSE data. A2744-z6Lya exhibits a pronounced UV continuum with an extremely steep spectral slope of , and it has a stellar mass of ∼108.75M⊙, a star formation rate of ∼5.95 M⊙ yr−1, and a gas-phase metallicity of . The observed flux and rest-frame equivalent width of its Lyα from MUSE spectroscopy are 1.2 × 10−16 erg s−1 cm−2 and 75 Å, equivalent to . However, its Lyα nondetection from JWST NIRSpec gives a 5σ upper limit of <5%, in stark contrast to that derived from MUSE. To explore the reasons for this bias, we perform spatially resolved stellar population analysis of A2744-z6Lya using the JWST NIRCam and HST imaging data to construct 2D maps of star formation rate, dust extinction, and neutral hydrogen column density. We find that the absence of Lyα in the slit regions probably stems from both the resonance scattering effect of neutral hydrogen and dust extinction. Through analyzing an extreme case in detail, this work highlights the important caveat of inferring from slit spectroscopy, particularly when using the JWST multiplexed NIRSpec microshutter assembly.

Reconstruction of the point-spread function (PSF) plays an important role in many areas of astronomy, including photometry, astrometry, galaxy morphology, and shear measurement. The atmospheric and instrumental effects are the two main contributors to the PSF, both of which may exhibit complex spatial features. Current PSF reconstruction schemes typically rely on individual exposures, and their ability to reproduce the complicated features of the PSF distribution is therefore limited by the number of stars. Interestingly, in conventional methods, after stacking the model residuals of the PSF ellipticities and (relative) sizes from a large number of exposures, one can often observe some stable and nontrivial spatial patterns on the entire focal plane, which could be quite detrimental to, e.g., weak-lensing measurements. These PSF residual patterns are caused by instrumental effects, as they consistently appear in different exposures. Taking this as an advantage, we propose a multilayer PSF reconstruction method to remove such PSF residuals, the second and third layers of which make use of all available exposures together. We test our method on the i-band data of the second release of the Hyper Suprime-Cam. Our method successfully eliminates most of the PSF residuals. Using the Fourier_Quad shear measurement method, we further test the performance of the resulting PSF fields on shear recovery using the field distortion effect. The PSF residuals have strong correlations with the shear residuals, and our new multilayer PSF reconstruction method can remove most of such systematic errors related to the PSF, leading to much smaller shear biases.

The detection of O- and B-type stars with extremely low-mass companions is very important for understanding the formation and evolution of binary stars. However, finding them remains a challenge because the low-mass components in such systems contribute such small flux to the total. During our search for pulsations among O- and B-type stars using the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) data, we found two short-period and B-type (B9) eclipsing binaries with orbital periods of 1.61613 and 2.37857 days. Photometric solutions of the two close binaries were derived by analyzing the TESS light curves with the Wilson–Devinney method. It is discovered that both of them are detached binaries with extremely low mass ratios of 0.067(2) for TIC 260342097 and 0.140(3) for TIC 209148631. The determined mass ratio indicates that TIC 260342097 is one of the lowest mass ratios among known B-type binary systems. We showed that the two systems have total eclipses with a broad and flat secondary minimum, suggesting that the photometric parameters could be derived reliably. The absolute parameters of the two binaries are estimated and it is found that the secondary components in the two systems are overluminous and oversize when compared with the normal low-mass and cool main-sequence (MS) stars. These findings may imply that the two systems are composed of a B-type MS primary and a cool pre-MS secondary with orbital periods shorter than 2.5 days. They are valuable targets to test theories of binary star formation and evolution.

As lensing of coherent astrophysical sources, e.g., pulsars, fast radio bursts, and gravitational waves, becomes observationally relevant, the mathematical framework of Picard–Lefschetz theory has recently been introduced to fully account for wave optics effects. Accordingly, the concept of lensing images has been generalized to include complex solutions of the lens equation referred to as “imaginary images,” and more radically, to the Lefschetz thimbles, which are a sum of the steepest descent contours connecting the real and imaginary images in the complex domain. In this wave-optics-based theoretical framework of lensing, we study the “Stokes phenomena” as the change of the topology of the Lefschetz thimbles. Similar to the well-known caustics at which the number of geometric images changes abruptly, the corresponding Stokes lines are the boundaries in the parameter space where the number of effective imaginary images changes. We map the Stokes lines for a few lens models. The resulting Stokes line-caustics network represents a unique feature of the lens models. The observable signature of the Stokes phenomena is the change of interference behavior, in particular the onset of frequency oscillation for some Stokes lines. We also demonstrate high-order Stokes phenomena where the system has a continuous number of effective images but with an abrupt change in the way they are connected to each other by the Lefschetz thimbles. Their full characterization calls for an analogy of the catastrophe theory for caustics.

Primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) play a pivotal role in influencing small-scale fluctuations within the primordial density field, thereby enhancing the matter power spectrum within the context of the ΛCDM model at small scales. These amplified fluctuations accelerate the early formation of galactic halos and stars, which can be observed through advanced high-redshift observational techniques. Therefore, stellar mass density (SMD) observations, which provide significant opportunities for detailed studies of galaxies at small scales and high redshifts, offer a novel perspective on small-scale cosmic phenomena and constrain the characteristics of PMFs. In this study, we compile 14 SMD data points at redshifts z > 6 and derive stringent constraints on the parameters of PMFs, which include the amplitude of the magnetic field at a characteristic scale of λ = 1 Mpc, denoted as B0, and the spectral index of the magnetic field power spectrum, nB. At 95% confidence level, we establish upper limits of B0 < 4.44 nG and nB < −2.24, along with a star formation efficiency of approximately . If we fix nB at specific values, such as −2.85, −2.9, and −2.95, the 95% upper limits for the amplitude of the magnetic field can be constrained to 1.33, 2.21, and 3.90 nG, respectively. Finally, we attempt to interpret recent early observations provided by the James Webb Space Telescope using the theory of PMFs and find that by selecting appropriate PMF parameters, it is possible to explain these results without significantly increasing the star formation efficiency.

总结:
NGC6334I是一个以其显著的流量突发事件而闻名的源。通过ALMA的观测，发现其总强度没有实质性变化，而线偏振有轻微的8%变化，暗示了稳定阶段或爆发的结束。从偏振辐射推断出的磁场显示出从西北到东南的主要径向模式，以及对主要核心的复杂扰动，提示螺旋结构的存在。能量分析表明，NGC6334I的流出能量约为3.5 × 10^45 erg，与之前的干涉研究结果相符。采用Davis–Chandrasekhar–Fermi方法确定的磁场强度区间为1至11 mG，平均为1.9 mG。考虑到Zeeman测量后，平均值增至4 ± 1 mG。而在引力、热和动能地图的比较分析中发现，磁能明显较弱，可能解释了观察到的场形态。此外，发现NGC6334I中的流出和膨胀的HII区域能量也比磁能大，暗示原恒星反馈可能是在我们观测的尺度范围内注入湍动的主要驱动力。文章还指出，NGC6334I中的气体主要表现出超声速和跨阿尔芬速条件，随着气体密度增加逐渐过渡到超阿尔芬速的状态，突显了磁场对气体的影响逐渐减弱。这些观测结果与之前在220 GHz进行的偏振研究相符，丰富了我们对高质量恒星形成区域动态过程的理解。 <div>
We report on Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of polarized dust emission at 1.2 mm from NGC6334I, a source known for its significant flux outbursts. Between five months, our data show no substantial change in total intensity and a modest 8% variation in linear polarization, suggesting a phase of stability or the conclusion of the outburst. The magnetic field, inferred from this polarized emission, displays a predominantly radial pattern from northwest to southeast with intricate disturbances across major cores, hinting at spiral structures. Energy analysis of CS (J = 5 → 4) emission yields an outflow energy of approximately 3.5 × 1045 erg, aligning with previous interferometric studies. Utilizing the Davis–Chandrasekhar–Fermi method, we determined magnetic field strengths ranging from 1 to 11 mG, averaging at 1.9 mG. This average increases to 4 ± 1 mG when incorporating Zeeman measurements. Comparative analyses using gravitational, thermal, and kinetic energy maps reveal that magnetic energy is significantly weaker, possibly explaining the observed field morphology. We also find that the energy in the outflows and the expanding cometary HII region is also larger than the magnetic energy, suggesting that protostellar feedback may be the dominant driver behind the injection of turbulence in NGC6334I at the scales sampled by our data. The gas in NGC6334I predominantly exhibits supersonic and trans-Alfvenic conditions, transitioning towards a super-Alfvenic regime, underscoring a diminished influence of the magnetic field with increasing gas density. These observations are in agreement with prior polarization studies at 220 GHz, enriching our understanding of the dynamic processes in high-mass star-forming regions.

We obtained New Horizons LORRI images to measure the cosmic optical background (COB) intensity integrated over 0.4 μm ≲ λ ≲ 0.9 μm. The survey comprises 16 high-Galactic-latitude fields selected to minimize scattered diffuse Galactic light (DGL) from the Milky Way, as well as scattered light from bright stars. This work supersedes an earlier analysis based on observations of one of the present fields. Isolating the COB contribution to the raw total sky levels measured in the fields requires subtracting the remaining scattered light from bright stars and galaxies, intensity from faint stars within the fields fainter than the photometric detection limit, and the DGL foreground. DGL is estimated from 350 μm and 550 μm intensities measured by the Planck High Frequency Instrument, using a new self-calibrated indicator based on the 16 fields augmented with eight additional DGL calibration fields obtained as part of the survey. The survey yields a highly significant detection (6.8σ) of the COB at 11.16 ± 1.65 (1.47 sys, 0.75 ran) nW m−2 sr−1 at the LORRI pivot wavelength of 0.608 μm. The estimated integrated intensity from background galaxies, 8.17 ± 1.18 nW m−2 sr−1, can account for the great majority of this signal. The rest of the COB signal, 2.99 ± 2.03 (1.75 sys, 1.03 ran) nW m−2 sr−1, is formally classified as anomalous intensity but is not significantly different from zero. The simplest interpretation is that the COB is completely due to galaxies.

<br />在这篇文章中，我们研究了SXT XTE J1856+053在2023年7月通过NICER和NuSTAR数据获取的突发事件。我们对突发期间的X射线发射进行了时序和光谱分析。能谱密度显示没有准周期振荡特征。7月19日的源光谱可以用多色黑体成分、幂律成分和反射成分与加宽的铁发射线很好地拟合。NICER光谱可以通过考虑黑体和幂律的组合很好地拟合。该源在突发下降阶段仅经历了5天从软态到中间态的转变。内部吸积盘具有较低的倾角（约18°）。光谱分析还表明中心吸积物体为高自旋（a>0.9）的黑洞。<br /><br />总结: 本文研究了软X射线暂现现象，通过时序和光谱分析，发现了X射线发射的特点和黑洞的性质。文章对于SXT研究有一定的参考价值。 <div>
Soft X-ray transients (SXTs) are a subclass of the low-mass X-ray binaries that occasionally show a sudden rise in their soft X-ray luminosity; otherwise, they remain in an extremely faint state. We investigate the accretion properties of the SXT XTE J1856+053 during its 2023 outburst obtained by NICER and NuSTAR data in July. We present detailed results on the timing and spectral analysis of the X-ray emission during the outburst. The power spectral density shows no quasi-periodic oscillation features. The source’s spectrum on July 19 can be well fitted with a multicolor blackbody component, a power-law component, and a reflection component with a broadened iron emission line. NICER spectra can be well fitted by considering a combination of a blackbody and a power law. The source exhibits a transition within just 5 days from a soft state to an intermediate state during the outburst decline phase. The inner accretion disk has a low inclination angle (∼18°). The spectral analysis also suggests a high-spin (a > 0.9) black hole as the central accreting object.

The origin of strong sodium absorption, which has been observed for a few nearby Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), remains elusive. Here we analyze two high-signal-to-noise, intermediate-resolution Very Large Telescope/X-shooter spectra at epochs +18 and +27 days past peak brightness of the strongly lensed and multiply imaged Type Ia SN 2016geu, which exploded at a redshift of z = 0.4. We show that SN 2016geu exhibits very strong multiple Na i and Ca ii absorption lines with a large total Na i D rest-frame equivalent width (EW) of 5.2 ± 0.2 Å, among the highest ever detected for an SN Ia and similar to only a handful of nearby SNe Ia with extraordinarily large Na i D EWs. The absorption system is time-invariant and extends over a large velocity span ∼250 km s−1. The majority of the absorption is blueshifted relative to the strongest component, while there are both blueshifted and redshifted components relative to the systemic redshift of the galaxy. The column density ratios and widths of the absorption lines indicate that the absorption likely arises from a combination of interstellar dusty molecular clouds and circumgalactic in- and outflowing material rather than circumstellar matter around the supernova.

<div> 高红移、金属丰度指示器、模拟数据、高红移超新星、演化。  
总结:<br /><br />本文研究了高红移星系中强光谱线的金属丰度指示器的校准，并使用宇宙学模拟中的模拟发射线数据。研究结果表明，我们所研究的12个指标中存在轻微的红移演化，这意味着在模拟中演化的主要物理性质对高红移时期的金属丰度校准产生了可辨认的影响。与詹姆斯·韦伯太空望远镜的高红移辐射线观测进行比较时，我们发现模型结果与观测结果存在轻微偏差，高红移时的更高电离参数可能是其中一个可能的解释。我们还探讨了驱动强线金属丰度关系形状的物理机制，并提出了迄今未被探索的低金属丰度范围的校准。最后，我们研究了漫射电离气体对总发射线通量的贡献，在z∼0时发现，低电离氧和硫线的漫射电离气体贡献随金属丰度的增加而增加，甚至可能达到70%，这使得在建模星云发射线时包含其贡献至关重要。 <div>
The ratios of strong rest-frame optical emission lines are the dominant indicators of metallicities in high-redshift galaxies. Since typical strong-line-based metallicity indicators are calibrated on auroral lines at z = 0, their applicability for galaxies in the distant Universe is unclear. In this paper, we make use of mock emission-line data from cosmological simulations to investigate the calibration of rest-frame optical emission lines as metallicity indicators at high redshift. Our model, which couples the simba cosmological galaxy formation simulation with cloudy photoionization calculations, includes contributions from H ii regions, post-asymptotic-giant-branch stars, and diffuse ionized gas (DIG). We find mild redshift evolution in the 12 indicators that we study, which implies that the dominant physical properties that evolve in our simulations do have a discernible impact on the metallicity calibrations at high redshifts. When comparing our calibrations with high-redshift auroral line observations from the James Webb Space Telescope, we find a slight offset between our model results and the observations and find that a higher ionization parameter at high redshifts can be one of the possible explanations. We explore the physics that drives the shapes of strong-line metallicity relationships and propose calibrations for hitherto unexplored low-metallicity regimes. Finally, we study the contribution of DIG to total line fluxes. We find that the contribution of DIG increases with metallicity at z ∼ 0 for singly ionized oxygen and sulfur lines and can be as high as 70%, making it crucial to include their contribution when modeling nebular emission.

<div> 红巨星，银河系形成，动力学，金属丰度，天体物理<br />
总结:<br />
本研究利用1000万颗红巨星星的化学动力学信息，阐述了银河系经历的三个阶段：无序混沌的原星系，动力学高的老盘，以及动力学冷的年轻盘。高α盘从[Fe/H]≈-1.0开始“加速旋转”，并在较高的金属性显示出更加有序和圆形的轨道。而年轻的低α盘在其金属丰度范围内表现出动力学上的冷状态，且受强烈的径向梯度影响。研究通过TNG50宇宙学模拟发现了与我们银河系动力学演化相匹配的模拟银河。该模拟银河的原星系在早期形成了相对薄而不一致的高α盘，随后被一次富含气体的重大并购所加热和扭曲。该并购提供了大量低金属丰度的气体和角动量，从而随后形成了动力学冷的低α恒星盘。该研究成果为我们对银河系的三阶段形成提供了全天境观的新视角，推动了旋转加速、合并和冷却这三个物理机制的形成。 <div>
We illustrate the formation and evolution of the Milky Way over cosmic time, utilizing a sample of 10 million red giant stars with full chemodynamical information, including metallicities and α-abundances from low-resolution Gaia XP spectra. The evolution of angular momentum as a function of metallicity—a rough proxy for stellar age, particularly for high-[α/Fe] stars—displays three distinct phases: the disordered and chaotic protogalaxy, the kinematically hot old disk, and the kinematically cold young disk. The old high-α disk starts at [Fe/H] ≈ −1.0, “spinning up” from the nascent protogalaxy, and then exhibiting a smooth “cooldown” toward more ordered and circular orbits at higher metallicities. The young low-α disk is kinematically cold throughout its metallicity range, with its observed properties modulated by a strong radial gradient. We interpret these trends using Milky Way analogs from the TNG50 cosmological simulation, identifying one that closely matches the kinematic evolution of our galaxy. This halo’s protogalaxy spins up into a relatively thin and misaligned high-α disk at early times, which is subsequently heated and torqued by a major gas-rich merger. The merger contributes a large amount of low-metallicity gas and angular momentum, from which the kinematically cold low-α stellar disk is subsequently born. This simulated history parallels several observed features of the Milky Way, particularly the decisive Gaia–Sausage–Enceladus merger that likely occurred at z ≈ 2. Our results provide an all-sky perspective on the emerging picture of our galaxy’s three-phase formation, impelled by the three physical mechanisms of spinup, merger, and cooldown.

We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of the [C ii] 158 μm line and the underlying continuum emission of TN J0924−2201, which is one of the most distant known radio galaxies at z > 5. The [C ii] line and 1 mm continuum emission are detected at the host galaxy. The systemic redshift derived from the [C ii] line is z[C II] = 5.1736 ± 0.0002, indicating that the Lyα line is redshifted by a velocity of 1035 ± 10 km s−1, marking the largest velocity offset between the [C ii] and Lyα lines recorded at z > 5 to date. In the central region of the host galaxy, we identify a redshifted substructure of [C ii] with a velocity of 702 ± 17 km s−1, which is close to the C iv line with a velocity of 500 ± 10 km s−1. The position and the velocity offsets align with a model of an outflowing shell structure, consistent with the large velocity offset of Lyα. The nondetection of [C ii] and dust emission from the three CO(1–0)-detected companions indicates their different nature compared to dwarf galaxies, based on the photodissociation region model. Given their large velocity of ∼1500 km s−1, outflowing molecular clouds induced by the active galactic nucleus are the most plausible interpretation, and they may exceed the escape velocity of a 1013M⊙ halo. These results suggest that TN J0924−2201, with ongoing and fossil large-scale outflows, is in a distinctive phase of removing molecular gas from a central massive galaxy in an overdense region in the early Universe. A dusty H i absorber at the host galaxy is an alternative interpretation.

总结: 
本研究观测并分析了NOAA活跃区12127中的M1.5级耀斑(SOL2014-08-01T18:13)，该耀斑具有三个耀斑带、耀斑带之间的限制性丝状结构、和太阳黑子旋转运动。通过磁场外推模型发现了两个相交的准分离层构成的双曲型磁通管(HFT)，形成了三个耀斑带的结构。进一步的场外推模型显示了两个耀斑带之间存在磁通绳结构，这对于观测未清楚地呈现了出来。研究发现了太阳黑子周围的旋转流，可能通过减弱磁通绳向下的磁张力而导致了耀斑的爆发。总的来说，这次的耀斑爆发路径不同于通常由日珥内部丝状结构成功爆发引起的圆环耀斑。我们的研究结果展示了太阳磁爆发路径的多样性，这多样性来自太阳磁场复杂配置的影响。 <br /><br /> <div>
We present observations and analysis of an eruptive M1.5 flare (SOL2014-08-01T18:13) in NOAA active region (AR) 12127, characterized by three flare ribbons, a confined filament between ribbons, and rotating sunspot motions as observed by the Solar Dynamics Observatory. The potential field extrapolation model shows a magnetic topology involving two intersecting quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs) forming a hyperbolic flux tube (HFT), which constitutes the fishbone structure for the three-ribbon flare. Two of the three ribbons show separation from each other, and the third ribbon is rather stationary at the QSL footpoints. The nonlinear force-free field extrapolation model implies the presence of a magnetic flux rope (MFR) structure between the two separating ribbons, which was unclear in the observation. This suggests that the standard reconnection scenario for eruptive flares applies to the two ribbons, and the QSL reconnection for the third ribbon. We find rotational flows around the sunspot, which may have caused the eruption by weakening the downward magnetic tension of the MFR. The confined filament is located in the region of relatively strong strapping field. The HFT topology and the accumulation of reconnected magnetic flux in the HFT may play a role in holding it from eruption. This eruption scenario differs from the one typically known for circular ribbon flares, which is mainly driven by a successful inside-out eruption of filaments. Our results demonstrate the diversity of solar magnetic eruption paths that arises from the complexity of the magnetic configuration.

总结:
本文通过对RT Cru多种X射线数据的主成分分析，揭示了δ型共生双星系统的X射线变化特征。观测显示了RT Cru的X射线光谱在2012年出现了硬化状态转变，且存在小时级的波动。主成分分析显示Chandra HRC-S/LETG和XMM-Newton EPIC-pn数据具有主要的成分，其中可能包含了软过剩的一些变化信号。此外，Suzaku XIS1数据的主要成分包括吸收柱、源连续谱和可能是软波段热等离子体发射的第三个成分。NuSTAR数据的主成分对应于连续谱和可能的发射特征。研究结果表明，Suzaku观测到的光谱硬度转变主要归因于吸收材料和X射线连续谱的变化，而热等离子体发射的一些变化可能导致了闪烁型变化。 <div>
Hard X-ray-emitting (δ-type) symbiotic binaries, which exhibit a strong hard X-ray excess, have posed a challenge to our understanding of accretion physics in degenerate dwarfs. RT Cru, which is a member of the δ-type symbiotics, shows stochastic X-ray variability. Timing analyses of X-ray observations from XMM-Newton and NuSTAR, which we consider here, indicate hourly fluctuations, in addition to a spectral transition from 2007 to a harder state in 2012 seen with Suzaku observations. To trace the nature of X-ray variability, we analyze the multimission X-ray data using principal component analysis (PCA), which determines the spectral components that contribute most to the flickering behavior and the hardness transition. The Chandra HRC-S/LETG and XMM-Newton EPIC-pn data provide the primary PCA components, which may contain some variable emission features, especially in the soft excess. Additionally, the absorbing column (first order with 50%), along with the source continuum (20%), and a third component (9%)—which likely accounts for thermal emission in the soft band—are the three principal components found in the Suzaku XIS1 observations. The PCA components of the NuSTAR data also correspond to the continuum and possibly emission features. Our findings suggest that the spectral hardness transition between the two Suzaku observations is mainly due to changes in the absorbing material and X-ray continuum, while some changes in the thermal plasma emission may result in flickering-type variations.

The properties of the galaxies are tightly connected to their host halo mass and halo assembly history. Accurate measurement of the halo assembly history in observation is challenging but crucial to the understanding of galaxy formation and evolution. The stellar-to-halo mass ratio (M*/Mh) for the centrals has often been used to indicate the halo assembly time th,50 of the group, where th,50 is the lookback time at which a halo has assembled half of its present-day virial mass. Using mock data from the semi-analytic models, we find that M*/Mh shows a significant scatter with th,50, with a strong systematic difference between the group with a star-forming central (blue group) and passive central (red group). To improve the accuracy, we develop machine learning models to estimate th,50 for galaxy groups using only observable quantities in the mocks. Since star formation quenching will decouple the co-growth of the dark matter and baryon, we train our models separately for blue and red groups. Our models have successfully recovered th,50, within an accuracy of ∼1.09 Gyr. With careful calibrations of individual observable quantities in the mocks with Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) observations, we apply the trained models to the SDSS Yang et al. groups and derive the th,50 for each group for the first time. The derived SDSS th,50 distributions are in good agreement with that in the mocks, in particular for blue groups. The derived halo assembly history, together with the halo mass, make an important step forward in studying the halo–galaxy connections in observation.

<div> 关键词: 太阳风, 地球, 太阳活动区, 日冕孔, 磁力线

总结:
太阳风预测和日冕事件模拟使用27天太阳旋转周期内的光球磁场图。研究发现，如果新的太阳活动区位于地球的经度约135°–180°处，那么对太阳风和日冕孔的影响将几乎可以忽略。然而，如果新的太阳活动区位于太阳边缘附近，可能会对中央经线附近的磁场产生明显影响。当新的太阳活动区和邻近的日冕孔有相反的极性时，可能导致日冕孔部分关闭，产生较慢的太阳风；但如果极性相同，则会增大日冕孔面积，产生更快的太阳风。总的来说，新的太阳活动区主要通过交换再连接来重新分配磁场。 <div>
Solar wind prediction algorithms and simulations of coronal events often employ photospheric field maps that are assembled over a 27 day solar rotation. This has stimulated efforts to update and better synchronize the maps by applying flux transport and including observations of the back side of the Sun. Here, using potential-field source-surface extrapolations, we address the question of how the emergence of a large active region (AR) on the Sun’s farside affects the coronal field and configuration of coronal holes on the Earth-facing side. We find that, if the new AR is located ∼135°–180° in longitude from Earth, the effect on the coronal field and solar wind near the central meridian will be almost negligible. This is because, when sunspot activity is relatively low, the outermost AR loops will become connected to the nearby polar fields; when sunspot activity is high, the newly emerged flux will connect to neighboring ARs. However, large ARs that emerge near the solar limb may sometimes have a significant effect on the field near the central meridian. In particular, a coronal hole having opposite polarity to that of the nearest sector of the AR may partially close down, resulting in slower wind; conversely, if the coronal hole has the same polarity as the facing AR sector, it will tend to increase in areal size, resulting in faster wind. In most cases, the main effect of a new AR will be to redistribute open flux between itself and neighboring coronal holes (including the polar holes) through interchange reconnection.

<div> Tidal disruption events, TDEs, low-mass black holes, X-ray spectroscopy, AT2021ehb
总结:
Tidal disruption events (TDEs)可能探测到宿主星系中未遵循星团或恒星离散关系的低质量黑洞（BH）。X射线光谱学可能可以限制BH质量，并揭示与超Eddington吸积相关的电离流出。我们对TDE AT2021ehb的XMM-Newton X射线观测进行了分析，并发现在大约300天的破坏之后，其软光谱可以用多彩盘黑体和幂律组分的组合来拟合。使用两个适用于TDE的独立盘模型，我们估计BH质量约为M≈105.5M⊙，表明AT2021ehb可能揭示核心BH种群的低质量端。这些模型提供简单而坚固的表征；不需要更复杂的模型，但在数据中等敏感性的情况下提供了重要的背景和警示。如果包括盘反射，盘流量会减少，推断的BH质量约高了0.35 dex。简单的风配方意味着极快的vout=−0.2c流出，并且排除了盘连续组分。假设一个单位填充因子，这样的风意味着瞬时质量流出率。如此高的速率表明超快流出(UFO)的填充因子必须非常低，和/或UFO相位是短暂的。我们讨论了分析的优势和局限性，以及TDE的未来观测途径。 <div>
Tidal disruption events (TDEs) can potentially probe low-mass black holes (BHs) in host galaxies that might not adhere to bulge or stellar-dispersion relationships. At least initially, TDEs can also reveal super-Eddington accretion. X-ray spectroscopy can potentially constrain BH masses, and reveal ionized outflows associated with super-Eddington accretion. Our analysis of XMM-Newton X-ray observations of the TDE AT2021ehb, around 300 days post-disruption, reveals a soft spectrum and can be fit with a combination of multicolor disk blackbody and power-law components. Using two independent disk models with properties suited to TDEs, we estimate a BH mass at M ≃ 105.5M⊙, indicating AT2021ehb may expose the elusive low-mass end of the nuclear BH population. These models offer simple yet robust characterization; more complicated models are not required, but provide important context and caveats in the limit of moderately sensitive data. If disk reflection is included, the disk flux is lower and inferred BH masses are ∼0.35 dex higher. Simple wind formulations imply an extremely fast vout = −0.2c outflow and obviate a disk continuum component. Assuming a unity filling factor, such a wind implies an instantaneous mass outflow rate of . Such a high rate suggests that the filling factor for the ultrafast outflow (UFO) must be extremely low, and/or the UFO phase is ephemeral. We discuss the strengths and limitations of our analysis and avenues for future observations of TDEs.

<title>Velocity-resolved Ionization Mapping of Broad Line Region. I. Insights into Diverse Geometry and Kinematics</title>

<div> 关键词: 转运映射, 宽发射线区域, 活跃星系核, 几何结构, 超大质量黑洞<br />
总结: <br />研究了活跃星系核（AGNs）的宽发射线区域（BLR），发现使用新的技术——速度分辨电离映射，可以发现不对称的BLR结构。通过分析光谱监测数据发现，氢线比例与连续谱呈反相关，与宽发射线速度延迟呈正相关。一些线比例轮廓不符合对称的BLR预期，提示红移和蓝移气体云可能不等距离于超大质量黑洞。这种不对称的几何结构可能代表一种形成痕迹，为AGNs的演化提供新视角，并影响超大质量黑洞质量的测量。 <div>
Broad emission lines of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) originate from the broad-line region (BLR), consisting of dense gas clouds in orbit around an accreting supermassive black hole. Understanding the geometry and kinematics of this region is crucial for gaining insights into the physics and evolution of AGNs. Conventional velocity-resolved reverberation mapping may face challenges in disentangling the degeneracy between intricate motion and geometry of this region. To address this challenge, new key constraints are required. Here, we report the discovery of an asymmetric BLR using a novel technique: velocity-resolved ionization mapping, which can map the distance of emitting gas clouds by measuring Hydrogen line ratios at different velocities. By analyzing spectroscopic monitoring data, we find that the Balmer decrement is anticorrelated with the continuum and correlated with the lags across broad emission line velocities. Some line ratio profiles deviate from the expectations for a symmetrically virialized BLR, suggesting that the redshifted and blueshifted gas clouds may not be equidistant from the supermassive black hole (SMBH). This asymmetric geometry might represent a formation imprint, provide new perspectives on the evolution of AGNs, and influence SMBH mass measurements.

<title>Should Zeros Count? Modeling the Galaxy–Globular Cluster Scaling Relation with(out) Zero-inflated Count Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The scaling relation between the size of a galaxy’s globular cluster (GC) population (NGC) and the galaxy’s stellar mass (M*) is usually described with a continuous, linear model, but in reality it is a count relationship that should be modeled as such. For massive galaxies, a negative binomial (NB) model has been shown to describe the data well, but it is unclear how the scaling relation behaves at low galaxy masses where a substantial portion of galaxies have NGC = 0. In this work, we test the utility of Poisson and NB models for describing the low-mass end of the NGC−M* scaling relation. We introduce the use of zero-inflated versions of these models, which allow for larger zero populations (e.g., galaxies without GCs) than would otherwise be predicted. We evaluate our models with a variety of predictive model comparison methods, including predictive intervals, the leave-one-out cross-validation criterion, and posterior predictive comparisons. We find that the NB model is consistent with our data, but the naive Poisson is not. Moreover, we find that zero inflation of the models is not necessary to describe the population of low-mass galaxies that lack GCs, suggesting that a single formation and evolutionary process acts over all galaxy masses. Under the NB model, there does not appear to be anything unique about the lack of GCs in many low-mass galaxies; they are simply the low-mass extension of the larger NGC−M* scaling relation.

<title>ϵ Sagittarii: An Extreme Rapid Rotator with a Decretion Disk</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report high-precision, multiwavelength linear-polarization observations of the bright B9 (or A0) star ϵ Sagittarii. The polarization shows the distinctive wavelength dependence expected for a rapidly rotating star. Analysis of the polarization data reveals an angular rotation rate ω (=Ω/Ωcrit) of 0.995 or greater, the highest yet measured for a star in our Galaxy. An additional wavelength-independent polarization component is attributed to electron scattering in a low-density, edge-on gas disk that also produces the narrow absorption components seen in the spectrum. Several properties of the star (polarization due to a disk, occasional weak Hα emission, and multiple periodicities seen in space photometry) resemble those of Be stars, but the level of activity in all cases is much lower than that of typical Be stars. The stellar properties are inconsistent with single-rotating-star evolutionary tracks, indicating that it is most likely a product of binary interaction. The star is an excellent candidate for observation by interferometry, optical spectropolarimetry to detect the Öhman effect, and ultraviolet polarimetry, any of which would allow its extreme rotation to be tested and its stellar properties to be refined.

<title>Modeling the Far-infrared Polarization Spectrum of a High-mass Star-forming Cloud</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The polarization spectrum, or wavelength dependence of the polarization fraction, of interstellar dust emission provides important insights into the grain alignment mechanism of interstellar dust grains. We investigate the far-infrared polarization spectrum of a realistic simulated high-mass star-forming cloud under various models of grain alignment and emission. We find that neither a homogeneous grain alignment model nor a grain alignment model that includes collisional dealignment is able to produce the falling spectrum seen in observations. On the other hand, we find that a grain alignment model with grain alignment efficiency dependent on local temperature is capable of producing a falling spectrum that is in qualitative agreement with observations of OMC-1. For the model most in agreement with OMC-1, we find no correlation between the temperature and the slope of the polarization spectrum. However, we do find a positive correlation between the column density and the slope of the polarization spectrum. We suggest this latter correlation to be the result of wavelength-dependent polarization by absorption.

<title>Afterglows from Binary Neutron Star Postmerger Systems Embedded in Active Galactic Nuclei Disks</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The observability of afterglows from binary neutron star mergers occurring within active galactic nuclei (AGN) disks is investigated. We perform 3D GRMHD simulations of a postmerger system and follow the jet launched from the compact object. We use semianalytic techniques to study the propagation of the blast wave powered by the jet through an AGN disk-like external environment, extending to distances beyond the disk scale height. The synchrotron emission produced by the jet-driven forward shock is calculated to obtain the afterglow emission. The observability of this emission at different frequencies is assessed by comparing it to the quiescent AGN emission. In the scenarios where the afterglow could temporarily outshine the AGN, we find that detection will be more feasible at higher frequencies (≳1014 Hz) and the electromagnetic counterpart could manifest as a fast variability in the AGN emission, on timescales less than a day.

<title>A Multiwavelength, Multiepoch Monitoring Campaign of Accretion Variability in T Tauri Stars from the ODYSSEUS Survey. III. Optical Spectra*</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Classical T Tauri Stars (CTTSs) are highly variable stars that possess gas- and dust-rich disks from which planets form. Much of their variability is driven by mass accretion from the surrounding disk, a process that is still not entirely understood. A multiepoch optical spectral monitoring campaign of four CTTSs (TW Hya, RU Lup, BP Tau, and GM Aur) was conducted along with contemporaneous Hubble Space Telescope (HST) UV spectra and ground-based photometry in an effort to determine accretion characteristics and gauge variability in this sample. Using an accretion flow model, we find that the magnetospheric truncation radius varies between 2.5 and 5 R⋆ across all of our observations. There is also significant variability in all emission lines studied, particularly Hα, Hβ, and Hγ. Using previously established relationships between line luminosity and accretion, we find that, on average, most lines reproduce accretion rates consistent with accretion shock modeling of HST spectra to within 0.5 dex. Looking at individual contemporaneous observations, however, these relationships are less accurate, suggesting that variability trends differ from the trends of the population and that these empirical relationships should be used with caution in studies of variability.

<title>Splitting and Eruption of an Active Region Filament Caused by Magnetic Reconnection</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
To gain a deeper understanding of the intricate process of filament eruption, we present a case study of a filament splitting and erupting by using multiwavelength data of the Solar Dynamics Observatory. It is found that the magnetic reconnection between the filament and the surrounding magnetic loops resulted in the formation of two new filaments, which erupted successively. The observational evidence of magnetic reconnection, such as the obvious brightening at the junction of two different magnetic structures, the appearance of a bidirectional jet, and subsequent filament splitting, were clearly observed. Even though the two newly formed filaments experienced failed eruptions, three obvious dimmings were observed at the footpoints of the filaments during their eruptions. Based on these observations, it is suggested that magnetic reconnection is the trigger mechanism for the splitting of the original filament and the subsequent eruption of the newly formed filaments. Furthermore, the process of filament splitting dominated by magnetic reconnection can shed light on the explanation of double-decker filament formation.

<title>The Centrifugal Acceleration and the Y-point of the Pulsar Magnetosphere</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad676b</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We investigate the centrifugal acceleration in an axisymmetric pulsar magnetosphere under the ideal MHD approximation. We solve the field-aligned equations of motion for flows inside the current sheet with finite thickness. We find that flows coming into the vicinity of a Y-point become super fast. The centrifugal acceleration takes place efficiently, and most of the Poynting energy is converted into kinetic energy. However, the super-fast flow does not provide enough centrifugal drift current to open the magnetic field. Opening of the magnetic field is possible by the plasmas that are accelerated in the azimuthal direction with a large Lorentz factor in the closed-field region. We find that this acceleration takes place if the field strength increases toward the Y-point from inside. The accelerated plasma is transferred from the closed-field region to the open-field region by magnetic reconnection with plasmoid emission. We also estimate the Lorentz factor to be reached in the centrifugal wind.

<title>FAST Detection of OH Emission in the Carbon-rich Planetary Nebula NGC 7027</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the first detection of the ground-state OH emission line at 1612 MHz toward the prototypical carbon-rich planetary nebula (PN) NGC 7027, utilizing the newly installed ultrawideband (UWB) receiver of the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). This emission is likely to originate from the interface of the neutral shell and the ionized region. The other three ground-state OH lines at 1665, 1667, and 1721 MHz are observed in absorption and have velocities well matched with that of HCO+ absorption. We infer that the OH absorption is from the outer shell of NGC 7027, although the possibility that they are associated with a foreground cloud cannot be completely ruled out. All the OH lines exhibit a single blueshifted component with respect to the central star. The formation of OH in carbon-rich environments might be via photodissociation-induced chemical processes. Our observations offer significant constraints for chemical simulations, and they underscore the potent capability of the UWB receiver of FAST to search for nascent PNe.

We study the anisotropy of centroid and integrated intensity maps with synthetic observations. We perform postprocess radiative transfer including the optically thick regime that was not covered in Hernández-Padilla et al. We consider the emission in various CO molecular lines that range from optically thin to optically thick (12CO, 13CO, C18O, and C17O). The results for the velocity centroids are similar to those in the optically thin case. For instance, the anisotropy observed can be attributed to the Alfvén mode, which dominates over the slow and fast modes when the line of sight is at a high inclination with respect to the mean magnetic field. A few differences arise in the models with higher opacity, where some dependence on the sonic Mach number becomes evident. In contrast to the optically thin case, maps of integrated intensity become more anisotropic in optically thick lines. In this situation the scales probed are restricted, due to absorption, to smaller scales, which are known to be more anisotropic. We discuss how the sonic Mach number can affect the latter results, with highly supersonic cases exhibiting a lower degree of anisotropy.

总结: 
本文介绍了使用Karl G. Jansky非常大阵列(VLA)对GOODS-N区域进行了首次高分辨率、高频率的射电连续波测量。使用X波段(8-12 GHz)接收器，共耗时380小时观测，获得了平均rms噪声为671 nJy beam−1，角分辨率为0.″22的10 GHz图。同时也生成了角分辨率为1.″0，rms噪声为968 nJy beam−1的低分辨率图。目录中包含了256个射电源的检测信息，其中假源比例为0.75%。通过蒙特卡洛模拟得出了目录的完整性修正。研究发现，在GOODS-N区域的10 GHz射电源计数与数值模拟/模型的预测以及1.4和3 GHz的射电源计数预期大体一致。 <div>
We present the first high-resolution, high-frequency radio continuum survey that fully maps an extragalactic deep field: the 10 GHz survey of the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey-North (GOODS-N) field. This is a Large Program of the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) that allocated 380 hr of observations using the X-band (8–12 GHz) receivers, leading to a 10 GHz mosaic of the GOODS-N field with an average rms noise σn = 671 nJy beam−1 and angular resolution θ1/2 = 0.″22 across 297 arcmin2. To maximize the brightness sensitivity we also produce a low-resolution mosaic with θ1/2 = 1.″0 and σn = 968 nJy beam−1, from which we derive our master catalog containing 256 radio sources detected with peak signal-to-noise ratio ≥ 5. Radio source size and flux density estimates from the high-resolution mosaic are provided in the master catalog as well. The total fraction of spurious sources in the catalog is 0.75%. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to derive completeness corrections of the catalog. We find that the 10 GHz radio source counts in the GOODS-N field agree, in general, with predictions from numerical simulations/models and expectations from 1.4 and 3 GHz radio counts.

<div> 关键词: 超新星遗迹，各向异性，功率谱，X射线图像，密度估计<br />
总结:<br />
本研究提出了一种通过计算高分辨率图像的功率谱来测量超新星遗迹中各向异性的技术。研究团队通过开发3D流体动力学模型生成合成X射线图像，并从中提取功率谱。这些功率谱展现出在早期时期的小尺度长度上的激增，表明了一种不符合Kolmogorov湍流的趋势，但在后期转变为Kolmogorov湍流。对Tycho超新星遗迹的观测确认了模型的功率谱，并且提供了该遗迹周围气体密度的估计和外部喷射物密度分布的估计。此外，还观察到了大尺度上额外的功率，这可能为爆炸机制本身提供了重要线索。 <div>
Supernova remnants (SNRs) exhibit varying degrees of anisotropy, which have been extensively modeled using numerical methods. We implement a technique to measure anisotropies in SNRs by calculating power spectra from their high-resolution images. To test this technique, we develop 3D hydrodynamical models of SNRs and generate synthetic X-ray images from them. Power spectra extracted from both the 3D models and the synthetic images exhibit the same dominant angular scale, which separates large-scale features from small-scale features due to hydrodynamic instabilities. The angular power spectrum at small length scales during relatively early times is too steep to be consistent with Kolmogorov turbulence, but it transitions to Kolmogorov turbulence at late times. As an example of how this technique can be applied to observations, we extract a power spectrum from a Chandra observation of Tycho’s SNR and compare with our models. Our predicted power spectrum picks out the angular scale of Tycho’s fleecelike structures and also agrees with the small-scale power seen in Tycho. We use this to extract an estimate for the density of the circumstellar gas (n ∼ 0.28 cm−3), consistent with previous measurements of this density by other means. The power spectrum also provides an estimate of the density profile of the outermost ejecta. Moreover, we observe additional power at large scales, which may provide important clues about the explosion mechanism itself.

We examine the local density environments around 67 quasars at z ∼ 3 by combining the imaging data of Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program and Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope Large Area U-band Deep Survey over about 20 deg2. Our measurements exploit U-dropout galaxies in the vicinities of quasars taken from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find that the quasars have an indistinguishable surrounding density distribution from the U-dropout galaxies and that three quasars are associated with protocluster candidates within a projected separation of 3′. According to a halo evolutionary model, our results suggest that quasars at this epoch occupy haloes with a typical mass of . We also investigate the dependence of the local galaxy overdensity on ultraviolet (UV) luminosities, black hole masses, and proximity zone sizes of the quasars, but no statistically significant correlation was found. Finally, we find that the local density of faint U-dropout galaxies are lower than that of bright U-dropout galaxies within a projected distance of 0.51 ± 0.05 physical Mpc, where the quasar UV radiation is 30 times more intense than background UV radiation. We argue that photoevaporation may suppress galaxy formation at short distances where the quasar UV intensity is strong, even in massive haloes.

While direct magnetic field measurements are rare for slowly rotating stars, spots observed during planetary transits provide a potential indicator of magnetic activity on stellar surfaces. Moreover, the rotation of the stellar surface can be probed by monitoring the spots’ position with time in subsequent transits. This study investigates the dynamic interplay of rotational shear and stellar rotation rate in six stars of spectral types F to M, all hosting exoplanets observed by the CoRoT space mission, except for one binary star from Kepler. The analysis, facilitated by the ECLIPSE code, unveils the physical properties of stellar spots, including radius, intensity, temperature, and position. The five CoRoT stars exhibit spot characteristics consistent with those observed in solar type stars. The determination of a spot longitude during different transits allows for the inference of the star’s differential rotation profile, revealing a decreasing trend of rotational shear with the mean stellar rotation period, given by . This implies that, at least for slow rotators (mean rotation period >5 days), as stars age, their differential rotation decreases. Additionally, the six stars analyzed here seem to fall into two categories, according to their spot flux deficit: those with ΔFspot > 0.005 and those with ΔFspot < 0.002.

LS I+61°303 is a high-mass X-ray binary system comprising a massive Be star and a rapidly rotating neutron star. Its spectral energy distribution across multiwavelengths categorizes it as a γ-ray binary system. In our analysis of LS I+61°303 using Fermi Large Area Telescope observations, we not only confirmed the three previously discussed periodicities of orbital, superorbital, and orbital–superorbital beat periods observed in multiwavelength observations, but also identified an additional periodic signal. This newly discovered signal exhibits a period of ∼26.3 days at a ∼7σ confidence level. Moreover, the power spectrum peak of the new signal gradually decreases as the energy increases across the energy ranges of 0.1–0.3, 0.3–1.0, and 1.0–500.0 GeV. Interestingly, a potential signal with a similar period was found in data obtained from the Owens Valley Radio Observatory 40 m telescope. We suggest that the newly discovered periodic signal may originate from a coupling between the orbital period and the retrograde stellar precession period.

自动检测大规模磁流绳以及评估它们的地球效应至关重要，因为它们可能引发严重的太空天气。研究提出了一种利用太阳风磁性特性训练的两个监督二元分类机器学习模型的流水线，用于自动检测大规模磁流绳并确定它们的地球效应。第一个模型用于生成自动检测到的磁流绳列表，第二模型利用南向磁场的性质确定磁流绳的地球效应。我们的方法能够在1天内自动识别出1 AU处90%左右的大型ICMEs，并获得88%的准确率来评估磁流绳的地球效应。因此，在L1点的空间天气预测中，我们的流水线可以提供大规模磁流绳及其地球效应的一级检测。 <br /><br />总结: <br />关键词: 自动检测、大规模磁流绳、太阳风磁性特性、机器学习模型、空间天气预测。<br />要点:提出使用机器学习模型自动检测大规模磁流绳，并评估其地球效应；利用两个监督分类模型对太阳风磁性特征进行训练；对1 AU处的大型ICMEs进行了有效识别和地球效应评估；在空间天气预测中具有重要应用价值。 <div>
Detecting large-scale flux ropes (FRs) embedded in interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) and assessing their geoeffectiveness are essential, since they can drive severe space weather. At 1 au, these FRs have an average duration of 1 day. Their most common magnetic features are large, smoothly rotating magnetic fields. Their manual detection has become a relatively common practice over decades, although visual detection can be time-consuming and subject to observer bias. Our study proposes a pipeline that utilizes two supervised binary classification machine-learning models trained with solar wind magnetic properties to automatically detect large-scale FRs and additionally determine their geoeffectiveness. The first model is used to generate a list of autodetected FRs. Using the properties of the southward magnetic field, the second model determines the geoeffectiveness of FRs. Our method identifies 88.6% and 80% of large-scale ICMEs (duration ≥ 1 day) observed at 1 au by the Wind and the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory missions, respectively. While testing with continuous solar wind data obtained from Wind, our pipeline detected 56 of the 64 large-scale ICMEs during the 2008–2014 period (recall = 0.875), but also many false positives (precision = 0.56), as we do not take into account any additional solar wind properties other than the magnetic properties. We find an accuracy of 0.88 when estimating the geoeffectiveness of the autodetected FRs using our method. Thus, in space-weather nowcasting and forecasting at L1 or any planetary missions, our pipeline can be utilized to offer a first-order detection of large-scale FRs and their geoeffectiveness.

<title>Multivariate Predictors of Lyman Continuum Escape. I. A Survival Analysis of the Low-redshift Lyman Continuum Survey*</title>

<div> 关键词: galaxies, reionization, Lyman continuum photons, fesc, multivariate predictors<br />
总结: <br />
这篇文章研究了银河系是如何对宇宙进行再电离的，通过开发和分析了对逸出分数（fesc）的新的多变量预测模型，使用了Cox比例风险模型进行预测，发现最重要的预测变量是Lyman系列吸收线的等效宽度（EW）和紫外线尘埃衰减。文章还强调了H i吸收的重要性，特别是对最强的LyC发射体来说。预测模型对于高红移也具有适用性，证实了ΣSFR和[O iii]/[O ii]在预测fesc方面的重要性。总体来说，这些多变量模型为在高红移时预测fesc提供了一个有希望的工具。 <div>
To understand how galaxies reionized the Universe, we must determine how the escape fraction of Lyman continuum (LyC) photons (fesc) depends on galaxy properties. Using the z ∼ 0.3 Low-redshift Lyman Continuum Survey (LzLCS), we develop and analyze new multivariate predictors of fesc. These predictions use the Cox proportional hazards model, a survival analysis technique that incorporates both detections and upper limits. Our best model predicts the LzLCS fesc detections with an rms scatter of 0.31 dex, better than single-variable correlations. According to ranking techniques, the most important predictors of fesc are the equivalent width (EW) of Lyman-series absorption lines and the UV dust attenuation, which track line-of-sight absorption due to H i and dust. The H i absorption EW is uniquely crucial for predicting fesc for the strongest LyC emitters, which show properties similar to weaker LyC emitters and whose high fesc may therefore result from favorable orientation. In the absence of H i information, star formation rate surface density (ΣSFR) and [O iii]/[O ii] ratio are the most predictive variables and highlight the connection between feedback and fesc. We generate a model suitable for z > 6, which uses only the UV slope, ΣSFR, and [O iii]/[O ii]. We find that ΣSFR is more important in predicting fesc at higher stellar masses, whereas [O iii]/[O ii] plays a greater role at lower masses. We also analyze predictions for other parameters, such as the ionizing-to-nonionizing flux ratio and Lyα escape fraction. These multivariate models represent a promising tool for predicting fesc at high redshift.

Eruptive mass loss of massive stars prior to supernova (SN) explosion is key to understanding their evolution and end fate. An observational signature of pre-SN mass loss is the detection of an early, short-lived peak prior to the radioactive-powered peak in the lightcurve of the SN. This is usually attributed to the SN shock passing through an extended envelope or circumstellar medium. Such an early peak is common for double-peaked Type IIb SNe with an extended hydrogen envelope but uncommon for normal Type Ibc SNe with very compact progenitors. In this paper, we systematically study a sample of 14 double-peaked Type Ibc SNe out of 475 Type Ibc SNe detected by the Zwicky Transient Facility. The rate of these events is ∼3%–9% of Type Ibc SNe. A strong correlation is seen between the peak brightness of the first and the second peak. We perform a holistic analysis of this sample’s photometric and spectroscopic properties. We find that six SNe have ejecta mass less than 1.5 M⊙. Based on the nebular spectra and lightcurve properties, we estimate that the progenitor masses for these are less than ∼12 M⊙. The rest have an ejecta mass >2.4 M⊙ and a higher progenitor mass. This sample suggests that the SNe with low progenitor masses undergo late-time binary mass transfer. Meanwhile, the SNe with higher progenitor masses are consistent with wave-driven mass loss or pulsation-pair instability-driven mass-loss simulations.

Signals generated by dust impacting spacecraft can be detected by electric field instruments. These signals have been simulated by numerous models. However, few models can accurately characterize the expansion of the plasma cloud generated by dust impact. The COMSOL model presented in this paper provides a way to understand the expansion properties of ions and electrons. The model can also be used to analyze the various expected waveforms of dust impact signals as a function of different parameters, such as the spacecraft voltage and the ambient plasma temperature. The results show that close to 50% of ions and electrons in the impact plasma cloud are collected by spacecraft at weak spacecraft potentials and that a fraction of the ions is still collected rather than all of them streaming away from the impact location at VSC > 0 V. The model also confirms that in the expanding plasma cloud, ions are in the form of plumes, while electrons diffuse in an isotropic manner.

Ionization drives important chemical and dynamical processes within protoplanetary disks, including the formation of organics and water in the cold midplane and the transportation of material via accretion and magnetohydrodynamic flows. Understanding these ionization-driven processes is crucial for understanding disk evolution and planet formation. We use new and archival Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of HCO+, H13CO+, and N2H+ to produce the first forward-modeled 2D ionization constraints for the DM Tau protoplanetary disk. We include ionization from multiple sources and explore the disk chemistry under a range of ionizing conditions. Abundances from our 2D chemical models are postprocessed using non-LTE radiative transfer, visibility sampling, and imaging, and are compared directly to the observed radial emission profiles. The observations are best fit by a modestly reduced cosmic-ray ionization rate (ζCR ∼10−18 s−1) and a hard X-ray spectrum (hardness ratio = 0.3), which we associate with stellar flaring conditions. Our best-fit model underproduces emission in the inner disk, suggesting that there may be an additional mechanism enhancing ionization in DM Tau’s inner disk. Overall, our findings highlight the complexity of ionization in protoplanetary disks and the need for high-resolution multiline studies.

<div> 关键词: Kelvin-Helmholtz波，月球磁层边界, 太阳风, 磁场, 统计结果

总结: <br /><br />这项研究分析了在月球磁层边界出现Kelvin-Helmholtz不稳定性（KHI）的情况，通过对ARTEMIS卫星观测数据的分析发现，KHI的发生率约为15％，低于侧磁层边界的发生率。研究还发现，KHI的发生率随着磁声马赫数、阿尔芬马赫数、太阳风速度和动压的增加而减少，仅与太阳风密度略微正相关。与白昼侧磁层边界不同，在月球距离磁层边界，KHI的发生率随太阳风速度增加而减少。此外，KHI的发生率也随着磁场的振幅减少，并受到磁场方向的影响。根据磁场钟角度的变化，KHI的发生率在钟角度为零时达到最大值，约为24％。这些统计结果基本与目前接受的KHI线性理论一致，为理解磁层边界KHI的激发和演化、尾部磁层边界等离子体输运过程做出了贡献。 <div>
Kelvin–Helmholtz waves can be observed frequently at the near-Earth magnetopause and play an important role in the transport of particles, momentum, and energy from the solar wind to the magnetosphere. This work analyzes the occurrence of Kelvin–Helmholtz instability (KHI) at lunar distance magnetopause, which has not been thoroughly studied currently based on Acceleration, Reconnection, Turbulence, and Electrodynamics of the Moon's Interaction with the Sun satellite observations, and it also investigates the effect of the upstream solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). Statistical results show that (1) the occurrence rate is about 15% of the time at lunar distance, lower than at the flank magnetopause, and (2) the occurrence rate decreases with the magnetoacoustic Mach number, Alfvén Mach number, solar wind velocity, and dynamic pressure but only shows a slightly positive correlation with solar wind density. Unlike at the dayside magnetopause, the occurrence rate of KHI diminishes as the solar wind velocity increases at the lunar distance magnetopause, and (3) the occurrence rate decreases with IMF amplitude and is influenced by IMF orientation. As a function of the IMF clock angle, the occurrence rate reaches its maximum at ∼24% when the clock angle is zero. The statistical results are basically consistent with the currently accepted linear theory of KHI, except for a lower rate for higher-speed solar wind. This work contributes to understanding the excitation and evolution of KHI along the magnetopause and plasma transport process in the tail magnetopause.

<div> Fermi Large Area Telescope, Cyg X-3, γ-ray, orbital modulation, anisotropic Compton scattering<br />
<br />研究团队利用Fermi Large Area Telescope对Cyg X-3的γ射线数据进行建模分析。他们发现该系统的γ射线在高通量时表现出明显的轨道调制特征，这种调制与先前的模型相吻合，可以解释为由喷流中的相对论电子对供体黑体辐射进行非均向康普顿散射所致。然而，他们发现如果喷流与旋转黑洞的自旋轴对齐，将会发生geodetic precession，其周期约为50年，但这一现象在γ和无线电数据中未被观测到。因此，研究团队提出另一种模型，认为喷流的平均方向虽然与轨道对齐，但受到供体恒星风的推力而弯曲，并以轨道周期进行进动。最终的γ射线调制现象则可以解释为自发辐射的多普勒增强效应。尽管该模型也能很好地拟合数据，但拟合的弯曲角却远大于基于当前已知的双星和恒星风参数的理论值。因此，当前的理论模型存在不足之处，需要进一步研究以找到正确的模型。 <br /><br />总结: Fermi Large Area Telescope对Cyg X-3的γ射线数据进行模型分析，发现γ射线表现出轨道调制特征，提出两种模型解释，但存在理论不足，需要进一步研究。 <div>
We model the currently available γ-ray data on Cyg X-3 from the Fermi Large Area Telescope. Thanks to Cyg X-3’s very strong γ-ray activity during 2018–2021, the data quality has significantly improved. We study the strong orbital modulation of the γ-rays observed at high γ-ray fluxes. The modulation, as found earlier, is well modeled by anisotropic Compton scattering of the donor blackbody emission by relativistic electrons in a jet strongly misaligned with respect to the orbital axis. We confirm that this model fits well both the average γ-ray modulation light curve and the spectrum. However, we find that if the jet were aligned with the spin axis of a rotating black hole, it would undergo geodetic precession with a period of ∼50 yr. However, its presence is ruled out by both the γ-ray and radio data. Therefore, we consider an alternative model in which the average jet direction is aligned, but it is bent outside the orbit owing to the thrust of the donor stellar wind, and thus precesses at the orbital period. The γ-ray modulation then appears as a result of the variable Doppler boosting of synchrotron self-Compton jet emission. This model also fits the data well. However, the fitted bending angle is much larger than the theoretical one based on the binary and wind parameters as currently known. Thus, both models disagree with important aspects of our current theoretical understanding of the system. We discuss possible ways to find the correct model.

这项研究报告了来自脉冲星PSR J1849-0001的脉冲星风星云（PWN）G32.64+0.53可能的GeV γ射线发射。研究利用了Fermi大面积望远镜Pass 8约14.7年的数据进行分析。研究发现，源的位置和光谱与X射线和TeV能量段的相匹配，因此我们认为GeV γ射线源表明了PWN G32.64+0.53。我们使用一个基于时间的单区模型解释了宽频谱能量分布（SED），假设目标源的多波段非热发射是通过电子/正电子的同步辐射和反康普顿散射（ICS）产生的。我们的发现表明，该模型在很大程度上阐明了观测到的SED。这些结果支持了γ射线源源自由PSR J1849-0001推动的PWN G32.64+0.53的假设。此外，TeV能带中的γ射线可能是通过星云内的电子/正电子通过ICS产生的。 <div>
In this study, we report the likely GeV γ-ray emissions originating from the pulsar PSR J1849-0001's pulsar wind nebula (PWN) G32.64+0.53. Our analysis covers approximately 14.7 yr of data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope Pass 8. The position of the source and its spectrum matches those in X-ray and TeV energy bands, so we propose that the GeV γ-ray source is indicative of PWN G32.64+0.53. We interpret the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) using a time-dependent one-zone model, which assumes that the multiband nonthermal emission of the target source can be generated by synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton scattering (ICS) of the electrons/positrons. Our findings demonstrate that the model substantially elucidates the observed SED. These results lend support to the hypothesis that the γ-ray source originates from the PWN G32.64+0.53 powered by PSR J1849-0001. Furthermore, the γ-rays in TeV bands are likely generated by electrons/positrons within the nebula through ICS.

We analyze the spectral evolution of 62 bright Fermi gamma-ray bursts with large enough signal-to-noise to allow for time-resolved spectral analysis. We develop a new algorithm to test for single-pulse morphology that is insensitive to the specific shape of pulses. Instead, it only checks whether or not there are multiple, isolated, or statistical significant peaks in the light curve. In addition, we carry out a citizen science test to assess light-curve morphology and spectral evolution. We find that, no matter the adopted assessment method, bursts characterized by single-peaked prompt emission light curves have a greater tendency to also have a consistently decaying peak energy or hard-to-soft spectral evolution. This contrasts with the behavior of multipeaked bursts, for which the tendency is to have a peak frequency that is not monotonically decreasing. We discuss this finding in the theoretical framework of internal/external shocks and find it to be consistent with at least some single-pulse bursts associated with particularly high-density environments.

For none of these objects was IXPE able to detect X-ray polarization at the 3σ level. However, we placed upper limits on the polarization degree at ∼10%–30%. The undetected polarizations favor models where the X-ray band is dominated by unpolarized photons upscattered by relativistic electrons in the jets of blazars, although hadronic models are not completely eliminated. We discuss the X-ray polarization upper limits in the context of our contemporaneous multiwavelength polarization campaigns.

该研究提出了一个用于银河系普通射电脉冲星的人口综合模型，考虑了最新的磁转演化过程。模型考虑了脉冲星的自旋减速、以磁力线为主的磁层和磁场强度及倾角的衰减。通过Markov Chain Monte Carlo技术将模拟的脉冲星人口与大型观测样本进行了拟合，比较了四个主要观测指标的分布。研究测试了两种B场衰减情形，并发现指数模型能更好地拟合观测到的脉冲星分布，暗示脉冲星B场在演化中出现了显著的衰减。 <div>
We present a population synthesis model for normal radio pulsars in the Galaxy incorporating the latest developments in the field and the magnetorotational evolution processes. Our model considers spin-down with a force-free magnetosphere and the decay of the magnetic field strength and its inclination angle. The simulated pulsar population is fit to a large observation sample that covers the majority of radio surveys using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique. We compare the distributions of four major observables—spin period (P), spin-down rate ( ), dispersion measure, and radio flux density—using accurate high-dimensional Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistics. We test two B-field decay scenarios, an exponential model motivated by ohmic dissipation and a power-law model motivated by the Hall effect. The former clearly provides a better fit, and it can successfully reproduce the observed pulsar distributions with a decay timescale of Myr. The result suggests that significant B-field decay in aged pulsars and ohmic dissipation could be the dominant process.

该研究使用TNG50宇宙学模拟中类似于银河系的星系的代表样本，探究了形成星盘的物理过程。研究发现，星盘的形成与恒星球冠的形成密切相关，这与最近的一个理论模型相吻合，该模型认为星盘的形成得到了重力势的促进。此外，研究还表明，星盘的形成与热环绕星系晕的形成有关。研究结果表明，这些过程可能同时发生，并对星盘的生长起着重要作用。总结：该研究发现星盘形成与恒星球冠形成，热环绕星系晕的形成等过程同时发生，并可能会对星盘的生长起着重要作用。 <div>
Using a representative sample of Milky Way (MW)–like galaxies from the TNG50 cosmological simulation, we investigate physical processes driving the formation of galactic disks. A disk forms as a result of the interplay between inflow and outflow carrying angular momentum in and out of the galaxy. Interestingly, the inflow and outflow have remarkably similar distributions of angular momentum, suggesting an exchange of angular momentum and/or outflow recycling, leading to continuous feeding of prealigned material from the corotating circumgalactic medium. We show that the disk formation in TNG50 is correlated with stellar bulge formation, in qualitative agreement with a recent theoretical model of disk formation facilitated by steep gravitational potentials. Disk formation is also correlated with the formation of a hot circumgalactic halo with around half of the inflow occurring at subsonic and transonic velocities corresponding to Mach numbers of ≲2. In the context of recent theoretical works connecting disk settling and hot halo formation, our results imply that the subsonic part of the inflow may settle into a disk while the remaining supersonic inflow will perturb this disk via the chaotic cold accretion. We find that disks tend to form when the host halos become more massive than ∼(1–2) × 1011M⊙, consistent with previous theoretical findings and observational estimates of the predisk protogalaxy remnant in the MW. Our results do not prove that either corotating outflow recycling, gravitational potential steepening, or hot halo formation cause disk formation, but they show that all these processes occur concurrently and may play an important role in disk growth.

<div> 关键词: NGC 330, Be stars, rotational velocity, emission lines, Magellan Telescope
总结:
NGC 330是一个年龄约40百万年的S型小麦哲伦云球状星团，通过对30颗恒星的高分辨率光谱分析，发现存在Be星，并且它们主要分布在分裂主序列的冷侧。这些目标星的自转速度测量结果表明，星团内存在两种类型的恒星：一类是自转速度快的Be星，另一类是温度较高、自转速度较慢的恒星。大多数目标的Hα发射线显示出Hδ光球吸收线的核心发射。样本中所计算的外壳参数显示，大多数观测恒星的倾角应低于75°。这些结果不仅确认了光度法探测到的Be星，还揭示了一些目标存在狭窄的Hα和Hδ特征，这些特征无法通过低分辨率光谱或光度法检测到。另外，观测还发现Hα线轮廓的不对称变化，这可能提供了关于分离盘几何形状的信息。观测还显示，一些暗弱目标存在星云Hα发射，强度足以影响光谱提取和用于评估Hα发射的窄带光度法。<br /><br /> <div>
We present an analysis of high-resolution optical spectra recorded for 30 stars of the split extended main-sequence turnoff of the young (∼40 Myr) Small Magellanic Cloud globular cluster NGC 330. Spectra were obtained with the Michigan/Magellan Fiber System and Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle spectrographs located on the Magellan-Clay 6.5 m telescope. These spectra revealed the presence of Be stars, occupying primarily the cool side of the split main sequence. Rotational velocity ( ) measurements for most of the targets are consistent with the presence of two populations of stars in the cluster: one made up of rapidly rotating Be stars ( km s−1) and the other consisting of warmer stars with slower rotation ( km s−1). Core emission in the Hδ photospheric lines was observed for most of the Hα emitters. The shell parameter computed for the targets in our sample indicates that most of the observed stars should have inclinations below 75°. These results confirm the detection of Be stars obtained through photometry but also reveal the presence of narrow Hα and Hδ features for some targets that cannot be detected with low-resolution spectroscopy or photometry. Asymmetry variability of Hα line profiles on the timescales of a few years is also observed and could provide information on the geometry of the decretion disks. Observations revealed the presence of nebular Hα emission, strong enough in faint targets to compromise the extraction of spectra and to impact narrow-band photometry used to assess the presence of Hα emission.

<div> M dwarf stars, K dwarf stars, habitable climates, observational advantages, planetary habitability
<br /><br />总结:
该篇文章研究了M和K矮星系中类地行星可能存在的气候和可居住性，发现K矮星行星具有更稳定的恒星环境，可能在“眼球”气候中发现湿润的日侧气候。同时，M和K矮星系中陆地行星都可能存在“边缘居住性”，但在M矮星系中更为普遍。这些发现有助于未来在M和K矮星系中寻找适合生命的行星。 <div>
M and K dwarf stars make up 86% of the stellar population and host many promising astronomical targets for detecting habitable climates in the near future. Of the two, M dwarfs currently offer greater observational advantages and are home to many of the most exciting observational discoveries in the last decade. But K dwarfs could offer even better prospects for detecting habitability by combining the advantages of a relatively dim stellar flux with a more stable stellar environment. Here we explore the climate regimes that are possible on Earth-like synchronous planets in M and K dwarf systems, and how they vary across the habitable zone. We focus on surface temperature patterns, water availability, and implications for habitability. We find that the risk of nightside cold trapping decreases with increased orbital radius and is overall lower for K dwarf planets. With reduced atmospheric shortwave absorption, K dwarf planets have higher dayside precipitation rates and less day-to-night moisture transport, resulting in lower nightside snow rates. These results imply a higher likelihood of detecting a planet with a moist dayside climate in a habitable “eyeball” climate regime orbiting a K dwarf star. We also show that “terminator habitability” can occur for both M and K dwarf land planets, but would likely be more prevalent in M dwarf systems. Planets in a terminator habitability regime tend to have slightly lower fractional habitability, but offer alternative advantages including instellation rates more comparable to Earth in regions that have temperatures amenable to life.

使用来自Gaia第三次数据释放的星星样本，研究了银河系的逃逸速度剖面，推断了银河系黑暗物质晕的性质，并得出了银河系的总质量。研究结果表明，银河系的总质量较低，但与其他最近的估计相吻合。 <div>
The escape velocity profile of the Milky Way offers a crucial and independent measurement of its underlying mass distribution and dark matter (DM) properties. Using a sample of stars from the third data release of Gaia with 6D kinematics and strict quality cuts, we obtain an escape velocity profile of the Milky Way from 4 to 11 kpc in Galactocentric radius. To infer the escape velocity in radial bins, we model the tail of the stellar speed distribution with both traditional power-law models and a new functional form that we introduce. While power-law models tend to rely on extrapolation to high speeds, we find our new functional form gives the most faithful representation of the observed distribution. Using this for the escape velocity profile, we constrain the properties of the Milky Way’s DM halo modeled as a Navarro–Frenck–White profile. Combined with constraints from the circular velocity at the solar position, we obtain a concentration and mass of and . This corresponds to a total Milky Way mass of , which is on the low end of the historic range of the galaxy’s mass, but in line with other recent estimates.

总结:
本研究探讨了中子俘获元素对星球化学相似性的影响，发现考虑中子俘获元素后，对于铁丰度在-0.1<[Fe/H]<0.1范围内的恒星，其化学相似率从约2.2％降低到0.4％，几乎减少了6倍。化学相似性与年龄和动力学相似性相关，但包括中子俘获元素似乎不会选择更相似于这些特征的恒星。这表明中子俘获元素包含与轻元素不同的信息，在银河丰度空间中至少增加了一个维度。这项工作强调了在对恒星进行化学表征时考虑中子俘获元素的重要性，并激励了改进光谱调查中的原子数据和测量的持续工作。 <div>
The observed chemical diversity of Milky Way stars places important constraints on Galactic chemical evolution and the mixing processes that operate within the interstellar medium. Recent works have found that the chemical diversity of disk stars is low. For example, the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) “chemical doppelganger rate,” or the rate at which random pairs of field stars appear as chemically similar as stars born together, is high, and the chemical distributions of APOGEE stars in some Galactic populations are well-described by two-dimensional models. However, limited attention has been paid to the heavy elements (Z > 30) in this context. In this work, we probe the potential for neutron-capture elements to enhance the chemical diversity of stars by determining their effect on the chemical doppelganger rate. We measure the doppelganger rate in GALactic Archaeology with HERMES DR3, with abundances rederived using The Cannon, and find that considering the neutron-capture elements decreases the doppelganger rate from ∼2.2% to 0.4%, nearly a factor of 6, for stars with −0.1 < [Fe/H] < 0.1. While chemical similarity correlates with similarity in age and dynamics, including neutron-capture elements does not appear to select stars that are more similar in these characteristics. Our results highlight that the neutron-capture elements contain information that is distinct from that of the lighter elements and thus add at least one dimension to Milky Way abundance space. This work illustrates the importance of considering the neutron-capture elements when chemically characterizing stars and motivates ongoing work to improve their atomic data and measurements in spectroscopic surveys.

总结: 
本研究使用逆向问题分析测量的行程时间, 推断太阳经度环流的内部轮廓, 并应用了一个HK21型约束，该约束要求经度环流输运的角动量应该朝赤道方向。结果显示，如果HK21制约约束正确描述太阳对流区内的物理机制，那么经度环流的轮廓是一个双细胞结构。推断得到的双细胞结构与不使用HK21型约束获得的单细胞结构相比，可以更或多或少地解释数据。然而，我们发现增加HK21型约束会降低平均核函数的分辨率。尽管目前很难确定太阳经度环流的大尺度形态，但我们的尝试突出了从理论和观测两方面研究太阳经度环流轮廓的相关性。 <br /><br /> <div>
We have carried out inversions of travel times as measured by Gizon et al. to infer the internal profile of the solar meridional circulation (MC). A linear inverse problem has been solved by the regularized least-squares method with a constraint that the angular momentum (AM) transport by MC should be equatorward (HK21-type constraint). Our motivation for using this constraint is based on the result by Hotta & Kusano (hereafter HK21), where the solar equator-fast rotation was reproduced successfully without any manipulation. The inversion result indicates that the MC profile is a double-cell structure if the so-called HK21 regime, in which AM transported by MC sustains the equator-fast rotation, correctly describes the physics inside the solar convective zone. The sum of the squared residuals computed with the inferred double-cell MC profile is comparable to that computed with the single-cell MC profile obtained when we exclude the HK21-type constraint, showing that both profiles can explain the data more or less at the same level. However, we also find that adding the HK21-type constraint degrades the resolution of the averaging kernels. Although it is difficult for us to determine the large-scale morphology of the solar MC at the moment, our attempt highlights the relevance of investigating the solar MC profile from both theoretical and observational perspectives.

We simulate galaxy properties and redshift estimation for SPHEREx, the next NASA Medium Class Explorer. To make robust models of the galaxy population and test the spectrophotometric redshift performance for SPHEREx, we develop a set of synthetic spectral energy distributions based on detailed fits to COSMOS2020 photometry spanning 0.1–8 μm. Given that SPHEREx obtains low-resolution spectra, emission lines will be important for some fraction of galaxies. Here, we expand on previous work, using better photometry and photometric redshifts from COSMOS2020 and tight empirical relations to predict robust emission-line strengths and ratios. A second galaxy catalog derived from the GAMA survey is generated to ensure the bright (mAB < 18 in the i band) sample is representative over larger areas. Using template fitting to estimate photometric continuum redshifts, we forecast the recovery of 19 million galaxies over 30,000 deg2 with redshifts better than σz < 0.003(1 + z), 445 million with σz < 0.1(1 + z), and 810 million with σz < 0.2(1 + z). We also find through idealized tests that emission-line information from spectrally dithered flux measurements can yield redshifts with accuracy beyond that implied by the naive SPHEREx channel resolution, motivating the development of a hybrid continuum–line redshift estimation approach.

We present a new suite of numerical simulations of the star-forming interstellar medium (ISM) in galactic disks using the TIGRESS-NCR framework. Distinctive aspects of our simulation suite are (1) sophisticated and comprehensive numerical treatments of essential physical processes including magnetohydrodynamics, self-gravity, and galactic differential rotation, as well as photochemistry, cooling, and heating coupled with direct ray-tracing UV radiation transfer and resolved supernova feedback and (2) wide parameter coverage including the variation in metallicity over , gas surface density Σgas ∼ 5–150 M⊙ pc−2, and stellar surface density Σstar ∼ 1–50 M⊙ pc−2. The range of emergent star formation rate surface density is ΣSFR ∼ 10−4–0.5 M⊙ kpc−2 yr−1, and ISM total midplane pressure is Ptot/kB = 103–106 cm−3 K, with Ptot equal to the ISM weight . For given Σgas and Σstar, we find . We provide an interpretation based on the pressure-regulated feedback-modulated (PRFM) star formation theory. The total midplane pressure consists of thermal, turbulent, and magnetic stresses. We characterize feedback modulation in terms of the yield ϒ, defined as the ratio of each stress to ΣSFR. The thermal feedback yield varies sensitively with both weight and metallicity as , while the combined turbulent and magnetic feedback yield shows weaker dependence . The reduction in ΣSFR at low metallicity is due mainly to enhanced thermal feedback yield, resulting from reduced attenuation of UV radiation. With the metallicity-dependent calibrations we provide, PRFM theory can be used for a new subgrid star formation prescription in cosmological simulations where the ISM is unresolved.

该研究利用Planck探测器提供的极化尘埃图和中性氢(CNM)分数的大面积图，研究了高纬度天空中极化尘埃分数(p353)与CNM分数(fCNM)之间的关系。他们发现p353与fCNM的相关性与p353和H i柱密度（NH i）关系有所不同。在低柱密度区域（NH i < 4 × 1020 cm−2）中，p353和NH i不相关，但p353与fCNM之间存在强烈的正相关性。通过数据驱动模型，作者得出了p353–fCNM相关性的拟合，以约束沿视线方向中介质的磁场失序程度。他们认为，相较于CNM，暖中性介质(WNM)中磁场的更大失序能最好解释了p353–fCNM的正相关性。模型进一步表明，与CNM相关的尘埃柱被认为是最大程度地极化，极化分数pCNM约为0.2，然后他们发现WNM相关的尘埃柱的平均极化分数为0.22pCNM。该研究结果为星际介质中中性相之间磁场相对失序程度提供了新的大面积约束，并与一个更具磁场排列的CNM柱形成于WNM杂乱的物理图景一致。

Utilizing Planck polarized dust emission maps at 353 GHz and large-area maps of the neutral hydrogen (H i) cold neutral medium (CNM) fraction (fCNM), we investigate the relationship between dust polarization fraction (p353) and fCNM in the diffuse high latitude ( ) sky. We find that the correlation between p353 and fCNM is qualitatively distinct from the p353–H i column density (NH i) relationship. At low column densities (NH i < 4 × 1020 cm−2) where p353 and NH i are uncorrelated, there is a strong positive p353–fCNM correlation. We fit the p353–fCNM correlation with data-driven models to constrain the degree of magnetic field disorder between phases along the line of sight. We argue that an increased magnetic field disorder in the warm neutral medium (WNM) relative to the CNM best explains the positive p353–fCNM correlation in diffuse regions. Modeling the CNM-associated dust column as being maximally polarized, with a polarization fraction pCNM ∼ 0.2, we find that the best-fit mean polarization fraction in the WNM-associated dust column is 0.22pCNM. The model further suggests that a significant fCNM-correlated fraction of the non-CNM column (an additional 18.4% of the H i mass on average) is also more magnetically ordered, and we speculate that the additional column is associated with the unstable medium. Our results constitute a new large-area constraint on the average relative disorder of magnetic fields between the neutral phases of the interstellar medium, and are consistent with the physical picture of a more magnetically aligned CNM column forming out of a disordered WNM.

引力波探测黑洞双星系统的轨道离心率是区分可能的双星起源的关键特征之一。然而，由于黑洞质量和离心率范围内偏心引力波波形的有限可用性，迄今为止检测轨道离心率一直很困难。本研究使用TEOBResumS-DALI、TEOBResumS-GIOTTO和TEOBResumSP模型评估了LIGO和Virgo天文台探测到的五次黑洞并合事件的离心率。该分析研究了参考频率为5赫兹时高达0.6的离心率，并结合了对高度偏心轨道的引力波发射至关重要的高阶引力波模式。由于先前对某些事件的轨道离心率存在微弱迹象，或者由于它们不寻常的质量和自旋，因此选择了这些双星系统。虽然其他研究发现了对某些事件轨道离心率的微弱证据，但我们的分析不支持将离心率纳入与准圆情况相比。尽管缺乏其他分析的偏心证据，但发现当允许离心率不为零时，我们的分析在多个事件的多个参数后验中略微改变了后验。 <div>
The detection of orbital eccentricity for a binary black hole system via gravitational waves is a key signature to distinguish between the possible binary origins. The identification of eccentricity has been difficult so far due to the limited availability of eccentric gravitational waveforms over the full range of black hole masses and eccentricities. Here we evaluate the eccentricity of five black hole mergers detected by the LIGO and Virgo observatories using the TEOBResumS-DALI, TEOBResumS-GIOTTO, and TEOBResumSP models. This analysis studies eccentricities up to 0.6 at the reference frequency of 5 Hz and incorporates higher-order gravitational-wave modes critical to model emission from highly eccentric orbits. The binaries have been selected due to previous hints of eccentricity or due to their unusual mass and spin. While other studies found marginal evidence for eccentricity for some of these events, our analyses do not favor the incorporation of eccentricity compared to the quasi-circular case. While lacking the eccentric evidence of other analyses, we find our analyses marginally shifts the posterior in multiple parameters for several events when allowing eccentricity to be nonzero.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We describe a method for calculating action-angle (AA) variables in axisymmetric galactic potentials using Birkhoff normalization, a technique from Hamiltonian perturbation theory. An advantageous feature of this method is that it yields explicit series expressions for both the forward and inverse transformations between the AA variables and position–velocity data. It also provides explicit expressions for the Hamiltonian and dynamical frequencies as functions of the action variables. We test this method by examining orbits in a Milky Way model potential and compare it to the popular Stäckel approximation method. When vertical actions are not too large, the Birkhoff normalization method achieves fractional errors smaller than a part in 103 and outperforms the Stäckel approximation. We also show that the range over which Birkhoff normalization provides accurate results can be extended by constructing Padé approximants from the perturbative series expressions developed with the method. Numerical routines in Python for carrying out the Birkhoff normalization procedure are made available.

By using surface brightness maps of Tycho’s supernova remnant (SNR) in radio and X-rays, along with the properties of thermal and synchrotron emission, we have derived the postshock density and magnetic field (MF) strength distributions over the projection of this remnant. Our analysis reveals a density gradient oriented toward the northwest, while the MF strength gradient aligns with the Galactic plane, pointing eastward. Additionally, utilizing this MF map, we have derived the spatial distributions of the cutoff frequency and maximum energy of electrons in Tycho’s SNR. We further comment on the implications of these findings for interpreting the gamma-ray emission from Tycho’s SNR.

Galaxy number counts probe the evolution of galaxies over cosmic time and serve as a valuable comparison point to theoretical models of galaxy formation. We present new galaxy number counts in eight photometric bands between 5 and 25 μm from the Systematic Mid-infrared Instrument Legacy Extragalactic Survey and the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey deep MIRI parallel, extending to unprecedented depth. By combining our new MIRI counts with existing data from Spitzer and AKARI, we achieve counts across 3–5 orders of magnitude in flux in all MIRI bands. Our counts diverge from predictions from recent semianalytical models of galaxy formation, likely due to their treatment of mid-IR aromatic features. Finally, we integrate our combined JWST−Spitzer counts at 8 and 24 μm to measure the cosmic infrared background (CIB) light at these wavelengths; our measured CIB fluxes are consistent with those from previous mid-IR surveys but larger than predicted by models based on TeV blazar data.

<title>In-field Phasing at the Upgraded GMRT</title>

In time-domain radio astronomy with arrays, voltages from individual antennas are added together with proper delay and fringe correction to form the beam in real time. In order to achieve the correct phased addition of antenna voltages, one has to also correct for the ionospheric and instrumental gains. Conventionally this is done using observations of a calibrator source located near to the target field. This scheme is suboptimal since it does not correct for the variation of the gains with time and position in the sky. Further, since the ionospheric phase variation is typically most rapid at the longest baselines, the most distant antennas are often excluded while forming the beam. We present here a different methodology (“in-field phasing”), in which the gains are obtained in real-time using a model of the intensity distribution in the target field, which overcomes all of these drawbacks. We present observations with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) which demonstrates that in-field phasing does lead to a significant improvement in sensitivity. We also show, using observations of the millisecond pulsar J1120−3618 that this in turn leads to a significant improvement of measurements of the Dispersion Measure and Time of Arrival. Finally, we present test observations of the GMRT discovered eclipsing black widow pulsar J1544+4937 showing that in-field phasing leads to improvement in the measurement of the cut-off frequency of the eclipse.

<title>Apparently Ultralong Period Radio Signals from Self-lensed Pulsar–Black Hole Binaries</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Pulsar–black hole (BH) close binary systems, which have not been found yet, are unique laboratories for testing theories of gravity and understanding the formation channels of gravitational-wave sources. We study the self-gravitational lensing effect in a pulsar–BH system on the pulsar’s emission. Because this effect occurs once per orbital period for almost edge-on binaries, we find that it could generate apparently ultralong period (minutes to hours) radio signals when the intrinsic pulsar signal is too weak to detect. Each of such lensed signals, or “pulse,” is composed of a number of amplified intrinsic pulsar pulses. We estimate that a radio telescope with a sensitivity of 10 mJy could detect a few systems that emit such signals in our Galaxy. The model is applied to three recently found puzzling long-period radio sources: GLEAM-X J1627, PSR J0901-4046, and GPM J1839-10. To explain their observed signal durations and periods, the masses of their lensing components are estimated as ∼104M⊙, ∼4 M⊙, and 103−6M⊙, respectively, with their binary coalescence times ranging from a few tens to thousands of years. However, the implied merger rates (as high as ∼103−4 Myr−1 per galaxy) and the large period decay rates (>10−8 s s−1) tend to disfavor this self-lensing scenario for these three sources. Despite this, our work still provides observational characteristics for self-lensed pulsar–BH binaries, which could help the detection of related sources in the future. Finally, for a binary containing a millisecond pulsar and a stellar-mass BH, the Shapiro delay effect would cause a ≥10% variation of the profile width for the subpulses in such lensed signals.

<title>RRAT J1913+1330: An Extremely Variable and Puzzling Pulsar</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Rotating radio transients (RRATs) are neutron stars that emit sporadic radio bursts. We detected 1955 single pulses from RRAT J1913+1330 using the 19 beam receiver of the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope. These pulses were detected in 19 distinct clusters, with 49.4% of them occurring with a waiting time of one rotation period. The energy distribution of these individual pulses exhibited a wide range, spanning 3 orders of magnitude, reminiscent of repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs). Furthermore, we observed abrupt variations in pulse profile, width, peak flux, and fluence between adjacent sequential pulses. These findings suggest that this RRAT could be interpreted as a pulsar with extreme pulse-to-pulse modulation. The presence of sequential pulse trains during active phases, along with significant pulse variations in profile, fluence, flux, and width, should be intrinsic to a subset of RRATs. Our results indicate that J1913+1330 represents a peculiar source that shares certain properties with populations of nulling pulsars, giant pulses, and FRBs from different perspectives. The dramatic pulse-to-pulse variation observed in J1913+1330 could be attributed to unstable pair creation above the polar cap region and the variation of the site where streaming pairs emit coherently. Exploring a larger sample of RRATs exhibiting similar properties to J1913+1330 has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of pulsars, RRATs, and FRBs.

<title>The Dzhanibekov Effect as a Possible Source of Magnetar Activity</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Magnetars, which are neutron stars with strong magnetic fields, exhibit occasional bursting activities. The shape of a magnetar is not perfectly spherical due to the Lorentz force exerted by its strong magnetic fields and is described as a triaxial body. We study the unstable free precession in a triaxial magnetar; one of the principal axes undergoes an upside-down flip. This flip is known as the Dzhanibekov effect. We find that during the flip, the Euler force can suddenly disturb the force balance on the surface layer of the magnetar, potentially leading to plastic flow of the layer. This, in turn, may trigger different forms of magnetar activity, such as the emission of the bursts and/or of gravitational waves.

<title>On the (Higher Multipoles) Variance Asymmetry in the Cosmic Microwave Background</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We have studied the cosmic microwave background (CMB) map looking for features beyond cosmological isotropy. We began by tiling the CMB variance maps (which are produced by different smoothing scales) with stripes of different sizes along the most prominent dipole direction. We were able to confirm previous findings regarding the significance of the dipole. Furthermore, we discovered that some of the higher multipoles exhibit significance comparable to the dipole that naturally depends on the smoothing scales. In the end, we discussed this result having an eye on the look-elsewhere-effect. We believe our results may indicate an anomalous patch in the CMB sky that warrants further investigation.

It is common for surveys that are designed to find artificial signals generated by distant civilizations to focus on galactic sources. Recently, researchers have started focusing on searching for all other sources within the field observed, including the vast population of background galaxies. Toward a population of galaxies in the background toward the Vela supernova remnant, we search for technosignatures, spectral and temporal features consistent with our understanding of technology. We set transmitter power limits for the detection of signals in a population of over 1300 galaxies within a single field of view observed with the Murchison Widefield Array.

<title>A Search for Soft X-Ray Emission Lines in the Afterglow Spectrum of GRB 221009A</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
GRB 221009A was the brightest gamma-ray burst (GRB) of all time (BOAT), surpassing in prompt brightness all GRBs discovered in ∼50 yr and in afterglow brightness in ∼20 yr. We observed the BOAT with XMM-Newton 2.3 days after the prompt. The X-ray afterglow was still very bright and we collected the largest number of photons with the reflection grating spectrometers (RGSs) on a GRB. We searched the RGS data for narrow emission or absorption features. We did not detect any bright line feature. A candidate narrow feature is identified at a (rest-frame) energy of keV, consistent with an Mg xiiKα emission line, slightly redshifted (0.012) with respect to the host galaxy. We assessed a marginal statistical significance of 3.0σ for this faint feature based on conservative Monte Carlo simulations, which requires caution for any physical interpretation. If this line feature would be for real, we propose that it might originate from the reflection in the innermost regions of the infalling funnel from low-level late-time activity emission of the central engine.

<div> NGC 5128, Cen A, elliptical galaxy, star formation, LPV stars
<br />
NGC 5128 (Cen A)是最近的巨型椭圆星系，是天空中最明亮的星系之一，具有明显的尘埃带和从其核心超大质量黑洞散发出的喷流。研究者构建了NGC 5128晕的两个小区域的恒星形成历史（SFH）：一个在东北方向（Field 1），距离中心约18.8千秒差距；另一个在南部（Field 2），距离中心约9.9千秒差距。他们基于长周期变星（LPV）的方法来追踪并重建恒星的形成历史，发现Field 1中有395颗LPV星，Field 2中有671颗LPV星。尽管这两个区域在距离中心28千秒差距的相反方向，它们显示出类似的SFH。在Field 1中，恒星形成率（SFR）在t∼800百万年和t∼3.8亿年左右显著增加，而在Field 2中，SFR在t∼800百万年，t∼3.8亿年和t∼6.3亿年左右明显增加。LPV星重建的SFH支持了多次核活动导致周期性的喷流引发的恒星形成的情景。这项方法的应用使我们能够限制NGC 5128这颗关键星系的复杂演化，这是首次在超出本地星系群的星系中进行此类研究。 
<br /><br />总结: NGC 5128是最近的巨型椭圆星系，通过LPV星的研究揭示了其恒星形成历史，显示出多次核活动导致的喷流引发的周期性恒星形成，支持了在800百万年前发生星系合并的假设。这是对星系演化复杂性的重要突破。 <div>
NGC 5128 (Cen A) is the nearest giant elliptical galaxy and one of the brightest extragalactic radio sources in the sky, boasting a prominent dust lane and jets emanating from its nuclear supermassive black hole. In this paper, we construct the star formation history (SFH) of two small fields in the halo of NGC 5128: a northeastern field (Field 1) at a projected distance of ∼18.8 kpc from the center, and a southern field (Field 2) ∼9.9 kpc from the center. Our method is based on identifying long-period variable (LPV) stars that trace their sibling stellar population and hence historical star formation due to their high luminosity and strong variability; we identified 395 LPV stars in Field 1 and 671 LPV stars in Field 2. Even though the two fields are ∼28 kpc apart on opposite sides from the center, they show similar SFHs. In Field 1, the star formation rate (SFR) increased significantly around t ∼ 800 Myr and t ∼ 3.8 Gyr and in Field 2, the SFR increased considerably around t ∼ 800 Myr, t ∼ 3.8 Gyr, and t ∼ 6.3 Gyr, where t is the lookback time. The increase in SFR ∼800 Myr ago agrees with previous suggestions that the galaxy experienced a merger around that time. The SFH reconstructed from LPV stars supports a scenario in which multiple episodes of nuclear activity lead to episodic jet-induced star formation. While there is no catalog of LPV stars for the central part of NGC 5128, applying our method to the outer regions (for the first time in a galaxy outside the Local Group) has enabled us to put constraints on the complex evolution of this cornerstone galaxy.

<div> 关键词: 太阳，差动旋转，机器学习算法，太阳活动，太阳观测<br />
总结:<br />
研究使用改进的机器学习算法对太阳观测数据进行分析，发现太阳差动旋转对太阳活动有关键影响。研究跟踪了超过321,440个日冕明亮点（CBPs），计算了它们的赤道和纬向速度，并确定它们出现在距离光球约5627公里的高度。通过追踪CBPs，在Fe xii（193 Å）辐射形成高度得到了太阳日冕的旋转图。发现赤道旋转速度和纬向旋转梯度与太阳活动（太阳黑子和耀斑）略微相关。研究还发现太阳北半球的差动旋转比南半球更加显著，而且纬向旋转梯度的不对称性与太阳黑子数在9年的太阳活动周期中有一定的一致性。水平雷诺应力的变化也显示出它对太阳活动有所指示，特别是负水平雷诺应力（向太阳赤道的动量传输）在2012年和2014年的高活动期间为-2500m2 s−2，在2019年的低活动期间为-100m2 s−2。 <div>
Differential rotation plays a crucial role in the dynamics of the Sun. We study the solar rotation and its correlation with solar activity by applying a modified machine learning algorithm to identify and track coronal bright points (CBPs) from the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly observations at 193 Å during cycle 24. For more than 321,440 CBPs, the sidereal and meridional velocities are computed. We find the occurring height of CBPs to be about 5627 km above the photosphere. We obtain a rotational map for the corona by tracking CBPs at the formation height of Fe xii (193 Å) emissions. The equatorial rotation (14.°40 to 14.°54 day−1) and latitudinal gradient of rotation (−3.°0 to −2.°64 day−1) show very slightly positive and negative trends with solar activity (sunspots and flares), respectively. For cycle 24, our investigations show that the northern hemisphere has more differential rotation than the southern hemisphere, confirmed by the asymmetry of the midlatitude rotation parameter. The asymmetry (ranked) of the latitudinal gradient of the rotation parameter is concordant with the sunspot numbers for 7 yr within the 9 yr of the cycle; however, for only 3 yr, it is concordant with the flare index. The minimum horizontal Reynolds stress changes from about −2500 m2 s−2 (corresponding to high activity) in 2012 and 2014 to −100 m2 s−2 (corresponding to low activity) in 2019 over 5° to 35° latitudes within cycle 24. We conclude that the negative horizontal Reynolds stress (momentum transfer toward the Sun’s equator) is a helpful indication of solar activity.

<div> HPAHs, interstellar space, IR action spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations, H2 formation
<br /><br />总结:
本研究对超氢化多环芳烃（HPAHs）进行了气相红外（IR）光谱研究，特别关注了4,5,9,10-四氢吡啶（THP; C16H14）。实验结果表明，在碰撞诱导解离的过程中，分子氢（H2）是THP阳离子的主要碎片，与通常认为的碳骨架碎裂截然不同。该研究还通过计算IR光谱和分子动力学模拟确定了HPAH碎片的分子结构及其分解途径。这些发现表明，HPAHs的降对称性和双或三脂肪基团能够改变它们的稳定性和碎裂模式，从而导致其在星际介质中可能对H2的形成产生影响。 <div>
While polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are now accepted to be abundant in interstellar space, the abundance and influence of superhydrogenated PAHs (HPAHs) in the interstellar medium (ISM) are still under investigation. HPAHs may act as catalysts for or reactants in small-molecule formation via hydrogen abstraction reactions, H2 evaporation, and carbon skeleton fragmentation. Here, we present a gas-phase infrared (IR) action spectroscopy study of the HPAH 4, 5, 9, 10-tetrahydropyrene (THP; C16H14), performed at the Free Electron Lasers for Infrared eXperiments facility. IR action spectroscopy was performed on the THP cation, protonated THP, and their fragments produced by collision-induced dissociation in the range from 600 to 1800 cm−1. Calculated IR spectra, at the density functional theory level, agree with experimental IR spectra to a high degree and were utilized to determine molecular structures of the HPAH fragments. Molecular dynamics simulations compared with experimental mass spectra reveal favorable HPAH fragmentation pathways. Molecular hydrogen (H2) is observed to be a primary fragment of [THP+H]+ with superhydrogenated duo groups. This contrasts the notion that HPAHs typically undergo carbon skeleton fragmentation leading to CxHy formation. These observations show that lowered symmetry and duo or trio aliphatic groups on HPAHs uniquely change their IR spectra, stability, and fragmentation patterns. As a result, these species may contribute to H2 formation in the ISM.

To improve our understanding of orbital instabilities in compact planetary systems, we compare suites of N-body simulations against numerical integrations of simplified dynamical models. We show that, surprisingly, dynamical models that account for small sets of resonant interactions between the planets can accurately recover N-body instability times. This points toward a simple physical picture in which a handful of three-body resonances, generated by interactions between nearby two-body mean motion resonances, overlap and drive chaotic diffusion, leading to instability. Motivated by this, we show that instability times are well described by a power law relating instability time to planet separations, measured in units of fractional semimajor axis difference divided by the planet-to-star mass ratio to the 1/4 power, rather than the frequently adopted 1/3 power implied by measuring separations in units of mutual Hill radii. For idealized systems, the parameters of this power-law relationship depend only on the ratio of the planets’ orbital eccentricities to the orbit-crossing value, and we report an empirical fit to enable quick instability time predictions. This relationship predicts that observed systems comprised of three or more sub-Neptune-mass planets must be spaced with period ratios and that tightly spaced systems ( ) must possess very low eccentricities (e ≲ 0.05) to be stable for more than 109 orbits.

After receiving an X-ray photon, an X-ray detector is not operational for a duration known as deadtime. It is detector specific and its effect on the data depends upon the luminosity of the source. It reduces the observed photon count rate in comparison to the expected one. In periodic sources such as the Crab pulsar, it can distort the folded light curve (FLC). An undistorted FLC of the Crab pulsar is required in combination with its polarization properties for studying its X-ray emission mechanism. This work derives a simple formula for the distortion of the FLC of a pulsar caused by the detector deadtime, and validates it using Crab pulsar data from the X-ray observatories Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer and Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array, which have very small and relatively large detector deadtimes respectively. Then it derives a method for correcting the distorted FLC of the Crab pulsar in Imaging X-ray Polarimeter Explorer data, which have intermediate detector deadtime. The formula is verified after addressing several technical issues. This work ends with a discussion of why an undistorted FLC is important for studying the formation of cusps in the FLC of the Crab pulsar.

总结:<br />WISPR是PSP任务上的一种成像仪器，可以从前所未有的视角观测到黄道尘云产生的亮度。该研究利用PSP在10到16轨道期间的科学观测，对ZL的位置和亮度演变进行了深入研究。WISPR-O观测角度独特，揭示了行星的引力扭曲了ZDC的对称平面，并导致ZL亮度的东西不对称性。此外，分析结果还首次一致观测到了在约25 R☉处由于尘埃颗粒升华而产生的环绕太阳的尘埃增强。总体来说，PSP平台上的WISPR观测正在打开黄道尘云遥感的新窗口。 <div>
The Wide-Field Imager for Solar Probe (WISPR) on the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) mission maps the brightness produced by the zodiacal dust cloud (ZDC) from an historically unprecedented viewpoint. The brightness results from the scattering of photospheric light by dust particles in the ZDC, and is called zodiacal light (ZL). We exploit the PSP nominal science encounters in orbits 10 through 16 for an in-depth study of the location and brightness evolution of the symmetry axis of the ZL in images taken with the WISPR outer telescope (WISPR-O). During these 11 day encounters, PSP covered heliocentric distances between 0.25 and 0.0617 au (∼53.78−13.28 R☉) and ∼255° in helioecliptic longitude from within the orbital plane of Venus. The unique WISPR-O viewpoint, which comprises line-of-sight elongations of 80° ± 27°, has led to further insights about the ZDC. Namely, we find that the gravitational pull of the planets warps the ZDC symmetry plane and shifts the ZDC towards the solar system barycenter, creating an east–west asymmetry in the ZL brightness. Additionally, our analysis provides the first consistent observational evidence of a circumsolar dust enhancement resulting from the sublimation of dust grains at ∼25 R☉. Overall, the WISPR observations from the PSP platform are opening a new window in the remote sensing of the ZDC.

这篇文章研究了Vela超星系团的性质，包括VC04、VC02和VC08三个星系团的Ks-band光度函数。研究发现了VC04的Schechter参数，并证实其为一个富集但尚未完全松弛的星系团。通过红序法确定了VC04的LF，并证明了这种方法可以在星系团缺乏高光谱覆盖的情况下使用。同时也确定了VC02和VC08的LF。将Coma、Norma和Virgo星系团的LF与VSCL星系团进行对比，发现它们的Schechter参数在1σ范围内相似，表明不同星系团环境的LF没有显著差异。总结: 这篇文章研究了Vela超星系团的性质，包括其富集程度、光度函数和环境对LF的影响。研究结果为我们了解星系团的形成和演化提供了重要的参考。 <div>
To learn more about the properties of the Vela Supercluster (VSCL), located behind the Milky Way at cz ∼ 18,000 km s−1, we determine the Ks-band luminosity function (LF) of VC04, the richest known galaxy cluster in the VSCL, and two other VSCL clusters (VC02 and VC08). The galaxy sample is based on NIR observations that are complete to an extinction-corrected absolute magnitude of (∼2.ͫ5 below ), within the clustercentric radius of rc < 1.5 Mpc (∼70% of the Abell radius). For VC04, we obtained 90 new spectroscopic redshifts of galaxies, observed with the 11 m Southern African Large Telescope. We found the Schechter parameters of the VC04 LF to be M* = −24.ͫ41 ± 0.44, α = −1.10 ± 0.20, and ϕ* = 8.84 ± 0.20. Both the redshift data and the LF confirm VC04 to be a rich but not yet fully relaxed cluster. We independently determined the LF of VC04 on membership defined by the red-sequence method and demonstrated that this method can be used in the absence of high spectroscopic coverage over a cluster. This allowed us to determine the LFs of VC02 and VC08. We also derived the LFs of the Coma, Norma, and Virgo clusters to similar depth and extent as the VSCL clusters. We found that the Schechter parameters of VC04 are within 1σ uncertainties of these local clusters, as well as VC02 and VC08. We do not find significant differences between the LFs in the different cluster environments probed in this work down to .

Electromagnetic follow-up observations of gravitational wave events offer critical insights and provide significant scientific gain from this new class of astrophysical transients. Accurate identification of gravitational wave candidates and rapid release of sky localization information are crucial for the success of these electromagnetic follow-up observations. However, searches for gravitational wave candidates in real time suffer from a nonnegligible false alarm rate. By leveraging the sky localization information and other metadata associated with gravitational wave candidates, GWSkyNet, a machine-learning classifier developed by Cabero et al., demonstrated promising accuracy for the identification of the origin of event candidates. We improve the performance of the classifier for LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA's (LVK) fourth observing run by reviewing and updating the architecture and features used as inputs by the algorithm. We also retrain and fine-tune the classifier with data from the third observing run. To improve the prospect of electromagnetic follow-up observations, we incorporate GWSkyNet into LVK's low-latency infrastructure as an automatic pipeline for the evaluation of gravitational wave alerts in real time. We test the readiness of the algorithm on an LVK mock data challenge campaign. The results show that by thresholding on the GWSkyNet score, noise masquerading as astrophysical sources can be rejected efficiently and the majority of true astrophysical signals can be correctly identified.

脉冲星定时阵列（PTAs）旨在检测低频引力波（GWs）。GWs在PTA数据中引起无色散信号，意味着定时延迟不依赖于射电频率。然而，脉冲到达时间也受到射频相关的“色散噪声”的影响。为了更好地理解这种影响，我们评估了不同色散噪声模型如何影响每颗脉冲星的无色散噪声特性。我们发现色散噪声模型的选择明显影响了几颗脉冲星的无色散噪声特性。此外，我们还比较了每颗脉冲星的噪声特性与EPTA DR2推断的噪声特性之间的差异，并识别了可以改进噪声模型的潜在领域。这些结果突显了定制的色散噪声模型提高PTA对GWs的灵敏度的潜力。<br /><br />总结: 该研究评估了不同色散噪声模型对PTA数据的影响，发现其明显影响了脉冲星的无色散噪声特性，尤其是PSR J1713+0747。同时，与EPTA DR2推断的噪声特性存在差异，为改进噪声模型提供了方向。这表明了定制的色散噪声模型可以提高PTA对GWs的探测灵敏度。 <div>
Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are designed to detect low-frequency gravitational waves (GWs). GWs induce achromatic signals in PTA data, meaning that the timing delays do not depend on radio frequency. However, pulse arrival times are also affected by radio-frequency-dependent “chromatic” noise from sources such as dispersion measure (DM) and scattering delay variations. Furthermore, the characterization of GW signals may be influenced by the choice of chromatic noise model for each pulsar. To better understand this effect, we assess if and how different chromatic noise models affect the achromatic noise properties in each pulsar. The models we compare include existing DM models used by the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational waves (NANOGrav) and noise models used for the European PTA Data Release 2 (EPTA DR2). We perform this comparison using a subsample of six pulsars from the NANOGrav 15 yr data set, selecting the same six pulsars as from the EPTA DR2 six-pulsar data set. We find that the choice of chromatic noise model noticeably affects the achromatic noise properties of several pulsars. This is most dramatic for PSR J1713+0747, where the amplitude of its achromatic red noise lowers from to , and the spectral index broadens from to . We also compare each pulsar's noise properties with those inferred from the EPTA DR2, using the same models. From the discrepancies, we identify potential areas where the noise models could be improved. These results highlight the potential for custom chromatic noise models to improve PTA sensitivity to GWs.

1. 本研究利用太阳探测器和太阳轨道飞行器的数据，展示了高能X射线成像在太阳活动爆发事件中的重要性。<br />
2. 文章指出，在缺乏高频极紫外成像的情况下，高频HXR成像对于理解太阳活动爆发结构的演变至关重要。<br />
3. 研究通过STIX提供的高频成像数据，揭示了这次爆发事件的能量释放特征、粒子加速时机和加速效率的演变。<br />

5. 该研究结果表明，高频HXR成像光谱学对于理解强烈且与太空天气相关的喷发现象至关重要。 <br /> <div>
Hard X-ray (HXR) observations are crucial for understanding the initiation and evolution of solar eruptive events, as they provide a key signature of flare-accelerated electrons and heated plasma. The potential of high-cadence HXR imaging for deciphering the erupting structure, however, has not received adequate attention in an era of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) imaging abundance. An extreme solar eruptive event on 2022 September 5 observed on the solar far side by both Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter provides the opportunity to showcase the power of HXR imaging in the absence of high-cadence EUV imaging. We investigate the evolution of flare energy release through HXR timing, imaging, and spectral analyses using data from the Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) on board Solar Orbiter. STIX provides the highest cadence imaging of the energy release sites for this far-side event and offers crucial insight into the nature of energy release, timing of flare particle acceleration, and evolution of the acceleration efficiency. We find that this is a two-phase eruptive event, rather than two distinct eruptions, as has been previously suggested. The eruption begins with an initial peak in flare emission on one side of the active region (AR), marking the rise/destabilization of a loop system followed by notable episodes of energy release across the AR and an eruptive phase associated with a very fast coronal mass ejection, type III radio bursts, and solar energetic particles. We demonstrate that high-cadence HXR imaging spectroscopy is indispensable for understanding the formation of powerful, space-weather relevant eruptions.

<div> Transformer, deep learning, astronomical images, deconvolution, denoising

总结:<br /><br /> 本文介绍了Transformer架构在深度学习领域的应用，重点是在天文图像处理中进行去卷积和去噪。实验结果表明，采用深度学习模型后，能够显著恢复光度、结构和形态信息。与James Webb Space Telescope图像相比，修复后的Hubble Space Telescope图像在等光度测量、Sérsic指数和半光半径方面的散射减少了4.4、3.6和4.7倍，皮尔逊相关系数接近于1。然而，在输入图像存在相关噪声、点状源、以及伪影的情况下，性能表现会下降。预计这一深度学习模型将在精密光度测量、形态分析和剪切校准等科学应用中发挥重要作用。 <div>
The Transformer architecture has revolutionized the field of deep learning over the past several years in diverse areas, including natural language processing, code generation, image recognition, and time-series forecasting. We propose to apply Zamir et al.'s efficient transformer to perform deconvolution and denoising to enhance astronomical images. We conducted experiments using pairs of high-quality images and their degraded versions, and our deep learning model demonstrates exceptional restoration of photometric, structural, and morphological information. When compared with the ground-truth James Webb Space Telescope images, the enhanced versions of our Hubble Space Telescope–quality images reduce the scatter of isophotal photometry, Sérsic index, and half-light radius by factors of 4.4, 3.6, and 4.7, respectively, with Pearson correlation coefficients approaching unity. The performance is observed to degrade when input images exhibit correlated noise, point-like sources, and artifacts. We anticipate that this deep learning model will prove valuable for a number of scientific applications, including precision photometry, morphological analysis, and shear calibration.

总结:<br /><br />
研究NGC 1068的高能中微子信号提供了研究超大质量黑洞中非热过程的机会。使用IceCube和最新的Fermi-LAT数据，研究人员提出了有关宇宙射线能量和中微子发射区域尺寸的一般性多信使约束。结果表明，在光子带电子场景中，所需的宇宙射线能量应大于Eddington光度的1%–10%，发射半径应在低β等离子体中小于15RS，在高β等离子体中小于3RS。而在电子场景中，所需的γ射线光度远大于Eddington光度，超出了NuSTAR或Fermi-LAT数据。而在β衰变场景中，不仅在能量上违反要求，而且在γ射线约束方面也不成立。这些结果几乎是无偏见的，支持了磁场驱动冠层中的强子机制，排除了电子和β衰变场景。 <div>
The detection of high-energy neutrino signals from the nearby Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068 provides us with an opportunity to study nonthermal processes near the center of supermassive black holes. Using the IceCube and latest Fermi-LAT data, we present general multimessenger constraints on the energetics of cosmic rays and the size of neutrino emission regions. In the photohadronic scenario, the required cosmic-ray luminosity should be larger than ∼1%−10% of the Eddington luminosity and the emission radius should be ≲15RS in low-β plasma and ≲3RS in high-β plasma. The leptonic scenario overshoots the NuSTAR or Fermi-LAT data for any emission radii we consider, and the required gamma-ray luminosity is much larger than the Eddington luminosity. The beta-decay scenario also violates not only the energetics requirement but also gamma-ray constraints, especially when the Bethe–Heitler and photomeson production processes are consistently considered. Our results rule out the leptonic and beta-decay scenarios in a nearly model-independent manner and support hadronic mechanisms in magnetically powered coronae if NGC 1068 is a source of high-energy neutrinos.

JWST observations have recently begun delivering the first samples of Lyα velocity profile measurements at z > 6, opening a new window into the reionization process. Interpretation of z ≳ 6 line profiles is currently stunted by limitations in our knowledge of the intrinsic Lyα profile (before encountering the intergalactic medium (IGM)) of the galaxies that are common at z ≳ 6. To overcome this shortcoming, we have obtained resolved (R ∼ 3900) Lyα spectroscopy of 42 galaxies at z = 2.1–3.4 with similar properties as are seen at z > 6. We quantify a variety of Lyα profile statistics as a function of [O iii]+Hβ equivalent width (EW). Our spectra reveal a new population of z ≃ 2–3 galaxies with large [O iii]+Hβ EWs (>1200 Å) and a large fraction of Lyα flux emerging near the systemic redshift (peak velocity ≃0 km s−1). These spectra indicate that low-density neutral hydrogen channels are able to form in a subset of low-mass galaxies (≲1 × 108M⊙) that experience a burst of star formation (sSFR > 100 Gyr−1). Other extreme [O iii] emitters show weaker Lyα that is shifted to higher velocities (≃240 km s−1) with little emission near the line center. We investigate the impact the IGM is likely to have on these intrinsic line profiles in the reionization era, finding that the centrally peaked Lyα emitters should be strongly attenuated at z ≳ 5. We show that these line profiles are particularly sensitive to the impact of resonant scattering from infalling IGM and can be strongly attenuated even when the IGM is highly ionized at z ≃ 5. We compare these expectations against a new database of z ≳ 6.5 galaxies with robust velocity profiles measured with JWST/NIRSpec.

In this article, we explore the dynamics of accretion structures encircling spherically symmetric black holes, comparing three accretion disk models with distinct angular momentum profiles: (i) the geometrically thin Keplerian disk, (ii) the Fishbone–Moncrief torus; and (iii) the Polish Doughnut. Employing general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations with the High Accuracy Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamics code, we investigate these three models, considering the magnetic field’s influence on the accretion disk angular momentum redistribution. We show that the magnetic field is a key factor in accretion disk structures, especially in regions with lower mass density. Our investigation verifies the well-established fact that the presence of a magnetic field significantly influences the accretion rate and its temporal variability.

总结: 
太阳黑子周期对地球附近太阳风的来源和特性产生重要影响。研究利用改进的“两步”映射程序追踪了1999年至2020年的太阳风，覆盖了太阳黑子周期23和24。结果发现，在太阳黑子周期23期间，日冕洞和活动区生成的太阳风比例较高，而静谧太阳生成的太阳风比例较低。在太阳黑子周期23的太阳极大期和衰减期，所有三种太阳风的磁场强度、速度、氦丰度和电荷状态普遍高于太阳黑子周期24。在太阳黑子周期的极小期，这些参数普遍低于太阳黑子周期24。太阳黑子周期23的太阳风的电荷状态在极小期有显著下降。这些统计结果表明，太阳黑子周期振幅影响着太阳风的来源和特性。活动区、静谧太阳和日冕洞区的温度在低高度有显著差异，而在高高度几乎是均匀的。 <div>
The dependence of the sources and properties of the near-Earth solar wind on solar cycle activity is an important issue in solar and space physics. We use the improved “two-step” mapping procedure that takes into account the initial acceleration processes to trace the near-Earth solar winds back to their source regions from 1999–2020, covering solar cycles (SCs) 23 and 24. Then, the solar wind is categorized into coronal hole (CH), active region (AR), and quiet Sun (QS) solar wind based on the source region type. We find that the proportions of CH and AR (QS) wind during SC 23 are higher (lower) than those during SC 24. During solar maximum and declining phases, the magnetic field strength, speed, helium abundance (AHe), and charge states of all three types of solar wind during SC 23 are generally higher than those during SC 24. During solar minimum, these parameters of solar wind are generally lower during SC 23 than those during SC 24. There is a significant decrease in the charge states of all three types of solar wind during the solar minimum of SC 23. The present statistical results demonstrate that the sources and properties of the solar wind are both influenced by solar cycle amplitude. The temperatures of AR, QS, and CH regions exhibit significant differences at low altitudes, whereas they are almost uniform at high altitudes.

总结:<br />
该研究总结了1996年至2023年间510个行星际日冕物质抛射（ICME）事件的数据集，并训练了一个径向基函数支持向量机（RBF-SVM）模型，以研究ICME的地磁效应及其对观测在1天文单位处的太阳风条件的依赖性。模型展示了在特定扰动风暴时间阈值下对地磁风暴强度的分类、评估ICME的地磁效应方面的高性能。模型的输出使用了精度、召回率、F1分数和真实技能统计（TSS）进行评估，并通过分层k折交叉验证进行了鲁棒性检验。在-50 nT阈值下，该模型实现了分别为0.84和0.93的精度，0.94和0.82的召回率，以及相应的0.89和0.87的F1分数，总体准确率为0.88，TSS为0.76。尽管在-100 nT阈值处存在数据集不平衡和样本有限的挑战，但该模型仍然保持了0.87的总体准确率，TSS为0.69，表明了该模型有效处理不平衡数据的能力。通过SHapley Additive exPlanations（SHAP）值分析，模型解释获得了物理见解，指出了南向磁场分量在触发地磁风暴中的作用，以及冲击-ICME组合在加剧这些风暴中的关键影响。使用SVM模型和SHAP值分析的有效应用提供了一种理解和预测ICME地磁效应的方法，并突显了相对简单的机器学习模型在预测空间天气并揭示潜在物理机制方面的能力。 <div>
In this study, we compiled a data set of 510 interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICME) events from 1996–2023 and trained a radial basis function support vector machine (RBF-SVM) model to investigate the geoeffectiveness of ICMEs and its dependence on the solar wind conditions observed at 1 au. The model demonstrates high performance in classifying geomagnetic storm intensities at specific Disturbance Storm Time thresholds and evaluating the geoeffectiveness of ICMEs. The model’s output was assessed using precision, recall, F1 score, and true skill statistics (TSS), complemented by stratified k-folds cross-validation for robustness. At the −50 nT threshold, the model achieves precisions of 0.84 and 0.93, recalls of 0.94 and 0.82, and corresponding F1 scores of 0.89 and 0.87 for the categories separated by this threshold, respectively. Overall accuracy is noted at 0.88, with a TSS of 0.76. Despite challenges at the −100 nT threshold due to data set imbalance and limited samples, the model maintains an overall accuracy of 0.87, with a TSS of 0.69, demonstrating the model’s ability to effectively handle imbalanced data. Physical insights were gained through model explanation with a SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) value analysis, pinpointing the role of the southward magnetic field component in triggering geomagnetic storms, as well as the critical impact of shock-ICME combinations in intensifying these storms. The effective application of an SVM model with SHAP value analysis offers a way to understand and predict the geoeffectiveness of ICMEs. It also underscores the capability of a relatively simple machine learning model in predicting space weather and revealing the underlying physical mechanisms.

关键词: 热尘埃遮蔽的星系、类星体、红移、合并、过密环境

- 热尘埃遮蔽的星系是一类超亮、极度遮蔽的类星体，通过广域红外测量被探测到。
- 研究通过大型望远镜寻找Lyα发射体（LAEs），发现W2246-0526的领域中存在着比空白领域更多的LAEs，这表明这个最遥远的热DOGs处于Mpc尺度上的过密环境中。
- 热DOGs的增长可能是由星系合并所驱动，这项研究结果与热DOGs的合并起源相关。 <div>
Hot dust-obscured galaxies (hot DOGs) are a population of hyperluminous, heavily obscured quasars discovered by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer all-sky survey at high redshift. Observations suggested the growth of these galaxies may be driven by mergers. Previous environmental studies have statistically shown hot DOGs may reside in dense regions. Here we use the Very Large Telescope narrowband and broadband imaging to search for Lyα emitters (LAEs) in the field of the hot DOG W2246−0526 at z = 4.6. W2246−0526 is the most distant hot DOG. We find that there is an overdensity of LAEs in the W2246−0526 field compared with the blank fields. This is direct evidence that this most distant hot DOG is in an overdense environment on the Mpc scale, and the result relates to the merger origin of hot DOGs.

本文报道了M3球状星团内5颗脉冲星的相位连接定时解决方案，发现M3E和F具有低质量伴星，并处于分别为7.1和3.0天的圆形轨道上。未在所有41次观测中检测到M3C的信号，未在Chandra图像中发现这些脉冲星的X射线对应物。从M3A和M3B的动态谱的自相关函数分析中，发现了强烈的闪烁现象，散射介质是各向异性的。从次级谱中，只捕捉到M3B的一个弯曲度为649±23 m^-1 mHz^-2的闪烁弧。 <div>
We present the phase-connected timing solutions of all five pulsars in globular cluster M3 (NGC 5272), namely PSRs M3A to F (PSRs J1342+2822A to F), with the exception of PSR M3C, from FAST archival data. In these timing solutions, those of PSRs M3E and F are obtained for the first time. We find that PSRs M3E and F have low-mass companions and are in circular orbits with periods of 7.1 and 3.0 days, respectively. For PSR M3C, we have not detected its signal in all 41 observations. We found no X-ray counterparts for these pulsars in archival Chandra images in the band of 0.2–20 keV. From the autocorrelation function analysis of M3A and M3B’s dynamic spectra, the scintillation timescale ranges from 7.0 ± 0.3 to 60.0 ± 0.6 minutes, and the scintillation bandwidth ranges from 4.6 ± 0.2 to 57.1 ± 1.1 MHz. The measured scintillation bandwidths from the dynamic spectra indicate strong scintillation, and the scattering medium is anisotropic. From the secondary spectra, we captured a scintillation arc only for PSR M3B with a curvature of 649 ± 23 m−1 mHz−2.

<div> 关键词: 多波长观测, 星系团, 活动星系核, 射流, 冷丝

总结:
多波长观测表明，一些星系团中的介质包含冷丝，但其形成机制尚存争议。作者利用流体动力学模拟表明，冷丝可能自然凝结出热气体射流所产生的气泡所带起的热气体尾流之中。模拟结果与观测一致，显示冷丝可延伸到星系团中心几十千帕秒之远，质量典型为10^8–10^9太阳质量，与典型活动星系核输出能量10^60爱尔格相符。冷丝具有平滑的速度梯度，从内部流入到外部流出，速度分散约数百公里/秒。冷丝的性质对射流特性有显著影响。与动能占主导的射流相比，热能占主导的射流更容易产生质量大、延伸较长的冷丝。射流早期启动、低基础速度或非常高功率的AGN射流往往会使星系团中心过热，并产生需要相对较长时间才能凝结出的短冷丝。 <div>
Multiwavelength observations indicate that the intracluster medium in some galaxy clusters contains cold filaments, while their formation mechanism remains debated. Using hydrodynamic simulations, we show that cold filaments could naturally condense out of the hot gaseous wake flows uplifted by jet-inflated active galactic nucleus (AGN) bubbles. Consistent with observations, the simulated filaments extend to tens of kiloparsecs from the cluster center, with a representative mass of 108–109M⊙ for a typical AGN outburst energy of 1060 erg. They show smooth velocity gradients, stretching typically from inner inflows to outer outflows with velocity dispersions of several hundred kilometers per second. The properties of cold filaments are affected substantially by the jet properties. Compared to kinetic-energy-dominated jets, it is easier for thermal-energy-dominated jets to produce long cold filaments with large masses, as observed. AGN jets with an early turn-on time, a low jet base, or a very high power tend to overheat the cluster center and produce short cold filaments that take a relatively long time to condense out.

<div> AGNs, jet cores, edge brightening, Lorentz factor, Monte Carlo simulations
<br /><br />总结:
AGN中的喷流核心呈现出边缘增亮的结构，这种现象可以通过喷流洛伦兹因子的角度依赖性来解释。喷流沿着其轴线具有较高的洛伦兹因子，沿着极角呈幂律下降。这导致观测者在喷流轴线附近看到较低的光学深度，而在较外部区域观测者看到较高的光学深度。通过蒙特卡洛模拟得到的分析和数值结果证实了边缘增亮现象。这项研究为通过观测到的喷流核心确定喷流结构和相关参数提供了独特的工具。这项研究为未来探索具有结构化洛伦兹因子的光学厚核心的谱特性铺平了道路。 <div>
The jet cores in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are resolved and found to harbor an edge-brightened structure where the jet base appears extended at the sides compared to its propagation axis. This peculiar phenomenon invites various explanations. We show that the photosphere of an optically thick jet base in AGNs is observed edge brightened if the jet Lorentz factor harbors an angular dependence. The jet assumes a higher Lorentz factor along the jet axis and decreases following a power law along its polar angle. For an observer near the jet axis, the jet has a lower optical depth along its propagation axis compared to off-axis regions. Higher optical depth at the outer region makes the jet photosphere appear to extend to larger radii compared to a deeper photosphere along its propagation axis. We tackle the problem both analytically and numerically, confirming the edge brightening through Monte Carlo simulations. Other than the edge brightening, the outcomes are significant as they provide a unique tool to determine the jet structure and associated parameters by their resolved observed cores. The study paves the way to explore the spectral properties of optically thick cores with structured Lorentz factors in the future.

总结: 本研究利用印度乌代浦太阳天文台的观测数据，对太阳光球和光球-色球界面区域的低频（ν < 5.0 mHz）声波的相位移和相位传播时间进行了估计和讨论。结果表明，在绝对视向磁场小于10 G的区域内，低频声波在光球和光球-色球界面区域均表现出非消散性特征，而且相位传播时间显示出非零值。此外，观测还揭示了高频声波向下传播的现象，表明它们在太阳大气的高层发生了折射。这些发现有助于深入了解太阳大气不同层次内声波的复杂动力学，揭示了声波的非消散性和向下传播特性。<br /><br /> <div>
We report and discuss the phase shift and phase travel time of low-frequency (ν < 5.0 mHz) acoustic waves estimated within the photosphere and photosphere–chromosphere interface regions, utilizing multiheight velocities in the quiet Sun. The bisector method has been employed to estimate seven height velocities in the photosphere within the Fe i 6173 Å line scan, while nine height velocities are estimated from the chromospheric Ca ii 8542 Å line scan observations obtained from the narrowband imager instrument installed on the Multi-Application Solar Telescope operational at the Udaipur Solar Observatory, India. Utilizing a fast Fourier transform at each pixel over the full field of view, phase shift and coherence have been estimated. The frequency and height-dependent phase shift integrated over the regions having an absolute line-of-sight magnetic field of less than 10 G indicates the nonevanescent nature of low-frequency acoustic waves within the photosphere and photosphere–chromosphere interface regions. Phase travel time estimated within the photosphere shows nonzero values, aligning with previous simulations and observations. Further, we report that the nonevanescent nature persists beyond the photosphere, encompassing the photospheric–chromospheric height range. We discuss possible factors contributing to the nonevanescent nature of low-frequency acoustic waves. Additionally, our observations reveal a downward propagation of high-frequency acoustic waves indicating refraction from higher layers in the solar atmosphere. This study contributes valuable insights into the understanding of the complex dynamics of acoustic waves within different lower solar atmospheric layers, shedding light on the nonevanescent nature and downward propagation of the acoustic waves.

<div> 磁环弯曲环流对横波和振荡的影响，磁环弯曲环流的Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH)不稳定性，流速对FSW+和FSW-频率的影响，磁环横波的极化特性，柯朗物理现象观测案例
<br /><br />总结:
本研究分析了磁环弯曲环流对横波和振荡的影响。在模型中发现，在准垂直传播极限下，模型支持两种快速表面模式：一个频率较高的模式（FSW+）和一个频率较低的模式（FSW-）。弱流速时，随着流速增加，FSW+（FSW-）的频率在传播和准驻波区域都会增加（减少）。我们展示了FSW+和FSW-受Kelvin-Helmholtz（KH）不稳定性的影响，并且对于FSW+（FSW-），临界流速大于（小于）内阿尔文速度。流体流动的存在导致了基本谐波与第一次超音波谐波的周期比P1/2P2小于（大于）1的情况，该影响在直线波导限制下退化。亚阿尔文流动可以阻止丝状模式的共振吸收，当FSW+和FSW-的频率脱离阿尔文连续的范围时。同时还表明，在静态情况和弱流动情况下，FSW+（FSW-）可解释为垂直（水平）极化的扭曲模式，而对于中等流动，两种模式都具有倾斜极化。我们将所开发的理论应用于解释具有虹吸流和沿环形磁结构引发的KH不稳定性爆发喷流的皇冠环中扭曲振荡的观测情况。 <div>
The effect of plasma flow in curved arcade loops on transverse waves and oscillations is examined analytically. The model under study is a semicircular magnetic slab with finite transverse extensions and a mass flow inside, in the zero-β plasma approximation. It is found that in the quasi-perpendicular propagation limit, the model supports two fast surface modes: one with higher (FSW+) and another with lower (FSW−) frequency. For a weak flow, the frequency of the FSW+ (FSW−) increases (decreases) as the flow speed grows in both propagating and quasi-standing wave regimes. We show that the FSW+ and FSW− are subjected to the Kelvin–Helmholtz (KH) instability, and the threshold flow is greater (less than) the internal Alfvén speed for the FSW+ (FSW−). The presence of plasma flow results in modifying the period ratio P1/2P2 of the fundamental harmonic to the first overtone with P1/2P2 less (more) than 1 for the FSW+ (FSW−), and this effect degenerates in the straight waveguide limit. The sub-Alfvénic flow can prohibit resonant absorption of kink modes when the frequencies of the FSW+ and FSW− become out of the Alfvén continuum. It is also shown that in the static case and for a weak flow case, the FSW+ (FSW−) is interpreted as a vertically (horizontally) polarized kink mode, while for moderate flow, both modes have oblique polarization. We apply the developed theory to interpret the observational cases of kink oscillations in coronal loops with signatures of a siphon flow and the onset of KH instability induced by the blowout jet along a loop-shaped magnetic structure.

本研究重点关注Al2O的光化学反应，在VY-CMa恒星中揭示AlO和Al的产生机制。通过先进的理论方法，探索了Al2O的最低电子态，发现在近紫外-可见光区域Al2O具有低概率的光解和光转化，可能会发生荧光和磷光现象。计算结果还发现UV区域有三个显著的峰值。最终预测Al2O是光稳定的，不可能是二元AlO的母分子，也不是原子铝的天体化学库。这些结果有助于改进模拟星际介质中铝化学反应的天文模型。 <div>
The chemistry within the interstellar medium (ISM) is notably influenced by the interplay between kinetics and photochemical processes, which play significant roles in both the formation and destruction of molecular species. This study focuses on theoretical investigations of Al2O photochemistry, aiming to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the production of AlO and Al in the VY-CMa star. Utilizing advanced theoretical methodologies, we explore the lowest electronic states with singlet and triplet spin multiplicities in linear Al2O. We investigated the photostability of Al2O in the near UV‒Vis region, revealing the low likelihood of photodissociation and photoconversion while suggesting the plausibility of fluorescence and phosphorescence phenomena. Calculations also identify three prominent peaks in the UV range at 261.5, 206.2, and 199 nm. Finally, Al2O is predicted to be photostable and cannot be the parent molecule of the diatomic AlO or even the astrochemical reservoir of atomic aluminum. These results contribute to improving the astronomical models in simulating aluminum chemistry in the ISM.

<div> CVs, cyclical period changes, third-body hypothesis, mass loss, magnetic activity
<br /><br />总结:
这篇文章报告了对爆发变星（CVs）的周期性变化进行统计研究的结果。研究假设第三体假说是导致周期变化的原因，估算了21个CVs的第三体质量m3和其与二元系统的分离距离a3。推断的a3值与二元轨道周期Porb无关，而m3值随着Porb增加一个数量级，从最短周期（最老）到最长周期（最年轻）的系统中，意味着第三体的显著质量损失。三体系统的时间演化模型无法同时解释观测到的m3(Porb)和a3(Porb)分布的行为，因为从二元系统和第三体的联合质量损失要求随着二元系统朝着更短的Porb发展，轨道分离增加约140倍，与观测到的分布明显不符。我们得出结论，第三体假说在统计上不一致，不能用来解释CVs中观察到的周期性变化。另一方面，周期变化振幅图与太阳型捐赠者恒星的磁活动所致的候选假说以及CVs的标准演化情景是一致的。 <div>
We report the results of a statistical study of cyclical period changes in cataclysmic variables (CVs). Assuming the third-body hypothesis as the cause of period changes, we estimate the third-body mass, m3, and its separation from the binary, a3, for 21 CVs showing cyclical period changes from well-sampled observed-minus-calculated diagrams covering more than a decade of observations. The inferred a3 values are independent of the binary orbital period, Porb, whereas the m3 values increase with Porb by 1 order of magnitude from the shortest period (oldest) to the longest period (youngest) systems, implying significant mass loss from the third body with time. A model for the time evolution of the triple system is not able to simultaneously explain the observed behavior of the m3(Porb) and a3(Porb) distributions because the combined mass loss from the binary and the third body demands an increase in orbital separation by factors ∼140 as the binary evolves toward shorter Porb's, in clear disagreement with the observed distribution. We conclude that the third-body hypothesis is statistically inconsistent and cannot be used to explain cyclical period changes observed in CVs. On the other hand, the diagram of the amplitude of the period change versus the CV donor-star mass is consistent both with the alternative hypothesis that the observed cyclical period changes are a consequence of magnetic activity in the solar-type donor star, and with the standard evolutionary scenario for CVs.

这篇文章讨论了新发现的H2CNCN分子的高放热形成路径，揭示了反应物和产物之间稳定中间体和深度潜伏的过渡态，以及CN-作为催化剂在HNCN和CN-之间进行了两步机制的探讨。文中报道了高度精确的量子化学光谱数据，用于指导这些分子的实验和观测搜索，这些分子大多数被在无线电中探测到，但现在可能通过JWST进行探测。 <div>
New highly exothermic formation pathways incorporating both thermodynamic and kinetic control for the newly astronomically detected H2CNCN molecule are paired with extremely accurate quantum chemical rovibrational spectroscopic computations. The reactions between astronomically known CH2CN/CH2CCH + HNCN follow effectively identical pathways and proceed through stable intermediates and over deeply submerged transition states to form H2CNCN and HCN/HCCH coproducts. Similarly, the reaction between CH2CN and NCN− can also form H2CNCN, although this pathway first requires the initial formation of NCN−, which is currently undetected in space, via HNCN + CN−. This two-step mechanism uses the highly abundant CN− as the catalyst. Incredibly accurate quantum chemical spectroscopic data are reported for all reactants and products of these reactions, with errors between experimental values and the computations herein on the order of 0.1% or less. Anharmonic vibrational frequencies and intensities are also reported in order to guide experimental and observational searches for these molecules that have mostly been detected in the radio but may now be detectable via JWST.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了活动星系核的吸积盘是否具有MAD。作者使用了3CRR目录中的35个类星体和14个高激发射电星系的样本，发现它们的X射线辐射与MAD样本相一致。研究结果表明，可能所有的类星体和至少一部分3CRR目录中的高激发射电星系具有MAD。 <div>
Based on the magnetization, an accretion disk with a large-scale magnetic field can be separated into either standard and normal evolution or magnetically arrested disk (MAD), which are difficult to identify from observations. It is still unclear whether all the radio-loud active galactic nuclei (RLAGNs) with a thin disk and strong radio emissions contain a MAD. We investigate this issue by utilizing the 3CRR catalog. We compile a sample of 35 quasars and 14 high-excitation radio galaxies powered by a thin accretion disk. In order to consistently compare with the MAD sample given by Li et al., the optical-UV emissions of our sample are all detected by the Hubble Space Telescope. It is found that the average X-ray luminosity (LX) of our sample is about 5.0 times higher than that of radio-quiet active galactic nuclei with matching optical-UV luminosity (LUV), in general accord with the factor of 4.5 times in MAD sample within the uncertainty. The relationship between radio (5 GHz) and X-ray (2 keV) luminosities in the 3CRR sources is also found to be consistent with the MAD sample. Furthermore, the jet efficiencies of 3CRR sources are consistent with those from the GRMHD simulations of MAD. Therefore, we suggest that probably all the quasars and at least a fraction of high-excitation radio galaxies in the 3CRR catalog, and perhaps all the RLAGNs with strong radio emissions contain a MAD.

Recent observations have confirmed circumplanetary disks (CPDs) embedded in parental protoplanetary disks (PPDs). On the other hand, planetary-mass companions and planetary-mass objects (PMOs) are likely to harbor their own accretion disks. Unlike PPDs, CPDs and other disks around planet analogs are generally too compact to be spatially resolved by current instrumentation. In this study, we generate over 4000 spectral energy distributions of circum-PMO disks (CPMODs) with various host temperature and disk properties, which can be categorized into four prototypes, i.e., full, pretransitional, transitional, and evolved CPMODs. We propose a classification scheme based on their near-to-mid-infrared colors. Using those CPMOD models, we synthesize JWST (NIRCam and MIRI) photometry for F444W, F1000W, and F2550W wide filters. We show that F444W−F1000W and F444−F2550W colors can be applied to distinguish different types of CPMODs, especially for those around hot hosts. Our results indicate that the ongoing and future JWST observations are promising to unveil structures and properties of CPMODs.

总结:
HESS J1809-193是一个未经鉴定的TeV源，最初被认为是一个脉冲星风星云候选者，但最近的研究表明其峰值与一组分子云重叠。该区域被认为是一个潜在的PeVatron候选者，发出的光子能量高达210TeV。研究人员使用HAWC望远镜对该区域进行了系统性的源搜索，并成功解析出一个扩展组分。他们通过时间依赖的轻子模型和轻子-强子模型对该区域的多波段观测进行了建模，并发现两种情景都可以解释观测到的数据。 <div>
HESS J1809-193 is an unidentified TeV source, first detected by the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) collaboration. The emission originates in a source-rich region that includes several supernova remnants (SNRs) and pulsars including SNR G11.1+0.1, SNR G11.0-0.0, and the young radio pulsar PSR J1809-1917. Originally classified as a pulsar wind nebula candidate, recent studies show the peak of the TeV region overlapping with a system of molecular clouds. This resulted in the revision of the original leptonic scenario to look for alternate hadronic scenarios. Marked as a potential PeVatron candidate, this region has been studied extensively by H.E.S.S. due to its emission extending up to several tens of TeV. In this work, we use 2398 days of data from the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) observatory to carry out a systematic source search of the HESS J1809-193 region. We were able to resolve emission detected as an extended component (modelled as a symmetric Gaussian with a 1σ radius of 0.°21) with no clear cutoff at high energies and emitting photons up to 210 TeV. We model the multiwavelength observations for the region around HESS J1809-193 using a time-dependent leptonic model and a lepto-hadronic model. Our model indicates that both scenarios could explain the observed data within the region of HESS J1809-193.

We perform broadband (0.7–100 keV) spectral analysis of five hard state observations of the low-mass black hole X-ray binary GX 339–4 taken by AstroSat during the rising phase of three outbursts from 2019 to 2022. We find that the outburst in 2021 was the only successful/full outburst, while the source was unable to make the transition to the soft state during the other two outbursts in 2019 and 2022. Our spectral analysis employs two different model combinations, requiring two separate Comptonizing regions and their associated reflection components and soft X-ray excess emission. The harder Comptonizing component dominates the overall bolometric luminosity, while the softer one remains relatively weak. Our spectral fits indicate that the disk evolves with the source luminosity, where the inner disk radius decreases with increasing luminosity. However, the disk remains substantially truncated throughout all the observations at the source luminosity of ∼2%–8%× of the Eddington luminosity. We note that our assumption of the soft X-ray excess emission as disk blackbody may not be realistic, and this kind of soft excess may arise due the nonhomogeneity in the disk/corona geometry. Our temporal analysis deriving the power density spectra suggests that the break frequency increases with the source luminosity. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates a consistency between the inner disk radii estimated from the break frequency of the power density spectra and those obtained from the reflection modeling, supporting the truncated disk geometry in the hard state.

We present the timing analysis of 10 archived XMM-Newton observations with an exposure of >40 ks of Markarian 421. Mrk 421 is the brightest high-frequency-peaked BL Lac object emitting in X-rays produced by electrons accelerated in the innermost regions of a relativistic jet pointing toward us. For each observation, we construct averaged X-ray spectra in 0.5–10 keV band, as well as 100 s binned light curves (LCs) in various subbands. During these observations, the source exhibited various intensity states differing by close to an order of magnitude in flux, with the fractional variability amplitude increasing with energy through the X-ray band. Bayesian power spectral density analysis reveals that the X-ray variability can be characterized by a colored noise, with an index ranging from ∼ −1.9 to −3.0. Moreover, both the standard cross-correlation function and cross-spectral methods indicate that the amount of time lags increases with the energy difference between two compared LCs. A time-dependent two-zone jet model is developed to extract physical information from the X-ray emission of Mrk 421. In the model, we assume that the jet emission mostly comprises a quasi-stationary component and a highly variable one. Our results show that the two-zone model can simultaneously provide a satisfactory description for both the X-ray spectra and time lags observed in different epochs, with the model parameters constrained in a fully acceptable interval. We suggest that shocks within the jets may be the primary energy dissipation process responsible for triggering the rapid variability, although magnetic reconnection cannot be excluded.

<div> gravitational wave background, supermassive black hole binary mergers, Pulsar Timing Array, early merger model, James Webb Space Telescope

<br /><br />总结:
2023年，脉冲星定时阵列协作宣布发现了引力波背景，主要归因于超大质量黑洞双星的合并。最近的詹姆斯·韦伯太空望远镜的发现揭示了大量的高红移星系，这意味着在早期时期存在更大质量的超大质量黑洞双星的合并。通过比较早期和标准的“晚期合并”模型，我们发现早期合并模型对单个双星的检测概率明显较低，并预测了第一个可检测到的单源有大概30%的可能是高红移和极大质量的，并且频率变化快速。未来的确认将大大支持早期融合模型，为我们提供关于星系和超大质量黑洞进化的重要见解。 <div>
In 2023, the Pulsar Timing Array Collaborations announced the discovery of a gravitational wave background (GWB), predominantly attributed to supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) mergers. However, the detected GWB is several times stronger than the default value expected from galactic observations at low and moderate redshifts. Recent findings by the James Webb Space Telescope have unveiled a substantial number of massive, high-redshift galaxies, suggesting more massive SMBHB mergers at these early epochs. Motivated by these findings, we propose an “early merger” model that complements the standard merger statistics by incorporating these early, massive galaxies. We compare the early and standard “late merger” models, which assume peak merger rates in the local Universe, and match both merger models to the currently detected GWB. Our analysis shows that the early merger model has a significantly lower detection probability for single binaries and predicts a ∼30% likelihood that the first detectable single source will be highly redshifted and remarkably massive with rapid frequency evolution. In contrast, the late merger model predicts a nearly monochromatic first source at low redshift. The future confirmation of an enhanced population of massive high-redshift galaxies and the detection of fast-evolving binaries would strongly support the early merger model, offering significant insights into the evolution of galaxies and SMBHs.

<div> 关键词: 银河系演化, 大质量星团, 群团环境, 恒星形成, 光谱能量分布拟合

总结:
银河系的演化取决于它们的质量和局部环境，研究环境抑制开始操作的时间和方式仍然是一个挑战。研究高红移区域的工作受限于大质量星团成员，这在灵敏度限制或场景范围小时存在偏见。在这项工作中，我们使用堆叠技术研究了来自WISE巨大和遥远星团调查Ⅱ的10,000多个星团的平均恒星形成历史。我们的分析涵盖了近紫外线到远红外波长的星系过密度，处于0.5 ≲ z ≲ 2.54。我们使用光谱能量分布拟合来测量具有半径在0到1000千秒差距之间的四个环形孔径中的比星形成率（sSFR）。在z≳1.6时，平均sSFR在核心和星团外围的演化与领域内一致。在和之间，核心中的sSFR急剧下降，并且在较低红移时继续相对于领域sSFR下降。我们解释这一变化是环境抑制的影响在z∼1.5时显著增加的证据，转变的短时间跨度表明在这个红移上占主导地位的环境抑制机制具有快速的时间尺度。我们发现迹象表明sSFR可能随着母体暗物质哈洛质量的增加而下降，但需要比信噪比更低的质量示踪器来确认这种关系。 <br /><br /> <div>
The evolution of galaxies depends on their masses and local environments; understanding when and how environmental quenching starts to operate remains a challenge. Furthermore, studies of the high-redshift regime have been limited to massive cluster members, owing to sensitivity limits or small fields of view when the sensitivity is sufficient, intrinsically biasing the picture of cluster evolution. In this work, we use stacking to investigate the average star formation history of more than 10,000 groups and clusters drawn from the Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey 2. Our analysis covers near-ultraviolet to far-infrared wavelengths, for galaxy overdensities at 0.5 ≲ z ≲ 2.54. We employ spectral energy distribution fitting to measure the specific star formation rates (sSFRs) in four annular apertures with radii between 0 and 1000 kpc. At z ≳ 1.6, the average sSFR evolves similarly to the field in both the core and the cluster outskirts. Between and , the sSFR in the core drops sharply, and it continues to fall relative to the field sSFR at lower redshifts. We interpret this change as evidence that the impact of environmental quenching dramatically increases at z ∼ 1.5, with the short time span of the transition suggesting that the environmental quenching mechanism dominant at this redshift operates on a rapid timescale. We find indications that the sSFR may decrease with increasing host halo mass, but lower-scatter mass tracers than the signal-to-noise ratio are needed to confirm this relationship.

总结: 该研究主要通过数值模拟研究了围绕旋转超大质量黑洞的二维辐射、相对论性、磁流体力学吸积流。首先构建了一个初始平衡的磁场嵌入扭转圆环，其内部包含初始磁场。通过比较磁致凝固盘和标准演化状态的研究，发现较高的初始磁场强度会导致磁致凝固盘状态。采用自洽的双温度模型评估了模型的总发光度和能谱。发现总发光度主要由自由电子辐射发光而非同步辐射发光所主导。同时通过功率密度谱分析发现了相似的准周期振荡。最后指出，磁致凝固盘状态适用于顺行和逆行吸积流。 <div>
In our study, we examine a 2D radiation, relativistic, magnetohydrodynamics accretion flow around a spinning supermassive black hole. We begin by setting an initial equilibrium torus around the black hole, with an embedded initial magnetic field inside the torus. The strength of the initial magnetic field is determined by the plasma beta parameter, which is the ratio of the gas pressure to the magnetic pressure. In this paper, we perform a comparative study of the magnetically arrested disc (MAD) and standard and normal evolution (SANE) states. We observe that the MAD state is possible for comparatively high initial magnetic field strength flow. Additionally, we also adopt a self-consistent two-temperature model to evaluate the luminosity and energy spectrum for our model. We observe that the total luminosity is mostly dominated by bremsstrahlung luminosity compared to the synchrotron luminosity due to the presence of a highly dense torus. We also identify similar quasi-periodic oscillations for both MAD and SANE states based on power-density spectrum analysis. Furthermore, our comparative study of the energy spectrum does not reveal any characteristic differences between MAD and SANE states. Last, we note that the MAD state is possible for both prograde and retrograde accretion flow.

Dark energy is believed to be responsible for the acceleration of the Universe. In this paper, we reconstruct the dark energy scalar field potential V(ϕ) using the Hubble parameter H(z) through Gaussian process analysis. Our goal is to investigate dark energy using various H(z) data sets and priors. We find that the selection of the prior and the H(z) data set significantly affects the reconstructed V(ϕ). We compare two models, Power Law and Free Field, to the reconstructed V(ϕ) by computing the reduced chi-square. The results suggest that the models are generally in agreement with the reconstructed potential within a 3σ confidence interval, except in the case of Observational H(z) data with the Planck 18 prior. Additionally, we simulate H(z) data to measure the effect of increasing the number of data points on the accuracy of reconstructed V(ϕ). We find that doubling the number of H(z) data points can improve the accuracy rate of reconstructed V(ϕ) by 5%–30%.

The polarization of the cosmic microwave background is rich in information but obscured by foreground emission from the Milky Way’s interstellar medium (ISM). To uncover relationships between the underlying turbulent ISM and the foreground power spectra, we simulated a suite of driven, magnetized, turbulent models of the ISM, varying the fluid properties via the sonic Mach number, , and magnetic (Alfvén) Mach number, . We measure the power spectra of density (ρ), velocity (v), magnetic field (H), total projected intensity (T), parity-even polarization (E), and parity-odd polarization (B). We find that the slopes of all six quantities increase with . Most increase with , while the magnetic field spectrum steepens with . By comparing spectral slopes of E and B to those measured by Planck, we infer typical values of and for the ISM. As the fluid velocity increases, , the ratio of BB power to EE power increases to approach a constant value near the Planck-observed value of ∼0.5, regardless of the magnetic field strength. We also examine correlation coefficients between projected quantities, and find that rTE ≈ 0.3, in agreement with Planck, for appropriate combinations of and . Finally, we consider parity-violating correlations rTB and rEB.

<br /><br />总结:
本研究探讨了关于盘状星系的URC，并使用来自PROBES-I、PROBES-II和MaNGA数据库的大量空间分辨旋转曲线（RCs），配合DESI-LIS和Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer调查的多色面亮度剖面。研究发现常见的URC公式无法以足够的准确度预测RC的形状和幅度。他们开发了用于预测更高准确度的URC的神经网络（NN）等价物，表明URC的不准确性并非是由于不足的数据，而是非最佳的表述或采样效应。最新的URC处方及其在对称RCs的579个盘状星系子样本上训练得到的NN等效物表现与在完整数据样本上训练得到的URC/NN相似。他们得出结论，具有所有半径上可接受水平准确度（ΔVcirc ≲ 15%）的URC将需要详细建模星系的中心区域和外围（例如，对导致暗物质晕受到收缩或膨胀的重子效应）。 <div>
The universal rotation curve (URC) of disk galaxies was originally proposed to predict the shape and amplitude of any rotation curve (RC) based solely on photometric data. Here, the URC is investigated with an extensive set of spatially resolved RCs drawn from the PROBES-I, PROBES-II, and MaNGA databases with matching multiband surface brightness profiles from the DESI-LIS and Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer surveys for 3846 disk galaxies. Common URC formulations fail to achieve an adequate level of accuracy to qualify as truly universal over fully sampled RCs. We develop neural network (NN) equivalents for the proposed URCs that predict RCs with higher accuracy, showing that URC inaccuracies are not due to insufficient data but rather nonoptimal formulations or sampling effects. This conclusion remains even if the total RC sample is pruned for symmetry. The latest URC prescriptions and their NN equivalents trained on our subsample of 579 disk galaxies with symmetric RCs perform similarly to the URC/NN trained on the complete data sample. We conclude that a URC with an acceptable level of accuracy (ΔVcirc ≲ 15%) at all radii would require a detailed modeling of a galaxy’s central regions and outskirts (e.g., for baryonic effects leading to contraction or expansion of any dark-matter-only halo).

The Jovian plasma sheet is a key region of the Jovian magnetosphere populated by a mix of warm and hot plasma. It is the main channel for radial transport of mass and energy in the Jovian magnetosphere and provides a favorable environment for magnetic reconnection and wave–particle interactions although the understanding of its plasma properties is incomplete. This study combines observations from the Jovian Auroral Distributions Experiment and Juno Energetic Particle Detector Instrument on board the Juno spacecraft during its first 31 orbits to analyze the plasma properties of the Jovian plasma sheet from 20 RJ to 100 RJ. Our results indicate that the plasma number density decreases from 1 cm−3 at 20 RJ to 0.005 cm−3 at 100 RJ, while the plasma pressure decreases from 2 nPa at 20 RJ to 0.02 nPa at 100 RJ. The plasma pressure inside the plasma sheet is comparable to the magnetic pressure in the lobe region, suggesting a rough balance between the two. In the plasma sheet with r > 70 RJ, the H+ density and pressure remain relatively constant, likely due to other plasma sources such as the solar wind. Additionally, we find that the pressure (density) ratios for heavy ions between the center and the edge of the plasma sheet are generally an order of magnitude, while that for H+ decreases with radial distance. These findings contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the plasma properties of the Jovian plasma sheet.

We present results from simultaneous far-ultraviolet (FUV) and near-ultraviolet (NUV) observations of T Tauri stars (TTSs) in the Taurus molecular cloud with UVIT/AstroSat. This is the very first UVIT study of TTSs. From the spectral energy distribution of TTSs from FUV to IR, we show that classical TTSs (CTTSs) emit significantly higher UV excess compared to weak-line TTSs (WTTSs). The equivalent blackbody temperatures corresponding to the UV excess in CTTSs (>104 K) are also found to be relatively higher than those in WTTSs (<9250 K). From the UV excess, we have reclassified two WTTSs (BS Tau and V836 Tau) as CTTSs, which has been supported by the follow-up optical spectroscopic study using the Himalayan Chandra Telescope, showing strong Hα line emission. We find that CTTSs show strong excess emission in both the FUV (>107) and NUV (>103) bands, while WTTSs show strong excess only in the FUV (≲105), suggesting that excess emission in the NUV can be used as a tool to classify the TTSs. We also find a linear correlation between UV luminosity (a primary indicator of mass accretion) and Hα luminosity (a secondary indicator of mass accretion) with a slope of 1.20 ± 0.22 and intercept of 2.16 ± 0.70.

Probing magnetic fields in astrophysical environments is both important and challenging. The Gradient Technique (GT) is a new tool for tracing magnetic fields, rooted in the properties of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence and turbulent magnetic reconnection. In this work, we examine the performance of GT when applied to synthetic synchrotron emission and spectroscopic data obtained from sub-Alfvénic and trans-Alfvénic MHD simulations. We demonstrate the improved accuracy of GT in tracing magnetic fields in the absence of low spatial frequencies. Additionally, we apply a low-spatial-frequency filter to a diffuse neutral hydrogen region selected from the GALFA-H i survey. Our results show an increased alignment between the magnetic fields inferred from GT and the Planck 353 GHz polarization measurements.

We report the first arcsecond-resolution observations of the magnetic field in the ministarburst complex Sgr B2. SMA polarization observations revealed magnetic field morphology in three dense cores of Sgr B2 N(orth), M(ain), and S(outh). The total plane-of-sky magnetic field strengths in these cores are estimated to be 4.3–10.0 mG, 6.2–14.7 mG, and 1.9–4.5 mG derived from the angular dispersion function method after applying the correction factors of 0.21 and 0.5. Combining with analyses of the parsec-scale polarization data from Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy, we found that a magnetically supercritical condition is present from the cloud scale (∼10 pc) to core scale (∼0.2 pc) in Sgr B2, which is consistent with the burst of star formation activities in the region likely resulting from a multiscale gravitational collapse from the cloud to dense cores.

We use cyclic spectroscopy to perform high-frequency resolution analyses of multihour baseband Arecibo observations of the millisecond pulsar PSR B1937+21. This technique allows for the examination of scintillation features in far greater detail than is otherwise possible under most pulsar timing array observing setups. We measure scintillation bandwidths and timescales in each of eight subbands across a 200 MHz observing band in each observation. Through these measurements we obtain intra-epoch estimates of the frequency scalings for scintillation bandwidth and timescale. Thanks to our high-frequency resolution and the narrow scintles of this pulsar, we resolve scintillation arcs in the secondary spectra due to the increased Nyquist limit, which would not have been resolved at the same observing frequency with a traditional filterbank spectrum using NANOGrav’s current time and frequency resolutions, and the frequency-dependent evolution of scintillation arc features within individual observations. We observe the dimming of prominent arc features at higher frequencies, possibly due to a combination of decreasing flux density and the frequency dependence of the plasma refractive index of the interstellar medium. We also find agreement with arc curvature frequency dependence predicted by Stinebring et al. in some epochs. Thanks to the frequency-resolution improvement provided by cyclic spectroscopy, these results show strong promise for future such analyses with millisecond pulsars, particularly for pulsar timing arrays, where such techniques can allow for detailed studies of the interstellar medium in highly scattered pulsars without sacrificing the timing resolution that is crucial to their gravitational-wave detection efforts.

<div> Hercules X-1, X-ray binaries, accretion disk winds, wind plasma number density, X-ray spectroscopy
总结: 
本研究提出了一种新的方法来确定X射线双星Hercules X-1中的等离子体数密度。通过对Hercules X-1的脉冲分辨分析，直接检测到了风的响应，确认风密度至少为1012cm-3。最后，我们模拟了对Hercules X-1的XRISM观测，并展示了它们将允许我们准确地测量离流的不同位置的数密度。使用XRISM，我们将排除约3个数量级的密度参数空间，约束风的质量流出率、能量学和其发射机制。 <div>
X-ray binaries are known to launch powerful accretion disk winds that can have a significant impact on the binary systems and their surroundings. To quantify the impact and determine the launching mechanisms of these outflows, we need to measure the wind plasma number density, an important ingredient in the theoretical disk wind models. While X-ray spectroscopy is a crucial tool for understanding the wind properties, such as their velocity and ionization, in nearly all cases, we lack the signal-to-noise ratio to constrain the plasma number density, weakening the constraints on the outflow location and mass outflow rate. We present a new approach to determining this number density in the X-ray binary Hercules X-1, by measuring the speed of the wind ionization response to the time-variable illuminating continuum. Hercules X-1 is powered by a highly magnetized neutron star, pulsating with a period of 1.24 s. We show that the wind number density in Hercules X-1 is sufficiently high to respond to these pulsations by modeling the ionization response with the time-dependent photoionization model tpho. We then perform a pulse-resolved analysis of the best-quality XMM-Newton observation of Hercules X-1 and directly detect the wind response, confirming that the wind density is at least 1012 cm−3. Finally, we simulate XRISM observations of Hercules X-1 and show that they will allow us to accurately measure the number density at different locations within the outflow. With XRISM, we will rule out ∼3 orders of magnitude in density parameter space, constraining the wind mass outflow rate, energetics, and its launching mechanism.

<div> 关键词: 偏振角度旋转, 伽马射线暴, 磁场配置, 磁星中心引擎, 多个发射壳体
总结:
本研究探讨了伽马射线暴（GRBs）的偏振角度（PA）在快速阶段观察到两次90°的突然旋转现象，提出了多个发射壳体模型解决这一难题。针对发射壳体中大尺度有序磁场的构型，考虑了环形和对齐两种情况。研究发现，通过多壳体对齐磁场配置（MFC）可以很好地解释GRB 170114A和GRB 160821A中观测到的两次90°的PA旋转现象。数值计算还表明，多个发射壳体采用环形MFC无法解释观测到的两次90°的PA旋转。对齐MFC通常意味着磁星中心引擎的偏好，而环形磁场配置通常与中心黑洞相关。因此，两个GRBs的磁星中心引擎的可能性更大。<br /><br /> <div>
The observed abrupt twice-90° rotations of the polarization angle (PA) in the prompt phase of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are difficult to understand within the current one-emitting-shell models. Here, we apply a model with multiple emitting shells to solve this new challenging problem. Two configurations of large-scale ordered magnetic fields in the shells are considered: toroidal and aligned. Together with the light curves and the spectral peak energy evolutions, the twice-90° PA rotations in GRB 170114A and GRB 160821A could be well interpreted with the multishell aligned magnetic field configuration (MFC). Our numerical calculations also show that the multiple shells with the toroidal MFC could not explain the observed twice-90° PA rotations. An aligned MFC in the GRB outflow usually indicates the preference of a magnetar central engine, while a toroidal field configuration is typically related to a central black hole. Therefore, the magnetar central engines for the two GRBs are favored.

<div> ΩM, σ8, galaxy cluster, cosmic shear, splashback radius
<br />
该研究通过宇宙学模拟发现，星系团周围的溅飞回半径随着ΩM或σ8值的变化而变化，从而打破了S8参数带来的ΩM和σ8的退化关系。研究还指出，这种变化在原则上是可以通过观测来测量的，因为溅飞回半径可以通过弱引力透镜分析来确定。这种新方法可以加强对宇宙学参数的低红移限制，可以利用现有数据或即将到来的欧几里德和大型巡天望远镜（LSST）的数据来实现。 
<br />
总结: 该研究发现星系团的溅飞回半径可以作为一个重要的观测指标，能够帮助打破ΩM和σ8之间的退化关系，从而加强对宇宙学参数的约束。通过宇宙学模拟和观测数据的对比，研究揭示了这一现象并指出了进一步的研究方向。Euclid和LSST等未来的观测数据有望进一步验证这一发现。 <div>
Cosmological parameters such as ΩM and σ8 can be measured indirectly using various methods, including galaxy cluster abundance and cosmic shear. These measurements constrain the composite parameter S8, leading to degeneracy between ΩM and σ8. However, some structural properties of galaxy clusters also correlate with cosmological parameters, due to their dependence on a cluster’s accretion history. In this work, we focus on the splashback radius, an observable cluster feature that represents a boundary between a cluster and the surrounding Universe. Using a suite of cosmological simulations with a range of values for ΩM and σ8, we show that the position of the splashback radius around cluster-mass halos is greater in cosmologies with smaller values of ΩM or larger values of σ8. This variation breaks the degeneracy between ΩM and σ8 that comes from measurements of the S8 parameter. We also show that this variation is, in principle, measurable in observations. As the splashback radius can be determined from the same weak lensing analysis already used to estimate S8, this new approach can tighten low-redshift constraints on cosmological parameters, either using existing data, or using upcoming data such as that from Euclid and LSST.

<title>A Brown Dwarf Orbiting around the Planetary-nebula Central Binary KV Vel</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
KV Vel is a noneclipsing short-period (P = 0.3571 days) close binary containing a very hot subdwarf primary (77,000 K) and a cool low-mass secondary star (3400 K) that is located at the center of the planetary nebula DS 1. The changes in the orbital period of the close binary were analyzed based on 262 new times of light maximum together with those compiled from the literature. It is discovered that the O − C curve shows a small-amplitude (0.ͩ0034) cyclic period variation with a period of 29.55 yr. The explanation by the solar-type magnetic activity cycles of the cool component is ruled out because the required energies are much larger than the total radiant energy of this component in a whole cycle. Therefore, the cyclic variation was plausibly explained as the light-travel time effect via the presence of a tertiary component, which is supported by the periodic changes of the O − C curve and the rather symmetric and stable light curves obtained by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. The mass of the tertiary companion is determined to be M⊙. If the third body is coplanar with the central binary (i.e., ), the mass of the tertiary component is computed as M3 ∼ 0.068 M⊙, and thus it would be below the stable hydrogen-burning limit and is a brown dwarf. The orbital separation is shorter than 9.35 au. KV Vel together with its surrounding planetary nebula and the brown-dwarf companion may be formed through the common-envelope evolution after the primary filled its Roche lobe during the early asymptotic giant branch stage.

<title>Laboratory Transition-rate Measurement of the Coronal Intercombination Line of Ar xv by Time-resolved Laser Spectroscopy</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The extreme-ultraviolet emission line (424 Å) of the intercombination 1s22s21S0–1s22s2p3P1 transition of Ar xv can potentially characterize the electron temperature of astrophysical plasma. Various theoretical studies have investigated the intercombination transition rate, which is essential for the plasma diagnostics; however, experimental difficulties have prevented its measurement. We present here measurement of the lifetime of the 3P1 excited state of Ar xv, providing the experimental value of the intercombination transition rate. Employing time-resolved plasma-assisted laser spectroscopy, a method we recently demonstrated, enables us to measure this submicrosecond lifetime. The experimental result exhibits a 25%–43% higher transition rate than theoretical predictions.

<title>STELLA Lightcurves of Energetic Pair-instability Supernovae in the Context of SN2018ibb</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad656c</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
SN2018ibb is a recently observed hydrogen-poor superluminous supernova that appears to be powered by the decay of 30 M⊙ of radioactive nickel. This supernova has been suggested to show hybrid signatures of a pair-instability supernova and an interacting supernova. In a previous paper, we found that rotating, metal-enriched pair-instability supernova progenitors appeared to check both of these boxes. In this paper, we model the lightcurves of the pair-instability supernovae using STELLA. We find that the STELLA models can explain the overall shape of the bolometric lightcurve of SN2018ibb, though not specific morphological features such as the luminosity peak or the bump at roughly 300 days after the peak. We also estimate the contribution from interaction and find that with relatively low wind velocities, the circumstellar medium originating from the stellar winds is consistent with the evidence for interaction in the spectra. The observed values of the photosphere velocity in the 100 days after peak luminosity are similar to the STELLA models, but the deceleration is lower. This leads to the biggest inconsistency, which is the blackbody temperature of SN2018ibb being much hotter than any of the STELLA models. We note that this high temperature (and the flat velocity) may be difficult to reconcile with the long rise time of SN2018ibb, but nevertheless conclude that if it is accurate, this discrepancy represents a challenge for SN2018ibb being a robust PISN candidate. This result is noteworthy given the lack of other scenarios for this supernova.

<title>Local Transition of Electron Pitch Angle Distribution within Flux Pileup Region behind Dipolarization Front</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Dipolarization fronts (DFs), earthward-propagating magnetic transients with a strong magnetic field, are important regions favorable for energetic electron acceleration in the magnetotail. The DF-driven electron acceleration usually generates coherent pitch angle distributions (PADs) inside flux pileup regions (FPRs), i.e., strong magnetic field regions behind the DFs, such as pancake, butterfly, and cigar distributions, which dominate at different tail regions and often occur separately. Here we present unique observations of electron PAD evolution inside the FPR, showing that electron PAD underwent local transition from cigar distribution, to butterfly distribution, then toward pancake distribution, forming a U-shaped distribution. During the local transition, electron perpendicular flux (relative to the local magnetic field) is anticorrelated with magnetic field strength, contrary to traditional expectation. The unexpected feature of the electron U-shaped distribution is associated with multiple physical processes at different scales, including local expansion of flux tubes and pitch angle variation near the neutral sheet. These atypical observations can advance our current understanding of electron acceleration and transport in the magnetosphere.

The Bright Transient Survey (BTS) aims to obtain a classification spectrum for all bright (mpeak ≤ 18.5 mag) extragalactic transients found in the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) public survey. BTS critically relies on visual inspection (“scanning”) to select targets for spectroscopic follow-up, which, while effective, has required a significant time investment over the past ∼5 yr of ZTF operations. We present BTSbot, a multimodal convolutional neural network, which provides a bright transient score to individual ZTF detections using their image data and 25 extracted features. BTSbot is able to eliminate the need for daily human scanning by automatically identifying and requesting spectroscopic follow-up observations of new bright transient candidates. BTSbot recovers all bright transients in our test split and performs on par with scanners in terms of identification speed (on average, ∼1 hr quicker than scanners). We also find that BTSbot is not significantly impacted by any data shift by comparing performance across a concealed test split and a sample of very recent BTS candidates. BTSbot has been integrated into Fritz and Kowalski, ZTF’s first-party marshal and alert broker, and now sends automatic spectroscopic follow-up requests for the new transients it identifies. Between 2023 December and 2024 May, BTSbot selected 609 sources in real time, 96% of which were real extragalactic transients. With BTSbot and other automation tools, the BTS workflow has produced the first fully automatic end-to-end discovery and classification of a transient, representing a significant reduction in the human time needed to scan.

<div> 关键词: common envelop jets, supernovae, r-process scenario, neutron-capture process, metal-poor stars
总结:
本研究提出了一种新的超新星r过程核合成理论，即共同包络喷流超新星(CEJSNe)场景。研究发现，在这种场景下形成的强子流密度分布可以产生最大比例的第三r过程峰元素与镧系元素，相比其他r过程理论而言。与观测到的r过程金属贫星和其他r过程场景相比，CEJSN场景能够很好地模拟特定r增强金属贫星的观测特征，这对于r过程核合成场景的研究具有重要意义。此外，CEJSN场景还可以通过宇宙年龄测定提供最重的元素的形成估计。 <div>
The common envelop jet supernovae (CEJSNe) r-process scenario has been proposed as an r-process nucleosynthesis site in the past decade. Jets launched by a neutron star that spirals in inside the core of a red supergiant star in a common envelope evolution supply the proper conditions for forming elements heavier than iron through the rapid neutron-capture process. The present work initially unveils the r-process abundance patterns that result from the density profile in the relatively long-lived jets. The results indicate that the expansion profile unique to the CEJSN scenario can produce the largest ratio of the third r-process peak elements to lanthanides among current r-process scenarios and, in addition, can form quite an amount of lanthanides, about 1% of matters above the first peak, in a single event. The comparison of the ratio of the third-peak elements to the lanthanides with several observed r-enhanced metal-poor stars and with other r-process scenarios suggests that a high mass of third-peak elements is anticorrelated with a high fraction of lanthanides, both in observations and theory. The CEJSN-like scenario plays a significant role in this conclusion since it reproduces the observational features of some particular r-enhanced metal-poor stars where other r-process scenarios encounter problems. Due to the formation of extremely heavy elements, the CEJSN also offers a credible estimation of the age of the most actinide-boosted star by cosmochronometry.

总结：<br />
本文研究了高度磁化离子-电子等离子体中磁重联产生的粒子加速和偏角各向异性。通过全粒子动力学模拟，我们证明磁重联产生了各向异性粒子分布，其特征是在粒子能量谱中呈现出破裂的幂律分布fs(ε) ∝ ε−p和偏角。这些分布的特征由磁场的导向和重联分量（Bg/B0）的相对强度以及等离子体磁化（σ0）决定。在注入断裂能量ε0以下，无论Bg/B0和σ0均≳ 1，离子和电子能谱都非常硬（p< ≲ 1），而在ε0以上，谱指数变陡（p> ≳ 2），对Bg/B0和σ0显示出很高的敏感性。偏角呈现出具有负斜率（m<）的幂律范围，在ε0以下且具有正斜率（m>）的幂律范围，在ε0以上，并且随着Bg/B0和σ0的增加而变陡。偏角各向异性还引起温度各向异性，并减缓了同步辐射冷却，同时产生了与磁场对齐的射束辐射，这可能是频率快速变化的原因。磁场的重分布还导致了光学薄的同步辐射功率谱Fν(ν) ∝ ν(2−2p+m)/(4+m)和线偏振度Πlin = (p + 1)/(p + 7/3 + m/3)。 <div>
Particle acceleration and pitch-angle anisotropy resulting from magnetic reconnection are investigated in highly magnetized ion-electron plasmas. By means of fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations, we demonstrate that magnetic reconnection generates anisotropic particle distributions , characterized by broken power laws in the particle energy spectrum fs(ε) ∝ ε−p and pitch angle . The characteristics of these distributions are determined by the relative strengths of the magnetic field’s guide and reconnecting components (Bg/B0) and the plasma magnetization (σ0). Below the injection break energy ε0, ion and electron energy spectra are extremely hard (p< ≲ 1) for any Bg/B0 and σ0 ≳ 1, while above ε0 the spectral index steepens (p> ≳ 2), displaying high sensitivity to both Bg/B0 and σ0. The pitch angle displays power-law ranges with negative slopes (m<) below and positive slopes (m>) above , steepening with increasing Bg/B0 and σ0. The ratio Bg/B0 regulates the redistribution of magnetic energy between ions (ΔEi) and electrons (ΔEe), with ΔEi ≫ ΔEe for Bg/B0 ≪ 1, ΔEi ∼ ΔEe for Bg/B0 ∼ 1, and ΔEi ≪ ΔEe for Bg/B0 ≫ 1, with ΔEi/ΔEe approaching unity when σ0 ≫ 1. The anisotropic distribution of accelerated particles results in an optically thin synchrotron power spectrum Fν(ν) ∝ ν(2−2p+m)/(4+m) and a linear polarization degree Πlin = (p + 1)/(p + 7/3 + m/3) for a uniform magnetic field. Pitch-angle anisotropy also induces temperature anisotropy and eases synchrotron cooling, along with producing beamed radiation aligned with the magnetic field, which is potentially responsible for rapid frequency-dependent variability.

UVCANDELS是哈勃空间望远镜授予的研究项目，通过对四个CANDELS领域进行紫外线和光学成像，覆盖面积约为426平方弧分，比之前深空紫外线数据覆盖面积大约多2.7倍。研究团队采用了新的光度测定方法，识别了5810个红移在0.6 < z < 1之间的星系，并进行了UV LF的分析。研究发现在z ∼ 0.8时的最佳拟合斜率，同时观察到在红移上可能发生的演化。最后得到了在MUV < −10时的UV光度密度。UVCANDELS的新光度目录已经公开发布在巴巴拉·米库尔斯基空间望远镜存档中。<br /><br /> <div>
UVCANDELS is a Hubble Space Telescope Cycle-26 Treasury Program awarded 164 orbits of primary ultraviolet (UV) F275W imaging and coordinated parallel optical F435W imaging in four CANDELS fields—GOODS-N, GOODS-S, EGS, and COSMOS—covering a total area of ∼426 arcmin2. This is ∼2.7 times larger than the area covered by previous deep-field space UV data combined, reaching a depth of about 27 and 28 ABmag (5σ in 0.”2 apertures) for F275W and F435W, respectively. Along with new photometric catalogs, we present an analysis of the rest-frame UV luminosity function (LF), relying on our UV-optimized aperture photometry method, yielding a factor of 1.5 increase over H-isophot aperture photometry in the signal-to-noise ratios of galaxies in our F275W imaging. Using well-tested photometric redshift measurements, we identify 5810 galaxies at redshifts 0.6 < z < 1, down to an absolute magnitude of MUV = −14.2. In order to minimize the effect of uncertainties in estimating the completeness function, especially at the faint end, we restrict our analysis to sources above 30% completeness, which provides a final sample of 4726 galaxies at −21.5 < MUV < −15.5. We performed a maximum likelihood estimate to derive the best-fit parameters of the UV LF. We report a best-fit faint-end slope of at z ∼ 0.8. Creating subsamples at z ∼ 0.7 and z ∼ 0.9, we observe a possible evolution of α with redshift. The unobscured UV luminosity density at MUV < −10 is derived as using our best-fit LF parameters. The new F275W and F435 photometric catalogs from UVCANDELS have been made publicly available on the Barbara A. Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes.

这篇文章介绍了南极望远镜进行的毫米波观测数据，通过短暂持续时间的过渡性搜寻发现了111次耀斑事件来自66颗恒星，扩大了之前 SPT-3G 数据发布中检测到的耀斑事件和耀斑星数量的数量级。研究人员提供了与Gaia DR3的匹配，并与第二个ROSAT全天巡天中发现的X射线点源进行了匹配。他们还发现了各种类型的耀斑星，包括主序星和演化恒星，这些星大多都在附近，距离为10-1000 pc。耀斑事件的时间尺度范围从几分钟到几小时不等，而峰值νLν光度在SPT-3G频段为10^27到10^31 erg s^−1。 <div>
We present a flare star catalog from 4 yr of nontargeted millimeter-wave survey data from the South Pole Telescope (SPT). The data were taken with the SPT-3G camera and cover a 1500 deg2 region of the sky from 20h40m0s to 3h20m0s in right ascension and from −42° to −70° in declination. This region was observed on a nearly daily cadence from 2019 to 2022 and chosen to avoid the plane of the galaxy. A short-duration transient search of this survey yields 111 flaring events from 66 stars, increasing the number of both flaring events and detected flare stars by an order of magnitude from the previous SPT-3G data release. We provide cross-matching to Gaia DR3, as well as matches to X-ray point sources found in the second ROSAT all-sky survey. We have detected flaring stars across the main sequence, from early-type A stars to M dwarfs, as well as a large population of evolved stars. These stars are mostly nearby, spanning 10–1000 pc in distance. Most of the flare spectral indices are constant or gently rising as a function of frequency at 95/150/220 GHz. The timescale of these events can range from minutes to hours, and the peak νLν luminosities range from 1027 to 1031 erg s−1 in the SPT-3G frequency bands.

JWST-NIRCam（詹姆斯·韦伯太空望远镜-近红外相机）使用深度1.4–4.8μm波段拍摄了Serpens Main恒星形成区的图像，识别出20个候选原恒星喷流，大多具有双极结构，并确定了驱动源。喷流的位置角（PA）强相关，并且与Serpens小丝的主轴±24°内对齐。这些方向进一步与该区域两个盘阴影的角动量矢量对齐。通过估算发现，如果采样自均匀PA分布，这么多年轻恒星对齐的概率为10^-4。这表明，这些对齐的原恒星，根据其喷流动力学，似乎处于类似的演化阶段，是在类似时间内形成，并且继承了一个局部云小丝的类似自旋。此外，还有初步证据表明，西北部和东南部星团的平均PA之间存在系统性变化，以及东南部原恒星的PA散度增加。Serpens Main的SOFIA-HAWC+存档尘埃偏振观测数据显示，在特别是西北地区，与主导的喷流方向垂直。我们测量并定位了所有喷流的冲击节点和边缘，并提供了一个识别目录。我们推测Serpens Main是一个从孤立小丝形成的星团，由于其年轻性保留了其原始喷流对齐性。 <br /><br />总结: 本研究利用JWST-NIRCam深度观测了Serpens Main星形成区，并发现了20个候选原恒星喷流，并确定了它们的驱动源。研究发现这些喷流的位置角呈现强相关，并与该区域的小丝主轴对齐。这表明这些对齐的原恒星可能是在相似时间内形成，并继承自局部云小丝的类似自旋。此外，还发现了对北西和东南星团的平均PA存在系统性变化，以及东南部原恒星的PA散度增加。SOIA-HAWC+存档的观测数据也显示了垂直于主导喷流方向的情况。 <div>
We present deep 1.4–4.8 μm JWST-NIRCam imaging of the Serpens Main star-forming region and identify 20 candidate protostellar outflows, most with bipolar structure and identified driving sources. The outflow position angles (PAs) are strongly correlated, and they are aligned within ±24° of the major axis of the Serpens filament. These orientations are further aligned with the angular momentum vectors of the two disk shadows in this region. We estimate that the probability of this number of young stars being coaligned if sampled from a uniform PA distribution is 10−4. This in turn suggests that the aligned protostars, which seem to be at similar evolutionary stages based on their outflow dynamics, formed at similar times with a similar spin inherited from a local cloud filament. Further, there is tentative evidence for a systematic change in average PA between the northwestern and southeastern cluster, as well as increased scatter in the PAs of the southeastern protostars. SOFIA-HAWC+ archival dust polarization observations of Serpens Main at 154 and 214 μm are perpendicular to the dominant jet orientation in the northwestern region in particular. We measure and locate shock knots and edges for all of the outflows and provide an identifying catalog. We suggest that Serpens main is a cluster that formed from an isolated filament and due to its youth retains its primordial outflow alignment.

<div> UHECRs, cosmic magnetism, Local Sheet, transient emissions, gamma-ray bursts
<br /><br />总结:
本研究基于UHECRs的到达方向和射线强度提供了瞬变源的证据，并将光学和红外调查得到的三维物质分布作为UHECRs源的密度模型。研究发现，本地薄片是地球观测者所观察到的UHECR爆发的磁化结构，并且还提出了磁场的湍流振幅必须在0.5-20 nG范围内，换言之，UHECRs的爆发率密度必须在50-5000 Gpc^-3 yr^-1的范围内才能合理解释观测到的UHECRs。最后，研究表明，唯一符合加速UHECRs能谱要求的星际瞬变事件是长持续时间的伽玛射线暴。 <div>
The arrival directions of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) observed above 4 × 1019 eV provide evidence of localized excesses that are key to identifying their sources. We leverage the 3D matter distribution from optical and infrared surveys as a density model of UHECR sources, which are considered to be transient. Agreement of the sky model with UHECR data imposes constraints on both the emission rate per unit matter and the time spread induced by encountered turbulent magnetic fields. Based on radio measurements of cosmic magnetism, we identify the Local Sheet as the magnetized structure responsible for the kiloyear duration of UHECR bursts for an observer on Earth and find that the turbulence amplitude must be within 0.5–20 nG for a coherence length of 10 kpc. At the same time, the burst-rate density must be above 50 Gpc−3 yr−1 for Local Sheet galaxies to reproduce the UHECR excesses and below 5000 Gpc−3 yr−1 (30,000 Gpc−3 yr−1) for the Milky Way (Local Group galaxies) not to outshine other galaxies. For the transient emissions of protons and nuclei to match the energy spectra of UHECRs, the kinetic energy of the outflows responsible for UHECR acceleration must be below 4 × 1054 erg and above 5 × 1050 erg (2 × 1049 erg) if we consider the Milky Way (or not). The only stellar-sized transients that satisfy both Hillas’ and our criteria are long-duration gamma-ray bursts.

总结:
该研究对大麦哲伦星云和小麦哲伦星云内34个mYSOs进行了观测，发现在大麦哲伦星云中宽双星的比例为9% ± 5%，而在小麦哲伦星云中则低于5%。研究排除了大麦哲伦星云和小麦哲伦星云中宽双星比例高于35%和38%的可能性。相比之下，据文献报道，银河系中mYSOs的宽双星比例约为15%–60%。研究认为金属丰度和环境因素可能影响了大质量恒星宽双星的形成。未来需要更大规模的低金属丰度环境下的高质量系统样本，以确认或反驳该观点。<br /><br /> <div>
Constraints on the binary fraction of massive young stellar objects (mYSOs) are important for binary and massive star formation theory. Here, we present speckle imaging of 34 mYSOs located in the Large Magellanic Cloud (1/2 Z⊙) and Small Magellanic Cloud (∼1/5 Z⊙), probing projected separations in the 2000 to 20,000 au (at angular scales of 0.″02–0.″2) range, for stars above 8 M⊙. We find two wide binaries in the Large Magellanic Cloud (from a sample of 23 targets), but none in a sample of 11 in the Small Magellanic Cloud, leading us to adopt a wide binary fraction of 9% ± 5% and <5%, respectively. We rule out a wide binary fraction greater than 35% in the Large Magellanic Cloud and 38% in the Small Magellanic Cloud at the 99% confidence level. This is in contrast to the wide binary fraction of mYSOs in the Milky Way (presumed to be 1 Z⊙), which within the physical parameter space probed by this study is ∼15%–60% from the literature. We argue that while selection effects could be responsible for the lower binary fraction observed, it is more likely that there are underlying physical mechanisms responsible for the observed properties. This indicates that metallicity and environmental effects may influence the formation of wide binaries among massive stars. Future larger, more statistically significant samples of high-mass systems in low-metallicity environments for comparison to the Milky Way, are essential to confirm or repudiate our claim.

总结:
太阳III型射电爆发是太阳冕层和星际空间中高能电子活动的重要指标。本研究分析了帕克太阳探测器在05至11次接触期间记录的43次星际III型射电爆发，观察频率范围在19-0.5 MHz之间的时间特征。研究结果显示，这些射电爆发的持续时间、速度、带宽和漂移速率均与频率有关。电子束的速度与爆发持续时间呈负相关，速度越快，持续时间越短。此外，爆发持续时间与上升、峰值和衰减时间呈现出明显的相关性，说明整个时间轮廓共同影响事件持续时间。这些复杂的发现揭示了影响爆发动态的物理机制，揭示了电子束特性与观测到的III型太阳射电爆发的时间和频谱特性之间错综复杂的相互作用。 <br /><br /> <div>
Solar type III radio bursts are crucial indicators of energetic electron activity in the solar corona and interplanetary space. Our assessment of 43 interplanetary type III bursts, recorded by the FIELDS instrument on board the Parker Solar Probe during Encounters 05 to 11, has led to significant and complex findings. We have analyzed time profile features across a frequency range of 19–0.5 MHz, revealing dependencies on frequency and providing insights into duration, burst speeds, bandwidths, and drift rates. This novel analysis has unveiled a spectral index of −0.63 ± 0.04 for rise, −0.69 ± 0.03 for decay time, and −0.68 ± 0.03 for the total duration. We have determined the average electron beam velocities for front, middle, and back as 0.15c, 0.13c, and 0.08c, respectively. Our findings show that faster electron beams generate emissions with shorter duration. The average ratio of the front-to-back velocity is 1.87, and the ratio of front-to-middle velocity is 1.23. We have also discovered a strong relationship between burst duration with rise, peak, and decay times, particularly pronounced with decay time (correlation coefficient = 0.95). This indicates that the entire temporal profile, including rise, peak, and decay phases, collectively contributes to event duration and is not solely influenced by external factors like plasma conditions or electron beam dynamics but also by internal burst processes. These complex findings shed light on the physical mechanisms governing burst dynamics, revealing intricate interactions between electron beam characteristics and observed temporal and spectral traits of type III solar radio bursts.

<div> Fermi GRBs, jets, magnetization, σ0, spectrum
总结:
本研究通过对所有已知红移的Fermi GRB的时间分辨光谱进行广泛分析，通过对比热辐射和非热辐射组分，诊断了每个时间段的σ0。结果表明，大多数GRB射流可能包含显著的磁能量组分，可能具有磁化因子σ0 ≥ 10。σ0的值在同一个GRB内似乎变化显著。未来的研究将通过更多样本的实验，特别是那些覆盖更低能光谱信息的实验，进一步验证我们的结果。 <div>
The composition of gamma-ray burst (GRB) jets remained a mystery until recently. In practice, we usually characterize the magnetization of the GRB jets (σ0) through the ratio between the Poynting flux and matter (baryonic) flux. With the increasing value of σ0, magnetic energy gradually takes on a dominant role in the acceleration and energy dissipation of the jet, causing the proportion of thermal component in the prompt-emission spectrum of GRBs to gradually decrease or even be completely suppressed. In this work, we conducted an extensive analysis of the time-resolved spectrum for all Fermi GRBs with known redshift, and we diagnose σ0 for each time bin by contrasting the thermal and nonthermal radiation components. Our results suggest that most GRB jets should contain a significant magnetic energy component, likely with magnetization factors σ0 ≥ 10. The value of σ0 seems to vary significantly within the same GRB. Future studies with more samples, especially those with lower-energy spectral information coverage, will further verify our results.

We present a stellar dynamical mass measurement of the supermassive black hole in the elliptical (E1) galaxy NGC 3258. Our findings are based on integral field unit spectroscopy from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) observations in narrow-field mode with adaptive optics and the MUSE wide-field mode, from which we extract kinematic information by fitting the Ca ii and Mg b triplets, respectively. Using axisymmetric, three-integral Schwarzschild orbit library models, we fit the observed line-of-sight velocity distributions to infer the supermassive black hole mass, the H-band mass-to-light ratio, the asymptotic circular velocity, and the dark matter halo scale radius of the galaxy. We report a black hole mass of (2.2 ± 0.2) × 109M⊙ at an assumed distance of 31.9 Mpc. This value is in close agreement with a previous measurement from Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array CO observations. The consistency between these two measurements provides strong support for both the gas dynamical and stellar dynamical methods.

总结:<br />
本文通过使用CHARA阵列对Cepheid Polaris进行了30年的轨道观测，并在Apache Point Observatory使用斑点干涉测量进行了额外的测量。使用自定义网格模型拟合程序和CANDID软件确认了伴星的星位置，结合大量的径向速度数据拟合了轨道，推导出Cepheid的质量为5.13 ± 0.28 M⊙。此外，文章还讨论了Polaris的一些异常特性，以及关于表面斑点的识别。文章提出了脉动模式、轨道近日点穿越和低脉动幅度这些因素在脉动中的作用，以解释这些特性。 <div>
The 30 yr orbit of the Cepheid Polaris has been followed with observations by the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy (CHARA) Array from 2016 through 2021. An additional measurement has been made with speckle interferometry at the Apache Point Observatory. Detection of the companion is complicated by its comparative faintness—an extreme flux ratio. Angular diameter measurements appear to show some variation with pulsation phase. Astrometric positions of the companion were measured with a custom grid-based model-fitting procedure and confirmed with the CANDID software. These positions were combined with the extensive radial velocities (RVs) discussed by Torres to fit an orbit. Because of the imbalance of the sizes of the astrometry and RV data sets, several methods of weighting are discussed. The resulting mass of the Cepheid is 5.13 ± 0.28 M⊙. Because of the comparatively large eccentricity of the orbit (0.63), the mass derived is sensitive to the value found for the eccentricity. The mass combined with the distance shows that the Cepheid is more luminous than predicted for this mass from evolutionary tracks. The identification of surface spots is discussed. This would give credence to the identification of a radial velocity variation with a period of approximately 120 days as a rotation period. Polaris has some unusual properties (rapid period change, a phase jump, variable amplitude, and unusual polarization). However, a pulsation scenario involving pulsation mode, orbital periastron passage, and low pulsation amplitude can explain these characteristics within the framework of pulsation seen in Cepheids.

该研究描述了与Chamaeleon-MMS1候选FHSC（首个静力核）相关的局部（∼4000天文单位）流出活动及其对周围物质的影响，以确定这个年轻的低质量源的演化状态。观测结果显示Chamaeleon-MMS1存在低能流出，流出物质对周围气体的影响并推断其旋转温度。通过分析分子示踪物质，结果表明Chamaeleon-MMS1虽然不是FHSC，但其流出的能量较其他0级天体要小，并且其物理特性与其他低光度原恒星的范围相符。推测Chamaeleon-MMS1是已知最年轻的星源之一。 <br /><br /> <div>
The earliest stages of low-mass star formation are unclear, with the first hydrostatic core (FHSC) as the transition stage between a prestellar and protostellar core. This work describes the local (∼4000 au) outflow activity associated with candidate FHSC Chamaeleon-MMS1 and its effect on the surrounding material to determine the evolutionary state of this young low-mass source. We observed Chamaeleon-MMS1 with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array at 220 GHz at high spatial (∼75 au) and spectral resolutions (0.1–0.3 km s−1). A low-energy outflow is detected, consisting of two components, a broad spectral feature (Δv ∼ 8 km s−1) to the northeast and narrow spectral features (Δv ∼ 1 km s−1) to both the northeast and southwest. The molecular tracers CS, formaldehyde (H2CO), and methanol (CH3OH) were used to analyze the effect of the outflows on the surrounding gas and determine its rotational temperature. The rotational temperature of H2CO is 40 K toward the continuum source with similarly low temperatures (10–75 K) toward clumps affected by the outflow. CH3OH is only detected toward gas clumps located away from the continuum source, where the methanol is expected to have been released by the energy of the outflow through ice sputtering. While molecular emission and high outflow speeds rule Cha-MMS1 out as an FHSC, its outflow is less energetic than those of other Class 0 objects and its physical properties are within the range covered by other low-luminosity protostars. The inferred gas temperatures toward the continuum source are also relatively low, indicating that Cha-MMS1 is one of the youngest known sources.

<br />Evolutionary and asteroseismic features of the evolved thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) star R Hya are studied using theoretical pulse spectra computed with MESA and oscillation spectra with GYRE. The star is found to be most likely driven by the fundamental mode and currently in the "power-down" phase of an intermediate pulse. The pulsation period is predicted to continue to shorten for millennia. The analysis suggests that R Hya has undergone third dredge-up in its most recent pulse. The MESA + GYRE model grid used in this study is the first publicly available grid of TP-AGB models with seismology and includes exact solutions to the linear, adiabatic equations of stellar oscillation for the first 10 radial-order pressure modes for every time step in every evolutionary track. The grid is open source and packaged with a data visualization application.<br /><br />总结: <br />通过MESA和GYRE计算了R Hya的脉动光谱和振荡光谱，并确定其可能由基频模式驱动，并处于中级脉冲的“功率下降”阶段。预测其脉动周期将在千年内继续缩短。分析表明，R Hya最近的脉冲中很可能经历了第三次深度混合。使用MESA + GYRE模型网格是首个包含来自MESA的TP-AGB模型和地震学数据的公开网格，该网格包括针对每个演化轨道的每个时间步长的前10个径向压力模式的线性绝热方程的确切解。 <div>
We present a comprehensive characterization of the evolved thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) star R Hydrae (R Hya), building on the techniques applied in Stellar Evolution in Real Time I (Molnár et al.) to T Ursae Minoris. We compute over 3000 theoretical TP-AGB pulse spectra using MESA and the corresponding oscillation spectra with GYRE. We combine these with classical observational constraints and nearly 400 years of measurements of R Hya’s period evolution to fit R Hya’s evolutionary and asteroseismic features. Two hypotheses for the mode driving R Hya’s period are considered. Solutions that identify this as the fundamental mode (FM) as well as the first overtone are consistent with observations. Using a variety of statistical tests, we find that R Hya is most likely driven by the FM and currently occupies the “power-down” phase of an intermediate pulse (TP ∼ 9–16). We predict that its pulsation period will continue to shorten for millennia. Supported by calculations from the Monash stellar evolution code, we find that R Hya has most likely undergone third dredge-up in its most recent pulse. The MESA + GYRE model grid used in this analysis includes exact solutions to the linear, adiabatic equations of stellar oscillation for the first 10 radial-order pressure modes for every time step in every evolutionary track. The grid is fully open source and packaged with a data visualization application. This is the first publicly available grid of TP-AGB models with seismology produced with MESA.

这篇文章报道了对23个光学发现的潮汐撕裂事件（TDEs）进行的射电观测结果。研究发现9个TDEs在较早时期没有检测到射电发射的现象，但在数百至2300天之后出现了迟来的明亮现象。另外还有7个TDEs的射电发射的起源不明确，可能归因于宿主星系或活动星系核。同时，报告了一个TDE在之前射电观测到约103天后出现了新的上升成分。有些TDE的射电发射在约2-4年内达到峰值，但超过一半的样本仍在上升阶段。数据显示大约40%的光学TDE会在发现后数百到数千天之后在射电波段被探测到，这可能比在约102天时出现的早期射电发射更为普遍。利用等离子体平衡分析，研究发现射电发射喷流可能存在延迟启动现象，延迟时间约为500-2000天，推测速度为0.02-0.15c，动能约为1047-1049 erg。该研究排除了非轴向相对论性喷流的可能性，得出延迟的流出可能是更可能的解释，可能是由于延迟的盘形成。最后得出结论，晚期射电发射标志着TDE演化的一个相当普遍但迄今被忽视的阶段。<br /><br />总结: TDE中存在晚期射电亮度增幅现象，可能由延迟启动的射电喷流产生，而非相对论性喷流，暗示了TDE演化的一个普遍但被忽视的阶段。 <div>
We present radio observations of 23 optically discovered tidal disruption events (TDEs) on timescales of ∼500–3200 days postdiscovery. We detect nine new TDEs that did not have detectable radio emission at earlier times, indicating a late-time brightening after several hundred (and up to 2300) days; an additional seven TDEs exhibit radio emission whose origin is ambiguous or may be attributed to the host galaxy or an active galactic nucleus. We also report a new rising component in one TDE previously detected in the radio at ∼103 days. While the radio emission in some of the detected TDEs peaked on a timescale ≈2–4 yr, over half of the sample still show rising emission. The range of luminosities for the sample is ∼1037–1039 erg s−1, about 2 orders of magnitude below the radio luminosity of the relativistic TDE Sw J1644+57. Our data set indicates ∼40% of all optical TDEs are detected in radio hundreds to thousands of days after discovery, and that this is probably more common than early radio emission peaking at ∼102 days. Using an equipartition analysis, we find evidence for a delayed launch of the radio-emitting outflows, with delay timescales of ∼500–2000 days, inferred velocities of ≈0.02–0.15c, and kinetic energies of ∼1047–1049 erg. We rule out off-axis relativistic jets as a viable explanation for this population, and conclude delayed outflows are a more likely explanation, possibly from delayed disk formation. We conclude late radio emission marks a fairly ubiquitous but heretofore overlooked phase of TDE evolution.

<div> 关键词: 双线发射, Mg ii, 共振散射, 球对称, 线比

总结:<br />
这项研究探讨了共振散射对Mg ii双线及恒星连续谱在球形和圆柱形几何中的影响。研究结果表明，在特定情况下，共振散射可导致双线流量比和逃逸流超出球形介质中期望的水平。在球对称且带尘埃的散射介质中，双线比一贯低于固有比值。然而，如果散射介质呈盘状，如正对盘状星系，并且被正对观察到，则预计双线比将高于2。同时还指出，在球形模型中，纯尘埃衰减无法解释紧凑星形成星系中观察到的双线比低于1.5的现象，除非灰尘不透明度明显偏离我们银河系的灰尘与Mg+气体比。讨论了连续泵浦发射线和膨胀介质对观测方面的重要性，包括双线流量比可能低于1.5或高于2，以及对称或不对称的线型。还讨论了扩散的温暖中性介质可能是Mg ii发射的重要来源。这些结果为理解遥远、空间未解析星系的形状和方向的复杂性提供了见解。 <div>
Observations of metallic doublet emission lines, particularly Mg iiλλ2796, 2803, provide crucial information for understanding galaxies and their circumgalactic medium. This study explores the effects of resonant scattering on the Mg ii doublet lines and the stellar continuum in spherical and cylindrical geometries. Our findings show that under certain circumstances, resonance scattering can cause an increase in the doublet flux ratio and the escaping flux of the lines beyond what is expected in optically thin spherical media. As expected, the doublet ratio is consistently lower than the intrinsic ratio when the scattering medium is spherically symmetric and dusty. However, if the scattering medium has a disk shape, such as face-on disk galaxies, and is viewed face-on, the doublet ratio is predicted to be higher than 2. It is also shown that doublet ratios as low as those observed in compact star-forming galaxies cannot be explained solely by pure dust attenuation of intrinsic Mg ii emission lines in spherical models unless dust opacity deviates markedly from that expected based on the dust-to-Mg+ gas ratio of our Galaxy. The importance of the continuum-pumped emission lines and expanding media is discussed to understand observational aspects, including doublet flux ratios, which can be lower than 1.5 or higher than 2, as well as symmetric or asymmetric line profiles. It is also discussed that the diffuse warm neutral medium may be an important source of Mg ii emission. These results provide insight into the complexity of the shape and orientation of distant, spatially unresolved galaxies.

<title>Resonant Absorption of Standing Magnetohydrodynamic Waves in Coronal Loops in the Absence of Directional Symmetry: The Effect of Plasma Flow</title>

<div> Magnetohydrodynamic, Standing Waves, Coronal Loops, Plasma Flow, Damping Rate
<br /><br />总结:
本文研究了日冕回路中静止磁流体动力学（MHD）波的振荡特性。研究模型将日冕回路建模为一个纯粹纵向磁场和沿磁场方向的等离子体流动的直筒。该模型包括一个不均匀的过渡层，导致波的谐振衰减。研究的目的是确定在流动回路中的静止MHD波的阻尼率，其中由于等离子体流动的存在，回路的方向对称性被破坏。为了解决这个问题，在采用的摄动方法中，我们让振荡频率和阻尼率都受到摄动。随着流速的增加，静止波的振荡频率减小，但阻尼率增加。因此，静止波的振荡频率与阻尼率的比值成为流速的一个更为下降的函数。流动是决定谐振吸收效果的重要因素。在流动回路中，即使是在薄的过渡层的情况下，谐振吸收也可以导致阻尼率达到周期时间的量级，这与观测结果一致。 <div>
The oscillation properties of standing magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves in coronal loops have been investigated. The coronal loop is modeled as a straight cylinder with a purely longitudinal magnetic field and a field-aligned plasma flow. The loop model includes an inhomogeneous transitional layer that causes the wave to be resonantly damped. Our aim is to determine the damping rate of the standing MHD waves in flowing loops, in which the directional symmetry of the loop has been broken due to the presence of plasma flow. To do this, the standing wave has been considered as the superposition of two propagating waves with opposite directions of propagation but the same oscillation frequency and damping rate. Due to the absence of directional symmetry in the loop, it seems that the propagating components of the standing wave cannot have the same oscillation frequency and damping rate. To overcome this problem, in the perturbation method employed, we let both the oscillation frequency and damping rate be perturbed. As the flow speed increases the oscillation frequency of the standing wave decreases but its damping rate increases. As a result, the ratio of the oscillation frequency to the damping rate of the standing wave becomes a more decreasing function of the flow speed. The flow is an important quantity in determining the effectiveness of resonant absorption. In flowing loops even in the case of a thin transitional layer, resonant absorption can result in a damping rate on the order of the period time, which is in agreement with observations.

<div> 关键词: 太阳耀斑, 电离层, X射线, 极端紫外线, 电子浓度
总结:
太阳耀斑发出的X射线和极端紫外辐射会导致地球电离层中电子浓度显著增加。过去的研究已经对太阳耀斑的冲击阶段对总电子含量（TEC）的影响进行了充分的研究，但最近的研究表明，大部分X级耀斑都会有一个强烈的“EUV晚期”辐射峰，其对电离层层化的影响尚不清楚。通过对2011年11月3日发生的X2.9太阳耀斑的冲击、逐渐和晚期阶段的太阳辐射及其引起的TEC变化进行综合分析，得出了较弱的Fe xv 28.4 nm太阳辐射在EUV晚期的高地球效应。研究发现，相对较弱的EUV晚期辐射对X2.9太阳耀斑的电离层反应几乎相当于冲击阶段的TEC增加的三分之一。 <div>
Variations in X-ray and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) irradiance during solar flares lead to a noticeable increase in the electron concentration in the illuminated part of the Earth’s ionosphere. Due to the large amount of experimental data accumulated by global navigation satellite systems, the total electron content (TEC) response to the impulsive phase of a solar flare has been studied quite well. However, recent studies have shown that a large fraction of X-class flares have a second strong peak of warm coronal emission (which is called “EUV late phase”), whose influence on the ionization of ionospheric layers is not yet clear. A combined analysis of successive solar emissions and the caused TEC changes made it possible to numerically estimate the ionospheric response to the impulsive, gradual, and late phases of the X2.9 solar flare that occurred on 2011 November 3 and demonstrate the high geoeffectiveness of the rather weak Fe xv 28.4 nm solar emission during the EUV late phase. It was found that the ionospheric response to the relatively weak emissions of the EUV late phase of the X2.9 solar flare amounted to almost a third of the TEC increase during the impulsive phase.

We report evidence for enhanced quenching in low-redshift galaxy clusters hosting radio relics. This effect is strongest for low-mass galaxies and is consistent with a rapid quenching of star formation. These results imply that merger shocks in the intracluster medium play a role in driving environmental quenching, which we argue is due to elevated ram pressure in these disturbed systems.

<br />
利用PCWI观测了AGC 102004的离子化气体(Hα和[N II])，并使用JCMT接收机进行了深入的CO(2–1)观测。Hα的速度场显示出北西部盘的异常分布，其谱线以两个高斯分量进行良好拟合，其中弱高斯分量由北西盘的异常Hα主导。Hα发射的高斯拟合中心偏离了+24.2 km s−1，得到的系统速度与H i发射的系统速度不符。我们利用[N II]λ6583/Hα比值作为代理推导了气相金属丰度12+log(O/H)，整个星系的平均值为8.30 ± 0.19。外部盘的金属丰度低至探测限7.72，表明AGC 102004存在金属丰度梯度。我们推测北西盘可能发生了次要/微小并合事件。AGC 102004中的CO(2–1)发射未探测到，噪声水平为0.33 mK，经过30 km s−1平滑。AGC 102004中的分子气体质量上限为2.1 × 107M⊙，XCO = 3.02 × 1020 cm−2 (K km s−1)−1。AGC 102004的M_gas/L_B比值低于0.0037，低于正常星系。

We present the integral field spectroscopic observations of ionized gas (Hα and [N II]) using the PCWI, along with deep CO(2–1) observations by the receiver on JCMT for AGC 102004. The velocity field of Hα shows an anomalous distribution in the northwestern (NW) disk. The Hα spectrum is well-fitted by two Gaussian components, and the weak Gaussian component is dominated by the anomalous Hα in the NW disk. The Gaussian fit center of Hα emission is offset by +24.2 km s−1 from the systemic velocity obtained from the H i emission. We derive the gas-phase metallicity, 12+log(O/H), using [N II]λ6583/Hα ratio as a proxy. The mean value of 12+log(O/H) is 8.30 ± 0.19 over the whole galaxy. The metallicity in the outer disk is lower than the detection limit of 7.72, indicating the metallicity gradient exists in AGC 102004. We speculate a minor/mini-merger event could have happened to the NW disk. CO(2–1) emission has nondetection in AGC 102004, reaching a noise level of 0.33 mK smoothed to 30 km s−1. The upper limit of molecular gas mass in AGC 102004 is 2.1 × 107M⊙ with XCO = 3.02 × 1020 cm−2 (K km s−1)−1. The /M of AGC 102004 is lower than 0.0037 and lower than that of normal galaxies.

Low-mass galaxies can significantly contribute to reionization due to their potentially high Lyman continuum (LyC) escape fraction and relatively high space density. We present a constraint on the LyC escape fraction from low-mass galaxies at z = 1.3–3.0. We obtained rest-frame UV continuum imaging with the ACS/SBC and the WFC3/UVIS from the Hubble Space Telescope for eight strongly lensed galaxies that were identified in the Sloan Giant Arc Survey and the Cluster Lensing and Supernova survey with Hubble. The targeted galaxies were selected to be spectroscopically confirmed, highly magnified, and blue in their UV spectral shapes (β < −1.7). Our targets include intrinsically low-luminosity galaxies down to a magnification-corrected absolute UV magnitude MUV ∼ −14. We perform custom-defined aperture photometry to place the most reliable upper limits of LyC escape from our sample. From our observations, we report no significant (>2σ) detections of LyC fluxes, placing 1σ upper limits on the absolute LyC escape fractions of 3%–15%. Our observations do not support the expected increased escape fractions of LyC photons from intrinsically UV faint sources. Considering the highly anisotropic geometry of LyC escape, increasing the sample size of faint galaxies in future LyC observations is crucial.

总结: 该研究调查了117个本地宿主低光度、宽谱线活动星系核(AGN)的星团质量和黑洞质量之间的关系。研究发现，相比于静止的黑洞，这些AGN的黑洞质量比早期星系中的黑洞要小上一个数量级。通过使用星团-盘分解和颜色相关的质量-光度比确定星团质量，发现这些AGN样本的黑洞质量与星系早期类型中的动态探测到的黑洞所定义的黑洞-星团质量关系仍存在明显偏离。研究提示，对于非椭圆形和星团主导系统的星系，使用传统的黑洞-星团质量关系可能会导致高度偏见的解释。这项工作对于与本地黑洞-星团质量关系相关的引力波探测和宇宙学模拟的预测具有直接影响。 <div>
We investigate the relation between black hole (BH) mass and bulge stellar mass for a sample of 117 local (z ∼ 0) galaxies hosting low-luminosity, broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Our sample comes from Reines & Volonteri, who found that, for a given total stellar mass, these AGNs have BH masses more than an order of magnitude smaller than those in early-type galaxies with quiescent BHs. Here, we aim to determine whether or not this AGN sample falls on the canonical BH-to-bulge mass relation by utilizing bulge–disk decompositions and determining bulge stellar masses using color-dependent mass-to-light ratios. We find that our AGN sample remains offset by more than an order of magnitude from the MBH–Mbulge relation defined by early-type galaxies with dynamically detected BHs. We caution that using canonical BH-to-bulge mass relations for galaxies other than ellipticals and bulge-dominated systems may lead to highly biased interpretations. This work bears directly on predictions for gravitational-wave detections and cosmological simulations that are tied to the local BH-to-bulge mass relations.

Measuring the properties of black hole images has the potential to constrain deviations from general relativity on horizon scales. Of particular interest is the ellipticity of the ring that is sensitive to the underlying spacetime. In 2019, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) produced the first-ever image of a black hole on horizon scales. Here, we reanalyze the M87* EHT 2017 data using Bayesian imaging (BI) techniques, constructing a posterior of the ring shape. We find that BI recovers the true on-sky ring shape more reliably than the original imaging methods used in 2019. As a result, we find that M87*'s ring ellipticity is and is consistent with the measured ellipticity from general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations.

总结:<br />
本文研究了使用uGMRT发现的10颗脉冲星的频谱特性，观测时间跨度为2017年至2023年，使用uGMRT的band 3（300-500 MHz）和band 4（550-750 MHz）。对这些脉冲星，我们报道了平均观测频段和所有观测时段的一系列频谱指数，范围约为0至-4.8。我们还计算了每颗脉冲星跨7-8个子频段的平均流量密度，计算了调制指数以及每个子频段内的平均和最大-中位数流量密度。我们使用流量密度的时间变化计算了折射闪烁时间尺度，并估计了样本中8颗脉冲星的时间滞后结构函数。我们注意到频谱的显著时间演化，分为三类：具有单一正频谱指数、多段折断功率谱、以及单一负频谱指数。此外，所有脉冲星均显示了低频拐点的迹象，拐点频率的时间变化（有些时段观测到了拐点，而另一些时段未观测到）也引起了注意。据我们所知，这是首次系统的探索脉冲星频谱和拐点频率的时间变化。未来的密集监测和频谱建模探索将为我们提供关于脉冲星固有发射特性和星际介质性质的重要见解。 <div>
This paper presents an investigation of the spectral properties of 10 millisecond pulsars (MSPs) discovered by the uGMRT, observed from 2017 to 2023 using band 3 (300–500 MHz) and 4 (550–750 MHz) of the uGMRT. For these MSPs, we have reported a range of spectral indices from ∼0 to −4.8, while averaging the full observing band and all the observing epochs. For every MSP, we calculated the mean flux density across 7–8 subbands, each with approximately 25 MHz bandwidth spanning band 3 and band 4. We computed their modulation indices as well as average and maximum-to-median flux density within each subband. Using the temporal variations of the flux density we calculated the refractive scintillation timescales and estimated a structure function with a time lag for eight MSPs in the sample. We note a significant temporal evolution of the in-band spectra, classified into three categories based on the nature of the best-fit power-law spectra, having single positive spectral indices, multiple broken power laws, and single negative spectral indices. Additionally, indications of a low-frequency turnover and temporal variations of the turnover frequency (to the extent that turnover was observed for some of the epochs while not seen for the rest) were noted for all the MSPs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic investigation probing temporal changes in MSP spectra as well as in the turnover frequency. Future exploration with dense monitoring combined with the modeling of spectra can provide vital insight into the intrinsic emission properties of MSPs and interstellar medium properties.

研究使用JWST的MIR观测19个邻近星系，发现PAH的分数在H ii区域急剧下降，显示了这些小颗粒在电离气体区域的破坏。而在H ii区域之外，PHANGS样本中的RPAH呈均匀分布，平均值为3.43 ± 0.98，对应于照射辐射强度为太阳邻域的2-5倍，PAH的值为3%-6%。 <div>
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a ubiquitous component of the interstellar medium (ISM) in z ∼ 0 massive, star-forming galaxies and play key roles in ISM energy balance, chemistry, and shielding. Wide field-of-view, high-resolution mid-infrared (MIR) images from JWST provide the ability to map the fraction of dust in the form of PAHs and the properties of these key dust grains at 10–50 pc resolution in galaxies outside the Local Group. We use MIR JWST photometric observations of a sample of 19 nearby galaxies from the Physics at High Angular Resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS) survey to investigate the variations of the PAH fraction. By comparison to lower-resolution far-infrared mapping, we show that a combination of the MIRI filters (RPAH = [F770W+F1130W]/F2100W) traces the fraction of dust by mass in the form of PAHs (i.e., the PAH fraction, or qPAH). Mapping RPAH across the 19 PHANGS galaxies, we find that the PAH fraction steeply decreases in H ii regions, revealing the destruction of these small grains in regions of ionized gas. Outside H ii regions, we find RPAH is constant across the PHANGS sample with an average value of 3.43 ± 0.98, which, for an illuminating radiation field of intensity 2–5 times that of the radiation field in the solar neighborhood, corresponds to qPAH values of 3%–6%.

在第四版Fermi-LAT 14年目录中，大部分的射电源仍未被识别。研究人员通过改进机器学习管道，成功对1206个具有信噪比大于3的X射线源进行分类，并在光学上对73个未被识别的Fermi-LAT 14年目录中的源进行了分类。他们对X射线源进行了八种天体物理类别的分类。作者还提出了未来的观测策略和管道改进，以实现更准确的分类。研究人员在光学数据中确定了42个GeV源的103个可靠X射线对应物。他们还发现2个GeV源可能是孤立的中子星候选体，16个可能是活跃星系核候选体，七个与星系的形成区相关，还有八个模糊的案例。最后，他们提出了管道的进一步改进以及可能导致更准确分类的观测策略。 
<br /><br />总结: <div>
A large fraction of Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT) sources in the fourth Fermi-LAT 14 yr catalog (4FGL) still remain unidentified (unIDed). We continued to improve our machine-learning pipeline and used it to classify 1206 X-ray sources with signal-to-noise ratios >3 located within the extent of 73 unIDed 4FGL sources with Chandra X-ray Observatory observations included in the Chandra Source Catalog 2.0. Recent improvements to our pipeline include astrometric corrections, probabilistic cross-matching to lower-frequency counterparts, and a more realistic oversampling method. X-ray sources are classified into eight broad predetermined astrophysical classes defined in the updated training data set, which we also release. We present details of the machine-learning classification, describe the pipeline improvements, and perform an additional spectral and variability analysis for brighter sources. The classifications give 103 plausible X-ray counterparts to 42 GeV sources. We identify 2 GeV sources as isolated neutron star candidates, 16 as active galactic nucleus candidates, seven as sources associated with star-forming regions, and eight as ambiguous cases. For the remaining 40 unIDed 4FGL sources, we could not identify any plausible counterpart in X-rays, or they are too close to the Galactic Center. Finally, we outline the observational strategies and further improvements in the pipeline that can lead to more accurate classifications.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章总结了Solar Orbiter（SO）任务的观测结果，研究了太阳风湍流的演变过程。通过对九个均匀湍流的扩展时间段的观测分析，确定了磁场涨落的波包和相干结构的特征。研究使用了两种小波进行分解，分别是能够解析波包和不连续性的Daubechies 10（Db10）和Haar小波。结果显示，在小尺度上，湍流涨落的概率分布函数（PDFs）呈现出伸展的尾部，在级联的外尺度处变为高斯分布。对小波涨落的PDFs进行直方图和Q-Q图比较，揭示了三个不同的行为阶段。研究还发现了在惯性范围和动能范围内，小波涨落的PDFs存在差异，并确定了波包和相干结构的物理特性在不同尺度范围内发生了交叉。这些结果为认识湍流级联过程中的不同物理机制提供了新的见解。 <div>
The Solar Orbiter (SO) mission provides the opportunity to study the evolution of solar wind turbulence. We use SO observations of nine extended intervals of homogeneous turbulence to determine when turbulent magnetic field fluctuations may be characterized as: (i) wave packets and (ii) coherent structures (CSs). We perform the first systematic scale-by-scale decomposition of the magnetic field using two wavelets known to resolve wave packets and discontinuities, the Daubechies 10 (Db10) and Haar, respectively. The probability distribution functions (PDFs) of turbulent fluctuations on small scales exhibit stretched tails, becoming Gaussian at the outer scale of the cascade. Using quantile–quantile plots, we directly compare the wavelet fluctuations PDFs, revealing three distinct regimes of behavior. Deep within the inertial range (IR) both decompositions give essentially the same fluctuation PDFs. Deep within the kinetic range (KR) the PDFs are distinct as the Haar decompositions have larger variance and more extended tails. On intermediate scales, spanning the IR–KR break, the PDF is composed of two populations: a core of common functional form containing ∼97% of fluctuations, and tails that are more extended for the Haar decompositions than the Db10 decompositions. This establishes a crossover between wave-packet (core) and CS (tail) phenomenology in the IR and KR, respectively. The range of scales where the PDFs are two-component is narrow at 0.9 au (4–16 s) and broader (0.5–8 s) at 0.4 au. As CS and wave–wave interactions are both candidates to mediate the turbulent cascade, these results offer new insights into the distinct physics of the IR and KR.

总结:<br />本研究利用帕克太阳探测器(FIELDS)仪器持续采集的谱数据，确定了威斯勒波的传播方向，并验证了技术的准确性。研究发现在25到35太阳半径范围内增强的威斯勒波主要是由于朝向太阳传播的波与磁场波动相关的磁场减小有关。在30到40太阳半径之间观察到逆向传播的情况，而在40到50太阳半径之间，朝向太阳和逆向传播的威斯勒波出现率相当。50太阳半径以上几乎没有观察到向太阳或逆向传播的威斯勒波。这些发现有助于更好地了解太阳风等离子体中威斯勒波的性质和行为。 <div>
In the interplanetary space solar wind plasma, whistler waves are observed in a wide range of heliocentric distances (from ∼20 solar radii (RS) to Jupiter’s orbit). They are known to interact with solar wind suprathermal electrons (strahl and halo) and to regulate the solar wind heat flux through scattering the strahl electrons. We present the results of applying the technique to determine the whistler wave propagation directions to the spectral data continuously collected by the FIELDS instruments on board Parker Solar Probe (PSP). The technique was validated based on the results obtained from burst mode magnetic and electric field waveform data collected during Encounter 1. We estimated the effective length of the PSP electric field antennas for a variety of solar wind conditions in the whistler wave frequency range and utilized these estimates for determining the whistler wave properties during PSP Encounters 1–11. Our findings show that (1) the enhancement of the whistler wave occurrence rate and wave amplitudes observed between 25 and 35 RS is predominantly due to the sunward-propagating whistler wave population associated with the switchback-related magnetic dips; (2) the antisunward or counterpropagating cases are observed at 30–40 RS; (3) between 40 and 50 RS, sunward and antisunward whistlers are observed with comparable occurrence rates; and (4) almost no sunward or counterpropagating whistlers were observed at heliocentric distances above 50 RS.

总结: CO排放已被广泛用作分子气体质量的示踪剂。文章通过Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array的观测数据，首次展示了对星暴星系中αCO建模结果的研究。研究发现，在Antennae星暴星系中，GMCs的αCO值约为普遍采用的银河系值的四分之一。此外，13CO/CO线比和GMC速度离散度可以用来推断星暴区域的αCO。研究还表明，Antennae星暴星系中的GMCs比普通螺旋星系中的GMCs更少地受到引力束缚。在千秒差距尺度上，建模出的αCO值比GMC尺度上的值小40％，这可能是由于包含了具有较低αCO值的弥散气体组分。对于千秒差距尺度上的αCO和CO强度之间存在着类似的相关性。<br /><br /> <div>
CO emission has been widely used as a tracer of molecular gas mass. However, it is a long-standing issue to accurately constrain the CO-to-H2 conversion factor (αCO) that converts CO luminosity to molecular gas mass, especially in starburst galaxies. We present the first resolved αCO modeling results with multiple Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array CO and 13CO transition observations at both giant molecular cloud (GMC) scale at 150 pc and kiloparsec scale for one of the closest starburst mergers, the Antennae. By combining our CO modeling results and measurements of 350 GHz dust continuum, we find that most GMCs in the Antennae have αCO values approximately four times smaller than the commonly adopted Milky Way value (4.3). We find that αCO at GMC scales shows a strong dependence on CO intensity, 13CO/CO ratio, and GMC velocity dispersion, which is consistent with various theoretical and simulation predictions. Specifically, we suggest that the 13CO/CO line ratio and the velocity dispersion can be used to infer αCO in starburst regions. By applying our modeled αCO in GMC analyses, we find that GMCs in the Antennae are less gravitationally bound than in normal spiral galaxies, which is more consistent with what is predicted by merger simulations. At kiloparsec scale, we find that our modeled αCO values are smaller than the modeled αCO at GMC scale by 40%, which can be due to inclusion of a diffuse gas component with lower αCO values. We find a similar correlation of αCO and CO intensity at kiloparsec scales to that at GMC scales.

The Rockets for Extended-source X-ray Spectroscopy (tREXS) are a series of suborbital rocket payloads designed to collect spectral emission from extended astronomical sources of soft X-rays. The tREXS spectrograph uses mechanical beam-shaping modules and reflection gratings to passively focus and then disperse incident X-rays to an array of Teledyne/e2v CIS 113 CMOS X-ray sensors. Designed to achieve a moderate spectral resolution, R ⪆ 50, from ≈15 to 40 Å over a large field of view (>10 deg2), the tREXS instrument is sensitive to line emission from key ion species over the soft-X-ray band. Here we present the complete end-to-end design of the tREXS spectrograph and discuss its significance and expected performance, using simulated observations of the Cygnus Loop supernova remnant and an enhanced region in the soft X-ray background.

<div> 关键词: 银河系, 恒星年龄, 星周围, 化学元素, 运动轨道
总结: 
本文报告了对120颗高径向轨道的亚巨星星周围恒星的发表年龄，这些星星可能属于盖亚-恒河/香肠(GES)星系的残骸。这些星系中大部分恒星年龄较老，中位数为11.6亿年，16分位数为10.5亿年和84分位数为12.7亿年。然而，分布呈偏态，存在一些年龄较轻的星星，它们的年龄范围在6-9亿年左右。所有高径向轨道的星周围恒星具有与GES残骸相关的化学和运动/轨道特性。初步结果表明，这些中间年龄的星星并非来自质量转移和/或恒星并合，这可能会降低它们的年龄确定。如果未来的光谱光度学研究证实了这一结论，那么这些星星的存在将对限制GES并购的性质和银河系的吸积历史构成重要挑战。 <br /><br /> <div>
Reconstructing the mass assembly history of the Milky Way relies on obtaining detailed measurements of the properties of many stars in the galaxy, especially in the stellar halo. One of the most constraining quantities is stellar age, as it can shed light on the accretion time and quenching of star formation in merging satellites. However, obtaining reliable age estimates for large samples of halo stars is difficult. We report published ages of 120 subgiant halo stars with highly radial orbits that likely belong to the debris of the Gaia-Enceladus/Sausage (GES) galaxy. The majority of these halo stars are old, with an age distribution characterized by a median of 11.6 Gyr and a 16th (84th) percentile of 10.5 (12.7) Gyr. However, the distribution is skewed, with a tail of younger stars that span ages down to ∼6–9 Gyr. All highly radial halo stars have chemical and kinematic/orbital quantities that associate them with the GES debris. Initial results suggest that these intermediate-age stars are not a product of mass transfer and/or stellar mergers, which can bias their age determination low. If this conclusion is upheld by upcoming spectrophotometric studies, then the presence of these stars will pose an important challenge for constraining the properties of the GES merger and the accretion history of the galaxy.

<div> 星系密度；恒星质量函数；过密环境；Elentári proto-supercluster；融合率

总结：<br /><br />本研究分析了在COSMOS领域中，恒星质量函数（SMF）随恒星质量的数量密度变化，比较了过密环境和同期场域中的SMF。研究区域包括Elentári proto-supercluster，其中包含六个延伸的过密区域，每边约70 cMpc。研究发现，过密区域的高质量星系相对于低质量星系的比例增加，表明在过密环境中恒星质量的积累速度较快。尽管过密区域和场域在z∼3.3时的SMF存在差异，但这一结果与对z∼1时的星系团的分析是一致的，表明过密环境可能通过增加融合率来促进成员星系的演化。然而，是否这种增进是在原生星系团环境中开始，甚至更早的群环境中开始，仍不清楚。研究发现，过密环境与场域之间测得的静止星系比例差异不大，暗示这种恒星质量的增进是持续进行的，并且由融合活动引发的星暴尚未熄灭。需要更多良好表征的过密区域样本才能得出更广泛的结论。 <div>
We present an analysis of the number density of galaxies as a function of stellar mass (i.e., the stellar mass function (SMF)) in the COSMOS field at z ∼ 3.3, making a comparison between the SMF in overdense environments and the SMF in the coeval field. In particular, this region contains the Elentári proto-supercluster, a system of six extended overdensities spanning ∼70 cMpc on a side. A clear difference is seen in the high-mass slope of these SMFs, with overdense regions showing an increase in the ratio of high-mass galaxies to low-mass galaxies relative to the field, indicating a more rapid buildup of stellar mass in overdense environments. This result qualitatively agrees with analyses of clusters at z ∼ 1, though the differences between protocluster and field SMFs at z ∼ 3.3 are smaller. While this is consistent with overdensities enhancing the evolution of their member galaxies, potentially through increased merger rates, whether this enhancement begins in protocluster environments or even earlier in group environments is still unclear. Though the measured fractions of quiescent galaxies between the field and overdense environments do not vary significantly, implying that this stellar mass enhancement is ongoing and any starbursts triggered by merger activity have not yet quenched, we note that spectroscopic observations are biased toward star-forming populations, particularly for low-mass galaxies. If mergers are indeed responsible, high-resolution imaging of Elentári and similar structures at these early epochs should then reveal increased merger rates relative to the field. Larger samples of well-characterized overdensities are necessary to draw broader conclusions in these areas.

We report experimental values for the CH stretch frequencies of the protonated fullerenes C60H+ and C70H+. Anharmonic frequency calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G level of theory, which are independent of empirical scaling factors, reproduce the experimental values to within approximately 5 cm−1. Scaling theoretical harmonic frequencies by applying factors derived for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons deviate significantly from the experimentally measured frequency. We attribute this deviation to the unusual hydrocarbon structure that affects the degree of anharmonicity of the CH stretch. This result allows us to propose an original, specific scaling factor of 0.9524 to correct harmonic frequencies of CH stretches of protonated fullerenes calculated at the B3LYP/6-311 + G(d,p) level of theory. The special spectral position of the protonated fullerene CH stretch bands makes it a diagnostic marker that may aid in their detection in the interstellar medium.

总结:
Radcliffe wave (RW)的运动信息对于确定其存在以及获取关于其起源和演化的洞察是至关重要的。本文利用径向速度（RV）测量，通过两种方法准确测量了RW的垂直速度（VZ），这是先前被忽略的关键信息。首先，利用年轻恒星的RV测量和Gaia DR3的天体运动测量，测量了朝向年轻恒星的速度。其次，将云的RV测量与关联年轻恒星物体的天体运动测量相结合，确定了云的垂直速度。结果显示，VZ的振荡与垂直坐标Z不同步，与先前研究的结论不同。相反，我们发现VZ沿着RW呈现出每千秒5公里的梯度，呈现出一个偶极子的模式。因此，这种运动的排列与空间排列不相一致，这对RW模型提出了质疑。 <div>
The kinematic information of the Radcliffe wave (RW) is essential for determining its existence and gaining insights into its origin and evolution. In this work, we present an accurate measurement of the vertical velocity (VZ) of the RW by incorporating the radial velocity (RV) measures through two methods, which is crucial but was neglected previously. First, the velocities are measured toward young stars, using their RV measurements from APOGEE-2 and proper motion measurements from Gaia DR3. Second, we combine RV measurements toward clouds with proper motion measurements of associated young stellar objects to determine the vertical velocities of the clouds. The results reveal that the oscillations in VZ are not synchronous with the vertical coordinate Z, which differs from the conclusions of previous studies. Instead, we find a 5 km s−1 kpc−1 gradient in VZ along the RW, exhibiting a dipole-like pattern. Consequently, the kinematic arrangement does not show a corresponding coherence with the spatial arrangement, bringing the RW model into question.

Modern cosmological research in large-scale structure has witnessed an increasing number of machine-learning applications. Among them, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have received substantial attention due to their outstanding performance in image classification, cosmological parameter inference, and various other tasks. However, many models based on CNNs are criticized as "black boxes" due to the difficulties in relating their outputs intuitively and quantitatively to the cosmological fields under investigation. To overcome this challenge, we present the Cosmological Correlator Convolutional Neural Network (C3NN)—a fusion of CNN architecture and cosmological N-point correlation functions (NPCFs). We demonstrate that its output can be expressed explicitly in terms of the analytically tractable NPCFs. Together with other auxiliary algorithms, we can open the "black box" by quantitatively ranking different orders of the interpretable outputs based on their contribution to classification tasks. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate this by applying our framework to a series of binary classification tasks using Gaussian and log-normal random fields and relating its outputs to the NPCFs describing the two fields. Furthermore, we exhibit the model's ability to distinguish different dark energy scenarios (w0 = −0.95 and −1.05) using N-body simulated weak-lensing convergence maps and discuss the physical implications coming from their interpretability. With these tests, we show that C3NN combines advanced aspects of machine learning architectures with the framework of cosmological NPCFs, thereby making it an exciting tool to extract physical insights in a robust and explainable way from observational data.

UV wind-line variability in OB stars appears to be universal. In order to quantify this variation and to estimate its effect on a mass-loss rate determined from a single observation, we use the International Ultraviolet Explorer archive to identify nonpeculiar OB stars with well-developed but unsaturated Si ivλ1400 doublets and at least 10 independent observations. This resulted in 1699 spectra of 25 stars. A simple model was used to translate the observed profile variations into optical depth variations and, hence, variations in measured mass-loss rates. These variations quantify the intrinsic error inherent in any single mass-loss rate derived from a single observation. The derived rates have an overall 1σ variation of about 22%, but this appears to differ with Teff, being as small at 8% for the hottest stars and up to 45% for the cooler ones. Furthermore, any single determination can differ from the mean by a factor of 2 or more. Our results also imply that mass-loss rates determined from nonsimultaneous observations (such as UV and ground-based data) need not agree. In addition, we use our results to examine the nature of the structures responsible for the variability. Our findings suggest that the optical depth variations result from optically very thick structures occulting more or less of the line of sight to the stellar disk. Further, the smaller optical depth variations in the hottest stars suggest that the structures responsible for the variations are disrupted in their more powerful winds.

Previous observations have found lower 14N/15N ratios in the Galactic center and higher values in the Galactic disk. This is consistent with the inside-out formation scenario of our Milky Way. However, previous studies mostly utilized double isotope ratios also including 12C/13C, which introduces additional uncertainties. Here we present observations of C14N and its rare isotopologue, C15N, toward a sample of star-forming regions measured by the IRAM 30 m and/or the ARO 12 m telescope at λ ∼ 3 mm wavelength. For those 35 sources detected in both isotopologues, physical parameters are determined. Furthermore, we have obtained nitrogen isotope ratios using the strongest hyperfine components of CN and C15N. For those sources showing small deviations from local thermodynamical equilibrium and/or self-absorption, the weakest hyperfine component, likely free of the latter effect, was used to obtain reliable 14N/15N values. Our measured 14N/15N isotope ratios from C14N and C15N measurements are compatible with those from our earlier measurements of NH3 and 15NH3 (Paper I), i.e., increasing ratios to a Galactocentric distance of ∼9 kpc. The unweighted second-order polynomial fit yields . Toward the outer galaxy, the isotope ratio tends to decrease, supporting an earlier finding by H13CN/HC15N. Galactic chemical evolution models are consistent with our measurements of the 14N/15N isotope ratio, i.e., a rising trend from the Galactic center region to approximately 9 kpc, followed by a decreasing trend with increasing RGC toward the outer Galaxy.

这篇文章总结了对最明亮的伽马射线暴（GRB）221009A的研究。研究发现其具有超长的特点，并采用Swift探测到的GRB样本进行了比较分析。研究表明，GRB 221009A可能与collapsar场景和高速自转的恒星有关，而不太可能与超新星有关。此外，还使用了MESA工具对低金属量的大质量恒星的演化进行了模拟。研究结果表明，高速自转的大质量恒星可能是ULGRB的潜在祖先。 <br /><br />总结: 本文讨论了GRB 221009A的超长特点，对比分析了Swift探测到的GRB样本，提出了可能的ULGRB中心引擎，排除了与超新星相关的可能性，并使用MESA模拟了潜在的ULGRB祖先的物理特性。 <div>
The brightest gamma-ray burst (GRB) ever, GRB 221009A, displays ultralong GRB (ULGRB) characteristics, with a prompt emission duration exceeding 1000 s. To constrain the origin and central engine of this unique burst, we analyze its prompt and afterglow characteristics and compare them to the established set of similar GRBs. To achieve this, we statistically examine a nearly complete sample of Swift-detected GRBs with measured redshifts. We categorize the sample to bronze, silver, and gold by fitting a Gaussian function to the log-normal of T90 duration distribution and considering three subsamples respectively to 1, 2, and 3 times of the standard deviation to the mean value. GRB 221009A falls into the gold subsample. Our analysis of prompt emission and afterglow characteristics aims to identify trends between the three burst groups. Notably, the gold subsample (a higher likelihood of being ULGRB candidates) suggests a collapsar scenario with a hyperaccreting black hole as a potential central engine, while a few GRBs (GRB 060218, GRB 091024A, and GRB 100316D) in our gold subsample favor a magnetar. Late-time near-IR observations from 3.6 m Devasthal Optical Telescope rule out the presence of any bright supernova associated with GRB 221009A in the gold subsample. To further constrain the physical properties of ULGRB progenitors, we employ the tool MESA to simulate the evolution of low-metallicity massive stars with different initial rotations. The outcomes suggest that rotating (Ω ≥ 0.2 Ωc) massive stars could potentially be the progenitors of ULGRBs within the considered parameters and initial inputs to MESA.

We report our search for infrared excesses in the Spitzer/Infrared Array Camera survey of the Kepler field at 3.6 and 4.5 μm. The Spitzer Kepler Survey contains ∼190,000 targets, which we reduce to ∼117,000 targets after applying multiple filters to arrive at a high-quality sample for spectral energy distribution fitting. Of the ∼117,000, we find 11 Sun-like stars (Teff ∼ 6000 K) with infrared excesses of high significance (>4σ) ranging from 10% to 40% above the photosphere at 4.5 μm, which is characteristic of debris disk systems. Blackbody fits of the infrared excesses for the 11 debris disk candidates suggest dust temperatures of 400–1400 K. None of the candidates have reported exoplanet detections. High-quality 1–5 μm or longer spectra or photometry would be necessary to confirm the candidates as debris disk systems.

<br />总结:
该研究利用ALMA多频尘埃连续观测数据对5 < z < 8的28个光谱确认的Lyman break星系进行了分析。研究发现，在z ∼ 6的星系中，红外过量与紫外斜率之间的关系较之前的z ∼ 2-4的结果更为浅。另外，对于z ∼ 6-7的星系，观测到的尘埃温度平均值支持从z = 0到z ∼ 6-7的温度缓慢增加。研究还讨论了尘埃温度的红移演化可以通过气体耗尽时间尺度和金属丰度的降低来解释。此外，高红移星系中观测到的尘埃温度的多样性也可以通过星系主序的离散和平均质量-金属丰度关系的变化来自然解释，包括在z = 8.3的一个星系中观测到的极高尘埃温度(Tdust > 80 K)。 <div>
We present an analysis of the Atacama Large Millimeter-submillimeter Array (ALMA) multiband dust continuum observations for 28 spectroscopically confirmed bright Lyman break galaxies at 5 < z < 8. Our sample consists of 11 galaxies at z ∼ 6 newly observed in our ALMA program, which substantially increases the number of 5 < z < 8 galaxies with both rest-frame 88 and 158 μm continuum observations, allowing us to simultaneously measure the IR luminosity and dust temperature for a statistical sample of z ≳ 5 galaxies for the first time. We derive the relationship between the ultraviolet (UV) slope (βUV) and infrared excess (IRX) for the z ∼ 6 galaxies, and find a shallower IRX–βUV relation compared to the previous results at z ∼ 2–4. Based on the IRX–βUV relation consistent with our results and the βUV–MUV relation including fainter galaxies in the literature, we find a limited contribution of the dust-obscured star formation to the total star formation rate density, ∼30% at z ∼ 6. Our measurements of the dust temperature at z ∼ 6–7, on average, support a gentle increase of Tdust from z = 0 to z ∼ 6–7. Using an analytic model with parameters consistent with recent James Webb Space Telescope results, we discuss that the observed redshift evolution of the dust temperature can be reproduced by an ∼0.6 dex decrease in the gas depletion timescale and ∼0.4 dex decrease in the metallicity. The variety of Tdust observed at high redshifts can also be naturally explained by scatters around the star formation main sequence and average mass–metallicity relation including an extremely high dust temperature of Tdust > 80 K observed in a galaxy at z = 8.3.

Panspermia is the hypothesis that life originated on Earth from the bombardment of foreign interstellar ejecta harboring polyextremophile microorganisms. Since the 2017 discovery of the interstellar body ‘Oumuamua (1I/2017 U1) by the Pan-STARRS telescope, various studies have reexamined panspermia based on updated number density models that accommodate for ‘Oumuamua’s properties. By utilizing ‘Oumuamua’s properties as an anchor, we estimate the mass and number density of ejecta in the interstellar medium (ρm [units of kg au−3] and ρn [units of au−3]). We build upon prior work by first accounting for the minimum ejecta size to shield microbes from supernova radiation. Second, we estimate the total number of impact events Cn on Earth after its formation and prior to the emergence of life (≈0.8 Gyr). We derive a conditional probability relation for the likelihood of panspermia for Earth specifically of <10−5, given a number of factors including fB, the fraction of ejecta harboring extremophiles and other factors that are poorly constrained. However, we find that panspermia is a plausible potential life-seeding mechanism for (optimistically) potentially up to ∼105 of the ∼109 Earth-sized habitable zone worlds in our Galaxy.

Line intensity mapping (LIM) has emerged as a promising tool for probing the 3D large-scale structure through the aggregate emission of spectral lines. The presence of interloper lines poses a crucial challenge in extracting the signal from the target line in LIM. In this work, we introduce a novel method for LIM analysis that simultaneously extracts line signals from multiple spectral lines, utilizing the covariance of native LIM data elements defined in the spectral–angular space. We leverage correlated information from different lines to perform joint inference on all lines simultaneously, employing a Bayesian analysis framework. We present the formalism, demonstrate our technique with a mock survey setup resembling the SPHEREx deep-field observation, and consider four spectral lines within the SPHEREx spectral coverage in the near-infrared: Hα, [O iii], Hβ, and [O ii]. We demonstrate that our method can extract the power spectrum of all four lines at the ≳10σ level at z < 2. For the brightest line, Hα, the 10σ sensitivity can be achieved out to z ∼ 3. Our technique offers a flexible framework for LIM analysis, enabling simultaneous inference of signals from multiple line emissions while accommodating diverse modeling constraints and parameterizations.

总结:<br />
这篇文章报告了2MASS J22132050−5137385这颗非常金属贫的星的恒星参数和化学丰度。这颗星的光谱呈现出异常强烈的铁组元素以外的元素线，分析揭示这些元素产生于快速中子俘获（r-过程）核合成。星中铪和铀的检测使得计算出了r-过程物质的年龄为13.6 ± 2.6 Gyr。此外，该星含有相对较大的元素增益，可能是由于超铀裂变碎片的产生。该文提出了一种新方法来评估r-过程增强星样本中的r-过程产物产量和气体稀释。根据假设的普通重子迷你暗物质晕的质量和金属保留率，得出该星形成于一个质量约为600 M⊙的云团。因此，文章得出结论，2MASS J22132050−5137385具有高水平的r-过程增强，因为它形成于r-过程物质稀释程度低于平均水平的环境中。 <div>
We present stellar parameters and chemical abundances of 47 elements detected in the bright (V = 11.63) very metal-poor ([Fe/H] = −2.20 ± 0.12) star 2MASS J22132050−5137385. We observed this star using the Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle spectrograph as part of ongoing work by the R-Process Alliance. The spectrum of 2MASS J22132050−5137385 exhibits unusually strong lines of elements heavier than the iron group, and our analysis reveals that these elements were produced by rapid neutron-capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis. We derive a europium enhancement, [Eu/Fe] = +2.45 ± 0.08, that is higher than any other r-process-enhanced star known at present. This star is only the eighth r-process-enhanced star where both thorium and uranium are detected, and we calculate the age of the r-process material, 13.6 ± 2.6 Gyr, from the radioactive decay of these isotopes. This star contains relatively large enhancements of elements that may be produced as transuranic fission fragments, and we propose a new method using this characteristic to assess the r-process yields and gas dilution in samples of r-process-enhanced stars. Assuming a canonical baryonic minihalo mass of 106M⊙ and a 1% metal retention rate, this star formed in a cloud of only ∼600 M⊙. We conclude that 2MASS J22132050−5137385 exhibits a high level of r-process enhancement because it formed in an environment where the r-process material was less diluted than average.

In the hierarchical evolution framework of cosmology, larger halos grow through matter accretion and halo mergers. To clarify halo evolution, we need to define the halo mass and radius physically. However, the pseudoevolution problem makes the process difficult. Thus, we aim to measure the splash-back radius (Rsp), a physically defined halo radius for a large number of halos with various mass and redshift, and to determine the most important parameters that affect it. We use the typical definition of splash-back radius as the radius with the steepest radial density profile. In this work, we measure the splash-back radius of dark matter halos within the mass of 1013M⊙ to 3 × 1015M⊙ and redshifts spanning 0.08–0.65. This is the measurement of the Rsp in the largest range of halo mass and redshift. Using the shear catalog of the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey Data Release 8, we investigate the splash-back radius of halos associated with galaxies and galaxy clusters identified in the various catalogs. Our finding reveals a trend wherein massive halos demonstrate a larger splash-back radius, and the normalized splash-back radius (Rsp/R200m) shows a U-shaped mass evolution. The upturn in these relations mainly comes from the contribution of massive halos with low redshifts. We further find the splash-back radius increases with the peak height, while the normalized splash-back radius has a negative relation with the peak height. We also find that Rsp ≳ R200m for most halos, indicating their low accretion rates. Our result is consistent with previous literature across a wide range of mass, redshift, and peak height, as well as the simulation work from More et al.

In NGC 2992, a galaxy-scale ionized gas outflow driven by active galactic nuclei (AGNs) has long been recognized, yet its impact on the host galaxy has remained elusive. In this paper, we utilize data from the archival Very Large Telescope/MUSE to present a spatially resolved analysis of stellar populations in this galaxy. Two different stellar population templates are employed to fit the stellar continuum, allowing us to determine the light-weighted stellar age, metallicity, the fraction of the young stellar population (age <100 Myr, PY), and the average age and metallicity of PY. Our results reveal the presence of a very young stellar population (≤40 Myr) within the dust lane and nearly along the galaxy’s major axis. The light-weighted stellar age and the fraction of PY show negative trends along the major and minor axes. The average age and metallicity of PY present positive trends with increasing distance, except along the northern direction of the major axis. Within the circumnuclear region (<1 kpc), the distribution of the young stellar population is spatially anticorrelated with the AGN outflow cone. The highest fraction of PY is observed at the outskirts of the nuclear radio bubble in the northern region near the nucleus. Considering the coupling efficiency and timescales, we propose that the AGN outflow in this galaxy may exert both negative and positive feedback on its host. Additionally, the star formation and the AGN activities could be attributed to the interaction between NGC 2992 and NGC 2993.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Deep JWST imaging of the giant galaxy cluster A2744, at redshift z = 0.308, is used to explore the features of its rich population of globular clusters (GCs), building on our initial survey of the system. We use the photometry of more than 10,000 GCs over a 3 mag range to construct the GC luminosity function and color distribution. These results now specifically account for photometric incompleteness as a function of location relative to the five giant galaxies that dominate the gravitational potential of A2744. The total GC population in A2744 is estimated at NGC ≥ 1.1 × 105, consistent with its high total mass. We also directly compare the observed distributions with theoretical predictions for GC populations drawn from the recent EMP-Pathfinder simulations, viewed at the same 3.5 Gyr look-back time as the cluster. The simulations match the observations well, with the only notable disagreement being that the simulations predict larger numbers of GCs at high metallicity formed after z ≃ 2 than are seen in the data.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report results from a detailed study of the neutron star X-ray binary, 4U 1608-52, using observations with AstroSat (Large Area X-ray Proportional Counter/Soft X-ray Telescope) and the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer during its 2016 and 2020 outbursts. The 0.7–20.0 keV spectra could be well described with the disk blackbody and thermal Comptonization model. The best-fitting inner disk temperature is ∼1 keV and radius ∼ –27.19 km and no significant evolution was observed in the disk radius after performing flux and time-resolved spectroscopy. We used a multi-Lorentzian approach to fit the power density spectra and obtained broadband noise variability. We estimated the energy-dependent fractional rms and time lag of the broadband noise, and these variations are quantitatively modeled as being due to the coherent variation of the disk emission and the coronal heating rate. Thus, the rapid temporal modeling is consistent with the longer-term spectral evolution where the inner disk radius does not vary, and instead, the variations can be attributed to accretion rate variations that change the inner disk temperature and the coronal heating rate.

<title>Simulated Coronal Mass Ejections on a Young Solar-type Star and the Associated Instantaneous Angular Momentum Loss</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) on stars can change the stars’ magnetic field configurations and mass-loss rates during the eruption and propagation and therefore, may affect the stars’ rotation properties on long timescales. The dynamics of stellar CMEs and their influence on the stellar angular momentum loss rate are not yet well understood. In order to start investigating these CME-related aspects on other stars, we conducted a series of magnetohydrodynamic simulations of CMEs on a solar-type star of moderate activity levels. The propagation and evolution of the CMEs were traced in the three-dimensional outputs and the temporal evolution of their dynamic properties (such as masses, velocities, and kinetic energies) were determined. The simulated stellar CMEs are more massive and energetic than their solar analog, which is a result of the stronger magnetic field on the surface of the simulated star than that of the Sun. The simulated CMEs display masses ranging from ∼1016 to ∼1018 g and kinetic energies from ∼1031 to ∼1033 erg. We also investigated the instantaneous influence of the CMEs on the star’s angular momentum loss rate. Our results suggest that angular momentum can either be added to or removed from the star during the evolution of CME events. We found a positive correlation between the amplitude of the angular momentum loss rate variation and the CME’s kinetic energy as well as mass, suggesting that more energetic/massive CMEs have a higher possibility to add angular momentum to the star.

Weak G-band stars (WGBs) are a unique class of objects characterized by weak CH molecular lines in the Fraunhofer G band, indicative of a deficiency in 12C. This peculiar spectral feature is often accompanied by significant enrichments in N and, occasionally, Li and Na abundances. Despite their rarity and recent discoveries of new WGB candidates, the underlying formation mechanism of these stars remains unknown. In this study, we present a comprehensive chemical analysis of four neglected WGBs: HD 54627, HD 105783, HD 198718, and HD 201557. These stars, though identified as WGBs, have been poorly studied to date. Our analysis utilizes high-resolution échelle spectra with a power resolution of R ≈ 48,000, complemented by photometric and astrometric data from the literature. Applying the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) approximation we determine the chemical abundance and then we conduct posterior non-LTE (NLTE) corrections for specific chemical abundances, including Li, O, Na, and Mg. Additionally, we provide details on the projected rotational velocities ( ) and conduct a thorough investigation of the kinematics and orbits of our sample, comparing them with other well-studied WGBs reported in the literature. Our findings indicate that these stars originate from the thin disk, as evidenced by the absence of alpha-element enrichment and kinematics. Notably, half of the WGBs in our sample exhibit Li-rich characteristics, and we identify no rapid rotators ( 8.0 km s−1) or infrared excess among our studied stars.

<title>Magnetohydrodynamic Modeling of Background Solar Wind near Mars: Comparison with MAVEN and Tianwen-1</title>

Combined with data assimilation methods, a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) numerical model is an effective tool to explore the mechanism of space weather. As a driver of space weather, the dynamic development of stream interaction regions (SIRs) near the orbit of Mars is an area of active research. In this study, we use the interplanetary total variation diminishing (TVD) MHD model to simulate solar wind parameters and model SIRs near Mars from 2021 November 15 to 2021 December 31. In this model, the MHD equations are solved by the conservation TVD Lax–Friedrichs scheme in a rotating spherical coordinate system with six component meshes used on the spherical shell. Solar wind velocity, density, temperature, and magnetic field strength are given at the inner boundary due to the characteristic waves propagating outward. We compared modeled results with observations from Mars Atmospheric Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) and Tianwen-1 (China’s first Mars exploration mission). Statistical analysis shows that the simulated results can capture SIRs and are in good agreement with observations; moreover, the assimilated results based on the Kalman filter improve the accuracy of numerical prediction compared with simulated results. This paper is the first attempt to simulate SIR events combined with MAVEN and Tianwen-1 in situ observations. Our work demonstrates that using the MHD model with the Kalman filter to reconstruct solar wind parameters can help us study the characteristics of SIRs near Mars, improve the capabilities of space weather forecasting, and understand the background solar wind environment.

<title>Denser Environments Cultivate Larger Galaxies: A Comprehensive Study beyond the Local Universe with 3 Million Hyper Suprime-Cam Galaxies</title>

The relationship between galaxy size and environment has remained enigmatic, with over a decade of conflicting results. We present one of the first comprehensive studies of the variation of galaxy radius with environment beyond the local Universe and demonstrate that large-scale environmental density is correlated with galaxy radius independent of stellar mass and galaxy morphology. We confirm with >5σ confidence that galaxies in denser environments are up to ∼25% larger than their equally massive counterparts with similar morphology in less dense regions of the Universe. We achieve this result by correlating projected two-dimensional densities over ∼360 deg2 with the structural parameters of ∼3 million Hyper Suprime-Cam galaxies at 0.3 ≤ z < 0.7 with . Compared to most previous studies, this sample is ∼100–10,000 times larger and goes ∼1 dex deeper in mass completeness. We demonstrate that past conflicting results have been driven by small sample sizes and a lack of robust measurement uncertainties. We verify the presence of the above correlation separately for disk-dominated, bulge-dominated, star-forming, and quiescent subpopulations. We find the strength of the correlation to be dependent on redshift, stellar mass, and morphology. The correlation is strongest at lower redshifts and systematically weakens or disappears beyond z ≥ 0.5. At z ≥ 0.5, more massive galaxies still display a statistically significant correlation. Although some existing theoretical frameworks can be selectively invoked to explain some of the observed correlations, our work demonstrates the need for more comprehensive theoretical investigations of the correlation between galaxy size and environment.

PINT is a pure-Python framework for high-precision pulsar timing developed on top of widely used and well-tested Python libraries, supporting both interactive and programmatic data analysis workflows. We present a new frequentist framework within PINT to characterize the single-pulsar noise processes present in pulsar timing data sets. This framework enables parameter estimation for both uncorrelated and correlated noise processes, as well as model comparison between different timing and noise models in a computationally inexpensive way. We demonstrate the efficacy of the new framework by applying it to simulated data sets as well as a real data set of PSR B1855+09. We also describe the new features implemented in PINT since it was first described in the literature.

We conduct a spectral and timing analysis of GX 339−4 and EXO 1846−031 with the aim of studying the evolution of type-C quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) with spectral parameters. The high-cadence data from Insight-HXMT and NICER allow us to track the evolution of QPOs and spectra simultaneously. Type-C QPOs appear at the end of the low–hard state and/or the hard–intermediate state. Our results reveal that the QPO frequency is closely related to the inner disk radius and mass accretion rate in the two sources. This correlation aligns well with the dynamic frequency model of a truncated disk.

<title>Unraveling the Trigger Mechanism of Explosive Reconnection in Partially Ionized Solar Plasma</title>

Plasmoid instability usually accounts for the onset of fast reconnection events observed in astrophysical plasmas. However, the measured reconnection rate from observations can be one order of magnitude higher than that derived from magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. In this study, we present the results of magnetic reconnection in the partially ionized low solar atmosphere based on 2.5D MHD simulations. The whole reconnection process covers two different fast reconnection phases. In the first phase, the slow Sweet–Parker reconnection transits to the plasmoid-mediated reconnection, and the reconnection rate reaches about 0.02. In the second phase, a faster explosive reconnection appears, with the reconnection rate reaching above 0.06. At the same time, a sharp decrease in plasma temperature and density at the principle X-point is observed, which is associated with the strong radiative cooling, the ejection of hot plasma from the local reconnection region, or the motion of the principle X-point from a hot and dense region to a cool and less dense region along the narrow current sheet. This causes gas pressure depletion and increases magnetic diffusion at the main X-point, resulting in the local Petschek-like reconnection and a violent and rapid increase in the reconnection rate. This study for the first time reveals a common phenomenon where the plasmoid-dominated reconnection transits to an explosive faster reconnection with a rate approaching the order of 0.1 in partially ionized plasma in the MHD scale.

<title>Hadronuclear Interactions in Active Galactic Nuclei Jets as the Origin of the Diffuse High-energy Neutrino Background</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The origin of diffuse high-energy neutrinos from TeV to PeV energies detected by the IceCube Observatory remains a mystery. In our previous work, we have shown that hadronuclear (p − p) interactions in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) jets could be important and generate detectable very-high-energy emissions. Here, we further explore these interactions in the AGN jets based on their luminosity function. The diffuse neutrino flux and corresponding γ-ray flux have been calculated and compared with observational data. In our modeling, two beaming patterns are considered separately. To make sure that the corresponding γ-ray flux does not overshoot the diffuse γ-ray background, we find that if the neutrino production region in a jet is opaque to γ-rays, p − p interactions in AGN jets with a small viewing angle (the blazar case) are able to interpret the PeV neutrino background. Similarly, AGN jets with a large viewing angle (the radio galaxy case) may interpret the TeV neutrino background. While, if the neutrino production region is transparent to γ-rays, only blazars have the potential to interpret the diffuse neutrino background around the PeV band. Some caveats are also discussed.

<title>Testing General Relativity with Juno at Jupiter</title>

The Juno spacecraft has been orbiting Jupiter since 2016 July to deepen our comprehension of the solar system by studying the gas giant. The radio science experiment enables the determination of Jupiter’s gravitational field, thus shedding light on its interior structure. The experiment relies on determining the orbit of the spacecraft during its pericenter passages. Previous gravity data analyses assumed the correctness of the general theory of relativity, which was used for trajectory integration and radio signal propagation modeling. In this work, we aim to test general relativity within the unique context of a spacecraft orbiting Jupiter, by employing the parameterized post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism, an established framework for comparing various gravitational theories. Within this framework, we focus our attention toward the PPN parameters γ and β, which offer insights into the curvature of spacetime and the nonlinearity of gravitational effects, respectively. Additionally, we extend our investigation to the Lense–Thirring effect, which models the dragging of spacetime induced by a rotating mass. By measuring the relativistic frequency shift on Doppler observables caused by Jupiter during Juno’s perijove passes, we estimate γ = 1 + (1.5 ± 4.9) × 10−3, consistent with the general theory of relativity. Our estimated γ is primarily influenced by its effect on light-time computation, with a negligible contribution from spacecraft dynamics. Furthermore, we also present a modest level of accuracy for the β parameter, reflecting the minimal dynamical perturbation on Juno from general relativity. This also applies to the Lense–Thirring effect, whose signal is too small to be confidently resolved.

<title>Scaling of Ion Bulk Heating in Magnetic Reconnection Outflows for the High-Alfvén-speed and Low-β Regime in Earth’s Magnetotail</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We survey 20 reconnection outflow events observed by Magnetospheric MultiScale in the low-β and high-Alfvén-speed regime of the Earth’s magnetotail to investigate the scaling of ion bulk heating produced by reconnection. The range of inflow Alfvén speeds (800–4000 km s−1) and inflow ion β (0.002–1) covered by this study is in a plasma regime that could be applicable to the solar corona and flare environments. We find that the observed ion heating increases with increasing inflow (upstream) Alfvén speed, VA, based on the reconnecting magnetic field and the upstream plasma density. However, ion heating does not increase linearly as a function of available magnetic energy per particle, . Instead, the heating increases progressively less as rises. This is in contrast to a previous study using the same data set, which found that electron heating in this high-Alfvén-speed and low-β regime scales linearly with , with a scaling factor nearly identical to that found for the low-VA and high-β magnetopause. Consequently, the ion-to-electron heating ratio in reconnection exhausts decreases with increasing upstream VA, suggesting that the energy partition between ions and electrons in reconnection exhausts could be a function of the available magnetic energy per particle. Finally, we find that the observed difference in ion and electron heating scaling may be consistent with the predicted effects of a trapping potential in the exhaust, which enhances electron heating, but reduces ion heating.

The observation of a kilonova AT2017gfo associated with the gravitational wave event GW170817 provides the first strong evidence that neutron star mergers are dominant contributors to the production of heavy r-process elements. Radioactive gamma-ray lines emitted from neutron star merger remnants provide a unique probe for investigating the nuclide composition and tracking its evolution. In this work, we studied the gamma-ray line features arising from the radioactive decay of heavy nuclei in the merger remnants based on the r-process nuclear reaction network and the astrophysical inputs derived from numerical relativity simulations. The decay chain of Sn (T1/2 = 230 kyr) → Sb (T1/2 = 12.35 days) → Te (stable) produces several bright gamma-ray lines with energies of 415, 667, and 695 keV, making it the most promising decay chain during the remnant phase. The photon fluxes of these bright gamma-ray lines reach ∼10−5γ cm−2 s−1 for Galactic merger remnants with ages less than 100 kyr, which can be detected by the high energy resolution MeV gamma-ray detectors like the MASS mission.

SN 2021gmj是一颗低亮度的II型超新星，通过扩张光球方法确定了其距离，从尾部光谱曲线推导了放射性镍质量，提出了环绕星际物质的存在，并通过光谱特征和辐射动力学模拟发现了类似的低亮度II型超新星可能存在的高密度物质。总结: 该研究通过观测和模拟分析了低亮度II型超新星SN 2021gmj的光学特性和物理特征，推测了其距离、放射性镍质量和环绕星际物质的存在，为研究相似超新星提供了重要信息和参考。 <div>
We present comprehensive optical observations of SN 2021gmj, a Type II supernova (SN II) discovered within a day of explosion by the Distance Less Than 40 Mpc survey. Follow-up observations show that SN 2021gmj is a low-luminosity SN II (LL SN II), with a peak magnitude MV = −15.45 and an Fe ii velocity of ∼1800 km s−1 at 50 days past explosion. Using the expanding photosphere method, we derive a distance of Mpc. From the tail of the light curve we obtain a radioactive nickel mass of = 0.014 ± 0.001 M⊙. The presence of circumstellar material (CSM) is suggested by the early-time light curve, early spectra, and high-velocity Hα in absorption. Analytical shock-cooling models of the light curve cannot reproduce the fast rise, supporting the idea that the early-time emission is partially powered by the interaction of the SN ejecta and CSM. The inferred low CSM mass of 0.025 M⊙ in our hydrodynamic-modeling light-curve analysis is also consistent with our spectroscopy. We observe a broad feature near 4600 Å, which may be high-ionization lines of C, N, or/and He ii. This feature is reproduced by radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of red supergiants with extended atmospheres. Several LL SNe II show similar spectral features, implying that high-density material around the progenitor may be common among them.

研究介绍了一种用于太阳日冕磁场线追踪和相关数量计算的新代码——Universal Fieldline Tracer (UFiT)。该代码具有开放源代码，可以直接从四个已建立的日冕模型中获取输入，并计划在将来直接获取更多模型。该软件包含工具，可利用大规模三维磁场线图来计算容积数量，例如太阳日冕的总体积，或者映射到太阳表面附近某一距离的日冕空洞边界的部分比例。这对于太阳风速度的现象模型（如万氏日冕速度模型）可能是相关的。此外，该软件包还可以快速生成合成日冕观测图。研究者们后处理了长期磁力摩擦仿真结果，证明分离线网在太阳活动极大期间占据日冕的比例较太阳活动极小期间更大。<br /><br /> <div>
We present a new code for the tracing of magnetic field lines and calculation of related quantities such as the squashing factor in the solar corona. The Universal Fieldline Tracer (UFiT) is an open-source package that can currently take inputs directly from four well-established coronal models, with additional models planned to be made directly accessible in the future. This package contains tools to make use of large-scale three-dimensional field line maps to calculate volumetric quantities, such as the total volume of the open corona, or the fraction that maps to regions on the solar surface within some distance of a coronal hole boundary, which may be relevant to phenomenological models of solar wind speed such as the Wang–Sheeley–Arge model. Synthetic coronagraphs can also be produced rapidly by this package. We have postprocessed long-term magnetofrictional simulations to demonstrate that the separatrix web occupies a larger fraction of the corona during solar maximum than solar minimum.

Galactic spinning compact objects (COs) with nonzero ellipticity are expected to be sources of continuous gravitational waves (CGWs). Certain classes of hypothetical COs, such as neutron stars with quark cores (hybrid stars) and quark stars, are thought to be capable of sustaining large ellipticities from theoretical considerations. Such exotic COs (eCOs) with large ellipticities and spins should produce CGWs detectable by the current LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA GW detector network. Since no detections for CGWs from searches in LIGO-Virgo data have so far been reported, we place constraints on the abundance of highly elliptical, rapidly spinning eCOs in our Galaxy. We formulate a Bayesian framework to place upper limits on the number count Ntot of highly deformed Galactic eCOs. We divide our constraints into two classes: an “agnostic” set of upper limits on Ntot evaluated on a CGW frequency and ellipticity grid that depend only on the choice of spatial distribution of COs; and a model-dependent set that additionally assumes prior information on the distribution of frequencies. We find that COs with ellipticities ϵ ≳ 10−5 have abundance upper limits at 90% confidence, of , and those with ϵ ≳ 10−6 have . We additionally place upper limits on the ellipticity of Galactic COs informed by our choices of spatial distributions, given different abundances Ntot.

<div> AGNs, black hole mass, host galaxy, variability, scaling relation
<br /><br />总结:
本研究通过对COSMOS区域z < 4的光学变化活动星系核（AGNs）样本进行研究，探讨了黑洞质量-宿主星系恒星质量关系。研究发现，变化搜寻可以识别出低质量星系中的AGNs，但它们的黑洞质量相比于预期的本地活跃星系关系更大。而在z ∼ 0.5–4范围内选择的AGNs则更符合本地非活跃早期星系的MBH–M*关系。这一结果表明了对于类似红移下中等质量黑洞候选者的稳健黑洞和恒星质量估算的需求，以锚定这一比例关系。假设这些结果不反映选择偏差，它们似乎与自调节反馈模型一致，其中中心黑洞和星系中的恒星同步增长。 <div>
We study the black hole mass–host galaxy stellar mass relation, MBH–M*, of a sample of z < 4 optically variable active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the COSMOS field. The parent sample of 491 COSMOS AGNs were identified by optical variability from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) program. Using publicly available catalogs and spectra, we consolidate their spectroscopic redshifts and estimate virial black hole masses using broad-line widths and luminosities. We show that variability searches with deep, high-precision photometry like the HSC-SSP can identity AGNs in low-mass galaxies up to z ∼ 1. However, their black holes are more massive given their host galaxy stellar masses than predicted by the local relation for active galaxies. We report that z ∼ 0.5–4 variability-selected AGNs are meanwhile more consistent with the MBH–M* relation for local inactive early-type galaxies. This result is in agreement with most previous studies of the MBH–M* relation at similar redshifts and indicates that AGNs selected from variability are not intrinsically different from the broad-line Type 1 AGN population at similar luminosities. Our results demonstrate the need for robust black hole and stellar mass estimates for intermediate-mass black hole candidates in low-mass galaxies at similar redshifts to anchor this scaling relation. Assuming that these results do not reflect a selection bias, they appear to be consistent with self-regulated feedback models wherein the central black hole and stars in galaxies grow in tandem.

近期研究发现，Gaia观测到的宽双星的离心率分布倾向于更强烈地支持大离心率，超过了经典热分布。基于这一观察，研究者重新审视三星系统中黑洞双星合并的形成渠道，并研究外部二进制的超热离心率分布对其影响。他们发现，对于满足ain/aout ≳ 0.005的黑洞三星系统，在每个成员都经历了超新星爆炸引起的质量损失后，外部离心率分布可能仍然明显超热，而其他情况下则受质量损失引起的脉冲和动力失稳的影响。然后，他们研究了剩余的黑洞三星系统的不同外部离心率分布对通过第三星诱导渠道产生的合并的影响。有趣的是，他们发现，即使初始恒星轨道接近对齐（不受冯-塞皮尔–利多夫–科赛效应影响），只要系统足够分层，仍然可以产生合并。另一方面，尽管外部二进制更离心时，八级冯-塞皮尔–利多夫–科赛效应的影响更大，但他们发现，由于最大离心率往往导致动力失稳，极端外部离心率分布时合并比例变化不大。 <br /><br />总结: Gaia观察的宽双星的离心率分布超出了经典热分布，黑洞三星系统的外部离心率分布可能保持超热，外部离心率分布对三星系统中合并的影响，系统分层可以产生合并，最大离心率导致动力失稳。 <div>
Recent studies show that the eccentricity distribution of wide binaries (semimajor axis ≳103 au) observed by Gaia tends to favor large eccentricities more strongly than the canonical thermal distribution (P(e) ∝ e)—such distributions are termed “superthermal.” Motivated by this observation, we revisit the formation channel of black hole (BH) binary mergers in triple stellar systems and study the impact of superthermal eccentricity distributions in the outer binaries. We explore the persistence of the highly eccentric outer orbits after each component in a stellar triple has undergone mass loss due to supernova explosions. We find that the outer eccentricity distribution can remain significantly superthermal for modestly hierarchical BH triples satisfying ain/aout ≳ 0.005 (where ain and aout are the semimajor axes of the inner and outer orbits), and are otherwise shaped by mass-loss induced kicks and dynamical instability. We then study the impact of these different outer eccentricity distributions of the remaining BH triples on mergers via the tertiary-induced channel. Of interest, we find that mergers can sometimes be produced even when the initial stellar orbits are near alignment (not subject to the von-Zeipel–Lidov–Kozai effect; ZLK effect) as long as the system is sufficiently hierarchical. On the other hand, although the impact of the octupole-order ZLK effect is much greater when the outer binary is more eccentric, we find that the merger fraction only changes modestly for extreme outer eccentricity distributions because the largest eccentricities tend to lead to dynamical instability.

<div> 强耦合、暖胀、引力理论、潮汐力、观测数据
总结: 
在本研究中，我们研究了暖胀情景下强耦合的线性版本f(Q, T)引力理论，该理论与标量场和辐射场相耦合。我们首先计算了修正的Friedmann方程和修正的慢滚参数。随后，我们应用慢滚近似推导了标量功率谱和张量功率谱。此外，我们为f(Q, T)引力理论与暖胀情景发展了标量和张量扰动的公式。我们进一步研究了两种不同形式的耗散系数，即恒定和与标量场的函数，以确定幂律势情况下的标量谱指数、张量标量比和功率谱的温度。通过对模型的自由参数施加一些约束，我们得到了与Planck 2018数据和Planck、BK15以及宇宙学声学振荡数据联合结果吻合良好的结果，且与Planck 2018数据一致的标量谱指数。此外，获得的结果在观测数据范围内的标量功率谱幅度。因此，我们能够复活先前被观测数据排除的幂律势。此外，对于两种耗散系数，该模型导致的标量谱指数都与威尔金森微波各向异性探测3年数据一致，呈蓝色和红色倾斜。 <div>
We investigate the warm inflationary scenario within the context of the linear version of f(Q, T) gravity, coupled with both the inflaton scalar field and the radiation field, under the conditions of the strong dissipation regime. First, we calculate the modified Friedmann equations and the modified slow-roll parameters. Subsequently, we apply the slow-roll approximations to derive the scalar power spectrum and the tensor power spectrum. Also, we develop formulations of the scalar and tensor perturbations for the f(Q, T) gravity with the warm inflation scenario. Furthermore, we scrutinize two different forms of the dissipation coefficient, a constant and a function of the inflaton field, to determine the scalar spectral index, the tensor-to-scalar ratio, and the temperature for the power-law potential case. By imposing some constraints on the free parameters of the model, we attain results in good agreement with both the Planck 2018 data and the joint Planck, BK15, and baryon acoustic oscillation data for the tensor-to-scalar ratio, and consistent results aligned with the Planck 2018 data for the scalar spectral index. In addition, the obtained results are within the range of observational data for the amplitude of the scalar power spectrum. Consequently, we are able to revive the power-law potential that was previously ruled out by observational data. Moreover, for both dissipation coefficients, the model leads to a scalar spectral index with the blue and red tilts in agreement with the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe 3 yr data.

<div> Lyα emitters, spectroscopic samples, redshift evolution, ionized bubbles, double-peaked profiles

总结:
观测到两个红移 (z = 5.7 和 z = 6.6) 的Lyα发射体 (LAE) 的样本，探讨了这些红移下LAE群体的演化。发现在 z = 6.6 时，高光度的LAE可能自己产生大的电离气泡，或者位于产生这些气泡的过密星系位置。双峰LAE需要蓝光透传，估计了在 z = 6.6 时的电离源周围的近距离半径。由于所需的半径较大，可能需要附近的多个电离源。这些发现对于理解早期星系的形成和演化具有重要意义。 <br /><br /> <div>
We present two uniformly observed spectroscopic samples of Lyα emitters (LAEs; 127 at z = 5.7 and 82 at z = 6.6), which we use to investigate the evolution of the LAE population at these redshifts. The observations cover a large field (44 deg2) in the North Ecliptic Pole, as well as several smaller fields. We have a small number of exotic LAEs in the samples: double-peaked Lyα profiles; very extended red wings; and one impressive lensed LAE cross. We also find three broad-line active galactic nuclei. We compare the Lyα line width measurements at the two redshifts, finding that the lower-luminosity LAEs show a strong evolution of decreasing line width with increasing redshift, while the high-luminosity LAEs do not, with a transition luminosity of log L(Lyα) ≈ 43.25 erg s−1. Thus, at z = 6.6, the high-luminosity LAEs may be producing large ionized bubbles themselves, or they may be residing in overdense galaxy sites that are producing such bubbles. In order to avoid losses in the red wing, the radius of the ionized bubble must be larger than 1 pMpc. The double-peaked LAEs also require transmission on the blue side. For the four at z = 6.6, we use models to estimate the proximity radii, Ra, where the ionizing flux of the galaxy is sufficient to make the surroundings have a low enough neutral fraction to pass the blue light. Since the required Ra are large, multiple ionizing sources in the vicinity may be needed.

3C 275.1 is a blue quasar at z = 0.55522, hosting powerful outflows and residing in a complex environment. We present a serendipitously detected giant nebula surrounding 3C 275.1, which shows morphological features resembling those of objects known as “jellyfish galaxies,” with extremely long tails of ionized gas extending to 170 kpc in projection. We analyze its optical spectra taken by MUSE on the Very Large Telescope. The brighter part of this giant nebula exceeds 100 kpc, and its rotation curve does not flatten out, making it very different from those of normal spiral galaxies. This system shares some characteristics common to those formed via ram pressure stripping (RPS), yet its long narrow tails and higher ionization are unusual compared to known tails in jellyfish galaxies, not fully consistent with a simple RPS scenario. Our photoionization simulation and the inferred short recombination timescale both suggest that, besides the quasar 3C 275.1, an extra source of ionization is necessary to keep the gas ionized at such a distance from the nucleus, which could be related to RPS, tidal interaction, or active galactic nucleus outflow, providing new evidence of active dynamical interaction of a galaxy with the intracluster medium.

<div> 高质量X射线双星；Be-XRBs；POSYDON；双星演化；自旋分布

高质量X射线双星（Be-XRBs）是高质量X射线双星中的一个重要子类，由一个快速旋转的Be星和一个中子星伴星组成，它们在离心轨道上间歇性地从捐赠者周围的排除盘中吸积物质。通过使用最先进的BPS代码POSYDON，我们研究了银河系中的Be-XRB种群。POSYDON在MT阶段自洽地纳入了恒星自旋，使我们能够详细考察多个演化阶段中Be星的自旋分布。我们的模型与银河系中Be-XRB的轨道特性很好地吻合，强调了自转限制的作用。我们的建模揭示了一个快速旋转的种群（ω/ωcrit ≳ 0.3），在中等自转速率处（ω/ωcrit ≃ 0.6）有一个明显的高峰，与观测结果高度一致。所有的Be-XRB在第一个紧凑天体形成之前都经历了一次MT阶段，其中超过一半经历了来自剥夺的氦伴星的第二次MT阶段（Case BB）。通过计算受限于自转的MT效率并将其应用于我们的种群，我们得出了一个物理合理的MT效率分布，发现大多数Be-XRB经历了高度非保守的MT。我们的研究强调了在解释Be-XRB种群时在MT期间进行详细的角动量建模的重要性，并强调了这一种群作为相互作用双星中MT稳定性和效率的关键探针。 <br /><br />总结: 高质量X射线双星（Be-XRBs）由快速旋转的Be星和中子星伴星组成，在银河系中具有明显的自旋分布特点。它们在演化过程中经历了多次质量传递（MT），大多数经历了高度非保守的MT。研究强调了在解释Be-XRB种群时在MT期间进行详细的角动量建模的重要性。 <div>
Be X-ray binaries (Be-XRBs) are one of the largest subclasses of high-mass X-ray binaries, comprised of a rapidly rotating Be star and neutron star companion in an eccentric orbit, intermittently accreting material from a decretion disk around the donor. Originating from binary stellar evolution, Be-XRBs are of significant interest to binary population synthesis (BPS) studies, encapsulating the physics of supernovae, common envelope, and mass transfer (MT). Using the state-of-the-art BPS code, POSYDON, which relies on precomputed grids of detailed binary stellar evolution models, we investigate the Galactic Be-XRB population. POSYDON incorporates stellar rotation self-consistently during MT phases, enabling detailed examination of the rotational distribution of Be stars in multiple phases of evolution. Our fiducial BPS and Be-XRB model aligns well with the orbital properties of Galactic Be-XRBs, emphasizing the role of rotational constraints. Our modeling reveals a rapidly rotating population (ω/ωcrit ≳ 0.3) of Be-XRB-like systems with a strong peak at intermediate rotation rates (ω/ωcrit ≃ 0.6) in close alignment with observations. All Be-XRBs undergo an MT phase before the first compact object forms, with over half experiencing a second MT phase from a stripped helium companion (Case BB). Computing rotationally limited MT efficiencies and applying them to our population, we derive a physically motivated MT efficiency distribution, finding that most Be-XRBs have undergone highly nonconservative MT ( ). Our study underscores the importance of detailed angular momentum modeling during MT in interpreting Be-XRB populations, emphasizing this population as a key probe for the stability and efficiency of MT in interacting binaries.

<div> TŻOs, merger, neutron star, angular momentum, stellar evolution
<br /><br />这篇文章讨论了Thorne-Żytkow对象(TŻOs)的形成和演化，重点在于研究了在共享包层阶段角动量传输对融合产物的影响，并提出了新的融合产物稳态解：薄包层TŻO。这些新的解可能成为未来时间域调查的潜在X射线源，前期可能会出现一系列明亮的瞬变事件。 <div>
Thorne–Żytkow objects (TŻOs), hypothetical merger products in which a neutron star is embedded in a stellar core, are traditionally considered steady-state configurations. Their assembly, especially through dynamical channels, is not well understood. The predominant focus in the literature has been on the observational signatures related to the evolution and long-term fate of TŻOs, with their initial formation often treated as a given. However, the foundational calculations supporting the existence of TŻOs assume nonrotating spherically symmetric initial conditions that we find to be inconsistent with a binary merger scenario. In this work, we explore the implications of postmerger dynamics in TŻO formation scenarios with field binary progenitors, specifically the role that angular momentum transport during the common envelope phase plays in constraining the possible merger products, using the tools of stellar evolution and three-dimensional hydrodynamics. We also propose an alternative steady-state outcome for these mergers: the thin-envelope TŻO, an equilibrium solution consisting of a low-mass spherical envelope supported by the accretion disk luminosity of a central stellar-mass black hole. These configurations may be of interest to upcoming time-domain surveys as potential X-ray sources that may be preceded by a series of bright transient events.

<div> FASHI, FAST, OH megamasers, IRAS Point Source Catalog Redshift, (U)LIRGs
总结:
FASHI调查通过与IRAS选择的PSCz交叉相关，从FASHI已覆盖的145个PSCz源中获得27个OHMs，检测率为18.6％，包括9个先前已知和18个新发现的OHMs。测量了9个OHMs的1667和1665 MHz线之间的超精细比，平均值为R1667:1665 = 4.74。研究证实OHMs是（超）明亮红外星系（（U）LIRGs）并通过FAST和其19束阵列和超宽带接收机将是未来观察更多OHMs和揭开它们谜团的有力工具。<br /><br /> <div>
The FAST All Sky H i survey (FASHI) is broader in frequency band and sky volume, and deeper in detection sensitivity than the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA survey. To efficiently expand the sample of OH megamasers (OHMs), whose strongest line has a rest frequency of 1667.35903 MHz, we directly matched the IRAS Point Source Catalog Redshift (PSCz) catalog with the corresponding FASHI data cube. From 145 PSCz sources already covered by FASHI, we obtained 27 OHMs with a detection rate of 18.6%, including 9 previously known and 18 new ones, within a redshift range of 0.14314 ≲ zOH ≲ 0.27656. We also measured the hyperfine ratio of nine OHMs between the 1667 and 1665 MHz lines. The ratio ranges from 1.32 to 15.22, with an average of R1667:1665 = 4.74. In a fit to the LOH versus LFIR relation, we have , which is almost the same as derived from previous observations. As expected, since the OHM sample was selected by cross correlation with the IRAS-selected PSCz, our detected OHMs are (ultra)luminous infrared galaxies ((U)LIRGs). However, not all (U)LIRGs have detectable OH emission, suggesting that the OH emission may be triggered within a specific stage of the merger or can only be seen in specific orientations. In general, FAST, with its 19-beam array and Ultra-Wide Bandwidth receiver, will be a powerful tool for observing more OHMs and unraveling their mystery in the future.

总结:
本文通过高分辨率的3D和2D数值流体动力学模拟研究了粘性盘中嵌入天体在盘的粘性时间尺度上的迁移动力学。研究发现，在主要由粘性控制的盘中，吸积行星倾向于向外迁移，与非吸积行星向内轨道衰减形成对比。3D和2D模拟得出了相一致的吸积行星向外迁移的结果。在这种情况下，吸积行星的向外迁移主要是由于从全局盘向希尔半径内输送的不对称螺旋臂。这类似于未饱和的共转扭矩，尽管不平衡是由于在回转时间尺度内的物质吸积而不是扩散到内盘。在粘度较小的盘中，吸积行星在其轨道附近形成深深的间隙。向内迁移的倾向被恢复，尽管速率受到抑制。通过对一系列粘性盘进行参数调查，发现对木星质量的行星而言，从向外迁移到向内迁移的转变发生在有效粘性效率因子α约为0.003时。 <br /><br /> <div>
Migration commonly occurs during the epoch of planet formation. For emerging gas giant planets, it proceeds concurrently with their growth through the accretion of gas from their natal protoplanetary disks. A similar migration process should also be applied to the stellar-mass black holes embedded in active galactic nucleus disks. In this work, we perform high-resolution 3D and 2D numerical hydrodynamical simulations to study the migration dynamics for accreting embedded objects over the disk viscous timescales in a self-consistent manner. We find that an accreting planet embedded in a predominantly viscous disk has a tendency to migrate outward, in contrast to the inward orbital decay of nonaccreting planets. 3D and 2D simulations find the consistent outward migration results for the accreting planets. Under this circumstance, the accreting planet’s outward migration is mainly due to the asymmetric spiral arms feeding from the global disk into the Hill radius. This is analogous to the unsaturated corotation torque although the imbalance is due to material accretion within the libration timescale rather than diffusion onto the inner disk. In a disk with a relatively small viscosity, the accreting planets clear deep gaps near their orbits. The tendency of inward migration is recovered, albeit with suppressed rates. By performing a parameter survey with a range of disks’ viscosity, we find that the transition from outward to inward migration occurs with the effective viscous efficiency factor α ∼ 0.003 for Jupiter-mass planets.

Rings and gaps are among the most widely observed forms of substructure in protoplanetary disks. A gap–ring pair may be formed when a planet carves a gap in the disk, which produces a local pressure maximum following the gap that traps inwardly drifting dust grains and appears as a bright ring owing to the enhanced dust density. A dust-trapping ring would provide a promising environment for solid growth and possibly planetesimal production via the streaming instability. We present evidence of dust trapping in the bright ring of the planet-hosting disk Elias 2-24, from the analysis of 1.3 and 3 mm Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations at high spatial resolution (0.″029, 4.0 au). We leverage the high spatial resolution to demonstrate that larger grains are more efficiently trapped and place constraints on the local turbulence (8 × 10−4 < αturb < 0.03) and the gas-to-dust ratio (Σg/Σd < 30) in the ring. Using a scattering-included marginal probability analysis, we measure a total dust disk mass of . We also show that at the orbital radius of the proposed perturber the gap is cleared of material down to a flux contrast of 10−3 of the peak flux in the disk.

The Earth’s magnetosheath serves as a natural laboratory to study the transition of highly turbulent fluctuations. The fundamental information about plasma turbulences can be examined observationally with the help of electron vorticity measurements. This study presents the first statistics of the electron vorticity field in the magnetosheath by utilizing 4 yr data from NASA’s Magnetospheric Multiscale mission. In this study, the magnetosheath vorticity has a dominant perpendicular anisotropy. The vorticity field in the subsolar region is much stronger than that of magnetosheath flanks. Clear dusk-favored asymmetry for large vorticity is identified in the subsolar region. We examine that the electron flow vorticity in the turbulent magnetosheath is well anticorrelated with the electron density. The vorticity is of great importance in energy dissipation and electron heating in the magnetosheath flanks. This study can improve the current understanding of electron vorticity due to its ubiquitous role in space plasma turbulences.

We present a direct measurement of extinction curves using corrected Gaia XP spectra of the common sources in Gaia DR3 and LAMOST DR7. Our analysis of approximately 370,000 high-quality samples yielded a high-precision average extinction curve for the Milky Way. After incorporating infrared photometric data from Two Micron All Sky Survey and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, the extinction curve spans wavelengths from 0.336 to 4.6 μm. We determine an average R55 of 2.730 ± 0.007, corresponding to RV = 3.073 ± 0.009, and a near-infrared power-law index α of 1.935 ± 0.037. Our study confirmed some intermediate-scale structures within the optical range. One new feature was identified at 540 nm, and its intensity exhibited a correlation with extinction. This extinction curve can be used to investigate the characteristics of dust and enhance the extinction correction of Milky Way stars. A Python package for this extinction curve is available.

本研究通过对小麦哲伦云中24个X射线瞬变体的观测数据进行分析，利用无迹卡尔曼滤波器追踪未经平均的时间序列L(t)和P(t)的波动，唯一地估计出了磁偶极矩μ。此外，还得到了每颗恒星的质量吸积率和磁盘-磁层边界的最大应力的时间演化历史，以及涉及这两个状态变量的自相关和交叉相关。推断的波动统计信息传达了有关磁盘-磁层边界的复杂吸积物理学的重要信息。 <div>
Many accretion-powered pulsars rotate in magnetocentrifugal disequilibrium, spinning up or down secularly over multiyear intervals. The magnetic dipole moment μ of such systems cannot be inferred uniquely from the time-averaged aperiodic X-ray flux 〈L(t)〉 and pulse period 〈P(t)〉, because the radiative efficiency of the accretion is unknown and degenerate with the mass accretion rate. Here, we circumvent the degeneracy by tracking the fluctuations in the unaveraged time series L(t) and P(t) using an unscented Kalman filter, whereupon μ can be estimated uniquely, up to the uncertainties in the mass, radius, and distance of the star. The analysis is performed on Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer observations for 24 X-ray transients in the Small Magellanic Cloud, which have been monitored regularly for ∼16 yr. As well as independent estimates of μ, the analysis yields time-resolved histories of the mass accretion rate and the Maxwell stress at the disk–magnetosphere boundary for each star, and hence auto- and cross-correlations involving the latter two state variables. The inferred fluctuation statistics convey important information about the complex accretion physics at the disk–magnetosphere boundary.

白矮星周围的可居住区内可能存在可以寻找生命迹象的行星，但这些行星的可居住区尚不完全清楚。研究人员使用全球气候模型ExoCAM来研究白矮星周围的可居住区的内边界。他们的模拟显示，具有超短轨道周期的可居住行星会进入一种名为“蝙蝠旋转”的大气循环状态，这与M型矮星周围的典型大气环流状态不同。蝙蝠旋转会导致行星的赤道区域出现平均次旋转，以及最热区域从赤道向中纬度区域的位移。研究人员指出这一循环变化会增加行星白天的云覆盖，并减少平流层水汽，从而将白矮星的可居住区扩大约50%。未来，詹姆斯·韦伯空间望远镜有望通过行星独特的热相位曲线快速确认白矮星周围的蝙蝠旋转行星。这项研究强调了潮汐锁定行星在超短轨道上可能表现出独特的大气动力学，并指导了未来白矮星系统的可居住性研究。 <br /><br />总结: 白矮星可能有可居住行星，气流循环状态为“蝙蝠旋转”，这增加了可居住区的范围。未来可通过观测热相位曲线确认这种状态。 <div>
White dwarfs offer a unique opportunity to search nearby stellar systems for signs of life, but the habitable zone around these stars is still poorly understood. Since white dwarfs are compact stars with low luminosity, any planets in their habitable zone should be tidally locked, like planets around M dwarfs. Unlike planets around M dwarfs, however, habitable white dwarf planets have to rotate very rapidly, with orbital periods ranging from hours to several days. Here we use the ExoCAM global climate model to investigate the inner edge of the habitable zone around white dwarfs. Our simulations show habitable planets with ultrashort orbital periods (P ≲ 1 day) enter a “bat rotation” regime, which differs from typical atmospheric circulation regimes around M dwarfs. Bat rotators feature mean equatorial subrotation and a displacement of the surface’s hottest regions from the equator toward the midlatitudes. We qualitatively explain the onset of bat rotation using shallow water theory. The resulting circulation shifts increase the dayside cloud cover and decrease the stratospheric water vapor, expanding the white dwarf habitable zone by ∼50% compared to estimates based on 1D models. The James Webb Space Telescope should be able to quickly characterize bat rotators around nearby white dwarfs thanks to their distinct thermal phase curves. Our work underlines that tidally locked planets on ultrashort orbits may exhibit unique atmospheric dynamics, and guides future habitability studies of white dwarf systems.

这篇论文利用JWST/NIRSpec光谱数据对恒星形成星系在再电离纪元的中性氢分数和电离泡泡半径进行了测量，并通过构建四个红移分组的复合光谱发现了软化断点在1216埃处的演化趋势，表明Lyα阻尼翼吸收逐渐增强。利用合理的模板估算了星系光谱中的Lyα阻尼翼吸收，得出了xH I (Rb)在红移7到12范围内的值，表明中性氢分数随着红移增加而增加。电离泡泡半径的测量结果显示，对于给定的xH I值，泡泡大小可能比分析计算得出的宇宙平均值大几个数量级，与最近的数值模拟对于明亮星系周围合并电离泡泡的预测结果大致相当。总结: 本研究发现中性氢分数随红移增加而增加， 表明再电离历史较晚，并估算了电离泡泡半径，结果表明泡泡大小可能比平均值大几个数量级。 <div>
We present volume-averaged neutral hydrogen fractions xH I and ionized bubble radii Rb measured with Lyα damping wing absorption of galaxies at the epoch of reionization. We combine JWST/NIRSpec spectra taken by the CEERS, GO-1433, DDT-2750, and JADES programs and obtain a sample containing 27 bright UV-continuum (MUV < −18.5 mag) galaxies at 7 < z < 12. We construct four composite spectra binned by redshift and find the clear evolution of the softening break toward high redshift at rest-frame 1216 Å, suggesting an increase of Lyα damping wing absorption. We estimate Lyα damping wing absorption in the galaxy spectra with realistic templates including Lyα emission and circumgalactic medium absorptions. Assuming the standard inside-out reionization picture having an ionized bubble with radius Rb around a galaxy embedded in the intergalactic medium with xH I, we obtain xH I (Rb) values generally increasing (decreasing) from to ( to comoving Mpc) at redshift to . The redshift evolution of xH I indicates a moderately late reionization history consistent with the one previously suggested from the electron scattering of cosmic microwave background and the evolution of UV luminosity function with an escape fraction fesc ∼ 0.2. Our Rb measurements suggest that bubble sizes could be up to a few dex larger than the cosmic average values estimated by analytic calculations for a given xH I, while our Rb measurements are roughly comparable with the values for merged ionized bubbles around bright galaxies predicted by recent numerical simulations.

这篇文章对北半球亮星系第三参考目录中有相对面向的Sd星系进行了分析，通过测量85个星系的螺旋臂缠绕角度和应用黑洞质量平面比例关系，预测了中心黑洞的质量。结果显示在50兆秒差距内至少有23个星系可能有中间质量黑洞，这对进一步观测来说是合适的目标。文章还估计了典型Sd星系可能存在黑洞的概率，并观察到这类星系呈现出多样性的特征，但更倾向于低质量、螺旋臂缠绕松散、旋转速度较小的特点。

We analyzed images of every northern hemisphere Sd galaxy listed in the Third Reference Catalogue of Bright Galaxies with a relatively face-on inclination (θ ≤ 30°). Specifically, we measured the spiral arms’ winding angle, ϕ, in 85 galaxies. We applied a novel black hole mass planar scaling relation involving the rotational velocities (from the literature) and pitch angles of each galaxy to predict central black hole masses. This yielded 23 galaxies, each having at least a 50% chance of hosting a central intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH), 102 < M• ≤ 105M☉. These 23 nearby (≲50 Mpc) targets may be suitable for an array of follow-up observations to check for active nuclei. Based on our full sample of 85 Sd galaxies, we estimate that the typical Sd galaxy (which tends to be bulgeless) harbors a black hole with , but with a 27.7% chance of hosting an IMBH, making this morphological type of galaxy fertile ground for hunting elusive IMBHs. Thus, we find that a ∼106M☉ black hole corresponds roughly to the onset of bulge development and serves as a conspicuous waypoint along the galaxy–supermassive black hole coevolution journey. Our survey suggests that >1.22% of bright galaxies (BT ≲ 15.5 mag) in the local Universe host an IMBH (i.e., the “occupation fraction”), which implies a number density >4.96 × 10−6 Mpc−3 for central IMBHs. Finally, we observe that Sd galaxies exhibit an unexpected diversity of properties that resemble the general population of spiral galaxies, albeit with an enhanced signature of the eponymous prototypical traits (i.e., low masses, loosely wound spiral arms, and smaller rotational velocities).

研究团队首次在野边射电太阳观测中探测到了34 GHz的热自由–自由辐射，而且观测到了八个环，七个位于磁场极强的区域。研究显示这些环的辐射在不同波长范围呈现多温度结构，甚至与米波噪声暴发辐射相关。研究者对17 GHz和34 GHz的辐射进行了比较，发现在两种频率下都是光学稀薄的。根据密度计算，环顶的密度值在1至6×10^10 cm^-3之间，且不同环和同一环的演变过程中有明显变化，而且与所假设的2×10^6 K的温度之间只有微弱的相关性。此外，环顶的磁场估计在10至30 G之间。总结: <br /><br />首次在太阳回波环中探测到34 GHz的热自由–自由辐射。辐射呈现出多温度结构，并与米波噪声暴发辐射相关。环顶的密度值表现出明显变化，且与所假设的温度之间只有微弱的相关性。此外，环顶的磁场估计在10至30 G之间。 <div>
We report for the first time the detection of thermal free–free emission from post-flare loops at 34 GHz in images from the Nobeyama Radioheliograph. We studied eight loops, seven of which were from regions with an extremely strong coronal magnetic field reported by Fedenev et al. Loop emission was observed in a wide range of wavelength bands, up to soft X-rays, confirming their multitemperature structure and was associated with noise storm emission in metric λ. The comparison of the 17 GHz emission with that at 34 GHz, after a calibration correction of the latter, showed that the emission was optically thin at both frequencies. We describe the structure and evolution of the loops and we computed their density, obtaining values for the top of the loops between 1 and 6 × 1010 cm−3, noticeably varying from one loop to another and in the course of the evolution of the same loop system; these values have only a weak dependence on the assumed temperature, 2 × 106 K in our case, as we are in the optically thin regime. Our density values are above those reported from EUV observations, which go up to about 1010 cm−3. This difference could be due to the fact that different emitting regions are sampled in the two domains and/or due to the more accurate diagnostics in the radio range, which do not suffer from inherent uncertainties arising from abundances and non-LTE excitation/ionization equilibria. We also estimated the magnetic field in the loop tops to be in the range of 10–30 G.

We present an atmospheric retrieval analysis of the Y0 brown dwarf WISE J035934.06−540154.6 using the low-resolution 0.96–12 μm James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) spectrum presented in Beiler et al. We obtain volume number mixing ratios of the major gas-phase absorbers (H2O, CH4, CO, CO2, PH3, and H2S) that are three to five times more precise than previous work that used Hubble Space Telescope (HST) spectra. We also find an order-of-magnitude improvement in the precision of the retrieved thermal profile, a direct result of the broad wavelength coverage of the JWST data. We used the retrieved thermal profile and surface gravity to generate a grid of chemical forward models with varying metallicity, (C/O)atm, and strengths of vertical mixing as encapsulated by the eddy diffusion coefficient Kzz. Comparison of the retrieved abundances with this grid of models suggests that the deep atmosphere of WISE 0359−54 shows signs of vigorous vertical mixing with Kzz = 109 [cm2 s−1]. To test the sensitivity of these results to our five-knot spline thermal profile model, we performed a second retrieval using the Madhusudhan & Seager thermal profile model. While the results of the two retrievals generally agree well, we do find differences between the retrieved values of mass and volume number mixing ratio of H2S with fractional differences of the median values of −0.64 and −0.10, respectively. In addition, the five-knot thermal profile is consistently warmer at pressure between 1 and 70 bar. Nevertheless, our results underscore the power that the broad-wavelength infrared spectra obtainable with the JWST have to characterize the atmospheres of cool brown dwarfs.

4U 1538-522 is a persistent high-mass X-ray binary that exhibits secular spin evolution. In 2019, it underwent a torque reversal from spinning up to spinning down. We performed an extensive study using four NuSTAR observations to compare temporal and spectral properties during different states. We observed no abrupt change in luminosity associated with the torque reversal. In addition, the pulse profile, the spectral shape, and the power spectrum remained unchanged before and after the torque reversal. The orbital and superorbital modulation profiles also showed no significant changes. We discuss possible mechanisms for the torque reversal and conclude that it is unlikely to be caused by interactions between the accretion disk and the magnetosphere. Instead, the transition of accretion modes in spherical accretion may be a plausible explanation.

总结:
JWST-FEAST项目利用JWST近红外和中红外成像来校准星系NGC 628的21 μm发射作为星形成率的指标，同时使用Paα (1.8756 μm)氢再组合发射线作为参考星形成率指标。研究发现，21 μm发射与星云线发射密切相关，使用模型分析表明星形成在星系中分布不均匀，使用混合SFR指标需要先了解主导尘埃加热的恒星年龄的平均值，这使得它们的应用变得不确定。与此相反，仅使用L(24)的非线性SFR校准更加稳健，从H ii区到星系的整个L(24)亮度范围内的变化小于2.5倍。<br /><br /> <div>
New JWST near-infrared imaging of the nearby galaxy NGC 628 from the JWST Cycle 1 program Feedback in Emerging extrAgalactic Star clusTers (JWST-FEAST) is combined with archival JWST mid-infrared imaging to calibrate the 21 μm emission as a star formation rate (SFR) indicator at ∼120 pc scales. The Paα (1.8756 μm) hydrogen recombination emission line targeted by FEAST provides a reference SFR indicator that is relatively insensitive to dust attenuation, as demonstrated by combining this tracer with Hubble Space Telescope Hα imaging. Our analysis is restricted to regions that appear compact in nebular line emission and are sufficiently bright to mitigate effects of both age and stochastic sampling of the stellar initial mass function. We find that the 21 μm emission closely correlates with the nebular line emission, with a power law with exponent = 1.07 ± 0.01, in agreement with past results. We calibrate a hybrid SFR indicator using a combination of Hα and 24 μm (extrapolated from 21 μm) tracers and derive the proportionality constant between the two tracers, b = 0.095 ± 0.007, which is ∼3–5 times larger than previous derivations using large regions/entire galaxies. We model these discrepancies as an increasing contribution to the dust heating by progressively older stellar populations for increasing spatial scale, in agreement with earlier findings that star formation is hierarchically distributed in galaxies. Thus, the use of hybrid SFR indicators requires prior knowledge of the mean age of the stellar populations dominating the dust heating, which makes their application uncertain. Conversely, nonlinear calibrations of SFRs from L(24) alone are more robust, with a factor ≲ 2.5 variation across the entire range of L(24) luminosities from H ii regions to galaxies.

这篇文章报告了利用JWST/NIRCam数据对NGC 628中离子化气体（用Paα和Brα追踪）、以及3.3μm多环芳烃（PAH）发射进行地图绘制的研究成果。研究探究并校准了3.3μm PAH发射和星形成率（SFR）之间的关系，发现在尺度约为40 pc的尺度下，3.3μm PAH光度面密度与由Brα追踪的SFR之间存在着密切的、次线性的关系。研究表明，关系的散布与局部星际介质金属丰度的变化不太相关，而可能是由于恒星初始质量函数（IMF）的随机采样和PAH加热、来源年龄的变化所致。研究结果经过各种连续谱减去技术的测试，并发现它们在导出的斜率和截距上仍然是稳健的，只有轻微差异。研究还发现氢再组合线（Paα与Brα；Hα与Brα）之间存在意外的差异。 <div>
We present maps of ionized gas (traced by Paα and Brα) and 3.3 μm polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 628, derived from new JWST/NIRCam data from the Feedback in Emerging extrAgalactic Star clusTers (FEAST) survey. With this data, we investigate and calibrate the relation between 3.3 μm PAH emission and star formation rate (SFR) in and around emerging young star clusters (eYSCs) on a scale of ∼40 pc. We find a tight (correlation coefficient ρ ∼ 0.9) sublinear (power-law exponent α ∼ 0.75) relation between the 3.3 μm PAH luminosity surface density and SFR traced by Brα for compact, cospatial (within 0.″16 or ∼7 pc) peaks in Paα, Brα, and 3.3 μm (eYSC–I). The scatter in the relationship does not correlate well with variations in local interstellar medium metallicity, due to a radial metallicity gradient, but rather is likely due to stochastic sampling of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) and variations in the PAH heating and age of our sources. The deviation from a linear relation may be explained by PAH destruction in more intense ionizing environments, variations in age, and IMF stochasticity at intermediate to low luminosities. We test our results with various continuum subtraction techniques using combinations of NIRCam bands and find that they remain robust with only minor differences in the derived slope and intercept. An unexpected discrepancy is identified between the relations of hydrogen recombination lines (Paα versus Brα; Hα versus Brα).

Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Legacy Imaging Surveys Data Release 9, Survey Validation 3,和Year 1数据集的结合，用于估计不同暗物质晕数据和红移范围的星系条件亮度函数和条件星族质量函数。利用DESI模拟星系红移调查(MGRS)和Jiutian模拟生成数据，并通过扩展的基于暗物质晕的群体发现器进行分析。通过对比使用光度和光谱数据导出的r-和z- 波段亮度函数和星族质量函数，定量评估了光度红移误差对星系亮度函数和星族质量函数的影响。通过使用MGRS进行先前的群体发现器评估，成功地从观测数据中获得了一组CLF和CSMF测量结果。发现在低红移下，低亮度/质量下方的CLF和CSMF的斜率与次暗物质质量函数具有一致性。根据Chen等人的研究修正了我们当地宇宙的宇宙方差效应后，发现LFs/SMFs的低亮度/质量端也与暗物质质量函数的斜率保持一致。 <div>
In this investigation, we leverage the combination of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Legacy Imaging Surveys Data Release 9, Survey Validation 3, and Year 1 data sets to estimate the conditional luminosity functions and conditional stellar mass functions (CLFs and CSMFs) of galaxies across various halo mass bins and redshift ranges. To support our analysis, we utilize a realistic DESI mock galaxy redshift survey (MGRS) generated from a high-resolution Jiutian simulation. An extended halo-based group finder is applied to both MGRS catalogs and DESI observation. By comparing the r- and z-band luminosity functions (LFs) and stellar mass functions (SMFs) derived using both photometric and spectroscopic data, we quantified the impact of photometric redshift (photo-z) errors on the galaxy LFs and SMFs, especially in the low-redshift bin at the low-luminosity/mass end. By conducting prior evaluations of the group finder using MGRS, we successfully obtain a set of CLF and CSMF measurements from observational data. We find that at low redshift, the faint-end slopes of CLFs and CSMFs below ∼109h−2L⊙ (or h−2M⊙) evince a compelling concordance with the subhalo mass functions. After correcting the cosmic variance effect of our local Universe following Chen et al., the faint-end slopes of the LFs/SMFs turn out to also be in good agreement with the slope of the halo mass function.

We present confusion-limited SCUBA-2 450 μm observations in the COSMOS-CANDELS region as part of the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope Large Program SCUBA-2 Ultra Deep Imaging EAO Survey. Our maps at 450 and 850 μm cover an area of 450 arcmin2. We achieved instrumental noise levels of σ450 = 0.59 mJy beam−1 and σ850 = 0.09 mJy beam−1 in the deepest area of each map. The corresponding confusion noise levels are estimated to be 0.65 and 0.36 mJy beam−1. Above the 4σ (3.5σ) threshold, we detected 360 (479) sources at 450 μm and 237 (314) sources at 850 μm. We derive the deepest blank-field number counts at 450 μm, covering the flux-density range of 2–43 mJy. These are in agreement with other SCUBA-2 blank-field and lensing-cluster observations but are lower than various model counts. We compare the counts with those in other fields and find that the field-to-field variance observed at 450 μm at the scale is consistent with Poisson noise, so there is no evidence of strong 2D clustering at this scale. Additionally, we derive the integrated surface brightness at 450 μm down to 2.1 mJy to be Jy deg−2, contributing to 41% ± 4% of the 450 μm extragalactic background light (EBL) measured by Cosmic Background Explorer and Planck. Our results suggest that the 450 μm EBL may be fully resolved at mJy, which extremely deep lensing-cluster observations and next-generation submillimeter instruments with large aperture sizes may be able to achieve.

总结:
通过深度的Green Bank望远镜21厘米观测数据和光学光谱数据的结合分析，揭示了breakBRD星系的气体含量特征。这些星系的特点是蓝色星形中心和红色熄灭盘，不符合螺旋星系典型的内外逐渐演化规律。研究确认了breakBRD的中性原子氢(H i)气体分数平均低于典型星系，但一般高于绿谷星系，H i消耗时间比典型星系低一个数量级，但远远高于绿谷星系。breakBRD的核气相金属丰度分布宽，倾向于略高于平均值。在质量旋转速度相同时，这些星系偏离了巴里奥-图利-费舍尔关系，H i的不对称性也更高。大部分星系的气体速度场高度扭曲或与恒星盘完全不一致，这些证据支持了一种场景，即breakBRD处于早期熄灭阶段，并且有混合的迹象表明它们的行为与过去的并合活动有关。 <div>
By combining newly obtained deep Green Bank Telescope 21 cm observations with optical spectroscopic data, we present an analysis of the gas content of break bulges in red disks (breakBRD) galaxies, a population denoted by their blue star-forming centers and red quenched disks that do not appear to follow the typical inside-out evolution of spiral galaxies. We confirm previous results that the neutral atomic hydrogen (H i) gas fractions of breakBRDs are, on average, lower than those of typical galaxies on the star-forming sequence (SFS), and find that their H i fractions are generally higher than green valley (GV) galaxies. H i depletion times for breakBRDs are roughly an order of magnitude lower than those of SFS galaxies, in stark contrast with GV galaxies that typically have much longer depletion times than SFS galaxies. The nuclear gas-phase metallicities of breakBRDs have a broader distribution than SFS galaxies and are skewed toward slightly above-average values. BreakBRDs are systematically offset from the baryonic Tully–Fisher relation toward lower baryonic mass at a given rotation velocity. They also have higher typical H i asymmetries than SFS galaxies, and of those galaxies with spatially resolved gas velocity fields from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory survey, two-thirds are either highly distorted or completely misaligned relative to the stellar disk. Evidence supports a scenario where breakBRDs are in an early phase of quenching, and there is mixed evidence that their behavior is related to past merger activity.

<div> M型恒星，耀斑能量，GWAC探测，恒星年龄，等效持续时间
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章讨论了M型恒星的耀斑活动。研究发现，这些恒星的耀斑能量范围很广，且耀斑振幅与恒星表面温度无关。通过对TESS和K2光变曲线、LAMOST、SDSS、2.16米望远镜和Gaia DR3数据的分析，发现这些GWAC耀斑星都很年轻。另外，研究了耀斑能量与恒星半球面积的关系，发现其呈正相关。对M7-L1型恒星来说，在限制其最大耀斑能量的同时，似乎还存在其他因素。 <div>
M-type stars are the ones that flare most frequently, but how big their maximum flare energy can reach is still unknown. We present 163 flares from 162 individual M2 through L1-type stars that triggered the GWAC, with flare energies ranging from 1032.2 to 1036.4 erg. The flare amplitudes range from △G = 0.84 to ∼10 mag. Flare energy increases with stellar surface temperature (Teff) but both △G and equivalent duration seem to be independent of Teff. Combining periods detected from light curves of TESS and K2, spectra from LAMOST, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the 2.16 m telescope, and the Gaia DR3 data, we found that these GWAC flare stars are young. For the stars that have spectra, we found that these stars are in or very near the saturation region, and is lower for M7–L1 stars than for M2–M6 stars. We also studied the relation between GWAC flare bolometric energy Ebol and stellar hemispherical area S, and found that (in erg) increases with increasing S (in square centimeters), and the maximum flare energy . For M7–L1 stars, there seem to be other factors limiting their maximum flare energies in addition to the stellar hemispherical area.

<div> 关键词: TESS, 光度测量, 天体光谱, 二元星, 磁活动<br />
总结: <br />
使用TESS高精度光度测量和大天区多目标光纤分光镜中分辨率的光谱分析了OO Leo，发现它是W型接触双星，具有较低质量比和适度接触程度。发现次星表面有一个逆行冷斑，Hα线的调查证实其具有较高的磁活动。轨道周期研究表明OO Leo正经历着轨道周期的线性减小和周期性变化，可通过无形第三体的光程效应或次星的周期性磁活动解释。这些发现使OO Leo成为研究接触双星差异旋转的绝佳目标。 <div>
With Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) high-precision photometry and Large Sky Area Multi-object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope medium-resolution spectra, we present the first light and radial velocity curve analyses for the eclipsing binary OO Leo. The simultaneous solution suggests that OO Leo is a W-subtype contact binary with a relatively low mass ratio (1/q = 0.173) and a moderate degree of contact (f = 28.1%). The asymmetry and continuous changes observed in the TESS light curve were properly modeled by one retrograde cool spot on its secondary surface. A detailed investigation of the Hα line also confirmed that the secondary star had a high level of magnetic activity. The retrograde longitudinal motion of the spot can be explained by a solar-like differential rotation in the secondary component. The orbital period investigation revealed that OO Leo is undergoing a secular decrease and a cyclic variation in its orbital period. The secular decrease may be mainly caused by mass transfer from the more massive secondary star to the less massive primary star. The cyclic period variation can be explained by the light–time effect of an invisible third body or the cyclic magnetic activity of the secondary star. The long-lived spot migration in the longitudinal direction makes OO Leo an excellent target for investigating the differential rotations of contact binaries.

<div> Pleiades open cluster, M-dwarf, magnetic fields, stellar rotation, radius inflation

总结:
这篇文章研究了昴星团中62个M-矮星成员的平均磁场测量值。他们使用马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛方法来对磁填充因子进行建模，并发现磁场强度与恒星自转之间存在正相关关系。他们还发现，平均而言，样本中的星体显示半径膨胀，并且磁场强度和半径膨胀之间存在正相关关系。研究结果还表明，具有更高色球和日冕活动的恒星往往具有更强的磁场。 <div>
Average magnetic field measurements are presented for 62 M-dwarf members of the Pleiades open cluster, derived from Zeeman-enhanced Fe i lines in the H band. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo methodology was employed to model magnetic filling factors using Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) IV APOGEE high-resolution spectra, along with the radiative transfer code Synmast, MARCS stellar atmosphere models, and the APOGEE Data Release 17 spectral line list. There is a positive correlation between mean magnetic fields and stellar rotation, with slow-rotator stars (Rossby number, Ro > 0.13) exhibiting a steeper slope than rapid rotators (Ro < 0.13). However, the latter sample still shows a positive trend between Ro and magnetic fields, which is given by 〈B〉 = 1604 × Ro−0.20. The derived stellar radii when compared with physical isochrones show that, on average, our sample shows radius inflation, with median enhanced radii ranging from +3.0% to +7.0%, depending on the model. There is a positive correlation between magnetic field strength and radius inflation, as well as with stellar spot coverage, correlations which together indicate that stellar spot-filling factors generated by strong magnetic fields might be the mechanism that drives radius inflation in these stars. We also compare our derived magnetic fields with chromospheric emission lines (Hα, Hβ, and Ca ii K), as well as with X-ray and Hα to bolometric luminosity ratios, and find that stars with higher chromospheric and coronal activity tend to be more magnetic.

<div> 星系；形成；抑制；卫星；环境
总结:
本研究使用NewHorizon模拟探讨了两个低质量星系团中M* > 107M⊙卫星星系的星系形成（SF）抑制现象。研究确认了卫星星系（M* ≲ 1010M⊙）比同等质量的场星系更容易被抑制。随着恒星质量增加，这种抑制比例下降，与最近的研究结果一致。与团簇环境的发现相似，我们注意到星系在星系团内的轨道运动与星系形成抑制现象之间存在相关性。具体而言，在星系团中心，星系形成被抑制，对于M* > 109.1M⊙的星系，通常在暂时抑制后会出现明显的“复苏”阶段。星系团中心的星系形成抑制主要受到星系形成效率和可用气体量的影响，这两者均受到星际介质和群星系周围热气体之间的流体动力学相互作用的影响。相反，M* < 108.2M⊙的卫星星系在星系团内经历了显著的气体去除，导致星系形成受到抑制。我们的分析凸显了星系群环境中卫星星系的星系形成抑制的复杂性，涉及星系形成效率（取决于气体的动力学状态）和寒冷致密气体的可用性之间的复杂竞争。这挑战了基于尘埃压力带来的气体剥离的环境效应的典型理解，表明需要对轻微环境效应下的星系演化进行新的描述。 <div>
We study star formation (SF) quenching of satellite galaxies with M* > 107M⊙ within two low-mass groups (Mvir = 1012.9 and 1012.7M⊙) using the NewHorizon simulation. We confirm that satellite galaxies (M* ≲ 1010M⊙) are more prone to quenching than their field counterparts. This quenched fraction decreases with increasing stellar mass, consistent with recent studies. Similar to the findings in cluster environments, we note a correlation between the orbital motions of galaxies within these groups and the phenomenon of SF quenching. Specifically, SF is suppressed at the group center, and for galaxies with M* > 109.1M⊙, there is often a notable rejuvenation phase following a temporary quenching period. The SF quenching at the group center is primarily driven by changes in SF efficiency and the amount of gas available, both of which are influenced by hydrodynamic interactions between the interstellar medium and surrounding hot gas within the group. Conversely, satellite galaxies with M* < 108.2M⊙ experience significant gas removal within the group, leading to SF quenching. Our analysis highlights the complexity of SF quenching in satellite galaxies in group environments, which involves an intricate competition between the efficiency of SF (which depends on the dynamical state of the gas) on the one hand, and the availability of cold dense gas on the other hand. This challenges the typical understanding of environmental effects based on gas stripping through ram pressure, suggesting a need for a new description of galaxy evolution under mild environmental effects.

<div> 磁活动区域，极场，太阳循环，磁场，太阳表面

总结：<br /><br />本文研究了太阳活跃区域（ARs）对太阳极场的贡献以及它们对太阳循环变化的影响。通过提供了1996年以来AR的初始和最终二极磁场的数据库以及其双极磁区（BMR）近似的结果，作者发现了BMR近似对于初始二极磁场的预测较为准确，但对于最终二极磁场存在显著偏差。因此，准确评估AR对极场的贡献需要采用最终二极磁场的真实配置。此外，虽然单个AR的磁通输送可能会增加或减少其二极磁场，但在整个太阳循环中，所有AR的集体影响是减少其总二极磁场。 <div>
Solar active regions (ARs) determine solar polar fields and cause solar cycle variability within the framework of the Babcock–Leighton dynamo. The contribution of an AR to the polar field is measured by its dipole field, which results from flux emergence and subsequent flux transport over the solar surface. The dipole fields contributed by an AR before and after the flux transport are referred to as the initial and final dipole fields, respectively. For a better understanding and prediction of solar cycles, in this paper, we provide a database including AR's initial and final dipole fields and the corresponding results of their bipolar magnetic region (BMR) approximation from 1996 onward. We also identify the repeated ARs and provide the optimized transport parameters. Based on our database, we find that although the commonly used BMR approximation performs well for the initial dipole field, it exhibits a significant deviation for the final dipole field. To accurately assess an AR’s contribution to the polar field, the final dipole field with its real configuration should be applied. Despite the notable contributions of a few rogue ARs, approximately the top 500 ARs ordered by their final dipole fields are necessary to derive the polar field at the cycle minimum. While flux transport may increase or decrease the dipole field for an individual AR, its collective impact over all ARs in a cycle is a reduction in their total dipole field.

总结:<br /><br />本研究通过二维粒子模拟探索了湍流涨压的哈里斯电流片对重联过程的影响。我们发现湍流场的存在可以影响磁重联的开始和演变。此外，我们观察到磁场涨落存在一个依赖尺度的振幅，超过这个振幅会破坏磁岛的生长。这些涨落向电流片内的粒子提供了热能，而对背景粒子则提供了优先的垂直热能。这些发现有助于我们更深入地理解碰撞无非相对论正负电子等离子体中的能量耗散机制。 <div>
Energy dissipation in collisionless plasmas is one of the most outstanding open questions in plasma physics. Magnetic reconnection and turbulence are two phenomena that can produce the conditions for energy dissipation. These two phenomena are closely related to each other in a wide range of plasmas. Turbulent fluctuations can emerge in critical regions of reconnection events, and magnetic reconnection can occur as a product of the turbulent cascade. In this study, we perform 2D particle-in-cell simulations of a reconnecting Harris current sheet in the presence of turbulent fluctuations to explore the effect of turbulence on the reconnection process in collisionless nonrelativistic pair plasmas. We find that the presence of a turbulent field can affect the onset and evolution of magnetic reconnection. Moreover, we observe the existence of a scale-dependent amplitude of magnetic field fluctuations above which these fluctuations are able to disrupt the growing of magnetic islands. These fluctuations provide thermal energy to the particles within the current sheet and preferential perpendicular thermal energy to the background population.

<div> 关键词: RRATs, LuNfit, intrinsic luminosity distribution, Bayes ratio, pulsar nulling fractions
总结:
本研究介绍了一种名为LuNfit的新算法，旨在校正源自望远镜和检测管道的选择偏差，估计脉冲星发射的单脉冲固有光度分布和nulling fraction。LuNfit依赖于贝叶斯嵌套抽样，可以完全探索参数空间。研究还发现，传统方法通过“放大”未检测到的射电暂现现象的部分可能不可靠。最后，讨论了LuNfit目前的实施限制，同时深入探讨了潜在的增强措施，使LuNfit能够应用于具有复杂脉冲形态的源。 <div>
Studying transient phenomena, such as individual pulses from pulsars, has garnered considerable attention in the era of astronomical big data. Of specific interest to this study are rotating radio transients (RRATs), nulling, and intermittent pulsars. This study introduces a new algorithm named LuNfit, tailored to correct the selection biases originating from the telescope and detection pipelines. Ultimately LuNfit estimates the intrinsic luminosity distribution and nulling fraction of the single pulses emitted by pulsars. LuNfit relies on Bayesian nested sampling so that the parameter space can be fully explored. Bayesian nested sampling also provides the additional benefit of simplifying model comparisons through the Bayes ratio. The robustness of LuNfit is shown through simulations and applying LuNfit onto pulsars with known nulling fractions. LuNfit is then applied to three RRATs, J0012+5431, J1538+1523, and J2355+1523, extracting their intrinsic luminosity distribution and burst rates. We find that their nulling fractions are 0.4(2), 0.749(5), and 0.995(2), respectively. We further find that a log-normal distribution likely describes the single pulse luminosity distribution of J0012+5431 and J1538+1523, while the Bayes ratio for J2355+1523 slightly favors an exponential distribution. We show the conventional method of correcting selection effects by “scaling up” the missed fraction of radio transients can be unreliable when the mean luminosity of the source is faint relative to the telescope sensitivity. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the current implementation of LuNfit while also delving into potential enhancements that would enable LuNfit to be applied to sources with complex pulse morphologies.

We introduce APPLE, a novel planetary evolution code designed specifically for the study of giant exoplanet and Jovian planet evolution in the era of Galileo, Juno, and Cassini. With APPLE, state-of-the-art equations of state for hydrogen, helium, ice, and rock are integrated with advanced features to treat ice/rock cores and metals in the gaseous envelope; models for helium rain and hydrogen/helium immiscibility; detailed atmosphere boundary tables that also provide self-consistent albedos and spectra; and options to address envelope metal gradients and stably stratified regions. Our hope is that these purpose-built features of APPLE will help catalyze the development of the next generation of giant exoplanet and Jovian planet evolutionary models.

<div> 关键词: 硅单硫化物, 天体化学, 反应机理, 分子云, 量子化学

总结: 
硅单硫化物（SiS）在宇宙空间的形成过程一直被认为困难重重，但现有研究显示，之前排除的反应途径可能对其天体丰度做出贡献。SH + SiH基团反应产生SiS，并产生一个稳定的H2分子作为产物来消散动能。这种反应是一种有利的气相化学反应。虽然之前提出的原子硫和硅与SiH、SH和H2S反应的机制仍然是SiS生成的主要贡献者，但在某些区域SiS的丰度可能是SiH存在的标志，而这之前并未观察到。量子化学计算得出的反应轨迹表明，分子云、震撼区域或原行星盘的硅-硫化合物化学可能比之前预想的更加丰富。此外，还提供了中间体顺式和反式HSiSH的量子化学光谱数据，以帮助其进行潜在的光谱表征。 <div>
The formation of silicon monosulfide (SiS) in space appears to be a difficult process, but the present work shows that a previously excluded pathway may contribute to its astronomical abundance. Reaction of the radicals SH + SiH produces SiS with a submerged transition state and generates a stabilizing H2 molecule as a product to dissipate the kinetic energy. Such is a textbook chemical reaction for favorable gas-phase chemistry. While previously proposed mechanisms reacting atomic sulfur and silicon with SiH, SH, and H2S will still be major contributors to the production of SiS, an abundance of SiS in certain regions could be a marker for the presence of SiH where it has previously been unobserved. These quantum chemically computed reaction profiles imply that the silicon-chalcogen chemistry of molecular clouds, shocked regions, or protoplanetary disks may be richer than previously thought. Quantum chemical spectral data for the intermediate cis- and trans-HSiSH are also provided to aid in their potential spectroscopic characterization.

<br /><br />总结: 本文首次利用加拿大氢强度映射实验的极化地图对G137+7进行详细分析，发现了一个有趣的天体结构——蝌蚪，并推测其头部是一个Faraday旋转特征，尾部暗示了气体或电离星的运动。在频谱中发现多个组分，而在约600兆赫兹的Faraday旋转观测对低密度的电离或部分电离气体敏感。 <div>
A direct consequence of Faraday rotation is that the polarized radio sky does not resemble the total intensity sky at long wavelengths. We analyze G137+7, which is undetectable in total intensity but appears as a depolarization feature. We use the first polarization maps from the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment. Our 400–729 MHz bandwidth and angular resolution, – , allow us to use Faraday synthesis to analyze the polarization structure. In polarized intensity and polarization angle maps, we find a tail extending 10° from the head and designate the combined object, the tadpole. Similar polarization angles, distinct from the background, indicate that the head and tail are physically associated. The head appears as a depolarized ring in single channels, but wideband observations show that it is a Faraday rotation feature. Our investigations of H i and Hα find no connections to the tadpole. The tail suggests motion of either the gas or an ionizing star through the interstellar medium; the B2(e) star HD 20336 is a candidate. While the head features a coherent, ∼ −8 rad m−2 Faraday depth, Faraday synthesis also identifies multiple components in both the head and tail. We verify the locations of the components in the spectra using QU fitting. Our results show that approximately octave-bandwidth Faraday rotation observations at ∼600 MHz are sensitive to low-density ionized or partially ionized gas, which is undetectable in other tracers.

<div> 演化, 星系, 大小, 熄灭, 红移
<br /><br />总结: 本研究跟踪了4518个老年和583个年轻的静止星系样本，在红移0.5 < z < 3期间进行了数量密度和结构演化的研究。在z∼2时期，大约50%的静止星系是最近熄灭的，而这些年轻的静止星系在较低红移时变得越来越稀少，支持了大质量星系熄灭的高峰时期发生在z > 2。我们的数据显示，尽管静止星系的有效半光半径随时间普遍增加，但在相同红移下，年轻的静止星系要比它们的老年对应物体明显更小。我们研究了这种大小差异与其他结构特性之间的关联，包括轴比、颜色梯度、恒星质量和有效半径的内禀离散度。我们证明了这种大小差异是由最大的亚种群（log(M⋆/M⊙) > 11）驱动的，并且当将样本限制在中等质量星系（10.4 < log(M⋆/M⊙) < 11）时，这种差异并不持续。有趣的是，在研究的时期内，物理大小的内禀离散度显示出强烈的共同演化，并在z ∼ 2附近达到峰值，只有在z < 1时才出现分歧。综上所述，并假设我们没有错过大量的低表面亮度星系群，尽管在更高红移时主导形成和熄灭机制产生了紧凑的遗迹，但在z < 1时期可能有多种演化路径可以解释熄灭的星系的多样形态。 <div>
We present a study of the growth of the quiescent galaxy population between 0.5 < z < 3 by tracing the number density and structural evolution of a sample of 4518 old and 583 young quiescent galaxies with log(M⋆/M⊙) > 10.4, selected from the COSMOS2020 catalog with complementary Hubble Space Telescope F160W imaging from the 3D-DASH survey. Among the quiescent population at z ∼ 2, roughly 50% are recently quenched galaxies; these young quiescent galaxies become increasingly rare toward lower redshift, supporting the idea that the peak epoch of massive galaxy quenching occurred at z > 2. Our data show that while the effective half-light radius of quiescent galaxies generally increases with time, young quiescent galaxies are significantly smaller than their older counterparts at the same redshift. In this work we investigate the connection between this size difference and other structural properties, including axis ratio, color gradients, stellar mass, and the intrinsic scatter in effective radius. We demonstrate that the size difference is driven by the most massive subpopulation (log(M⋆/M⊙) > 11) and does not persist when restricting the sample to intermediate-mass galaxies (10.4 < log(M⋆/M⊙) < 11). Interestingly, the intrinsic scatter in physical size shows a strong coevolution over the investigated time period and peaks around z ∼ 2 for both populations, only diverging at z < 1. Taken together, and assuming we are not missing a significant population of lower surface brightness galaxies, while the formation and quenching mechanisms that dominate at higher redshifts yield compact remnants, multiple evolutionary pathways may explain the diverse morphologies of galaxies that quench at z < 1.

总结：<br /><br />这篇文章介绍了对小麦哲伦星云中最亮的星形成区域NGC 346进行的JWST成像调查。通过两个仪器的光度测量，已经检测到200,000多个独特的源。使用近红外颜色分析，观察到了包括196个年轻恒星对象（YSO）在内的各种不同演化阶段的星团。进一步进行了中红外颜色-星等图并确定了颜色分割，以识别了833个红化的YSO候选源。这些候选源与尘埃丝状星云区域有空间关联。此外，对在所有MIRI波段上均有探测的一些源，拟合了YSO光谱能量分布模型。对这些样本中的23个YSO进行了高度自信的分类，并估计了它们的半径、辐射温度、光度和质量。检测到了质量接近1太阳质量的星际年轻恒星对象，这是迄今为止已确认的质量最低的星系外YSO。 <div>
We present a JWST imaging survey with NIRCam and MIRI of NGC 346, the brightest star-forming region in the Small Magellanic Cloud. By combining aperture and point-spread function photometry of 11 wavelength bands across these two instruments, we have detected more than 200,000 unique sources. Using a near-infrared color analysis, we observe various evolved and young populations, including 196 young stellar objects (YSOs) and pre-main-sequence stars suitable for forthcoming spectroscopic studies. We expand upon this work, creating mid-infrared color–magnitude diagrams and determining color cuts to identify 833 reddened sources which are YSO candidates. We observe that these candidate sources are spatially associated with regions of dusty, filamentary nebulosity. Furthermore, we fit model YSO spectral energy distributions to a selection of sources with detections across all of our MIRI bands. We classify with a high degree of confidence 23 YSOs in this sample and estimate their radii, bolometric temperatures, luminosities, and masses. We detect YSOs approaching 1 M⊙, the lowest-mass extragalactic YSOs confirmed to date.

We have determined the proper motions (PMs) of 12 dwarf galaxies in the Local Group (LG), ranging from the outer Milky Way (MW) halo to the edge of the LG. We used the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) as the first and Gaia as the second epoch using the GaiaHub software. For Leo A and Sag DIG, we also used multi-epoch HST measurements relative to background galaxies. Orbital histories derived using these PMs show that two-thirds of the galaxies in our sample are on first infall with >90% certainty. The observed star formation histories of these first-infall dwarfs are generally consistent with infalling dwarfs in simulations. The remaining four galaxies have crossed the virial radius of either the MW or M31. When we compare their star formation (SF) and orbital histories we find tentative agreement between the inferred pattern of SF with the timing of dynamical events in the orbital histories. For Leo I, SF activity rises as the dwarf crosses the MW’s virial radius, culminating in a burst of SF shortly before pericenter (≈1.7 Gyr ago). The SF then declines after pericenter, but with some smaller bursts before its recent quenching (≈0.3 Gyr ago). This shows that even small dwarfs like Leo I can hold onto gas reservoirs and avoid quenching for several gigayears after falling into their host, which is longer than generally found in simulations. Leo II, NGC 6822, and IC 10 are also qualitatively consistent with this SF pattern in relation to their orbit, but more tentatively due to larger uncertainties.

总结:<br />
研究对四颗CTTSs进行了多波段的光度监测，并结合哈勃太空望远镜的紫外和光学光谱。发现这四颗恒星的光变性强烈，变化通常在数天至数年之间，与恒星自转周期和随机的吸积变化有关。光度变化与质量吸积存在强烈的关联，但关系因目标和时期而异。因此，在CTTSs中，光度测量应谨慎用作吸积的直接测量。 <div>
Classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs) are young, low-mass stars that accrete material from their surrounding protoplanetary disk. To better understand accretion variability, we conducted a multiepoch, multiwavelength photometric monitoring campaign of four CTTSs, TW Hya, RU Lup, BP Tau, and GM Aur, in 2021 and 2022, contemporaneous with Hubble Space Telescope UV and optical spectra. We find that all four targets display significant variability in their light curves, generally on days-long timescales (but in some cases year-to-year), often due to periodicity associated with stellar rotation and to stochastic accretion variability. There is a strong connection between mass accretion and photometric variability in all bands, but the relationship varies per target and epoch. Thus, photometry should be used with caution as a direct measure of accretion in CTTSs.

<br /><br />
这篇论文利用Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam多色成像技术对M33星系的外部区域进行了分析。他们使用RGB和RC星等作为研究目标，并构建了这些星体的径向表面密度分布图。研究发现M33存在一个扩展的星体组分，其斜率较浅，表明M33可能具有双重结构的星系组分。另外，在星系外部区域检测到了老化或者贫金属成分，支持了星际晕的延伸。最后，他们估计这一星体组分的表面亮度为μV = 35.72 ± 0.08 mag arcsec−2，这与之前的观测限制是一致的。
<br /><br />总结: M33通过Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam进行外部区域分析，发现扩展星体组分，估计表面亮度为35.72 ± 0.08 mag arcsec−2；通过径向分布图发现浅斜率的星系组分，支持双重结构或者延伸盘的存在；检测到了老化或者贫金属成分，支持星际晕的延伸。 <div>
We analyze the outer regions of M33, beyond 15 kpc in projected distance from its center, using Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam multicolor imaging. We identify red giant branch (RGB) stars and red clump (RC) stars using the surface-gravity-sensitive NB515 filter for the RGB sample and a multicolor selection for both samples. We construct the radial surface density profiles of these RGB and RC stars and find that M33 has an extended stellar population with a shallow power-law index of α > −3, depending on the intensity of the contamination. This result represents a flatter profile than the stellar halo that was detected by the previous study focusing on the central region, suggesting that M33 may have a double-structured halo component, i.e., inner/outer halos or a very extended disk. Also, the slope of this extended component is shallower than those typically found for halos in large galaxies, implying intermediate-mass galaxies may have different formation mechanisms (e.g., tidal interaction) from large spirals. We also analyze the radial color profiles of RC/RGB stars and detect a radial gradient, consistent with the presence of an old and/or metal-poor population in the outer region of M33, thereby supporting our proposal that the stellar halo extends beyond 15 kpc. Finally, we estimate that the surface brightness of this extended component is μV = 35.72 ± 0.08 mag arcsec−2. If our detected component is the stellar halo, this estimated value is consistent with the detection limit of previous observations.

总结: 
本研究使用数值一维太阳能粒子传输模型比较观测到的太阳能粒子事件的强度-时间曲线，推导出1天文单位处太阳能粒子的平行平均自由程(pMFP)随能量（或刚度）的变化。研究发现，在质子方面，逆推得到的pMFP值与理论估计相当一致，而观测到的pMFP值的事件间变化可以通过背景涡动值的自然变化来解释。对于电子，采用动力学涡动耗散模型推导的pMFP值与观测结果相对一致，尽管理论值对涡动耗散范围的细节非常敏感，而这些细节本身又表现出很高的变化。<br /><br /> <div>
In this work, more than a dozen solar energetic particle (SEP) events are identified where the source region is magnetically well connected to at least one spacecraft at 1 au. The observed intensity–time profiles, for all available proton and electron energy channels, are compared to results computed using a numerical one-dimensional SEP transport model in order to derive the parallel mean free paths (pMFPs) as a function of energy (or rigidity) at 1 au. These inversion results are then compared to theoretical estimates of the pMFP, using observed turbulence quantities with observationally motivated variations as input. For protons, a very good comparison between inversion and theoretical results is obtained. It is shown that the observed inter-event variations in the inversion pMFP values can be explained by natural variations in the background turbulence values. For electrons, there is relatively good agreement with pMFPs derived assuming the damping model of dynamical turbulence, although the theoretical values are extremely sensitive to the details of the turbulence dissipation range, which themselves display a high level of variation.

Most galaxies, including the Milky Way, harbor a central supermassive black hole (SMBH) weighing millions to billions of solar masses. Surrounding these SMBHs are dense regions of stars and stellar remnants, such as neutron stars (NSs) and black holes (BHs). NSs and possibly BHs receive large natal kicks at birth on the order of hundreds of kilometers per second. The natal kicks that occur in the vicinity of an SMBH may redistribute the orbital configuration of the compact objects and alter their underlying density distribution. We model the effects of natal kicks on a Galactic center (GC) population of massive stars and stellar binaries with different initial density distributions. Using observational constraints from stellar orbits near the GC, we place an upper limit on the steepness of the initial stellar profile and find it to be core-like. In addition, we predict that 30%–70% of compact objects become unbound from the SMBH due to their kicks and will migrate throughout the Galaxy. Different BH kick prescriptions lead to distinct spatial and kinematic distributions. We suggest that the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope may be able to distinguish between these distributions and thus be able to differentiate between natal kick mechanisms.

This study addresses the prediction of geomagnetic disturbances by exploiting machine learning techniques. Specifically, the Long Short-term Memory recurrent neural network, which is particularly suited for application over long time series, is employed in the analysis of in situ measurements of solar wind plasma and magnetic field acquired over more than one solar cycle, from 2005 to 2019, at the Lagrangian point L1. The problem is approached as a binary classification aiming to predict 1 hr in advance a decrease in the SYM-H geomagnetic activity index below the threshold of −50 nT, which is generally regarded as indicative of magnetospheric perturbations. The strong class imbalance issue is tackled by using an appropriate loss function tailored to optimize appropriate skill scores in the training phase of the neural network. Beside classical skill scores, value-weighted skill scores are then employed to evaluate predictions, suitable in the study of problems, such as the one faced here, characterized by strong temporal variability. For the first time, the content of magnetic helicity and energy carried by solar transients, associated with their detection and likelihood of geoeffectiveness, were considered as input features of the network architecture. Their predictive capabilities are demonstrated through a correlation-driven feature selection method to rank the most relevant characteristics involved in the neural network prediction model. The optimal performance of the adopted neural network in properly forecasting the onset of geomagnetic storms, which is a crucial point for giving real warnings in an operational setting, is finally showed.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The origin and formation of globular clusters (GCs) has remained a mystery. We present a formation scenario for ancient GC-like objects that form in ultrahigh-resolution simulations (smallest cell size < 0.1 pc, mass resolution Mcell = 4 M⊙). The simulations are cosmological zoom-in simulations of dwarf galaxies within the stellar mass range 106−7M⊙ that match Local Group dwarf properties well. Our investigation reveals GCs hosting ancient stellar populations, characterized by a lack of dark matter (DM) in the present epoch. The clusters exhibit short, episodic star formation histories, occasionally marked by the presence of multiple stellar generations. The metallicity distributions show a widening, encompassing stars in the range of 10−4 < Z⋆/Z⊙ < 1. The presence of these objects is attributable to star formation occurring within low-mass DM halos (Mhalo ≈ 106M⊙) during the early stages of the Universe, preceding reionization (z ≳ 7). As these clusters are accreted into dwarf galaxies, DM is preferentially subjected to tidal stripping, with an average accretion redshift of .

Spectropolarimetric observation of a quiescent prominence was performed in He i 1083 nm. With the slit of the spectrograph fixed on the prominence, we obtained a time series of Stokes profiles for a duration of 108 minutes with a cadence of 8 s. Also using imaging spectroscopic data in Hα and extreme-ultraviolet images at 193 Å, we obtained the following results: (1) The prominence harbors persistent waves propagating across its body. (2) The waves are conspicuous in the line-of-sight (LOS) velocity with an amplitude of about 2 km s−1 but not detectable in the intensity of emission lines or magnetic field. (3) Noticeable periods are about 4 minutes (220 and 260 s) and 15 minutes (910 s), and they propagate with phase speeds of 140 ∼ 200 and ∼24 km s−1 preferentially in horizontal and vertical directions, respectively. (4) Magnetic field strength was estimated to be about 2.5 G with its LOS component of 0 ± 1 G on average. We interpret the 4 minute oscillation as Alfvénic waves propagating in the corona containing the prominence threads, and it is not a resonant wave trapped in the prominence body but excited by an external source. On the other hand, a 15 minute oscillation is interpreted as Alfvénic waves propagating upward in the prominence body. The prominence was evolving in its height during our observation, and there is a hint that the 15 minute period gradually gets longer during the observation. These waves are thought to be taking place in layers with different field directions and strength superposed in the LOS.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Strong magnetically dominated Alfvénic turbulence is an efficient engine of nonthermal particle acceleration in a relativistic collisionless plasma. We argue that in the limit of strong magnetization, the type of energy distribution attained by accelerated particles depends on the relative strengths of turbulent fluctuations δB0 and the guide field B0. If δB0 ≪ B0, the particle magnetic moments are conserved, and the acceleration is provided by magnetic curvature drifts. Curvature acceleration energizes particles in the direction parallel to the magnetic field lines, resulting in log-normal tails of particle energy distribution functions. Conversely, if δB0 ≳ B0, interactions of energetic particles with intense turbulent structures can scatter particles, creating a population with large pitch angles. In this case, magnetic mirror effects become important, and turbulent acceleration leads to power-law tails of the energy distribution functions.

This study is motivated by recent observations from the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) mission, which have been identified as ion-acoustic waves from 15 to 25 solar radii. These observations reveal characteristic sequences of narrowband, high-frequency bursts exceeding 100 Hz embedded into a slower evolution around 1 Hz, persisting for several hours. To explore the potential role of the ion-acoustic instability (IAI) in these phenomena, we begin by reviewing classical findings on the IAI within the framework of linear kinetic theory. Focusing on proton distributions comprising both a core and a beam component, we analyze the IAI instability range and growth rates within the parameter regime relevant to PSP observations. Our findings indicate that the IAI can indeed occur in this regime, albeit requiring electron-to-core and beam-to-core temperature ratios slightly different from reported values during electrostatic burst detection. Furthermore, employing one-dimensional kinetic plasma simulations, we validate the growth rates predicted by linear theory and observe the saturation behavior of the instability. The resultant nonlinear structures exhibit trapped proton beam populations and oscillatory signatures comparable to those observed, both in terms of timescales and amplitude.

总结:
太阳日冕突和日冕丝的物质循环过程尚未完全被理解。研究人员一致认为，这些密集结构是由于日冕中的原位凝结和从下方色球中的等离子体虹吸而形成的。通过极高分辨率的三维磁流体力学模拟，研究人员发现热不稳定性可以驱动从低日冕到色球的虹吸流，而无需任何局部加热。研究还表明，冷凝结可以引起磁场线内的虹吸流，从而形成主要的原位质量收集机制。模拟结果与真实观测结果相吻合，包括在极紫外发射通道中的暗日冕腔、细微的垂直结构和再连接流动。 <div>
The mass cycle of solar prominences or filaments is still not completely understood. Researchers agree that these dense structures form by coronal in situ condensations and plasma siphoning from the underlying chromosphere. In the evaporation–condensation model siphoning arises due to evaporation of chromospheric plasma from localized footpoint heating, but this is challenging to justify observationally. Here, we simulate the reconnection–condensation model at extreme resolutions down to 20.8 km within a three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic coronal volume. We form a draining, quiescent prominence and associated coronal rain simultaneously. We show that thermal instability—acting as a trigger for local condensation formation—by itself drives siphoning flows from the low corona without the need of any localized heating. In addition, for the first time, we demonstrate through a statistical analysis along more than 1000 magnetic field lines that cold condensations give rise to siphoning flows within magnetic threads. This siphoning arises from the strong pressure gradient along field lines induced by thermal instability. No correlation is found between siphoning flows and the prominence mass, making thermal instability the main in situ mass-collection mechanism. Our simulated prominence drains by gliding along strongly sheared, asymmetric, dipped magnetic arcades, and develops natural vertical fine structure in an otherwise horizontal magnetic field due to the magnetic Rayleigh–Taylor instability. By synthesising our data, our model shows remarkable agreement with observations of quiescent prominences such as its dark coronal cavity in extreme-ultraviolet emission channels, fine-scale vertical structure, and reconnection outflows, which, for the first time, have been self-consistently obtained as the prominence evolves.

We examine Saturn’s nonauroral (dayglow) emissions at Lyα observed by the Cassini/Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) instrument from 2003 until 2017, to constrain meridional and seasonal trends in the upper atmosphere. We separate viewing geometry effects from trends driven by atmospheric properties, by applying a multivariate regression to the observed emissions. The Lyα dayglow brightnesses depend on the incident solar flux, solar incidence angle, emission angle, and observed latitude. The emissions across latitudes and seasons show a strong dependence with solar incidence angle, typical of resonantly scattered solar flux and consistent with no internal source such as electroglow. We observe a bulge in Lyα brightnesses that shifts with the summer season from the southern to the northern hemisphere. We estimate atomic hydrogen optical depths above the methane homopause level for dayside disk observations (2004–2016) by comparing observed Lyα emissions to a radiative transfer model. We model emissions from resonantly scattered solar flux and a smaller but significant contribution by scattered photons from the interplanetary hydrogen (IPH) background. During the northern summer, inferred hydrogen optical depths steeply decrease with latitude toward the winter hemisphere from a northern hemisphere bulge, as predicted by a 2D seasonal photochemical model. The southern hemisphere mirrors this trend during its summer. However, inferred optical depths show substantially more temporal variation between 2004 and 2016 than predicted by the photochemical model. We benchmark our brightness values by comparing observed IPH Lyα emissions from Cassini/UVIS in 2006 with a model of the IPH emissions. Cassini/UVIS observations agree well with the modeled IPH background.

<br />总结: 本研究确认FR0星系总体上是伽马射线发射体，并发现了两个显著的发射源。研究还发现了5 GHz核心无线电亮度和1-800 GeV带的伽马射线亮度之间存在相关性。使用一区域自同步辐射自康普顿模型，研究通过宽频谱能量分布建模表明这些发现的伽马射线可以解释为反康普顿光子。该建模结果指出了低洛伦兹因子和远离等离子状态、粒子能量密度高于磁场能量密度的射流组成，以解释这些星系的多波段观测。 <div>
FR0 galaxies constitute the most abundant jet population in the local Universe. With their compact jet structure, they are broadband photon emitters and have been proposed as multimessenger sources. Recently, these sources have been detected for the first time in γ rays. Using a revised FR0 catalog, we confirm that the FR0 population as a whole are γ-ray emitters, and we also identify two significant sources. For the first time, we find a correlation between the 5 GHz core radio luminosity and γ-ray luminosity in the 1–800 GeV band, having a 4.8σ statistical significance. This is clear evidence that the jet emission mechanism is similar in nature for FR0s and the well-studied canonical FR (FRI and FRII) radio galaxies. Furthermore, we perform broadband spectral energy distribution modeling for the significantly detected sources as well as the subthreshold source population using a one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model. Within the maximum jet power budget, our modeling shows that the detected γ rays from the jet can be explained as inverse Compton photons. To explain the multiwavelength observations for these galaxies, the modeling results stipulate a low bulk Lorentz factor and a jet composition far from equipartition, with the particle energy density dominating over the magnetic field energy density.

总结:
本文提出了一个由两个关于赤道面对称的磁偶极体环组成的结构，作为太阳磁场可能的模型。通过近似计算得出该结构产生的磁场符合Joy's law和Hale's polarity law。它还解释了太阳活动高峰期太阳黑子分布中出现两个峰（格涅维舍夫间隙）的现象。通过磁滞原理计算极地磁场，预测了太阳活动的行为。分析偶极子章动有助于预测未来太阳活动的强度。尽管这个磁偶极体环结构的涌现和运行是从陀螺磁力和热力的角度进行了简化的考虑，但这并不限制这个结构作为其他更全球范围内的太阳磁理论的潜在模型的应用。 <div>
This paper considers a structure consisting of two rings of magnetic dipoles symmetrical relative to the equatorial plane as a possible model for the source of the solar magnetic field. It shows that the magnetic field generated by this structure corresponds to Joy’s law and Hale’s polarity law. Approximate calculations show that the form and shape of the equatorial field of this structure are close to measured values, and the resulting distribution of sunspots is in agreement with Joy's law to Maunder’s butterfly diagram. Based on this structure, it is possible to explain the appearance of two peaks (Gnevyshev gap) in the distribution of sunspots at the maximum of solar activity. Calculating the polar field based on the principles of magnetic hysteresis shows a good coincidence of the calculated and measured values and makes it possible to predict the behavior of the polar field in the interval to the nearest minimum of solar activity. Analyzing dipole nutation makes it possible to predict the intensity of the upcoming solar activity maxima, while a nutation period of approximately 8 months can be associated with 1.3 yr-period field oscillations. Despite the fact that the emergence and the functioning of the proposed configuration of magnetic dipoles is considered in a simplified manner and only from the point of view of gyromagnetic and thermal forces for speed and clarity, this does not limit the use of the proposed structure as a potential model in other, more global-scale general hydromagnetic theories of solar magnetism.

<br />
通过对S5 0716+716的光学B、V、R和I波段在2019年3月至2023年8月进行的观测研究，发现这个类星体在不同时间尺度上具有变化。使用土耳其T60机器人望远镜对其进行了416个夜晚的长期观测。另外，为了寻找类星体的日内变化，用T100望远镜进行了至少1小时的观测，共21个夜晚。研究发现，该类星体在光学R波段在观测期间呈现约2.47等变化，亮度最高于2020年1月18日（MJD 58866），R = 12.109±0.011等，最暗于2019年3月23日（MJD 58565），R = 14.580±0.013等。应用嵌套ANOVA检验和加权F检验量化了日内变异性，发现其中12个夜晚类星体在R波段显著变化。光变曲线的相关性分析显示，BVRI光学波段的发射在短期和长期内都强相关且没有时间延迟。根据加权小波Z变换和Lomb-Scargle周期图分析，发现该类星体在光学R波段光变曲线上可能有186±30和532±76天的准周期。文章对日内变化和长期变化特征进行了讨论，提出了一些潜在的情景。 <br /><br />总结: <br />研究对S5 0716+716类星体的光学变异性进行了长期观测，并发现了日内和长期的变化特征。BVRI光学波段的发射与时间相关，并且可能存在准周期。 <div>
We present the results of the observational study of the blazar S5 0716+716 in the optical bands B, V, R, and I between 2019 March and 2023 August to investigate its variability on diverse timescales. The blazar was followed up by the T60 robotic telescope in Türkiye for 416 nights to obtain long-term variability during this period. In order to search for the intraday variability of the object, we have carried out 21 nights of observations with the T100 telescope for at least 1 hr. The blazar showed a ∼2.47 mag variation in the optical R band during our monitoring period, the brightest state on 2020 January 18 (MJD 58866) as R = 12.109 ± 0.011 mag and the faintest state on 2019 March 23 (MJD 58565) as R = 14.580 ± 0.013 mag. We employed the nested ANOVA test and the power-enhanced F-test to quantify intraday variability, which showed that the blazar was significantly variable in the R band on 12 out of 21 nights. Correlation analysis of the light curves shows that the emission in the BVRI optical bands was strongly correlated both in the short and long term without any time lag. The blazar has likely quasiperiods of 186 ± 30 and 532 ± 76 days in the optical R-band light curve according to the weighted wavelet Z-transform and Lomb–Scargle periodogram. The intraday variation and long-term variation features are discussed within the frame of prospective scenarios.

总结:
本研究利用斯隆数字化天空勘测的Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA)目录，发现301个具有广Hα发射线的星系和801个具有广Hβ发射线的星系。在总计1042个独特的广发射线星系中，60个同时具有广Hα和广Hβ发射线。研究显示，广发射线区域的半径范围在0.01到46 lt-days之间，其中广Hβ样本的中值半径为0.1 lt-days（0.02 pc）。此外，研究还发现，与MaNGA星系全样本（26%）相比，广Hα样本和广Hβ样本都具有更高的星系合并比例（分别为44%和43%），这表明星系合并推动的燃料补给在我们的样本中非常活跃。<br /><br /> <div>
Broad Hα and Hβ emission lines (FWHM > 1000 km s−1) are incredibly efficient tracers of the high-velocity clouds encircling active galactic nuclei (AGNs). As a result, we search for these broad-line AGN in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey’s Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) catalog. We identify 301 broad-line Hα galaxies and 801 broad-line Hβ galaxies in the catalog. In total, we detect 1042 unique broad-line galaxies with luminosities between 1037 and 1043 erg s−1; 60 feature both broad Hα and broad Hβ emission. We also determine that the broad-line region radius ranges between 0.01 and 46 lt-days, with a median radius of 0.1 lt-days (0.02 pc) for our broad Hβ sample. In addition, we find that both samples feature a higher fraction of galaxy mergers (44% for the broad Hα sample and 43% for the broad Hβ sample), compared to the full MaNGA galaxy sample (26%), which suggests that merger-driven fueling is strongly active in our sample.

<br />
总结:<br />
本研究使用矩阵方法和线性响应理论研究了被略微置于动态平衡之外的孤立恒星系统的松弛过程。研究表明，最终的平衡状态的全相空间分布可以直接从非平衡的初始条件中恢复，无需计算系统的时间演化，从而减少了计算的复杂性。此外，还开发了工具来模拟系统在线性近似下的完整时间演化，尤其是表明可以利用广义矩矩阵高效地计算速度分布的矩。研究应用线性方法对能量截断的Hernquist球体进行了松弛过程的研究，模拟了一个具有等离子体的暗物质次哈洛的潮汐剥离。与受控的孤立N体模拟进行比较显示，在预期会出现线性对扰动相响应的部分，线性预测与实际结果一致。研究结果发现，尽管初始的非平衡状态具有各向同性的运动学特性，但是松弛会在中间区域生成切向速度各向异性。结果还加强了松弛过程会消减密度尖峰幅度，但不会影响其渐近斜率的观点。最后，将线性理论与椭圆轨道潮汐剥离的N体模拟进行比较，验证了该理论仍然准确预测了系统大部分区域的密度和速度分散特性。 <div>
Placed slightly out of dynamical equilibrium, an isolated stellar system quickly returns toward a steady virialized state. We study this process of collisionless relaxation using the matrix method of linear response theory. We show that the full phase-space distribution of the final virialized state can be recovered directly from the disequilibrium initial conditions, without the need to compute the time evolution of the system. This shortcut allows us to determine the final virialized configuration with minimal computational effort. Complementing this result, we develop tools to model the system's full time evolution in the linear approximation. In particular, we show that moments of the velocity distribution can be efficiently computed using a generalized moment matrix. We apply our linear methods to study the relaxation of energy-truncated Hernquist spheres, mimicking the tidal stripping of a cuspy dark matter subhalo. Comparison of our linear predictions against controlled, isolated N-body simulations shows agreement at percent level for the parts of the system where a linear response to the perturbation is expected. We find that relaxation generates a tangential velocity anisotropy in the intermediate regions, despite the initial disequilibrium state having isotropic kinematics. Our results also strengthen the case for relaxation depleting the amplitude of the density cusp, without affecting its asymptotic slope. Finally, we compare the linear theory against an N-body simulation of tidal stripping on a radial orbit, confirming that the theory still accurately predicts density and velocity dispersion profiles for most of the system.

总结: 
文章研究了太阳风湍流中的间歇性相干结构，利用Park Solar Probe的数据，跨越了从MHD到动力学等离子体尺度的范围，首次在物理空间中应用了多尺度分析。研究发现在MHD尺度范围内，存在电流片和阿尔芬涡等结构，而在这些事件中嵌入了更小尺度的结构，通常是离子尺度的阿尔芬涡和亚离子尺度的可压缩涡旋。观察到的结构数量随着尺度的减小而增多，在MHD尺度约为200个事件，在离子尺度约为103个，在亚离子尺度约为104个。通过统计分析，结果显示阿尔芬涡在各个尺度上占据主导地位，这与以往普遍认为电流片占主导地位的观点有所不同，这表明阿尔芬涡是太阳风湍流中重要的构建模块。 <br /><br /> <div>
We study intermittent coherent structures in solar wind turbulence from MHD to kinetic plasma scales using Parker Solar Probe data during its first perihelion (at 0.17 au) in the highly Alfvénic slow solar wind. We detect coherent structures using Morlet wavelets. For the first time, we apply a multiscale analysis in physical space. At MHD scales within the inertial range, times scales τ ∈ (1, 102) s, we find (i) current sheets including switchback boundaries and (ii) Alfvén vortices. Within these events are embedded structures at smaller scales: typically Alfvén vortices at ion scales, τ ∈ (0.08, 1) s, and compressible vortices at sub-ion scales, τ ∈ 8(10−3, 10−2) s. The number of coherent structures grows toward smaller scales: we observe ∼200 events during a 5 hr time interval at MHD scales, ∼103 at ion scales, and ∼104 at sub-ion scales. In general, there are multiple structures of ion and sub-ion scales embedded within one MHD structure. There are also examples of ion and sub-ion scale structures outside MHD structures. To quantify the relative importance of different types of structures, we do a statistical comparison of the observed structures with the expectations of models of the current sheets and vortices. The results show the dominance of Alfvén vortices at all scales in contrast to the widespread view of the dominance of current sheets. This means that Alfvén vortices are important building blocks of Alfvénic solar wind turbulence.

实验在加利福尼亚大学洛杉矶分校的大型等离子体装置中进行，首次实验性地探测到了在类似日冕空洞条件下的Alfvén速度梯度上发生的Alfvén波的反射现象。实验测量了反射系数与波的不均匀参数的依赖关系，即入射波波长与梯度长度尺度的比值。通过使用Gkeyll代码进行的两流体模拟与实验结果在定性上达成一致并予以支持。实验结果支持依赖于在低高度处从光滑Alfvén速度梯度处发生波反射以引发湍流的波加热模型。 <div>
We report the first experimental detection of a reflected Alfvén wave from an Alfvén-speed gradient under conditions similar to those in coronal holes. The experiments were conducted in the Large Plasma Device at the University of California, Los Angeles. We present the experimentally measured dependence of the coefficient of reflection versus the wave inhomogeneity parameter, i.e., the ratio of the wavelength of the incident wave to the length scale of the gradient. Two-fluid simulations using the Gkeyll code qualitatively agree with and support the experimental findings. Our experimental results support models of wave heating that rely on wave reflection at low heights from a smooth Alfvén-speed gradient to drive turbulence.

总结:
本研究对漩涡星系M101中的九个H ii区的恒星和星云特性进行了调查，使用了远紫外（FUV; ∼900–2000 Å）和光学（∼3200–10,000 Å）光谱。我们检测到了7个区域中显著的C iii] λλ1907,1909星云发射，但只在最低金属丰度的区域中发现了O iii] λ1666。我们提出了关于金属丰度的碳离子化校正因子的新解析函数，以进行初步的C/O丰度分析。FUV光谱还包含了大量的恒星发射和P-Cygni特征，我们用单次爆发的Starburst99和BPASS模型的辐射加权组合对其进行拟合。我们发现，最佳拟合的Starburst99模型与观察到的非常高电离P-Cygni特征很好地匹配，需要非常炽热、年轻(≲3百万年)、金属丰度高的大质量恒星。最年轻的恒星群体与宽He ii发射、氮Wolf–Rayet（WR）FUV和光学光谱特征以及增强的N/O气体丰度密切相关。因此，短寿命的WR相可能在几个N P-Cygni风特征（λ955, λ991, λ1720）中驱动多余的发射，导致了对较高金属丰度的恒星连续体拟合与气相金属丰度的偏差。精确表征这些H ii区需要在恒星群体合成模型中进一步包含WR恒星。我们的FUV光谱证明了∼900–1200 Å FUV可以为未来WR大气和进化模型提供强有力的试验基础。<br /><br /> <div>
We investigate the stellar and nebular properties of nine H ii regions in the spiral galaxy M101 with far-ultraviolet (FUV; ∼900–2000 Å) and optical (∼3200–10,000 Å) spectra. We detect significant C iii] λλ1907,1909 nebular emission in seven regions, but O iii] λ1666 only in the lowest-metallicity region. We produce new analytic functions of the carbon ionization correction factors as a function of metallicity in order to perform a preliminary C/O abundance analysis. The FUV spectra also contain numerous stellar emission and P-Cygni features that we fit with luminosity-weighted combinations of single-burst Starburst99 and BPASS models. We find that the best-fit Starburst99 models closely match the observed very-high-ionization P-Cygni features, requiring very hot, young (≲3 Myr), metal-enriched massive stars. The youngest stellar populations are strongly correlated with broad He ii emission, nitrogen Wolf–Rayet (WR) FUV and optical spectral features, and enhanced N/O gas abundances. Thus, the short-lived WR phase may be driving excess emission in several N P-Cygni wind features (λ955, λ991, λ1720) that bias the stellar continuum fits to higher metallicities relative to the gas-phase metallicities. Accurate characterization of these H ii regions requires additional inclusion of WR stars in the stellar population synthesis models. Our FUV spectra demonstrate that the ∼900–1200 Å FUV can provide a strong test bed for future WR atmosphere and evolution models.

<br />总结: 
本研究提供了1996年11月至2023年5月期间在Wind和Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory飞船上观察到的139个DH类型IV爆发的全面目录。其中73％与快速（> 900 km/s）和宽泛（> 60°）的CME相关联，平均CME速度为1301 km/s。所有DH类型IV爆发均与白光CME相关，其中78％与光晕CME相关。CME源纬度在±45°范围内。77个事件有多颗卫星不同位置的观测数据，发现观测角度对动态光谱的影响。观察到的爆发在±60°的视线范围内效果最佳。持续时间超过120分钟的爆发在±60°的经度范围内。这些结果确认了类型IV辐射的固有定向性。此外，该目录形成了一个以太阳为星的DH类型IV爆发数据库。 <div>
Decameter hectometric (DH; 1–14 MHz) type IV radio bursts are produced by flare-accelerated electrons trapped in postflare loops or the moving magnetic structures associated with the coronal mass ejections (CMEs). From a space weather perspective, it is important to systematically compile these bursts, explore their spectrotemporal characteristics, and study the associated CMEs. We present a comprehensive catalog of DH type IV bursts observed by the Radio and Plasma Wave Investigation instruments on board the Wind and Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory spacecraft covering the period of white-light CME observations by the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory mission between 1996 November and 2023 May. The catalog has 139 bursts, of which 73% are associated with a fast (>900 km s−1) and wide (>60°) CME, with a mean CME speed of 1301 km s−1. All DH type IV bursts are white-light CME-associated, with 78% of the events associated with halo CMEs. The CME source latitudes are within ±45°. Seventy-seven events had multiple-vantage-point observations from different spacecraft, letting us explore the impact of the line of sight on the dynamic spectra. For 48 of the 77 events, there were good data from at least two spacecraft. We find that, unless occulted by nearby plasma structures, a type IV burst is best viewed when observed within a ±60° line of sight. Also, bursts with a duration above 120 minutes have source longitudes within ±60°. Our inferences confirm the inherent directivity in the type IV emission. Additionally, the catalog forms a Sun-as-a-star DH type IV burst database.

<div> Parker Solar Probe, WSA coronal model, EUHFORIA, calibration, solar wind observations
总结:
Parker Solar Probe观测在最近的太阳活动极小期间，使用Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA)日冕模型进行校准，该模型是欧洲日球层预报信息资源(EUHFORIA)的一部分。通过PSP观测，校准了WSA模型的四个常数，并将更新后的WSA边界条件同PSP观测进行对比，并在整个日球层中传播这些条件。通过对地球的预测结果来评估模型的性能，发现接近太阳的模型配置与提供更好地球预测的配置不同。原因可能是PSP记录的快速太阳风速度的稀缺性，并且还可能与EUHFORIA的日球层中缺少的物理过程以及WSA关系与日球层MHD域耦合可能需要全面重新制定有关。 <div>
We employ Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observations during the latest solar minimum period (years 2018–2021) to calibrate the version of the Wang–Sheeley–Arge (WSA) coronal model used in the European Heliospheric Forecasting Information Asset (EUHFORIA). WSA provides a set of boundary conditions at 0.1 au necessary to initiate the heliospheric part of EUHFORIA, namely, the domain extending beyond the solar Alfvénic point. To calibrate WSA, we observationally constrain four constants in the WSA semiempirical formula based on PSP observations. We show how the updated (after the calibration) WSA boundary conditions at 0.1 au are compared to PSP observations at similar distances, and we further propagate these conditions in the heliosphere according to EUHFORIA’s magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) approach. We assess the predictions at Earth based on the dynamic time-warping technique. Our findings suggest that, for the period of interest, the WSA configurations that resembled optimally the PSP observations close to the Sun were different from the ones needed to provide better predictions at Earth. One reason for this discrepancy can be attributed to the scarcity of fast solar wind velocities recorded by PSP. The calibration of the model was performed based on unexpectedly slow velocities that did not allow us to achieve generally and globally improved solar wind predictions compared to older studies. Other reasons can be attributed to missing physical processes from the heliospheric part of EUHFORIA but also the fact that the currently employed WSA relationship, as coupled to the heliospheric MHD domain, may need a global reformulation beyond that of just updating the four constant factors that were taken into account in this study.

<br />
研究发现，伽马射线暴余辉中的电子加速不符合纯幂律分布，还有额外的低能“热”部分占据了相当大的能量比例。通过对热电子对伽马射线暴余辉的影响进行研究，可以深入了解粒子加速机制。研究解决了电子能量空间中的连续方程，推导了多波段余辉，并包含了包括辐射、自吸收、自康普顿散射和伽马-伽马湮灭等过程。首先，由于电子冷却，时间和能谱指数之间存在正相关性。此外，热电子导致多波段上同时出现能谱和时间指数的非单调变化，这些可以被2.5米广域调查望远镜和维拉·鲁宾天文台空间和时间遗产调查单独记录。热电子也可以通过光学（与维拉·鲁宾天文台）和X射线（与微通道X射线望远镜）波段的余辉光谱进行诊断。最后，我们使用蒙特卡洛模拟得到了软和硬X射线峰值通量比（RX）的分布，以及软X射线和光学光曲线峰值时间之间的时间延迟（Δt）的分布。热电子显著提高了RX和Δt的上限。因此，具有热电子的伽马射线暴余辉的分布在RX-Δt平面上更加分散。<br /><br />总结: 电子加速不符合幂律分布，热电子对余辉造成影响，同时影响能谱和时间指数，LSST和微通道X射线望远镜可以用于记录这些变化，热电子导致RX和Δt的上限提高。 <div>
Particle-in-cell simulations have unveiled that shock-accelerated electrons do not follow a pure power-law distribution, but have an additional low-energy “thermal” part, which owns a considerable portion of the total energy of the electrons. Investigating the effects of these thermal electrons on gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows may provide valuable insights into the particle acceleration mechanisms. We solve the continuity equation of electrons in energy space, from which multiwavelength afterglows are derived by incorporating processes including synchrotron radiation, synchrotron self-absorption, synchrotron self-Compton scattering, and γ–γ annihilation. First, there is an underlying positive correlation between the temporal and spectral indices due to the cooling of electrons. Moreover, thermal electrons result in simultaneous nonmonotonic variations of both the spectral and temporal indices at multiple wavelengths, which could be individually recorded by the 2.5 m Wide Field Survey Telescope and Vera Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). The thermal electrons could also be diagnosed using afterglow spectra from synergistic observations in the optical (with LSST) and X-ray (with the Microchannel X-ray Telescope on board the Space Variable Objects Monitor) bands. Finally, we use Monte Carlo simulations to obtain the distribution of the peak flux ratio (RX) between the soft and hard X-rays, and of the time delay (Δt) between the peak times of the soft X-ray and optical light curves. The thermal electrons significantly raise the upper limits of both RX and Δt. Thus, the distribution of GRB afterglows with thermal electrons is more scattered in the RX−Δt plane.

总结:
受到后质量传递系统中吸积星自转速度测量的启发，我们研究了磁致制动对双星演化过程中各个恒星自转速度减缓的影响。我们首先计算了潮汐力是否足够强大来同步轨道，从而影响了恒星的自转减速和轨道分离。我们应用了四种磁致制动方案来减小整个双星演化模拟中两颗恒星的自转角动量。我们的研究发现，尽管磁致制动导致吸积星持续自转减速，但当捐赠者开始向吸积星传递物质时，吸积星可以快速旋转至临界自转速率。质量传递后，磁致制动对恒星角动量的演化变得更加重要。因此，后质量传递吸积星可以作为观察磁致制动方案如何将恒星从临界自转速率减速的宝贵试验平台。吸积星的自转速度结合其质量，可以提供自质量传递停止后的年龄信息。通过将模型与观测数据进行比较，发现Garraffo等人的磁致制动方案更符合后质量传递吸积星的自转数据。 <div>
Motivated by measurements of the rotation speed of accretor stars in post-mass-transfer (post-MT) systems, we investigate how magnetic braking affects the spin-down of individual stars during binary evolution with the MESAbinary module. Unlike the conventional assumption of tidal synchronization coupled with magnetic braking in binaries, we first calculate whether tides are strong enough to synchronize the orbit. Subsequently, this influences the spin-down of stars and the orbital separation. In this study, we apply four magnetic braking prescriptions to reduce the spin angular momentum of the two stars throughout the entire binary evolution simulation. Our findings reveal that despite magnetic braking causing continuous spin-down of the accretor, when the donor begins to transfer material onto the accretor, the accretor can rapidly spin up to its critical rotation rate. After MT, magnetic braking becomes more important in affecting the angular momentum evolution of the stars. Post-MT accretor stars thus serve as a valuable test bed for observing how the magnetic braking prescriptions operate in spinning down stars from their critical rotation, including the saturation regimes of the magnetic braking. The rotation rate of the accretor star, combined with its mass, could provide age information since the cessation of MT. By comparing the models against observations, the magnetic braking prescription by Garraffo et al. is found to better align with the rotation data of post-MT accretors.

<div> 磁瓶结构，带电粒子，太阳耀斑，多波段观测，宏观磁流体和粒子建模

总结:<br /><br />本研究通过多波段观测和数据驱动的宏观磁流体和粒子建模，揭示了在真实的耀斑几何结构中存在磁瓶结构。观测结果显示，磁瓶结构不仅具有磁场强度的局部最小值，还引起了等离子体的急剧减速。这一结构与上方环顶区域紧凑的硬X射线源和横跨耀斑拱的扩展微波源位置吻合。空间分辨谱分析表明，非热电子高度聚集在这一区域。模型还返回了与观测相匹配的合成发射特征。研究结果表明，由于湍流的作用，高能电子受困在磁瓶区域内，只有很小一部分得以逃逸。这些电子主要通过等离子体压缩加速，并通过费米机制在快模终止激波加速。我们的结果为磁瓶结构成为耀斑中主要的电子加速场提供了坚实的依据。同时，它还为理解早前报道的进入星际空间的小型耀斑加速电子群体提供了新的见解。 <div>
Where and how flares efficiently accelerate charged particles remains an unresolved question. Recent studies revealed that a “magnetic bottle” structure, which forms near the bottom of a large-scale reconnection current sheet above the flare arcade, is an excellent candidate for confining and accelerating charged particles. However, further understanding its role requires linking the various observational signatures to the underlying coupled plasma and particle processes. Here we present the first study combining multiwavelength observations with data-informed macroscopic magnetohydrodynamics and particle modeling in a realistic eruptive flare geometry. The presence of an above-the-loop-top magnetic bottle structure is strongly supported by the observations, which feature not only a local minimum of magnetic field strength but also abruptly slowing plasma downflows. It also coincides with a compact above-the-loop-top hard X-ray source and an extended microwave source that bestrides the flare arcade. Spatially resolved spectral analysis suggests that nonthermal electrons are highly concentrated in this region. Our model returns synthetic emission signatures that are well matched to the observations. The results suggest that the energetic electrons are strongly trapped in the magnetic bottle region due to turbulence, with only a small fraction managing to escape. The electrons are primarily accelerated by plasma compression and facilitated by a fast-mode termination shock via the Fermi mechanism. Our results provide concrete support for the magnetic bottle as the primary electron acceleration site in eruptive solar flares. They also offer new insights into understanding the previously reported small population of flare-accelerated electrons entering interplanetary space.

推断方法的复杂性及计算成本是对后验近似的可靠性和统计可靠性的挑战。本文介绍了一种新颖的方法，使用KilonovaNet生成的模拟数据进行基于模拟的推断。我们的方法利用了ANPE的准即时推断时间，通过覆盖诊断和后验预测检查工具来验证后验近似的可靠性。我们还通过AT 2017gfo的真实观测数据进行了测试，证明了与之前基于似然方法的结果一致，同时将推断时间缩短到几秒钟。ANPE产生的推断结果似乎是保守和可靠的，为可测试和更高效的合并天体参数推断铺平了道路。 <br /><br />总结: 推断方法挑战，新方法使用模拟数据进行推断，验证了可靠性，测试结果一致且高效。 <div>
Kilonovae represent a category of astrophysical transients, identifiable as the electromagnetic (EM) counterparts associated with the coalescence events of binary systems comprising neutron stars and neutron star–black hole pairs. They act as probes for heavy-element nucleosynthesis in astrophysical environments. These studies rely on an inference of the physical parameters (e.g., ejecta mass, velocity, composition) that describe kilonovae-based on EM observations. This is a complex inverse problem typically addressed with sampling-based methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo or nested sampling algorithms. However, repeated inferences can be computationally expensive, due to the sequential nature of these methods. This poses a significant challenge to ensuring the reliability and statistical validity of the posterior approximations and, thus, the inferred kilonova parameters themselves. We present a novel approach: simulation-based inference using simulations produced by KilonovaNet. Our method employs an ensemble of amortized neural posterior estimation (ANPE) with an embedding network to directly predict posterior distributions from simulated spectral energy distributions. We take advantage of the quasi-instantaneous inference time of ANPE to demonstrate the reliability of our posterior approximations using diagnostics tools, including coverage diagnostic and posterior predictive checks. We further test our model with real observations from AT 2017gfo, the only kilonova with multimessenger data, demonstrating agreement with previous likelihood-based methods while reducing inference time down to a few seconds. The inference results produced by ANPE appear to be conservative and reliable, paving the way for testable and more efficient kilonova parameter inference.

<br /><br />总结:
本研究通过20个类似于银河系的宿主暗物质的冷暗物质缩放模拟，筛选出符合银河系暗物质质量、浓度、近期和早期进入的分支星系大麦哲伦云和Gaia–Sausage–Enceladus的宿主系统。这些宿主系统比未包含大麦哲伦云和Gaia–Sausage–Enceladus分支星系的系统有着更多的次星系，尤其是在内部区域。同时，研究发现Gaia–Sausage–Enceladus分支星系对目前的银河系次星系数量贡献不大。这些结果有助于我们更好地理解银河系的暗物质结构和次星系数量，并对目前仅能在银河系中测量的一系列数据进行解释。 <div>
We present Milky Way-est, a suite of 20 cosmological cold-dark-matter-only zoom-in simulations of Milky Way (MW)-like host halos. Milky Way-est hosts are selected such that they (i) are consistent with the MW’s measured halo mass and concentration, (ii) accrete a Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC)-like (≈1011M⊙) subhalo within the last 2 Gyr on a realistic orbit, placing them near 50 kpc from the host center at z ≈ 0, and (iii) undergo a >1:5 sub-to-host halo mass ratio merger with a Gaia–Sausage–Enceladus (GSE)-like system at early times (0.67 < z < 3). Hosts satisfying these LMC and GSE constraints constitute <1% of all halos in the MW’s mass range, and their total masses grow rapidly at late times due to LMC analog accretion. Compared to hosts of a similar final halo mass that are not selected to include LMC and GSE analogs, Milky Way-est hosts contain 22% more subhalos with present-day virial masses above 108M⊙ throughout the virial radius, on average. This enhancement reaches ≈80% in the inner 100 kpc and is largely, if not entirely, due to LMC-associated subhalos. These systems also induce spatial anisotropy in Milky Way-est subhalo populations, with ≈60% of the total subhalo population within 100 kpc found in the current direction of the LMC. Meanwhile, we find that GSE-associated subhalos do not significantly contribute to present-day Milky Way-est subhalo populations. These results provide context for our Galaxy’s dark matter structure and subhalo population and will help interpret a range of measurements that are currently only possible in the MW.

We calculated cross sections for the dielectronic recombination (DR) satellite lines of Fe xvii and benchmarked our predictions with experimental cross sections of Fe xvii resonances that were monoenergetically excited in an electron-beam ion trap. We extend the benchmark to all resolved DR and direct electron-impact excitation (DE) channels in the experimental data set, specifically the n ≥ 4 DR resonances of Fe xvii, complementing earlier investigations of n = 3 channels. Our predictions for the DR and DE absolute cross sections for the higher n complexes disagree considerably with experimental results when using the same methods as in previous works. However, we achieve agreement within ∼10% of the experimental results by an approach whereby we doubly convolve the predicted cross sections with both the spread of the electron-beam energy and the photon energy resolution of our experiment. We then calculated rate coefficients from the experimental and theoretical cross sections, finding general agreement within 2σ with the rates found in the OPEN-ADAS atomic database.

Recent analyses of millimeter-wavelength protoplanetary disk observations have revealed several emission excesses on the previously identified dust rings, referred to as dust shoulders. The prevalence of dust shoulders suggests that they trace a common but unclear mechanism. In this work, we combine 3D, multifluid hydrodynamic simulations with radiative transfer calculations to explain the formation of dust shoulders. We find that the ring-shoulder pairs can result from the 3D planet–disk interactions with massive, gap-opening planets. The key driver is the dust filtration effect at the local pressure maximum due to planet-driven outward gas flows. Our work provides a possible explanation for the outer dust shoulders in recent super-resolution analyses of Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations. It also provides insights into the formation of the inner dust shoulder in the PDS 70 disk and highlights the role of 3D effects in planet–disk interaction studies.

总结:
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)的深度调查揭示了在4≲z≲13范围内出现了由早期大质量黑洞的吸积过程驱动的中等亮度、宽线活跃星系核(AGNs)的新群体。这些AGNs显示出很高的光子泄漏率和大量的氢、氦LyC辐射产生效率，这使得重新评估AGNs是否是宇宙氢/氦再电离过程中的唯一驱动因素。研究假设了一些前提条件，并且提出了模型来解释氢再电离的进程，得到了一些与宇宙微波背景各向异性数据一致的结果。研究结果表明，在JWST探测到的丰富AGN群体不会违反对未解析的X射线背景的限制。 <div>
Deep surveys with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed an emergent population of moderate-luminosity, broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at 4 ≲ z ≲ 13 powered by accretion onto early massive black holes. The high number densities reported, together with the large Lyman-continuum (LyC) production efficiency and leakiness into the intergalactic medium that are typical of UV-selected AGNs, lead us to reassess a scenario where AGNs are the sole drivers of the cosmic hydrogen/helium reionization process. Our approach is based on the assumptions, grounded in recent observations, that (a) the fraction of broad-line AGNs among galaxies is around 10%–15%; (b) the mean escape fraction of hydrogen LyC radiation is high, at ≳80%, in AGN hosts and is negligible otherwise; and (c) internal absorption at 4 ryd or a steep ionizing EUV spectrum delay full reionization of He ii until z ≃ 2.8–3.0, in agreement with observations of the He ii Lyα forest. In our fiducial models, (1) hydrogen reionization is 99% completed by redshift z ≃ 5.3–5.5 and reaches its midpoint at z ≃ 6.5–6.7; (2) the integrated Thomson scattering optical depth to reionization is ≃0.05, consistent with constraints from cosmic microwave background anisotropy data; and (3) the abundant AGN population detected by JWST does not violate constraints on the unresolved X-ray background.

We examine the dynamics and stability of circumbinary particles orbiting around the Earth–Moon binary system. The moon formed close to the Earth (semimajor axis aEM ≈ 3 R⊕) and expanded through tides to its current day semimajor axis (aEM = 60 R⊕). Circumbinary orbits that are polar or highly inclined to the Earth–Moon orbit are subject to two competing effects: (i) nodal precession about the Earth–Moon eccentricity vector and (ii) Kozai–Lidov oscillations of eccentricity and inclination driven by the Sun. While we find that there are no stable polar orbits around the Earth–Moon orbit with the current day semimajor axis, polar orbits were stable immediately after the formation of the Moon, at the time when there was a lot of debris around the system, up to when the semimajor axis reached about aEM ≈ 10 R⊕. We discuss implications of polar orbits on the evolution of the Earth–Moon system and the possibility of polar orbiting moons around exoplanet–moon binaries.

We investigated the stellar mass function and the binary fraction of 114 nearby open clusters (OCs) using the high-precision photometric data from Gaia Data Release 3 (Gaia DR3). We estimated the mass of member stars by using a ridge line that is better in line with the observed color–magnitude diagram, thus obtaining more accurate stellar mass and binary mass ratio (q) at the low-mass region. By analyzing the present-day mass function (PDMF) of star clusters, we found that 108 OCs follow a two-stage power-law distribution, whereas six OCs present a single power-law PDMF. Subsequently, we fitted the high(low)-mass index of PDMF ( ), denoted as αh(αl), and segmentation point mc. For our cluster sample, the median values of αh and αl are 2.65 and 0.95, respectively, which are approximately consistent with the initial mass function results provided by Kroupa. We utilized the cumulative radial number distribution of stars with different masses to quantify the degree of mass segregation. We found a significant positive correlation between the state of dynamical evolution and mass segregation in OCs. We also estimated the fraction of binary stars with q ≥ 0.5, ranging from 6% to 34% with a median of 17%. Finally, we provided a catalog of 114 nearby cluster properties, including the total mass, the binary fraction, the PDMF, and the dynamical state.

本研究利用VLA Imaging和THINGS选取了五个类似于银河系的星系作为样本，通过3D-BAROLO模型分析其旋转曲线，将旋转曲线分解为星体和气体的贡献并隔离暗物质成分。通过Markov Chain Monte Carlo方法推导出在这些星系中的太阳邻域的暗物质密度范围，结果与文献中银河系本地暗物质密度的数值一致。 <div>
Our current understanding of how dark matter (DM) is distributed within the Milky Way (MW) halo, particularly in the solar neighborhood, is based on either careful studies of the local stellar orbits, model assumptions on the global shape of the MW halo, or from direct acceleration measurements. In this work, we undertake a study of external galaxies, with the intent of providing insight into the DM distribution in MW-analog galaxies. For this, we carefully select a sample of galaxies similar to the MW, based on maximum atomic hydrogen (H i) rotational velocity ( km s−1) and morphological type (Sab–Sbc) criteria. With a need for deep, highly resolved H i, our resulting sample is composed of five galaxies from the VLA Imaging of Virgo in Atomic Gas (VIVA) survey and The H i Nearby Galaxy Survey (THINGS). To perform our baryonic analysis, we use deep mid-IR images at 3.6 and 4.5 μm from the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structures in Galaxies (S4G). Based on the dynamical three-dimensional modeling software 3D-Based Analysis of Rotating Objects via Line Observations (3D-BAROLO), we construct rotation curves (RCs) and derive the gas and stellar contributions from the galaxy's gaseous and stellar disks' mass surface density profiles. Through a careful decomposition of their RCs into their baryonic (stars, gas) and DM components, we isolate the DM contribution by using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo-based approach. Based on the Sun's location and the MW’s R25, we define the corresponding location of the solar neighborhood in these systems. We put forward a window for the DM density (ρdm = 0.21–0.55 GeV cm−3) at these galactocentric distances in our MW analog sample, consistent with the values found for the MW’s local DM density, based on more traditional approaches found in the literature.

We assemble a sample of 733 dwarf galaxies (M* ≤ 109.5M⊙) with signatures of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and explore the intersection between different AGN-selection techniques. Objects in our database are compiled from previous studies that identify AGN in dwarf galaxies through spectroscopy, X-ray emission, infrared colors, and optical photometric variability. We apply a uniform set of AGN diagnostic tools to the database using archival data. We find that any single selection method captures no more than half of the overall AGN population, and there is a general disagreement among the AGN-selection methods in this stellar-mass regime. The largest overlap between methods is found when both methods use optical spectroscopic data. In contrast, the populations of AGN intersect the least when comparing those methods that use photometric data at different wavelengths. These results can be used to better constrain the active fraction in dwarf galaxies, which is in turn an important constraint for black hole seed formation models. In a follow-up paper, we will explore links between the effectiveness of each selection technique and host galaxy properties.

The recent discovery of a galaxy at z = 7.3 with undetected optical emission lines and a blue UV-to-optical continuum ratio in JWST spectroscopy is surprising and needs to be explained physically. Here, we explore two possibilities that could cause such a seemingly quiescent ∼5 × 108M⊙ galaxy in the early Universe: (i) stochastic variations in the star formation history (SFH) and (ii) the effect of spatially varying dust attenuation on the measured line and continuum emission properties. Both scenarios can play out at the same time to amplify the effect. A stochastic star formation model (similar to realistic SFHs from hydrodynamical simulations of similar-mass galaxies) can create such observed properties if star formation is fast-varying with a correlation time of <150 Myr given a reasonable burst amplitude of ∼0.6 dex. The total time spent in this state is less than 20 Myr, and the likelihood of such a state to occur over 500 Myr at z = 7 is ∼50% (consistent with current observations). On the other hand, we show that a spectrum with blue UV continuum and lack of emission lines can be reproduced by a blue+red composite spectrum. The UV continuum is emitted from dust-free density-bounded H ii regions (blue component), while the red component is a dust-obscured starburst with weakened emission lines due to strong differential dust attenuation between stellar and nebular emission. Future resolving far-infrared observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array will shed light on the latter scenario.

本研究通过磁流体动力学模拟发现，高速氢气碰撞可以形成具有大质量和足够致密度的气体团块，这些团块经受离子化反馈后仍能保持足够的逃逸速度，促进内部高效星团形成，并最终演化为年轻巨大星团。此外，研究还发现低速气体碰撞并不会导致分子云的形成，而需要较长的时间尺度来形成年轻巨大星团，这表明了宇宙间相互作用驱动的气体碰撞可能更有利于年轻巨大星团的形成。 <div>
Young massive clusters (YMCs) are dense aggregates of young stars and are often speculated as potential precursors to globular clusters. However, the formation mechanism of massive and compact gas clumps that precede YMCs remains unknown. In this paper, we study the formation of such massive clumps via fast H i gas collisions (∼100 km s−1) as suggested by recent observations and their subsequent evolution into YMCs by using three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics simulations involving self-gravity and detailed thermal/chemical processes. In particular, the impact of ionization feedback from stellar radiation is included in an approximate fashion where the temperature within the H ii regions is elevated to 10,000 K, while supernova feedback is not included. We examine whether the resulting massive clumps can survive this ionization feedback and evolve into YMCs. Our simulations reveal the emergence of gas clumps that not only possess substantial mass (∼105M⊙) but also sufficient compactness (∼5 pc). Notably, these clumps exhibit significantly higher escape velocities compared to the sound speed of the H ii region, indicating effective gravitational retention of gas against feedback-induced evaporation. Consequently, these conditions foster efficient star formation within the massive gas clumps, ultimately leading to their evolution into YMCs. We also perform simulations involving lower-velocity gas collisions, approximately 15 km s−1, typical shock velocities induced by galactic superbubbles. In contrast to the high-velocity collisions, we find that molecular cloud formation does not occur in the case of 1 cm−3 gas collision, while YMC formation is observed in the presence of denser gas of 10 cm−3. However, the formation of YMCs requires compression periods exceeding 10 Myr in these cases, indicating a potential preference for gas collisions driven by intergalactic interactions rather than galactic superbubbles for YMC formation.

<div> Magnetohydrodynamic Turbulence, Stokes Parameters, Synchrotron Polarization Analysis, Plasma Modes, Statistical Properties
<br /><br />总结:
本文提出了一种通过系统性分析Stokes参数的统计特性来识别等离子体模式的方法。研究在理论上从MHD湍流的基本统计出发，通过对MHD模式的投影来识别在合成的同步辐射偏振观测中占主导能量分数的模式。通过3D理想MHD模拟获得合成同步辐射偏振观测，提出了一种修改后的模式识别方法，并建立了一种基于新的SPA+拟合过程的分类标准来区分Alfvén模式和可压缩/慢模式主导的湍流。还提出了一种通过分析SPA+特征的不对称性来识别快模式的方法，并建立了一种新的不对称参数来检测快模式湍流的存在。另外，通过数值测试证实了对可压缩和快模式的识别不受前景和发射等离子体中法拉第旋转的影响。 <div>
One of the biggest challenges in understanding magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence is identifying the plasma mode components from observational data. Previous studies on synchrotron polarization from the interstellar medium (ISM) suggest that the dominant MHD modes can be identified via statistics of Stokes parameters, which would be crucial for studying various ISM processes such as the scattering and acceleration of cosmic rays, star formation, and dynamo. In this paper, we present a numerical study of the synchrotron polarization analysis (SPA) method through systematic investigation of the statistical properties of the Stokes parameters. We derive the theoretical basis for our method from the fundamental statistics of MHD turbulence, recognizing that the projection of the MHD modes allows us to identify the modes dominating the energy fraction from synchrotron observations. Based on the discovery, we revise the SPA method using synthetic synchrotron polarization observations obtained from 3D ideal MHD simulations with a wide range of plasma parameters and driving mechanisms, and present a modified recipe for mode identification. We propose a classification criterion based on a new SPA+ fitting procedure, which allows us to distinguish between Alfvén mode and compressible/slow mode dominated turbulence. We further propose a new method to identify fast modes by analyzing the asymmetry of the SPA+ signature and establish a new asymmetry parameter to detect the presence of fast mode turbulence. Additionally, we confirm through numerical tests that the identification of the compressible and fast modes is not affected by Faraday rotation in both the emitting plasma and the foreground.

<div> Sgr A*, multiwavelength campaign, flaring events, periodicity feature, synchrotron hotspot, adiabatically expanding

总结:
Sgr A*在2019年7月的多波段观测中表现出多个耀斑事件，包括在Spitzer光度曲线中检测到的瞬态35分钟周期性特征，以及Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array光度曲线中检测到的时滞辐射。这暗示了一个在稳定轨道上的热点。同时，还观察到了X射线耀斑导致亚毫米光度曲线的通量减少，以及通过模拟表明这个特征是由绕着一个半径为0.55RS的等离子体产生的，这个等离子体通过130高斯的磁场扩张速度为光速的0.6%。最后，在红外、亚毫米和射电波段观察到了一个明显的耀斑，证实了这种变化与这些波段的辐射是内在相关的。在射电和亚毫米光度曲线拟合中发现，这是由具有电子谱p=0.59、187高斯磁场和半径0.47RS的等离子体齐次膨胀的系切辐射热点产生，扩张速度为0.029c。这些结果表明，辐射的变化演化在亚毫米和红外波长中涉及了辐射和绝热冷却过程。 <div>
We report on the final two days of a multiwavelength campaign of Sgr A* observing in the radio, submillimeter, infrared (IR), and X-ray bands in 2019 July. Sgr A* was remarkably active, showing multiple flaring events across the electromagnetic spectrum. We detect a transient ∼35 minute periodicity feature in Spitzer light curves on 2019 July 21. Time-delayed emission was detected in Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array light curves, suggesting a hotspot within the accretion flow on a stable orbit. On the same night, we observe a decreased flux in the submillimeter light curve following an X-ray flare detected by Chandra, and we model the feature with an adiabatically expanding synchrotron hotspot occulting the accretion flow. The event is produced by a plasma 0.55 RS in radius with an electron spectrum p = 2.84. It is threaded by a ∼130 Gauss magnetic field and expands at 0.6% the speed of light. Finally, we reveal an unambiguous flare in the IR, submillimeter, and radio, demonstrating that the variable emission is intrinsically linked. We jointly fit the radio and submillimeter light curves using an adiabatically expanding synchrotron hotspot and find it is produced by a plasma with an electron spectrum p = 0.59, 187 Gauss magnetic field, and radius 0.47 RS that expands at 0.029c. In both cases, the uncertainty in the appropriate lower and upper electron energy bounds may inflate the derived equipartition field strengths by a factor of 2 or more. Our results confirm that both synchrotron- and adiabatic-cooling processes are involved in the variable emission’s evolution at submillimeter and IR wavelengths.

The Cassini spacecraft detected a soup of organics in the plume of Saturn’s moon Enceladus. Those compounds could provide building blocks for the potential emergence or sustenance of microbial life in Enceladus’ subsurface ocean. However, the sources and stabilities of organics in Enceladus’ ocean are still poorly understood. Here, we perform nonequilibrium thermodynamic calculations to assess the energetics of abiotic synthesis for a broad spectrum of small organic molecules under both cold oceanic and hydrothermal conditions on Enceladus. Most of the organics that we studied are thermodynamically favorable to synthesize at micromolal dissolved concentrations over wide ranges of pH (8.5–11) and redox conditions. This suggests that many of the organic compounds detected by Cassini may be derived from reactions of CO2 and H2. However, some widely assumed precursors of biomolecules, such as formaldehyde, hydrogen cyanide, and acetylene, are found to be unstable and therefore unfavorable to be synthesized. We found that higher temperatures also seem to favor the synthesis of organic species under Enceladus hydrothermal conditions. Detection of thermodynamically unstable species in the plume might reflect artifacts introduced during high-speed spacecraft flybys and/or active synthesis via degradation of primordial chondritic organics, or biological activities.

<br />模型扩展了使用卷积神经网络（CNN）建模闪耀星的光谱能量分布（SED）的方法，包括外部逆康普顿过程。该模型假设发射区域内的相对论电子可以与来自吸积盘、宽线区域和星系环的外部光子发生相互作用，并产生观测到的高能辐射。我们在一个数值模型上对CNN进行训练，该模型考虑了电子注入、它们自洽的冷却以及对偶产生-湮灭过程，并考虑了所有内部和外部光子场。尽管参数数量比自洽自康普顿模型多，并且光谱形状更加多样，但CNN能够准确计算指定参数集的SED。通过拟合两个平谱射电类星体3C 454.3和CTA 102的SED并获得其参数后验分布，证明了CNN的性能。对于第一个源，低能带中可用的数据使我们能够约束电子的最小洛伦兹因子，而对于第二个源，由于缺乏这些数据，可以被设定。我们使用获得的参数来研究系统的能量学特性。这里开发的模型与Bégué等人开发的模型一起，在轻子场景中实现了自洽的、深入的闪耀星宽带辐射建模。<br /><br />总结: SED建模方法扩展了CNN，包括外部逆康普顿过程。模型对闪耀星的光谱能量分布进行了准确计算，并通过拟合平谱射电类星体的SED来展示其性能。模型的参数后验分布和系统能量学特性得到了研究。这一研究使得在轻子场景下对闪耀星宽带辐射进行了自洽的建模。 <div>
In the context of modeling spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for blazars, we extend the method that uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to include external inverse Compton processes. The model assumes that relativistic electrons within the emitting region can interact with and up-scatter external photons originating from the accretion disk, the broad-line region, and the torus, to produce the observed high-energy emission. We trained the CNN on a numerical model that accounts for the injection of electrons, their self-consistent cooling, and pair creation-annihilation processes, considering both internal and all external photon fields. Despite the larger number of parameters compared to the synchrotron self-Compton model and the greater diversity in spectral shapes, the CNN enables an accurate computation of the SED for a specified set of parameters. The performance of the CNN is demonstrated by fitting the SED of two flat-spectrum radio quasars, namely 3C 454.3 and CTA 102, and obtaining their parameter posterior distributions. For the first source, the available data in the low-energy band allowed us to constrain the minimum Lorentz factor of the electrons, , while for the second source, due to the lack of these data, was set. We used the obtained parameters to investigate the energetics of the system. The model developed here, along with one from Bégué et al., enables self-consistent, in-depth modeling of blazar broadband emissions within a leptonic scenario.

The spin of dark halos has been shown to significantly affect bar formation and evolution in disk galaxies. To understand the physical role of halo spin in bar formation, we run N-body simulations of isolated, Milky Way–sized galaxies by varying the halo spin parameter in the range −0.16 ≤ λ ≤ 0.16 and the bulge mass. We find that our adopted halo alone is subject to swing amplification of an m = 2 nonaxisymmetric mode rotating in the same sense as the halo, which assists or inhibits the bar formation in a disk depending on its sense of rotation. The m = 2 mode in the disk, growing via swing amplification, interacts constructively (destructively) with the m = 2 mode in the prograde (retrograde) halo, promoting (delaying) bar formation. A bar grows by losing its angular momentum primarily to a halo. Since the halo particles inside (outside) the corotation resonance with the bar can emit (absorb) angular momentum to (from) the bar, the bar pattern speed decays more slowly for larger λ > 0, while it decreases relatively fast almost independent of λ ≤ 0. Models with a strong bar develop a boxy peanut-shaped bulge. In models without a bulge, this occurs rapidly via buckling instability, while bars with a bulge thicken gradually without undergoing buckling instability. Among the models considered in the present work, the bar in the λ = 0.06 model with a bulge of 10% of the disk mass best describes the Milky Way in terms of its length and pattern speed.

<div> 冷水排放，原行星盘模型，Herschel Space Observatory 数据，氧气丰度，光解吸附作用
总结：<br /><br />研究重新审视了Herschel Space Observatory数据提供的限制条件，关于原行星盘中的冷水排放。以往的盘模型根据观测到的水排放得出结论，如果假设盘采用标准的星际气尘质量比，氧气就至少减少了两个数量级。在这项研究中，我们使用了最近的盘参数调查中的模型结果，并展示了对冷水的Herschel约束大多可以通过采用类似于星际介质的氧元素丰度（即O/H = 3.2×10^-4）和规范的气尘质量比100的盘模型来解释。我们发现，冷水蒸气主要是通过在分子层和中面之间的界面处水冰的光解吸附形成的，其排放与盘的主要性质如盘气体质量和气尘质量比相对独立。我们发现外盘区域中水蒸气的丰度是由光过程决定的，并且取决于需要减弱远紫外线光子通量的水冰的（恒定）垂直柱密度，结果导致了我们调查中变化的参数（气体质量，尘埃质量，盘半径）产生了大致恒定的排放。重要的是，水线排放发现是光学浓密的，因此对温度的敏感性高于丰度，可能推动了先前对大规模氧减少的推断。 <div>
We reexamine the constraints provided by Herschel Space Observatory data regarding cold water emission from protoplanetary disks. Previous disk models that were used to interpret observed water emission concluded that oxygen (O/H) is depleted by at least 2 orders of magnitude if a standard, interstellar gas/dust mass ratio is assumed in the disk. In this work, we use model results from a recent disk parameter survey and show that most of the Herschel constraints obtained for cold water (i.e., for transitions with an upper energy level Eup < 200 K, where the bulk of the disk water lies) can be explained with disk models adopting interstellar medium-like oxygen elemental abundance (i.e., O/H = 3.2 × 10−4) and the canonical gas/dust mass ratio of 100. We show that cold water vapor is mainly formed by photodesorption of water ice at the interface between the molecular layer and the midplane, and that its emission is relatively independent of the main disk properties like the disk gas mass and gas/dust mass ratio. We find that the abundance of water vapor in the outer disk is set by photoprocesses and depends on the (constant) vertical column density of water ice needed to attenuate the far-ultraviolet photon flux, resulting in roughly constant emission for the parameters (gas mass, dust mass, disk radius) varied in our survey. Importantly, water line emission is found to be optically thick and hence sensitive to temperature more than abundance, possibly driving previous inferences of large-scale oxygen depletion.

Globular clusters contain vast repositories of metal-poor stars that represent some of the oldest stellar generations in the Universe. The archaeological footprint of early Galactic evolution may be retained in the measurable properties of globular clusters, such as their ages, mass functions, and chemical abundances. Until recently, all photometric studies of globular clusters were restricted to stellar members. Now, the sensitivity of JWST can extend this analysis to the substellar regime. If detected in sufficient numbers, brown dwarf members can provide tight constraints on the properties of their parent population. We present SANDee—a new grid of stellar models that accurately represent the color–magnitude diagrams of globular clusters across the hydrogen-burning limit at a wide range of metallicities. Using JWST NIRCam photometry and the new models, we identify three brown dwarfs in the globular cluster NGC 6397 with Teff = 1300–1800 K, confirmed by both proper motion and model fitting. We use the observed luminosities of discovered brown dwarfs to obtain the first age estimate of a globular cluster from its substellar cooling sequence: 13.4 ± 3.3 Gyr. We also derive the local mass function of the cluster across the hydrogen-burning limit and find it to be top heavy, suggesting extensive dynamical evolution. We expect that the constraints on both age and mass function of NGC 6397 derived in this work can be greatly improved by a second epoch of NIRCam imaging in the same field.

The detection of GW170817/AT2017gfo inaugurated an era of multimessenger astrophysics, in which gravitational-wave and multiwavelength photon observations complement one another to provide unique insight into astrophysical systems. A broad theoretical consensus exists, in which the photon phenomenology of neutron star mergers largely rests upon the evolution of the small amount of matter left on bound orbits around the black hole or massive neutron star remaining after the merger. Because this accretion disk is far from inflow equilibrium, its subsequent evolution depends very strongly on its initial state, yet very little is known about how this state is determined. Using both snapshot and tracer particle data from a numerical relativity/MHD simulation of an equal-mass neutron star merger that collapses to a black hole, we show how gravitational forces arising in a nonaxisymmetric, dynamical spacetime supplement hydrodynamical effects in shaping the initial structure of the bound debris disk. The work done by hydrodynamical forces is ∼10 times greater than that due to time-dependent gravity. Although gravitational torques prior to remnant relaxation are an order of magnitude larger than hydrodynamical torques, their intrinsic sign symmetry leads to strong cancellation; as a result, hydrodynamical and gravitational torques have a comparable effect. We also show that the debris disk’s initial specific angular momentum distribution is sharply peaked at roughly the specific angular momentum of the merged neutron star’s outer layers, a few rgc, and identify the regulating mechanism.

We present a method to obtain rapid mass-loss rates in binary systems, specifically at the onset of mass transfer (MT) episodes. The method unifies atmospheric (underflow) and L1 stream (overflow) mass rates in a single continuous procedure. The method uses averaged 3D properties of the binaries, such as effective binary potential and effective binary acceleration, to both evolve the donor and obtain properties of the matter at the L1 plane. In the case of underflow, we obtain atmospheric stratification. Our method can be used for binaries with an extensive range of mass ratios, 0.01 ≤ q ≤ 100, and can also be applied to hot donors. The considered examples show that the MT rates obtained with this revised formalism always differ from the optically thin and optically thick MT rates widely used during the computations of binary evolution.

这篇文章研究了在大量的潮汐撕裂事件中发现的晚期（几百到一千天后）射电闪耀。研究人员提出，如果在邦迪半径外部密度分布呈平坦趋势，则这些晚期射电闪耀是一种自然结果。在邦迪半径处，流出是对准自吸收而光学薄的（在几GHz以上）。随着更多物质的被带走，射电辐射上升呈asymptotically ∝ t3，直到流出开始减速。检测到这种上升并且晚期达到最大值，则可以限制黑洞质量、射电流出质量和能量。研究人员表明，这种模型可以合理拟合一些观测到的光变曲线，从而得出黑洞和流出质量的合理估计。他们还发现邦迪半径内的密度剖面斜率决定了是否存在早期（约102天）的射电峰值。 <br /><br />总结:  这项研究发现在大量的潮汐撕裂事件中，晚期射电闪耀现象并不罕见，提出了与周围密度分布及黑洞质量相关的模型，以合理估计射电流出的质量和能量。 <div>
Radio monitoring unveiled late (hundreds to a thousand days) radio flares in a significant fraction of tidal disruption events. We propose that these late-time radio flares are a natural outcome if the surrounding density profile flattens outside the Bondi radius. At the Bondi radius, the outflow is optically thin (above a few GHz) to synchrotron self-absorption. As more and more material is swept up, the radio emission rises asymptotically as ∝ t3 until the outflow begins to decelerate. A detection of such a rise and a late-time maximum constrains the black hole mass and the mass and energy of the radio-emitting outflow. We show that this model can give reasonable fits to some observed light curves, leading to reasonable estimates of the black hole and outflow masses. We also find that the slope of the density profile within the Bondi radius determines whether an early-time (∼102 days) radio peak exists.

<br /><br />这项研究利用Keck Cosmic Web Imager来观测来自MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF)调查的27个星系在红移z∼2时的扩展Lyα发射。研究者对星系的SFR和ΣSFR等性质进行了分析，发现Lyα轮廓在Lyα晕中的三个区域呈现出空间变化。他们发现在中心7千秒差距半径区域内单峰、红移的轮廓是普遍存在的。在晕的更远处（7-14和14-21千秒差距），共振散射发射的Lyα轮廓表现出更多的多样性，要么过渡到双峰轮廓，要么在整个晕中保持单峰。此外，他们发现带有更快风的复合体晕Lyα光晕表面亮度轮廓的尺度长度较短。这项研究表明，需要采用更现实的、多孔的ISM模型来解释Lyα光晕轮廓的形状和标准化。 
<br /><br />总结: 该研究利用Keck Cosmic Web Imager观测了27个星系在z∼2时的Lyα发射，发现Lyα轮廓在Lyα晕中呈现出空间变化。另外，他们发现带有更快风的星系Lyα光晕表面亮度轮廓的尺度长度较短，表明需要更现实的ISM模型来解释Lyα轮廓。 <div>
We present Keck Cosmic Web Imager integral field observations of extended Lyα emission in the circumgalactic medium of 27 typical star-forming galaxies at z ∼ 2, drawn from the Multi-Object Spectrometer for Infra-Red Exploration (MOSFIRE) Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) survey. Using composite spectra in two bins of star formation rate (SFR), star formation rate surface density (ΣSFR), and other galactic properties, we measure spatial variations in the Lyα profile across three regions in the Lyα halo. We find single-peaked, redshifted profiles are ubiquitous within a central 7 kpc radius region. Further out in the halo (7–14 and 14–21 kpc), the Lyα profile of the resonantly scattered emission exhibits more diversity, either transitioning to a double-peaked profile or remaining single peaked across the halo. We find a shorter scale length of the Lyα halo surface brightness profile for composite halos with faster winds. The composites have a similar average inclination, suggesting those with faster winds clear channels in the interstellar medium (ISM), reducing the fraction of Lyα photons resonantly scattered to large radii. A uniform expanding shell radiative transfer model reproduces the shape but not the normalization of the observed double-peaked Lyα profiles. Models that adopt a more realistic, clumpy ISM are likely needed to reproduce both the shape and normalization of the Lyα profiles.

<title>Photometry of Saturated Stars with Neural Networks</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We use a multilevel perceptron (MLP) neural network to obtain photometry of saturated stars in the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN). The MLP can obtain fairly unbiased photometry for stars from g ≃ 4 to 14 mag, particularly compared to the dispersion (15%–85% 1σ range around the median) of 0.12 mag for saturated (g < 11.5 mag) stars. More importantly, the light curve of a nonvariable saturated star has a median dispersion of only 0.037 mag. The MLP light curves are, in many cases, spectacularly better than those provided by the standard ASAS-SN pipelines. While the network was trained on g-band data from only one of ASAS-SN’s 20 cameras, initial experiments suggest that it can be used for any camera and the older ASAS-SN V-band data as well. The dominant problems seem to be associated with correctable issues in the ASAS-SN data reduction pipeline for saturated stars more than the MLP itself. The method is publicly available as a light-curve option on ASAS-SN Sky Patrol v1.0.

<title>A Surprising Excess of Radio Emission in Extremely Stable Quasars: A Unique Clue to Jet Launching?</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad5a0c</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Quasars are generally divided into jetted radio-loud and nonjetted radio-quiet ones, but why only 10% of quasars are radio-loud has been puzzling for decades. Other than jet-induced phenomena, black hole mass, or Eddington ratio, a prominent difference between jetted and nonjetted quasars has scarcely been detected. Here we show a unique distinction between them, and the mystery of jet launching could be disclosed by a prominent excess of radio emission in extremely stable quasars (ESQs; i.e., type 1 quasars with extremely weak variability in UV/optical over 10 yr). Specifically, we find that >25% of the ESQs are detected by the FIRST/VLASS radio survey, while only ∼6%–8% of the control sample, matched in redshift, luminosity, and Eddington ratio, are radio-detected. The excess of radio detection in ESQs has a significance of 4.4σ (99.9995%) and predominantly occurs at intermediate radio loudness with R ∼ 10–60. The radio detection fraction of ESQs also tends to increase in the ESQ samples selected with more stringent thresholds. Our results are in contrast to the common view that radio-loud quasars are likely more variable in UV/optical due to jet contribution. New clues/challenges posed by our findings highlight the importance of extensive follow-up observations to probe the nature of jets in ESQs and theoretical studies on the link between jet launching and ESQs. Moreover, our results make ESQs, an essential population that has never been explored, unique targets in the burgeoning era of time domain astronomy, like their opposite counterparts of quasars exhibiting extreme variability or changing-look features.

<title>The Relation between Variances of 3D Density and Its 2D Column Density Revisited</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad5a84</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We revisit the relation between the variance of three-dimensional (3D) density ( ) and that of the projected two-dimensional (2D) column density ( ) in turbulent media, which is of great importance in obtaining turbulence properties from observations. Earlier studies showed that , where Σ/Σ0 and ρ/ρ0 are 2D column and 3D volume densities normalized by their mean values, respectively. The factor depends only on the density spectrum for isotropic turbulence in a cloud that has similar dimensions along and perpendicular to the line of sight. Our major findings in this paper are as follows. First, we show that the factor can be expressed in terms of N, the number of independent eddies along the line of sight. To be specific, is proportional to ∼1/N due to the averaging effect arising from independent eddies along the line of sight. Second, we show that the factor needs to be modified if the dimension of the cloud in the line-of-sight direction is different from that in the perpendicular direction. However, if we express in terms of N, the expression remains same even in the case the cloud has different dimensions along and perpendicular to the line of sight. Third, when we plot against , two quantities roughly lie on a single curve regardless of the sonic Mach number, which implies that we can directly obtain the latter from the former. We discuss observational implications of our findings.

<title>Modeling Transition Region Hot Loops on the Sun: The Necessity of Rapid, Complex Spatiotemporal Heating and Nonequilibrium Ionization</title>

The study examines the heating profile of hot solar transition region loops, particularly focusing on transient brightenings observed in IRIS 1400 Å slit-jaw images. The findings challenge the adequacy of simplistic, singular heating mechanisms, revealing that the heating is temporally impulsive and requires a spatially complex profile with multiple heating scales. A forward-modeling code is utilized to generate synthetic Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) emission spectra of these loops based on HYDRAD model output, confirming that emitting ions are out of equilibrium. The modeling further indicates that density-dependent dielectronic recombination rates must be included to reproduce the observed line ratios. Collectively, this evidence substantiates that the loops are subject to impulsive heating and that the components of the transiently brightened plasma are driven far from thermal equilibrium. Heating events such as these are ubiquitous in the transition region, and the analysis described above provides a robust observational diagnostic tool for characterizing the plasma.

<title>An Alternative Channel to Black Hole Low-mass X-Ray Binaries: Dynamical Friction of Dark Matter?</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad5be0</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad5be0</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Both the anomalous magnetic braking of Ap/Bp stars and the surrounding circumbinary disk models can account for the formation of black hole (BH) low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), while the simulated effective temperatures of the donor stars are significantly higher than the observed values. Therefore, the formation of BH LMXBs is still not completely understood. In this work, we diagnose whether the dynamical friction between dark matter and the companion stars can drive BH binaries to evolve toward the observed BH LMXBs and alleviate the effective temperature problem. Assuming that there exists a density spike of dark matter around BH, the dynamical friction can produce an efficient angular momentum loss, driving BH binaries with an intermediate-mass companion star to evolve into BH LMXBs for a spike index higher than γ = 1.58. Our detailed stellar evolution models show that the calculated effective temperatures can match the observed value of most BH LMXBs for a spike index range of γ = 1.7–2.1. However, the simulated mass-transfer rates when γ = 2.0 and 2.1 are too high to be consistent with the observed properties showing that BH LMXBs appear as soft X-ray transients. Therefore, the dynamical friction of dark matter can only alleviate the effective temperature problem of those BH LMXBs with a relatively short orbital period.

<title>GRB 221009A/SN 2022xiw: A Supernova Obscured by a Gamma-Ray Burst Afterglow?</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad5ce1</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad5ce1</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present optical photometry for the afterglow of GRB 221009A, in some respects the most extraordinary gamma-ray burst (GRB) ever observed. Good quality in the R-band light curve is obtained, covering 0.32–19.57 days since the Fermi-Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor trigger. We find that a weak bump emerges from the declining afterglow at t ≈ 11 days; a supernova (SN) may be responsible. We use a smooth broken power-law and 56Ni model to fit the light curve. The best-fitting results reveal that the SN ejected a total mass of Mej = 3.70 M⊙, a 56Ni mass of MNi = 0.23 M⊙, and a kinetic energy of . We also compare GRB 221009A with other GRB–SN events based on a GRB-associated SN sample and find that only SN 2003lw and SN 2011kl can be obviously revealed in the afterglow of GRB 221009A by setting these objects at its distance. This suggests that a supernova (SN 2022xiw) is possibly obscured by the brighter afterglow emission from GRB 221009A.

<title>Spectra of GRB 221009A at Low Energies Derived from Ground-based Very Low-frequency Measurements</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The gamma-ray burst (GRB) event GRB 221009A was the brightest event that has ever been detected to date. Owing to its unexpected brightness, the temporal and/or spectral information of the prompt emission cannot be accurately measured by many satellites (with the only exception of GECAM-C), since they suffered from significant pulse pileup and data saturation effects. Similarly, the X45 solar flare event occurring on 2003 November 4 saturated space-borne X-ray detectors, and it was through ground-based measurements of very low-frequency (VLF) signals that the magnitude of this event was determined, since VLF signals are particularly sensitive to the disturbance on the D-region ionosphere caused by low-energy photons. Therefore, in this study, we first report measurements of VLF signals from the JJI and VTX transmitter as recorded in Shiyan, China, when GRB 221009A occurred. The amplitude change was ∼1.25 and ∼2.31 dB for the JJI and VTX transmitter, respectively. Using a suite of well-validated models, we have further simulated the influence on the D-region ionosphere induced by low-energy photons (<100 keV) of GRB 221009A. Compared with the pre-GRB condition, the electron density was enhanced by 39.75% and 626.61% at 60 and 70 km altitude for the VTX-SYS path and 39.73% and 621.11% at 60 and 70 km altitude for the JJI-SYS path, respectively, with the altitude of notable electron density change being as low as ∼30 km. Moreover, we have compared modeling results of VLF signal change with our measurements during GRB 221009A. The good agreements obtained in terms of amplitude change and overall trend validate the fluxes and spectra of GRB 221009A at low energies (<20 keV) as measured by GECAM-C.

<title>On the Magnetic Braking Law in Black Hole Low-mass X-Ray Binaries</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Magnetic braking (MB) plays an important role in the evolution of close low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). It is also essential to the formation of ultracompact X-ray binaries (UCXBs). There have been lively investigations on the MB mechanism(s) in both single stars and close binaries including cataclysmic variables and neutron star (NS) LMXBs but with diverse conclusions. In this paper we explore the effect of MB on the black hole (BH) LMXB evolution. We combine binary population synthesis with detailed binary evolution to obtain the expected properties of the Galactic BH LMXB population. The simulated results are compared with the observational data including the BH mass, companion mass, companion temperature, orbital period, and mean accretion rate. Our results reveal that the MB laws with relatively low efficiency (i.e., RM12 and RVJ83) exhibit better agreement with observations, contrary to what was found for NS LMXBs. This raises the interesting question about whether MB really follows the same unified law in different types of binaries. We also predict that only a very small fraction (≲2.5%) of BH LMXBs can evolve to be UCXBs. This explains why no BH UCXB has been discovered so far.

<title>Direct Evidence of the Hybrid Nature of Extreme-ultraviolet Waves and the Reflection of the Fast-mode Wave</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We performed an analysis of the extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) wave event on 2022 March 31. The event originated from active region (AR) 12975 located at N13W52 in the field of view of the Atmospheric imaging Assembly (AIA) and exactly at the west limb viewed by the EUV Imager (EUVI) of the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory-Ahead (STEREO-A) satellite. The EUV wave was associated with an M9.6 class flare. The event was also well observed by Mauna Loa Solar Observatory and COR1 coronagraphs. We revealed here evident coexistence of two components of EUV waves in AIA as well as in EUVI images, i.e., a fast-mode wave and a nonwave, which was predicted by the EUV wave hybrid model. The speeds of the fast-mode and nonwave EUV wave components in AIA vary from ∼430 to 658 km s−1 and ∼157 to 205 km s−1, respectively. The computed speeds in STEREO-A for the fast-mode wave and nonwave components are ∼520 and ∼152 km s−1, respectively. Another wave emanated from the source AR and interacted with ambient coronal loops, showing evident reflection in the EUV images above the solar limb. The speed of the reflected wave in the plane of the sky is ∼175 km s−1. With the precise alignments, we found that the fast-mode EUV wave is just ahead of the coronal mass ejection (CME), and the nonwave component is cospatial with the frontal loop of the accompanied CME. The event also showed stationary fronts.

总结: 
本研究利用高分辨率的Jansky Very Large Array (VLA)观测和存档的射电调查，研究了28个椭球形后并合星系的射电特性。在样本中检测到18个射电源，发现了射电发射的普遍缺乏(sub)kiloparsec尺度的延伸辐射，表明这些后并合星系中存在大量紧凑的核心射电发射，其中大多数(16/18; 89%)呈现为低亮度。通过多波段数据，确定了射电发射的来源，发现了15个新的射电AGNs和三个射电源可能与星形(SF)过程相关。几乎所有的射电AGNs都是低亮度的(13/15; 87%)，与相对论喷流起源不符。研究了一个新的双重AGN(DAGN)候选者J1511+0417，并调查了DAGN候选者J0843+3549的射电特性。其中五个射电AGNs寄主于SF或SF-AGN复合发射线星系，表明射电AGN活动可能存在于后并合星系中的SF活动期间。这些射电AGNs的低功率喷流和紧凑形态也指向了一个情景，即AGN反馈可能在这些后并合星系中是高效的。最后，我们提出对这15个射电AGNs进行模拟多频率观测，利用Very Long Baseline Array和Next-Generation VLA的非常长基线干涉能力，以评估这些仪器在寻找超大质量黑洞双星方面的可行性。 <div>
Post-merger galaxies are unique laboratories to study the triggering and interplay of star formation and active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity. Combining new, high-resolution Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observations with archival radio surveys, we have examined the radio properties of 28 spheroidal post-merger galaxies. We detect 18 radio sources in our post-merger sample and find a general lack of extended emission at (sub)kiloparsec scales, indicating the prevalence of compact, nuclear radio emission in these post-merger galaxies, with the majority (16/18; 89%) characterized as low luminosity. Using multiwavelength data, we determine the origin of the radio emission, discovering 15 new radio AGNs and three radio sources likely associated with star-forming (SF) processes. Among the radio AGNs, almost all are low luminosity (13/15; 87%), inconsistent with a relativistic jet origin. We discover a new dual AGN (DAGN) candidate, J1511+0417, and investigate the radio properties of the DAGN candidate J0843+3549. Five of these radio AGNs are hosted by a SF or SF-AGN composite emission-line galaxy, suggesting that radio AGN activity may be present during periods of SF activity in post-mergers. The low-power jets and compact morphologies of these radio AGNs also point to a scenario in which AGN feedback may be efficient in this sample of post-mergers. Lastly, we present simulated, multifrequency observations of the 15 radio AGNs with the Very Long Baseline Array and the very-long-baseline interferometry capabilities of the Next-Generation VLA to assess the feasibility of these instruments in searches for supermassive black hole binaries.

在这篇文章中，研究人员使用JWST NIRSpec对MACS J1149.5+2223的视线进行了深入观测，并报告了在3 < z < 9.1范围内28个源的光谱红移，其中包括检测到9个源的辐射线。他们观察到恒星质量与金属丰度之间存在正相关关系，但存在着大约0.5 dex的偏离。此外，他们还发现金属丰度存在大约0.3 dex的散布，这一散布随着红移增加而增加。他们认为这可能是由于金属丰度的富集过程具有更高的随机性导致的，可能是由于较浅的潜在井、更强烈的反馈过程和更高的星系并合率。研究人员还就JWST的Micro-Shutter Assembly观测的局限性进行了调查，并提醒在目标超出狭缝尺寸时需要谨慎，因为这种情况可能导致对全局金属丰度的过高估计，尤其是在存在强烈负金属丰度梯度的情况下。 <br /><br />总结: 本研究报道了JWST NIRSpec对MACS J1149.5+2223进行的深入观测，发现在3 < z < 9.1范围内28个源的光谱红移，并探讨了恒星质量与金属丰度之间的相关性以及金属丰度的散布情况，还对JWST观测的局限性进行了调查。 <div>
We present deep JWST NIRSpec observations in the sight line of MACS J1149.5+2223, a massive cluster of galaxies at z = 0.54. We report the spectroscopic redshift of 28 sources at 3 < z < 9.1, including nine sources with the detection of the auroral line. Combining these with 16 -detected sources from publicly available JWST data, our sample consists of 25 galaxies with robust gas-phase metallicity measurements via the direct method. We observe a positive correlation between stellar mass and metallicity, with an ∼0.5 dex offset down below the local relation. Interestingly, we find a larger-than-expected scatter of ∼0.3 dex around the relation, which cannot be explained by redshift evolution among our sample or other third parameters. The scatter increases at higher redshift, and we tentatively attribute this to the enrichment process having higher stochasticity, due to shallower potential wells, more intense feedback processes, and a higher galaxy merger rate. Despite reaching a considerably low-mass regime ( ), our samples have metallicity of +12 ≳ 7, i.e., comparable to the most metal-poor galaxies in the local Universe. The search for primordial galaxies may be accomplished by extending toward a lower mass and/or by investigating inhomogeneities at smaller spatial scales. Lastly, we investigate potential systematics caused by the limitation of JWST’s Micro-Shutter Assembly observations. Caution is warranted when the target exceeds the slit size, as this situation could allow an overestimation of global metallicity, especially under the presence of a strong negative metallicity gradient.

这项研究通过在谐波域中加权平均联合利用CLASS 40 GHz和WMAP Q波段数据获得了灵敏度改进的40 GHz极化图。通过从WMAP Q波段获取精确的大尺度测量和CLASS 40 GHz波段在中间尺度上的高灵敏度信息，将在地图空间中的噪声水平在ℓ ∈ [30, 100]范围内降低了2-3倍。利用WMAP K波段和合并地图的像素域分析极化同步辐射谱指数(βs)，显示出比使用WMAP K和Ka波段进行的结果更强的空间变化偏好(对于均匀βs假设的超过概率小于0.001)。合并地图的交叉功率谱与其他低频数据表现出相同的趋势，并通过模拟验证表明合并方法引入的偏差可忽略不计(在功率谱中的百分比级别)。这项工作的成果已经在LAMBDA上公开提供(https://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/class/class_prod_table.html)。<br /><br />总结: 通过合并CLASS 40 GHz和WMAP Q波段数据，得到了灵敏度改进的40 GHz极化图，大大降低了在中等尺度上的噪声水平。同时，利用像素域分析展示了更强的空间变化偏好，合并地图的交叉功率谱与其他低频数据表现出相同的趋势，并且通过模拟验证了合并方法的可靠性。 <div>
Improved polarization measurements at frequencies below 70 GHz with degree-level angular resolution are crucial for advancing our understanding of the Galactic synchrotron radiation and the potential polarized anomalous microwave emission and ultimately benefiting the detection of primordial B modes. In this study, we present sensitivity-improved 40 GHz polarization maps obtained by combining the CLASS 40 GHz and Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Q-band data through a weighted average in the harmonic domain. The decision to include WMAP Q-band data stems from similarities in the bandpasses. Leveraging the accurate large-scale measurements from the WMAP Q band and the high-sensitivity information from the CLASS 40 GHz band at intermediate scales, the noise level at ℓ ∈ [30, 100] is reduced by a factor of 2–3 in the map space. A pixel domain analysis of the polarized synchrotron spectral index (βs) using the WMAP K band and the combined maps (mean and 16th/84th percentiles across the βs map: ) reveals a stronger preference for spatial variation (probability to exceed for a uniform βs hypothesis smaller than 0.001) than the results obtained using WMAP K and Ka bands ( ). The cross-power spectra of the combined maps follow the same trend as other low-frequency data, and validation through simulations indicates negligible bias introduced by the combination method (subpercent level in the power spectra). The products of this work are publicly available on LAMBDA (https://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/class/class_prod_table.html).

这篇文章主要是关于对于星系聚集中心的亮度最高星系（BCGs）的星系形成、发射线星云和活跃星系核（AGN）与星系聚集介质（ICM）的热力学关系的重新评估。作者在CLASH计划中对25个星系聚集进行了观测，并且研究了它们的BCGs的属性以及ICM的热力学特性。他们发现，BCGs的星系形成和星云的存在与ICM的“过剩核熵”K0有关，而不是与熵值地板有关。并且发现ICM熵越低，BCGs越有可能显示星系形成、星云和更具辐射亮的AGNs。几乎所有的BCGs都有检测到的AGNs，这表明它们的供能路径有多种。 <div>
We set the stage for reassessing how star formation, emission-line nebulae, and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) depend on the thermodynamics of the intracluster medium (ICM). Our work is based on the 25 clusters observed in the CLASH program for which the aforementioned attributes in their BCGs can be well scrutinized, as has the thermodynamics of their ICM. Nine of these BCGs display complex UV morphologies tracing recent star formation, whereas the remaining 16 are characterized by a relatively compact central UV enhancement. Here, we show definitively that three of the latter BCGs also display star formation, whereas the diffuse UV of the remaining 13 is entirely consistent with old low-mass stars. The overall results support the previously established dependence of star formation and nebulae in BCGs on an “excess core entropy,” K0, for the ICM: all 11 clusters with K0 ≤ 24 keV cm2 (but only one of 14 clusters with K0 ≥ 42 keV cm2) host star-forming BCGs that almost if not always possess nebulae. Instead of an entropy floor, we show that K0 reflects the degree to which the radial entropy profile decreases inward within ∼100 kpc rather than (except perhaps at large K0) actually flattening: clusters with lower ICM entropies and hence shorter cooling times at their cores preferentially host BCGs displaying star formation, nebulae, and more radio-luminous AGNs. Nearly all BCGs possess detectable AGNs, however, indicating multiple pathways for fuelling their AGNs.

A plethora of coronal models, from empirical to more complex magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) ones, are being used for reconstructing the coronal magnetic field topology and estimating the open magnetic flux. However, no individual solution fully agrees with coronal hole observations and in situ measurements of open flux at 1 au, as there is a strong deficit between the model and observations contributing to the known problem of the missing open flux. In this paper, we investigate the possible origin of the discrepancy between modeled and observed magnetic field topology by assessing the effect on the simulation output by the choice of the input boundary conditions and the simulation setup, including the choice of numerical schemes and the parameter initialization. In the frame of this work, we considered four potential field source surface-based models and one fully MHD model, different types of global magnetic field maps, and model initiation parameters. After assessing the model outputs using a variety of metrics, we conclude that they are highly comparable regardless of the differences set at initiation. When comparing all models to coronal hole boundaries extracted by extreme-ultraviolet filtergrams, we find that they do not compare well. This mismatch between observed and modeled regions of the open field is a candidate contributing to the open flux problem.

We analyze the structure and dynamics of the plasma atmospheres and Coulomb-liquid oceans on neutron stars. Salient dynamical parameters are identified and their values estimated for the governing set of magnetohydrodynamics equations. Neutron star atmospheres and oceans are strongly stratified and, depending on the rotation period, contain a multitude of long-lived vortices (spots) and/or narrow zonal jets (free-shear zones) in the large plasma-beta regime—i.e., βp ≫ 1 (hydrodynamic regime). In contrast, when βp ≲ 1 (magnetohydrodynamic regime), the flow is dominated by a global lattice of effectively fixed magnetic islands (plasmoids) without any jets. Understanding the spatiotemporal variability of dynamic atmospheres and oceans on neutron stars is crucial for interpreting observations of their X-ray emissions.

We present a comprehensive analysis of the post-outburst evolution of the FU Ori object HBC 722 in optical/near-infrared (NIR) photometry and spectroscopy. Using a modified viscous accretion disk model, we fit the outburst epoch spectral energy distribution to determine the physical parameters of the disk, including yr−1, Rinner = 3.65 R⊙, i = 79°, and a maximum disk temperature of K. We then use a decade of optical/NIR spectra to demonstrate a changing accretion rate drives the visible-range photometric variation, while the NIR shows the outer radius of the active accretion disk expands outward as the outburst progresses. We also identify the major components of the disk system: a plane-parallel disk atmosphere in Keplerian rotation and a two-part warm disk wind that is collimated near the star and wide-angle at larger radii. The wind is traced by classic wind lines, and appears as a narrow, low-velocity, deep absorption component in several atomic lines spanning the visible spectrum and in the CO 2.29 μm band. We compare the wind lines to those computed from wind models for other FU Ori systems and rapidly accreting young stellar disks and find a 4000–6000 K wind can explain the observed line profiles. Fitting the progenitor spectrum, we find M* = 0.2 M⊙ and . Finally, we discuss HBC 722 relative to V960 Mon, another FU Ori object we have previously studied in detail.

热尘埋藏星系（Hot DOGs）是一种罕见的高红移超大红外星系，它们中活跃星系核（AGN）被尘埃显著遮挡，但通常观察到明显的宽广蓝移发射线。此前的研究表明，有八个热尘埋藏星系，被称为蓝色过量热尘埋藏星系（BHDs），在其紫外-光学光谱能量分布中呈现出一种与1型类星体发射一致的蓝色过量，其来源是被遮挡的中心发动机的光被散射到视线中。我们通过UV-中红外光谱能量分布建模和光谱细节的分析来对172个热尘埋藏星系进行分析，特别关注BHDs的识别。我们发现，虽然热尘埋藏星系中观察到的光学发射在大多数情况下是由年轻恒星族群主导的，但有26%的热尘埋藏星系显示出足够显著的蓝色过量发射，可以被分类为BHDs。基于其宽C iv和Mg ii线，我们发现BHDs中黑洞质量MBH的范围从10^8.7到10^10M⊙不等。当使用相同的发射线在普通热尘埋藏星系中，我们发现MBH的估计涵盖了BHDs所发现的整个范围，同时也延伸到相对较低的值。这一一致可能表明，普通热尘埋藏星系中的宽线也源自中心发动机的散射光，就像BHDs一样，尽管需要进行更详细的研究以排除是由流出驱动的特性。与z∼6类星体相似，我们发现热尘埋藏星系位于恒星与黑洞质量之间关系的上方，这表明AGN反馈尚未显著抑制宿主星系的恒星质量增长，或者在达到z=0时它们将成为关系的离群值。 <br /><br />总结: 热尘埋藏星系（Hot DOGs）是一类罕见的高红移超大红外星系，其中的蓝色过量热尘埋藏星系（BHDs）显示出与1型类星体相似的蓝色过量发射，这源自被遮挡的中心发动机的光被散射出来。在172个研究对象中，26%被分类为BHDs。这些星系中的光学发射主要由年轻恒星族群主导。黑洞质量的估计范围在BHDs和普通热尘埋藏星系中是一致的，这表明宽线可能也源自中心发动机的散射光。热尘埋藏星系位于恒星与黑洞质量之间关系的上方，表明AGN反馈可能尚未显著抑制宿主星系的恒星质量增长。 <div>
Hot dust-obscured galaxies (Hot DOGs) are a rare population of hyperluminous infrared galaxies discovered by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer mission. Despite the significant obscuration of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) by dust in these systems, pronounced broad and blueshifted emission lines are often observed. Previous work has shown that eight Hot DOGs, referred to as blue-excess Hot DOGs (BHDs), present a blue excess consistent with type 1 quasar emission in their UV–optical spectral energy distributions (SEDs), which has been shown to originate from the light of the obscured central engine scattered into the line of sight. We present an analysis of the rest-frame optical emission characteristics for 172 Hot DOGs through UV–mid-IR SED modeling and spectroscopic details, with a particular focus on the identification of BHDs. We find that while the optical emission observed in Hot DOGs is in most cases dominated by a young stellar population, 26% of Hot DOGs show a significant enough blue excess emission to be classified as BHDs. Based on their broad C iv and Mg ii lines, we find that the mass of the black hole MBH in a BHD ranges from 108.7 to 1010M⊙. When using the same emission lines in regular Hot DOGs, we find the MBH estimates cover the entire range found for BHDs while also extending to somewhat lower values. This agreement may imply that the broad lines in regular Hot DOGs also originate from scattered light from the central engine, just as in BHDs, although a more detailed study would be needed to rule out an outflow-driven nature. Similar to z ∼ 6 quasars, we find that Hot DOGs sit above the local relation between stellar and black hole masses, suggesting either that AGN feedback has not yet significantly suppressed the stellar mass growth in the host galaxies or that they will be outliers of the relation when reaching z = 0.

总结:<br /><br />本研究通过模拟升级后的巨型米波射电望远镜（uGMRT）数据，系统地研究了不同信噪比条件下各种频谱指数估算方法的可靠性。研究发现，在低于S/N ≲ 100的情况下，MT-MFS成像算法得到的在频内的频谱指数误差≳0.2，不可靠；而子频带分裂方法在类似S/N条件下得到的误差≲0.2，更准确且无偏。宽带频谱指数在S/N ≳ 15时得到的误差≲0.2，因此在没有频谱指数的高阶变化时最为可靠。这些结果可用于改进uGMRT观测和数据分析策略，取决于目标源的亮度。 <div>
Low-radio-frequency spectral index measurements are a powerful tool for distinguishing between different emission mechanisms and, in turn, understanding the nature of the sources. Besides the standard method of estimating the “broadband” spectral index of sources from observations in two different frequency “bands,” if the observations were made with large instantaneous bandwidth, the “in-band” spectral index can be determined, either using images of emission at multiple frequency ranges within a band or using the novel Multi Term-Multi Frequency Synthesis (MT-MFS) imaging algorithm. Here, using simulated upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) data, we have systematically studied the reliability of various methods of spectral index estimation for sources with a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios (S/Ns). It is found that for synthetic uGMRT point-source data, the MT-MFS imaging algorithm produces in-band spectral indices for S/N ≲ 100 that have errors ≳0.2, making them unreliable. However, at a similar S/N, the sub-band splitting method produces errors ≲0.2, which are more accurate and unbiased than the in-band spectral indices. The broadband spectral indices produce errors ≲0.2 even for S/N ≳ 15, and hence they are most reliable if there are no higher-order variations in the spectral index. These results may be used to improve the uGMRT observation and data analysis strategies, depending on the brightness of the target source.

<div> 关键词: 超大质量黑洞二进制，辐射+流体动力学模拟，活跃星系核反馈，环绕双星盘，辐射反馈效应

总结:<br />
本研究使用RAMSES代码进行了次差量级分辨率的辐射+流体动力学自适应网格细化模拟，研究了嵌入气态核双星盘中超大质量黑洞（SMBH）二进制的动力学，探讨了活跃星系核反馈对SMBH二进制的迁移行为和盘结构的影响。模拟中采用了注入与气体相互作用的光子的辐射反馈效应，并通过采用一组BH发射谱的网格来建模这一效应。研究发现，对于形成间隙的双星系统，辐射反馈不会改变轨道演化，但电离辐射会蒸发位于低密度区域外缘的气体。对于未形成间隙的系统，引入反馈会导致环绕双星盘的强烈初期扰动，随后介质逐渐稳定，并可能重新进入快速二进制迁移状态。这些发现是因为我们的模拟捕捉了核盘区域的电离状态，以及这如何影响与辐射反馈效率的耦合效率下降。 <div>
Using subparsec-scale-resolution radiation+hydrodynamical adaptive mesh refinement simulations deployed with the RAMSES code, we study the dynamics of supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries embedded in gaseous nuclear circumbinary disks, where we investigate the effects of active galactic nucleus feedback on the SMBH binaries' migration behavior and disk structure. The radiative feedback effects are modeled by injecting photons that interact with the gas, through the adoption of a grid of BH emission spectra. We run simulations with initial conditions that lead by pure gravity plus hydrodynamics both to the formation of a low-density tidal cavity and to systems where gas–viscous diffusion is efficient enough to maintain a sizable gas reservoir surrounding the binary. For gap-forming binaries we find that orbital evolution is unchanged with the inclusion of feedback, but ionizing radiation photoevaporates gas that is at the outer edge of the low-density region. For non-gap-forming systems we find that when feedback is included a strong initial disruption of the circumbinary disk is followed by an eventual stabilization of the medium that can usher a return to a fast binary migration regime. All of this is possible as a result of how our simulations capture the ionization states of the nuclear disk region and how this affects the coupling efficiency decrease with respect to the radiative feedback.

In the denser and colder regions of the interstellar medium (ISM), gas-phase sulfur is depleted by 2 or 3 orders of magnitude with respect to its cosmic abundance. Thus, which species are the main carriers of sulfur is an open question. Recent studies have proposed Sn species as potential sulfur reservoirs. Among the various sulfur allotropes, the most stable one is the S8 ring, detected in the asteroid Ryugu and Orgueil meteorite. Shorter species, namely S3 and S4, have been found in the comet 67P/C-G, but their presence in the ISM remains elusive. In this study, we compute the binding energies (BEs) of Sn (n = 1–8) species on an amorphous water-ice surface model and analyze their infrared (IR) and Raman spectral features to provide data for their identification in the ISM. Our computations reveal that these species exhibit lower BEs than previously assumed and that their spectral features experience minimal shifts when adsorbed on water ice, because of the weak and nonspecific Sn–ice interactions. Furthermore, these species display very low IR band intensities and, therefore, very accurate instruments operating in the mid-IR range are required for detecting the presence of these species in dense interstellar environments.

Chemical anomalies in planet-hosting stars (PHSs) are studied in order to assess how the planetary nature and multiplicity affect the atmospheric chemical abundances of their host stars. We employ APOGEE DR17 to select thin-disk stars of the Milky Way, and crossmatch them with the Kepler Input Catalog to identify confirmed PHSs, which results in 227 PHSs with available chemical abundance ratios for six refractory elements. We also examine an ensemble of stars without planet signals, which are equivalent to the selected PHSs in terms of evolutionary stage and stellar parameters, to correct for Galactic chemical evolution effects, and derive the abundance gradient of refractory elements over the condensation temperature for the PHSs. Using the Galactic chemical evolution corrected abundances, we find that our PHSs do not show a significant difference in abundance slope from the stars without planets. However, when we examine the trends of the refractory elements of PHSs, based on the total number of their planets and their planet types, we find that the PHSs with giant planets are more depleted in refractory elements than those with rocky planets. Among the PHSs with rocky planets, the refractory depletion trends are potentially correlated with the terrestrial planets’ radii and multiplicity. In the cases of PHSs with giant planets, sub-Jovian PHSs demonstrate more depleted refractory trends than stars hosting Jovian-mass planets, raising questions on different planetary formation processes for Neptune-like and Jupiter-like planets.

We show that strong bow shocks are turbulent and nonuniversal near the head but asymptote to a universal, steady, self-similar, and analytically solvable flow in the downstream. The turbulence is essentially 3D and has been confirmed by a 3D simulation. The asymptotic behavior is confirmed with high-resolution 2D and 3D simulations of a cold uniform wind encountering both a solid spherical obstacle and stellar wind. This solution is relevant in the context of (i) probing the kinematic properties of observed high-velocity compact bodies—e.g., runaway stars and/or supernova ejecta blobs—flying through the interstellar medium; and (ii) constraining stellar bow shock luminosities invoked by some quasiperiodic eruption models.

We investigate the global structure of the general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) accretion flows around Kerr black holes containing shock waves, where the disk is threaded by radial and toroidal magnetic fields. We self-consistently solve the GRMHD equations that govern the flow motion inside the disk and for the first time, to our knowledge, we obtain the shock-induced global GRMHD accretion solutions around weakly as well as rapidly rotating black holes for a set of fundamental flow parameters, such as energy ( ), angular momentum ( ), radial magnetic flux (Φ), and isorotation parameter (F). We show that shock properties—namely, the shock radius (rsh), compression ratio (R), and shock strength (Ψ)—strongly depend on , , Φ, and F. We observe that the shock in the GRMHD flow continues to exist for a wide range of the flow parameters, which allows us to identify the effective domain of the parameter space in the plane where shock solutions are feasible. Moreover, we examine the modification of the shock parameter space and find that it shifts towards the lower-angular-momentum values with increasing Φ and black hole spin (ak). Finally, we compute the critical radial magnetic flux (Φcri) that admits shocks in GRMHD flows and ascertain that Φcri is higher (lower) for a black hole of spin ak = 0.99 (0.0) and vice versa.

<br /><br />总结: 该研究利用Hubble WFC3和Spitzer IRAC观测数据，结合1D-RCTE模型和贝叶斯推断框架，对19个行星的大气进行了分析。结果显示大气金属丰度和碳氧比存在大量分散，无法呈现出明显趋势。同时，日侧温度值也分散较大，没有与平衡温度呈现出一致的趋势。这表明外行星大气的形成和气候驱动因素存在巨大的变异性，或者需要更精确的观测来识别趋势。该研究预计1D-RCTE模型将在JWST时代继续为我们提供有关外行星大气的宝贵见解。 <div>
We present a population-level analysis of the dayside thermal emission spectra of 19 planets observed with Hubble WFC3 and Spitzer IRAC 3.6 and 4.5 μm, spanning equilibrium temperatures 1200–2700 K and 0.7–10.5 Jupiter masses. We use grids of planet-specific 1D, cloud-free, radiative–convective–thermochemical equilibrium models (1D-RCTE) combined with a Bayesian inference framework to estimate atmospheric metallicity, the carbon-to-oxygen ratio, and day-to-night heat redistribution. In general, we find that the secondary eclipse data cannot reject the physics encapsulated within the 1D-RCTE assumption parameterized with these three variables. We find a large degree of scatter in atmospheric metallicities, with no apparent trend, and carbon-to-oxygen ratios that are mainly consistent with solar or subsolar values but do not exhibit population agreement. Together, these indicate either (1) formation pathways vary over the hot and ultra-hot Jupiter population and/or (2) more accurate composition measurements are needed to identify trends. We also find a broad scatter in derived dayside temperatures that do not demonstrate a trend with equilibrium temperature. Like with composition estimates, this suggests either significant variability in climate drivers over the population and/or more precise dayside temperature measurements are needed to identify a trend. We anticipate that 1D-RCTE models will continue to provide valuable insights into the nature of exoplanet atmospheres in the era of JWST.

总结:<br />
本研究使用JWST NIRCam和MIRI观测了NGC 628中年轻恒星团的出现阶段。通过对氢复合线和多环芳烃（PAH）发射的空间分辨率图像进行分析，提取了953个紧凑的H ii区，并在相关的光解区域内对3.3和7.7μm PAH发射进行了分析。文章定义了三种PAH形态类别，并观察到PAH发射随着星团年龄的增长而减少。在H ii区附近，中性PAH和带电PAH的破坏速率相似，与文献中的参考模型预期不符。 <div>
We investigate the emergence phase of young star clusters in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 628. We use JWST NIRCam and MIRI observations to create spatially resolved maps of the Paα 1.87 μm and Brα 4.05 μm hydrogen recombination lines, as well as 3.3 and 7.7 μm emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). We extract 953 compact H ii regions and analyze the PAH emission and morphology at ∼10 pc scales in the associated photodissociation regions. While H ii regions remain compact, radial profiles help us to define three PAH morphological classes: compact (∼42%), extended (∼34%), and open (∼24%). The majority of compact and extended PAH morphologies are associated with very young star clusters (<5 Myr), while open PAH morphologies are mainly associated with star clusters older than 3 Myr. We observe a general decrease in the 3.3 and 7.7 μm PAH band emission as a function of cluster age, while their ratio remains constant with age out to 10 Myr and morphological class. The recovered PAH3.3μm/PAH7.7μm ratio is lower than values reported in the literature for reference models that consider neutral and ionized PAH populations and analyses conducted at galactic physical scales. The 3.3 and 7.7 μm bands are typically associated with neutral and ionized PAHs, respectively. While we expected neutral PAHs to be suppressed in proximity to an ionizing source, the constant PAH3.3μm/PAH7.7μm ratio would indicate that both families of molecules disrupt at similar rates in proximity to H ii regions.

<div> 双星系统, Hyades星团, 动力学质量, 恒星演化模型, TESS光变曲线
<br />
这项研究报道了使用CHARA阵列进行的长基线干涉观测，解析了Hyades星团中六个先前已知的双线谱二进制系统，它们的轨道周期从3到358天不等：HD 27483，HD 283882，HD 26874，HD 27149，HD 30676和HD 28545。结合这些观测和新旧的径向速度测量，推断了组分的动力学质量和轨道视差。对大多数恒星来说，质量的确定度优于1%。这项工作显著增加了星团中具有质量测定的系统数量。研究结果发现，尽管Hyades的年龄和金属丰度的当前恒星演化模型能够重现经验质量-光度关系的整体形状，但在0.5至1.4 M⊙范围内V-band光度被高估了约0.1等。在H波段，这种差异较小，在K波段附近为零，并且在一定程度上取决于模型。研究还利用了TESS光变曲线来估计目标的自转周期，并在其中一个目标（HD 283882）中检测到了大量耀斑活动，估计平均耀斑率为0.44次/天。 
<br /><br />总结: 双星系统动力学质量测定、恒星演化模型的不足、TESS光变曲线的利用及耀斑活动检测。 <div>
We report long-baseline interferometric observations with the CHARA Array that resolve six previously known double-lined spectroscopic binary systems in the Hyades cluster, with orbital periods ranging from 3 to 358 days: HD 27483, HD 283882, HD 26874, HD 27149, HD 30676, and HD 28545. We combine those observations with new and existing radial-velocity measurements, to infer the dynamical masses for the components as well as the orbital parallaxes. For most stars, the masses are determined to be better than 1%. Our work significantly increases the number of systems with mass determinations in the cluster. We find that, while current models of stellar evolution for the age and metallicity of the Hyades are able to reproduce the overall shape of the empirical mass–luminosity relation, they overestimate the V-band fluxes by about 0.1 mag between 0.5 and 1.4 M⊙. The disagreement is smaller in H, and near zero in K, and depends somewhat on the model. We also make use of the TESS light curves to estimate rotation periods for our targets, and detect numerous flares in one of them (HD 283882), estimating an average flaring rate of 0.44 events per day.

该研究通过对活跃区的Hα和Ca ii 8662 Å线进行同时观测发现，太阳黑子呈现多种结构，包括光桥和Ca ii 8662 Å线核心处的发射区域。在发射区域，Hα线核心图像显示出明亮的发射区域，光谱轮廓显示出升高的线核心。研究利用Ca ii 8662 Å线的非局部热动力学平衡多线反演和Hα线的弱场近似推断出视线磁场的分层结构。研究发现，Hα线核心推断的磁场强度始终小于 = −4.5处反演推断的磁场强度。然而，研究发现Hα线核心处的弱场近似和 = −4.5处反演推断之间没有相关性。在表现出发射特征的区域， = −4.5处推断的磁场形态类似于 = −1处，磁场强度略高或者相当。在光桥区域， = −1处推断的磁场强度小于周围黑子区域，并且在 = −4.5处相当。同样，Hα线的弱场近似所推断的光桥区域的磁场强度较周围黑子区域为低。 <br /><br />总结: 该研究通过观测Hα和Ca ii 8662 Å线同时观测到活跃区的多种结构，利用不同方法推断了磁场形态和强度，结果表明在发射区域和光桥区域的磁场特征有所不同，为太阳活动区的研究提供了重要的观测和分析结果。 <div>
We present spectropolarimetric observations of an active region recorded simultaneously in the Hα and the Ca ii 8662 Å lines. The sunspot exhibits multiple structures, including a light bridge and a region where the Ca ii 8662 Å line core is in emission. Correspondingly, the Hα line core image displays brightening in the emission region, with the spectral profiles showing elevated line cores. The stratification of the line-of-sight magnetic field is inferred through nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium multiline inversions of the Ca ii 8662 Å line and the weak field approximation (WFA) over the Hα line. The field strength inferred from the Hα line core is consistently smaller than that inferred from inversions at = −4.5. However, the study finds no correlation between the WFA over the core of the Hα line and that inferred from inversions at = −4.5. In regions exhibiting emission features, the morphology of the magnetic field at = −4.5 resembles that at = −1, with slightly higher or comparable field strengths. The magnetic field morphology inferred from the core of the Hα line is also similar to that inferred from the full spectral range of the Hα line in the emission region. The field strength inferred in the light bridge at = −1 is smaller than the surrounding umbral regions and comparable at = −4.5. Similarly, the field strength inferred in the light bridge from the WFA over the Hα line appears lower compared to the surrounding umbral regions.

研究了Fermi/GBM在高采样频率下观测到的太阳耀斑数据，发现并分析了X射线能量范围内短周期准周期脉动（QPPs）的普遍性。通过对合成太阳耀斑光变曲线的分析，了解了在实际数据中可能出现的假警报率和真阳率。研究结果表明，在Fermi/GBM数据中，普遍存在短周期QPPs的证据不强，可能是因为这种信号的基本发生率较低，或者它们的典型信噪比要低于1。最后，提出了在GBM太阳X射线数据中识别出的最有趣的潜在QPP事件的选择。 <br /><br />总结: 太阳耀斑的准周期脉动研究了Fermi/GBM数据中的X射线能量，通过合成光变曲线分析了短周期QPPs的普遍性，得出了在实际数据中可能出现的假警报率和真阳率的结论，并呈现了识别出的有趣的潜在QPP事件。 <div>
Most studies of quasiperiodic pulsations (QPPs) in solar flares have identified characteristic periods in the 5–300 s range. Due to observational limitations, there have been few attempts to probe the <5 s period regime and understand the prevalence of such short-period QPPs. However, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) has observed approximately 1500 solar flares to date in high-cadence 16 Hz burst mode, providing us with an opportunity to study short-period QPPs at X-ray energies. We systematically analyze every solar flare observed by Fermi/GBM in burst mode, estimating the prevalence of QPPs in multiple X-ray energy bands. To better understand these results, we complement this with an analysis of synthetic solar flare lightcurves, both with and without oscillatory signals present. Using these synthetic lightcurves, we can understand the likely false-alarm and true-positive rates in the real solar GBM data. We do not find strong evidence for widespread short-period QPPs, indicating either a low base occurrence rate of such signatures or that their typical signal-to-noise ratios must be low—less than 1—in Fermi/GBM data. Finally, we present a selection of the most interesting potential QPP events that were identified in the GBM solar X-ray data.

总结:<br /><br />本研究探讨了Ne viii 770 Å在探测太阳冕磁场方面的诊断潜力。通过模拟极端紫外线下的Ne viii线的偏振信号，结合Hanle效应，研究了不同太阳活动周期下的线偏振信号变化，发现随着太阳活动的增强，线偏振信号的检测性能显著提高，与磁场强度和太阳亮度的增加一致。最后讨论了考虑了实际仪器设计的信噪比要求。 <div>
Magnetic fields are the primary driver of the plasma thermodynamics in the upper solar atmosphere, especially in the corona. However, magnetic field measurements in the solar corona are sporadic, thereby limiting us from the complete understanding of physical processes occurring in the coronal plasma. In this paper, we explore the diagnostic potential of a coronal emission line in the extreme-ultraviolet, i.e., Ne viii 770 Å, to probe the coronal magnetic fields. We utilize 3D “Magnetohydrodynamic Algorithm outside a Sphere” models as input to the FORWARD code to model polarization in the Ne viii line produced as a result of resonance scattering, and we interpret its modification due to collisions and the magnetic fields through the Hanle effect. The polarization maps are synthesized both on the disk and off the limb. The variation of this polarization signal through the different phases of Solar Cycle 24 and the beginning phase of Solar Cycle 25 is studied in order to understand the magnetic diagnostic properties of this line owing to different physical conditions in the solar atmosphere. The detectability of the linear polarization signatures of the Hanle effect significantly improves with increasing solar activity, consistent with the increase in the magnetic field strength and the intensity of the mean solar brightness at these wavelengths. We finally discuss the signal-to-noise ratio requirements by considering realistic instrument designs.

<div> 高斯过程方法, 光变曲线, X射线爆发, 快速射电暴和哈哈镜振荡器

总结:<br /><br />文章介绍了利用高斯过程方法分析了2020年至2022年间Insight-HXMT、NICER和SGR 1935+2154探测到的X射线爆发的光变曲线。研究发现，需要使用随机驱动的阻尼简谐振荡器来捕捉X射线爆发的特征。X射线爆发的可变时间尺度通过简谐振荡器功率谱密度中的临界频率得到。特别是，与快速射电暴200428相关的HXMT-HE爆发限制了一个高达35赫兹的临界频率，其中简谐振荡器功率谱密度的指数从-4变为-2。研究指出，对应的时间尺度为0.03秒，可能是系统受到某种能量释放的阻滞时间尺度，同时高能光子的产生应该几乎与系统的响应同时发生。另一个特殊事件是NICER爆发，其阻滞时间尺度为1/(39赫兹)≈0.02秒。在正常的X射线爆发中，没有限制阻滞时间尺度；而获得了一个较长的松弛/平衡时间尺度（相应简谐振荡器功率谱密度中的临界频率为1-10赫兹，指数从-4/-2变为0）。研究结果表明，与快速射电暴相关的HXMT-HE X射线爆发可能是在系统对能量干扰做出响应时立即产生的，远在达到平衡状态之前。 <div>
The Gaussian process method is employed to analyze the light curves of bursts detected by Insight-HXMT, Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER), and Gravitational Wave High-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor from SGR 1935+2154 between 2020 and 2022. It is found that a stochastically driven damped simple harmonic oscillator (SHO) is necessary to capture the characteristics of the X-ray bursts (XRBs). A variability timescale of the XRBs, corresponding to the broken frequencies in the SHO power spectral densities (PSDs), is extracted. In particular, a high broken frequency of 35 Hz where the index of the SHO PSD changes from −4 to −2 is constrained by the HXMT-HE burst associated with fast radio burst (FRB) 200428. It is suggested that the corresponding timescale of 0.03 s could be the retarding timescale of the system driven by some energy release, and the production of the HE photon should be quasi-simultaneous with the response. The other special event is a NICER burst with a retarding timescale of 1/(39 Hz) ≈ 0.02 s. In the normal XRBs, no retarding timescale is constrained; a long relax/equilibrium timescale (corresponding to a broken frequency of 1–10 Hz, where the index of the SHO PSD changes from −4/−2 to 0 in the SHO PSD) is obtained. The results indicate that the FRB-associated HXMT-HE XRB could be produced immediately when the system is responding to the energy disturbance, far before the equilibrium state.

Nonlinear electrostatic solitary waves (ESWs) are routinely detected at various regions of Earth’s magnetosphere using the Wideband Data plasma wave receivers mounted on board the Cluster satellite(s). This mission has facilitated the observation and analysis of ESW characteristics, such as amplitude and temporal duration within the magnetosheath, while concurrently determining the density and temperature profiles of energetic electrons. These electron parameters, in conjunction with data from ion experiments, have served as input for the ion-acoustic solitary wave model developed in this article, with the ambition to contribute to the understanding of ESW generation mechanisms. Assuming as the starting point a plasma system comprising inertial ion fluid and kappa-distributed electron populations of different temperatures (i.e., “cold” and “hot” electrons), a nonperturbative approach has been adopted to investigate the existence and properties of solitary waves. A thorough parametric investigation has scrutinized the existence conditions for such localized structures in terms of the plasma configuration parameters. An interesting aspect emerges from the analysis, namely, the possibility for the coexistence of positive and negative polarity structures associated with ion-acoustic modes, in fact, manifested as simultaneously occurring positive polarity supersolitary waves and negative polarity regular solitary waves. Furthermore, our study has investigated the combined effect of the magnetic field strength, electron density, and suprathermal electron statistics on wave dynamics. The outcomes of this research are in agreement with observed electrostatic wave phenomena in the magnetosheath region, thus underscoring the intrinsic relevance of electrostatic supersolitary structures in data obtained by Cluster and other satellite missions.

总结:
通过使用Keck行星成像仪和特性分析仪（KPIC）高分辨率光谱技术，研究了HD 33632 Ab的旋转速度和分子丰度。根据对太阳系外行星HD 33632 Ab的自洽的次恒星大气和检索模型，获得了53 ± 3 km s−1的投影旋转速度以及CO和H2O的质量分数。得出的碳-氧比（C/O = 0.58 ± 0.14）、分子丰度和金属丰度与其恒星宿主一致。然而，在KPIC光谱中没有检测到甲烷，部分原因是高的v sin i和我们敏感的压力下的失衡化学。将HD 33632 Ab与文献中的>200个极低质量物体（M≲ 0.1 M⊙）进行了比较，发现孤立的低质量场物体与质量之间没有明显的趋势，但在低质量伴星和直接成像的外行星中发现了一个初步的趋势，与以前的研究结果相似。大规模的近距离气态巨行星和棕矮星样本将通过旋转和化学丰度测量对它们的形成和演化理解进行重要的考验。<br /><br /> <div>
We present the projected rotational velocity and molecular abundances for HD 33632 Ab obtained via Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC) high-resolution spectroscopy. HD 33632 Ab is a nearby benchmark brown dwarf companion at a separation of ∼20 au that straddles the L–T transition. Using a forward-modeling framework with on-axis host star spectra, which provides self-consistent substellar atmospheric and retrieval models for HD 33632 Ab, we derive a projected rotational velocity of 53 ± 3 km s−1 and carbon monoxide and water mass fractions of logCO = −2.3 ± 0.3 and logH2O = −2.7 ± 0.2, respectively. The inferred carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O = 0.58 ± 0.14), molecular abundances, and metallicity ([C/H] = 0.0 ± 0.2 dex) of HD 33632 Ab are consistent with its host star. Although detectable methane opacities are expected in L–T transition objects, we did not recover methane in our KPIC spectra, partly due to the high v sin i and to disequilibrium chemistry at the pressures to which we are sensitive. We parameterize the spin as the ratio of rotation to the breakup velocity, and compare HD 33632 Ab to a compilation of >200 very low-mass objects (M ≲ 0.1 M⊙) that have spin measurements in the literature. There appears to be no clear trend for the isolated low-mass field objects versus mass, but a tentative trend is identified for low-mass companions and directly imaged exoplanets, similar to previous findings. A larger sample of close-in gas giant exoplanets and brown dwarfs will critically examine our understanding of their formation and evolution through rotation and chemical abundance measurements.

总结:
本研究利用存档的AstroSat Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT)成像数据首次在M31提供了一份紫外光天文学对新星的目录。通过两种图像减法技术，我们发现了M31中部深处的物体。在UVIT图像中共发现了42颗新星，其中15颗在远紫外光和近紫外光的多个滤波器中被检测到。在静止期间检测到的新星显示出紫外光能谱中吸积盘的特征，而在爆发阶段的新星则显示出伪光球的特征。还有一些新星在多个时期被检测到。一些在静止期间显示出接近恒定的远紫外光亮度，而其他在爆发附近的新星则显示出光变曲线中的爆发前暗淡。最后，我们讨论了紫外光调查对阐明新星系统理论预测的重要性，包括探测难以捕捉到的早期紫外光闪烁。 <div>
Extensive multiwavelength studies of novae have been carried out in our galaxy and in M31 for decades. However, UV studies of extragalactic novae are limited, especially those in quiescence. For the first time, we present a UV catalog of novae in M31 using the archival AstroSat Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) imaging data. We used two image subtraction techniques to retrieve objects located deep into the M31 central region. We have found 42 novae in total in the UVIT images, 15 of which have been detected in multiple filters in the far-ultraviolet (FUV) and near-ultraviolet. The novae detected at quiescence show signatures of accretion disk from their UV spectral energy distributions, whereas those in the outburst phase show signatures of a pseudo-photosphere. A few novae were also detected in multiple epochs. Some show a near-constant FUV magnitude at quiescence, while others caught near the outburst reveal pre-eruption dips in their light curves. We conclude with a discussion on the significance of UV surveys in illuminating theoretical predictions for novae systems, including detecting the elusive early UV flash.

Templates modeling just the dominant mode of gravitational radiation are generally sufficient for the unbiased parameter inference of near-equal-mass compact binary mergers. However, neglecting the subdominant modes can bias the inference if the binary is significantly asymmetric, very massive, or has misaligned spins. In this work, we explore if neglecting these subdominant modes in the parameter estimation of nonspinning binary black hole mergers can bias the inference of their population-level properties such as mass and merger redshift distributions. Assuming the design sensitivity of the advanced LIGO-Virgo detector network, we find that neglecting subdominant modes will not cause a significant bias in the population inference, although including them will provide more precise estimates. This is primarily because asymmetric binaries are expected to be rarer in our detected sample, due to their intrinsic rareness and the observational selection effects. The increased precision in the measurement of the maximum black hole mass can help in better constraining the upper mass gap in the mass spectrum.

<div> 关键词: 彗星 81P/Wild 2, 26Al–26Mg同位素, 彗星形成机制, 碎屑矿物, 碎片分析
总结: 彗星81P/Wild 2是一种几乎未经内部加热26Al衰变的4.5公里大小的原始天体，其核可能是通过颗粒云的分层聚集或重力坍缩形成的。对野2号碎片Pyxie进行了26Al–26Mg同位素系统学的重新分析，结果显示其初期(26Al/27Al)0的上限≤1.5 × 10−6，比其他野2号碎片估计的值小2倍。Pyxie的最小结晶年龄估计为钙铝富集体之后的3.6Ma以上，表明它是在富含中度挥发元素的盘环境中形成的球粒碎屑，并在彗星野2号之前沉积。这些结果与早期和持续沉积的分层聚集模型不符合。相反，结果更符合在26Al丰度极低(26Al/27Al ≤ 1.5 × 10−6)且气体扩散之前，通过颗粒轻柔的重力坍缩形成彗星的观点。 <br /><br /> <div>
Comet 81P/Wild 2 is a ∼4.5 km-sized primordial object that almost has not been modified by internal heating by 26Al decay. Its nucleus could have been formed by hierarchical agglomeration or gravitational collapse of pebble swarms concentrated by streaming instability. To shed light on the cometesimal formation mechanism from laboratory sample analysis, we reexamined the 26Al–26Mg isotope systematics of the plagioclase-bearing fragment, Pyxie (from Wild 2 track 81), with significantly improved analytical precision. The revised upper limit of the initial (26Al/27Al)0 of Pyxie is ≤1.5 × 10−6, 2 times smaller than those estimated from other Wild 2 fragments. Assuming homogenous distribution of 26Al in the early solar system, the minimum crystallization age of Pyxie is estimated to be >3.6 Ma after calcium–aluminum-rich inclusions. Additional petrologic examination demonstrated that it is a chondrule fragment formed in disk environments enriched in moderately volatile elements comparable to the Si-rich rim of CR chondrules before accreting by comet Wild 2. The late accretion of the Wild 2 nucleus with most silicates likely from a common source are not favored by the hierarchical agglomeration model that considers early and continuous accretion. Instead, the results are more in line with comet formation by gentle gravitational collapse of pebbles when the 26Al abundance is extremely low (26Al/27Al ≤ 1.5 × 10−6) before gas dispersal.

<div> 关键词: Orion Nebula Cluster, Chandra HETGS, young massive star formation, high-resolution spectra, X-ray bright stars 

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章描述了对猎户座星云簇（ONC）进行的长达2.1 Ms的Chandra HETGS观测，提取和清洁了36个高分辨率光谱，包括θ1 Ori C星的X射线光谱。观测显示所有恒星都具有高度变化性，包括大质量恒星。通过热等离子体辐射线模型拟合发现，大多数恒星显示高达几次1022 cm−2的柱密度和10–90 MK的高等离子温度。观测还发现了高温成分的分叉，表明有重大的耀斑活动。这组数据代表着迄今最大的关于年轻的主序前恒星的HETGS高分辨率X射线光谱的收集。 <div>
The Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) is the closest site of very young (∼1 Myr) massive star formation The ONC hosts more than 1600 young and X-ray bright stars with masses ranging from ∼0.1–35 M⊙. The Chandra HETGS Orion Legacy Project observed the ONC with the Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer (HETGS) for 2.1 Ms. We describe the spectral extraction and cleaning processes necessary to separate overlapping spectra. We obtained 36 high-resolution spectra, which include a high-brilliance X-ray spectrum of θ1 Ori C with over 100 highly significant X-ray lines. The lines show Doppler broadening between 300 and 400 km s−1. Higher spectral diffraction orders allow us to resolve line components of high Z He-like triplets in θ1 Ori C with unprecedented spectral resolution. Long-term light curves spanning ∼20 yr show all stars to be highly variable, including the massive stars. Spectral fitting with thermal coronal emission line models reveals that most sources show column densities of up to a few times 1022 cm−2 and high coronal temperatures of 10–90 MK. We observe a bifurcation of the high-temperature component where some stars show a high component of 40 MK, while others show above 60 MK, indicating heavy flaring activity. Some lines are resolved with Doppler broadening above our threshold of ∼200 km s−1, up to 500 km s−1. This data set represents the largest collection of HETGS high-resolution X-ray spectra from young pre-main-sequence stars in a single star-forming region to date.

<div> 关键词: M矮星、耀斑、多波段观测、NUV、光学
总结: 该研究通过对M矮星进行多波段观测，发现了24颗近邻M矮星上213次NUV耀斑，并发现所有光学耀斑都有NUV对应。研究发现NUV和光学能量之比随NUV能量增加而略有减少，这一趋势与先前针对更高能量G-K星的耀斑研究结果一致。通过对M0-M3和M4-M6矮星的分析，得出了NUV耀斑时间的平均比例分别为2.1%和5%。此外，对NUV和光学耀斑的频率分布进行比较后发现，在所有光谱亚型中，NUV和光学耀斑的频率分布均具有相似的斜率。研究结果表明，M矮星的NUV耀斑会影响大气化学、辐射环境，并可能对其携带的外行星的生命潜力产生影响。最终得出结论，早期和中期M矮星具有引发生命起源的NUV耀斑的潜力。 <br /><br /> <div>
We present a comprehensive multiwavelength investigation into flares and activity in nearby M dwarf stars. We leverage the most extensive contemporaneous data set obtained through the Transiting Exoplanet Sky Survey, Kepler/K2, the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, and the Hubble Space Telescope, spanning the optical and near-ultraviolet (NUV) regimes. In total, we observed 213 NUV flares on 24 nearby M dwarfs, with ∼27% of them having detected optical counterparts, and found that all optical flares had NUV counterparts. We explore NUV/optical energy fractionation in M dwarf flares. Our findings reveal a slight decrease in the ratio of optical to NUV energies with increasing NUV energies, a trend in agreement with prior investigations on G–K stars’ flares at higher energies. Our analysis yields an average NUV fraction of flaring time for M0–M3 dwarfs of 2.1%, while for M4–M6 dwarfs it is 5%. We present an empirical relationship between NUV and optical flare energies and compare to predictions from radiative hydrodynamic and blackbody models. We conducted a comparison of the flare frequency distribution (FFDs) of NUV and optical flares, revealing that the FFDs of both NUV and optical flares exhibit comparable slopes across all spectral subtypes. NUV flares on stars affect the atmospheric chemistry, the radiation environment, and the overall potential to sustain life on any exoplanets they host. We find that early and mid-M dwarfs (M0–M5) have the potential to generate NUV flares capable of initiating abiogenesis.

<title>A Hot Mess: The Rich and Complex Soft Emitting Regions Surrounding the Reflection Dominated Flaring Central Engine of Mrk 1239</title>

<div> X-ray, Seyfert 1, absorption, emission, AGN
总结:
本文针对Mrk 1239进行了深入的X射线观测和分析。观测发现AGN在4-30keV范围内出现了5倍的强烈闪烁，主要由主要连续体的增强引起。然而，在3keV以下的范围内没有任何变化，表明AGN连续体被大约10^23.5cm^-2的中性介质完全吸收。时序和谱学特性与主要发射的模糊反射解释一致。中性吸收介质的存在排除了部分电离遮挡的可能性。如果中性吸收介质是一种流出物质，可能会与周围介质和星际介质相碰撞，产生低能连续体和碰撞电离发射。内部环的散射辐射可能产生光电离发射。数据要求的复杂环境突显了AGN和宿主星系环境之间的界面复杂性。Mrk 1239等物体是揭示AGN和宿主星系环境界面的重要来源。 <div>
Previous X-ray works on Mrk 1239 have revealed a complex narrow-line Seyfert 1 that exhibits substantial absorption and strong emission from both collisionally ionized and photoionized plasmas. Here, we report on deep-pointed observations with XMM-Newton and NuSTAR, along with Swift monitoring, to understand the 0.3–30 keV continuum emission and the central engine geometry. A strong X-ray flare, where the AGN brightens by a factor of 5 in ∼30 ks, is captured between 4 and 30 keV and can be attributed to a brightening of the primary continuum. However, the lack of any variability below ∼3 keV on long or short timescales requires complete absorption of the AGN continuum with a neutral medium of column density ∼1023.5 cm−2. The timing and spectral properties are consistent with a blurred reflection interpretation for the primary emission. The variability and presence of a Compton hump disfavors ionized partial covering. The neutral absorber, if outflowing, could be crashing into the surrounding medium and interstellar medium to produce the low-energy continuum and collisionally ionized emission. Scattered emission off the inner torus could produce the photoionized emission. The intricate scenario is demanded by the data and highlights the complexity of the environment that is normally invisible when overwhelmed by the AGN continuum. Objects like Mrk 1239 serve as important sources for unveiling the interface between the AGN and host galaxy environments.

<div> 光谱，紫外线，星系，氧含量，再电离<br />
<br />总结:
这项研究利用JWST公开数据构建了63个红移在5.6 < z < 9的星系的紫外到光学复合光谱。根据这个复合光谱，研究人员得出了平均尘埃衰减、电子密度、电子温度、电离参数和氧含量等参数。结果显示，再电离时代的星系可能正在快速积累高特定星形成率的星体，而紫外诊断显示星系主要是由星形成所导致的电离。另外，复合光谱的一些比率暗示，样本中的一些星系可能是再电离辐射的强烈贡献者。 <div>
Ultraviolet (UV; rest-frame ∼1200–2000 Å) spectra provide a wealth of diagnostics to characterize fundamental galaxy properties, such as their chemical enrichment, the nature of their stellar populations, and their amount of Lyman-continuum (LyC) radiation. In this work, we leverage publicly released JWST data to construct the rest-frame UV-to-optical composite spectrum of a sample of 63 galaxies at 5.6 < z < 9, spanning a wavelength range from 1500 to 5200 Å. Based on the composite spectrum, we derive an average dust attenuation from Hβ/Hγ, an electron density cm−3 from the [O ii] doublet ratio, an electron temperature K from the [O iii] λ4363/[O iii] λ5007 ratio, and an ionization parameter from the [O iii]/[O ii] ratio. Using a direct Te method, we calculate an oxygen abundance and a carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) abundance ratio . This C/O ratio is smaller than compared to z = 0 and z = 2–4 star-forming galaxies, albeit with moderate significance. This indicates the reionization-era galaxies might be undergoing a rapid buildup of stellar mass with high specific star formation rates. A UV diagnostic based on the ratios of C iii] λλ1907, 1909/He iiλ1640 versus O iii] λ1666/He iiλ1640 suggests that the star formation is the dominant source of ionization, similar to the local extreme dwarf galaxies and z ∼ 2–4 He ii–detected galaxies. The [O iii]/[O ii] and C iv/C iii] ratios of the composite spectrum are marginally larger than the criteria used to select galaxies as LyC leakers, suggesting that some of the galaxies in our sample are strong contributors to the reionizing radiation.

这篇文章报道了一个红移为z=0.304458±0.000007的新型绿豆星系，其具有大尺度的喷射诱导的射电发射。射电组分的光谱能量分布显示出陡峭的光谱指数，而延伸区域的光谱年龄建模表明其波束已经存在超过6百万年。关于喷流是活跃的还是休眠的问题尚不清楚。此外，测量到几个云区，距离宿主星系最远可达37.8千秒差距，并且它们的电离剖面显示出过去大约0.15百万年内AGN的电离光子产生有所下降。研究还发现一个云区呈现蓝移，与射电喷流路径重合，可能是被光电离AGN照射，也可能是与相对论喷流发生了相互作用。多波段分析表明，RGB1在较低激发的射电星系或者不活跃星系可能是在过去约0.15百万年内的喷流产生阶段过渡到了较高辐射效率的吸积阶段。不清楚RGB1是在过去约0.15百万年内过渡为了低激发射电星系或者不活跃星系，或者是延长的射电和光学发射迹中迹着有序进行的两个吸积阶段。

Jetted active galactic nuclei (AGN) hosting extended photoionized nebulae provide us with a unique view of the timescales associated with AGN activity. Here, we present a new green bean galaxy at z = 0.304458 ± 0.000007 with large-scale jet-induced radio emission. The spectral energy distributions of the radio components show steep spectral indices (α = −0.85 to −0.92 for the extended regions, and α = −1.02 for the faint radio core), and spectral age modeling of the extended radio emission indicates that the lobes are >6 Myr old. It is unclear whether the jet is active, or is a remnant with an off-time of 2–3 Myr. Several detached clouds lie around the host galaxy up to 37.8 kpc away from the nucleus, and their ionization profile indicates a decline (∼2 dex) in the AGN ionizing photon production over the past ∼0.15 Myr. Furthermore, we measure a blueshift for one of the clouds that is spatially coincident with the path of the radio jet. The cloud is likely illuminated by the photoionizing AGN, and potentially underwent an interaction with the relativistic jet. Our multiwavelength analysis suggests that RGB1 was in a phase of jet production prior to the radiatively efficient accretion phase traced by the detached cloud emission. It is unclear whether RGB1 transitioned into a low-excitation radio galaxy or an inactive galaxy over the past ∼0.15 Myr, or whether the extended radio and optical emission trace distinct accretion phases that occurred in succession.

<div> 关键词: Pantheon+, Type Ia supernova, ΩΛ, 天鹅座, 宇宙微波背景辐射

总结:
本研究分析了天鹅座+型Ia超新星样本中的宇宙学常数ΩΛ，发现了两个大尺度的不对称性。第一个不对称性与银河北-南方向密切对齐，第二个大致指向R.A.约217.°5，decl.约-26.°4，距宇宙微波背景辐射偶极子顶点约50.°9。这暗示了一个与天鹅座+超新星在天空中的分布以及银河红化校正相关的系统效应。第二个不对称性表明，在相反方向上测量的ΩΛ存在2.8σ的张力，这对我们对ΩΛ的暗能量解释具有重要影响。这可能意味着ΩΛ并不是一个真正的暗能量，而是与相对论参考系转换相关的表观效应。 <br /><br /> <div>
An analysis of the cosmological constant ΩΛ fitted to subsamples of the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernova sample spanning 2π steradians for a grid of 432 pole positions covering the whole sky reveals two large-scale asymmetries. One of them is closely aligned with the Galactic north–south direction and the other points approximately toward R.A. ∼ 217.°5, decl. ∼ −26.°4, ∼50.°9 from the cosmic microwave background dipole Apex. The signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the multiple ΩΛ measurements in these directions is 3.2 ≲ S/N ≲ 8.4. The first asymmetry is puzzling, and would indicate a systematic effect related with the distribution of Pantheon+ supernovae on the sky and, probably, how the correction for reddening in the Galaxy is calculated. The second one, which entails a 2.8-σ tension between ΩΛ measured in opposite directions, bears strong implications on our interpretation of ΩΛ as dark energy: it is consistent with the prediction for tilted observers located in a Friedmann–Robertson–Walker universe who could measure an acceleration or a deceleration with a dipolar asymmetry, irrespective of what the universe as a whole is doing. In this case, ΩΛ would not be a physical entity, a real dark energy, but an apparent effect associated with the relativistic frame of reference transformation.

Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations have shown that relativistic collisionless shocks mediated by the Weibel instability accelerate ∼1% of incoming particles, while the majority are transmitted through the shock and become thermalized. The microphysical processes that determine whether an incoming particle will be transmitted or reflected are poorly understood. We study the microphysics of particle reflection in Weibel-mediated shocks by tracking a shell of test particles in a PIC simulation of a shock in pair plasma. We find that electrons in positron-dominated filaments and positrons in electron-dominated filaments efficiently reflect off of strong magnetic structures at the shock. To participate in diffusive shock acceleration, however, these reflected particles headed toward the upstream must avoid getting advected downstream. This is enabled by incoming filaments, which trap reflected particles carrying the same sign of current as the filaments. The final injection efficiency on the order of ∼1% thus results from the effectiveness of the initial reflection at the shock and the reflected particles’ probability of survival in the upstream postreflection. We develop a model that predicts the fraction of high-energy particles as a function of the properties of Weibel filamentation.

We have characterized the ionized, neutral, and warm molecular gas kinematics in the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 3227 using observations from the Hubble Space Telescope Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph, Apache Point Observatory’s Kitt Peak Ohio State Multi-Object Spectrograph, Gemini-North’s Near-Infrared Integral Field Spectrometer, and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. We fit multiple Gaussians to several spatially resolved emission lines observed with long-slit and integral-field spectroscopy and isolate the kinematics based on apparent rotational and outflowing motions. We use the kinematics to determine an orientation for the bicone along which the outflows travel and find that the biconical structure has an inclination of ° from our line of sight and a half-opening angle with an inner and outer boundary of ° and °, respectively. We observe ionized outflows traveling 500 km s−1 at distances up to 7″ (800 pc) from the supermassive black hole (SMBH) and disturbed ionized gas up to a distance of 15″ (1.7 kpc). Our analysis reveals that the ionized outflows are launched from within 20 pc of the SMBH, at the same location as a bridge of cold gas across the nucleus detected in Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array CO(2–1) observations. We measure a turnover radius where the gas starts decelerating at a distance of 26 ± 6 pc from the active galactic nucleus. Compared to a turnover radius in the range of 31−63 pc from a radiative driving model, we confirm that radiative driving is the dominant acceleration mechanism for the narrow-line region outflows in NGC 3227.

The key to detecting neutral hydrogen during the epoch of reionization (EoR) is to separate the cosmological signal from the dominating foreground radiation. We developed direct optimal mapping (DOM) to map interferometric visibilities; it contains only linear operations, with full knowledge of point spread functions from visibilities to images. Here, we demonstrate a fast Fourier transform-based image power spectrum and its window functions computed from the DOM images. We use noiseless simulation, based on the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array Phase I configuration, to study the image power spectrum properties. The window functions show <10−11 of the integrated power leaks from the foreground-dominated region into the EoR window; the 2D and 1D power spectra also verify the separation between the foregrounds and the EoR.

This study elucidates the properties of electrostatic and electromagnetic instabilities, exploring their role over the transrelativistic range. Notably, the growth of oblique Buneman waves and previously overlooked, secondary, small-scale ion–electron instabilities is observed to be particularly promoted in the relativistic regime. Furthermore, the growth of large-scale electromagnetic modes encounters severe limitations in any cold, baryon-loaded precursor. It is argued that electron preheating in electrostatic modes may alleviate these constraints, facilitating the subsequent growth of large-scale filamentation modes in the precursors of transrelativistic shocks.

<div> 关键词: 星系，13CO发射，分级结构，重力，统计性质<br />
<br />
这项工作介绍了银河系成像卷轴绘画项目针对Maddalena巨型分子云（GMC）的数据。我们使用修改后的树状图算法将观测区域的13CO发射数据立方体分解为分级次结构。我们研究了这些分级结构的统计特性，并探讨了自身重力在不同空间尺度上的作用。我们呈现了这些分级结构的质量（M）、半径（R）、速度离散度（σv）、维里参数（αvir）和声速马赫数的统计数据。分级结构的半径和质量分布以及σv-R比例关系与以往使用非分级算法识别实体的研究结果相似。我们发现，对于分级结构，随着其半径或质量的增加，αvir会减小。Maddalena GMC的安静区域中，大多数分级结构不受重力束缚（αvir > 2），而在形成星系的区域中，大多数分级结构是受重力束缚的（αvir < 2）。此外，我们发现在IRAS 06453形成星系区域的0.8-4 pc尺度上，自身重力起着重要作用，而在非形成星系区域的5 pc以下尺度上则不是重要因素。 <br /><br />总结: 这项工作使用13CO发射数据对Maddalena GMC进行了分级结构分解，研究了这些结构的统计特性并探讨了自身重力的作用。研究表明，在星系形成区域，大部分结构受到重力影响，而在非形成星系区域，自身重力影响较小。 <div>
In this work, we present data from the Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting project for the Maddalena giant molecular cloud (GMC). We decompose the 13CO emission datacube of the observed region into hierarchical substructures using a modified dendrogram algorithm. We investigate the statistical properties of these substructures and examine the role that self-gravity plays on various spatial scales. The statistics of the mass (M), radius (R), velocity dispersion (σv), virial parameter (αvir), and sonic Mach number of the substructures are presented. The radius and mass distributions and the σv–R scaling relationship of the substructures resemble those reported in previous studies that use nonhierarchical algorithms to identify the entities. We find that for the hierarchical substructures αvir decreases as the radius or mass of the substructures increases. The majority of the substructures in the quiescent region of the Maddalena GMC are not gravitationally bound (αvir > 2), while most of the substructures in the star-forming regions are gravitationally bound (αvir < 2). Furthermore, we find that self-gravity plays an important role on scales of 0.8–4 pc in the IRAS 06453 star-forming region, while it is not an important factor on scales below 5 pc in the non-star-forming region.

We perform the numerical simulations of axisymmetric, relativistic, optically thin jets under the influence of the radiation field of an accretion disk. We show that starting from a very low injection velocity at the base, jets can be accelerated to relativistic terminal speeds when traveling through the radiation field. The jet gains momentum through the interaction with the radiation field. We use a relativistic equation of state for multispecies plasma, which self-consistently calculates the adiabatic index for the jet material. All the jet solutions obtained are transonic in nature. In addition to the acceleration of the jet to relativistic speeds, our results show that the radiation field also acts as a collimating agent. The jets remain well collimated under the effect of radiation pressure. We also show that if the jet starts with a rotational velocity, the radiation field will reduce the angular momentum of the jet beam.

To investigate gravity in the nonlinear regime of cosmic structure using measurements from stage IV surveys, it is imperative to accurately compute large-scale structure observables, such as nonlinear matter power spectra, for gravity models that extend beyond general relativity. However, the theoretical predictions of nonlinear observables are typically derived from N-body simulations, which demand substantial computational resources. In this study, we introduce a novel public emulator, termed FREmu, designed to provide rapid and precise forecasts of nonlinear power spectra specifically for the Hu–Sawicki f(R) gravity model across scales 0.0089h Mpc−1 < k < 0.5h Mpc−1 and redshifts 0 < z < 3. FREmu leverages principal component analysis and artificial neural networks to establish a mapping from parameters to power spectra, utilizing training data derived from the Quijote-MG simulation suite. With a parameter space encompassing seven dimensions, including Ωm, Ωb, h, ns, σ8, Mν, and , the emulator achieves an accuracy exceeding 95% for the majority of cases, thus proving to be highly efficient for constraining parameters.

<title>The Incompressible Magnetohydrodynamic Energy Cascade Rate Upstream of Mars: Effects of the Total Energy and the Cross-helicity on Solar Wind Turbulence</title>

Solar wind turbulence is a dynamical phenomenon that evolves with heliocentric distance. Orbiting Mars since 2014 September, Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN offers a unique opportunity to explore some of its main properties beyond ∼1.38 au. Here, we analyze solar wind turbulence upstream of Mars' bow shock, utilizing more than 5 years of magnetic field and plasma measurements. This analysis is based on two complementary methodologies: (1) the computation of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) invariants characterizing incompressible fluctuations; (2) the estimation of the incompressible energy cascade rate at MHD scales (i.e., 〈εT〉MHD). Our results show the solar wind incompressible fluctuations are primarily in a magnetically dominated regime, with the component traveling away from the Sun having a higher median pseudoenergy. Moreover, turbulent fluctuations have a total energy per mass of up to ∼ 300 km2 s−2, a range smaller than reported at 1 au. For these conditions, we determine the probability distribution function of 〈εT〉MHD ranges mainly between ∼ −1 × 10−16 and ∼1 × 10−16 J m−3 s −1, with a median equal to −1.8 × 10−18 J m−3 s −1, suggesting back transfer of energy. Our results also suggest that ∣〈εT〉MHD∣ is correlated with the total energy per mass of fluctuations and that the median of 〈εT〉MHD does not vary significantly with the cross-helicity. We find, however, that the medians of the inward and outward pseudoenergy cascade rates vary with the solar wind cross-helicity. Finally, we discuss these results and their implications for future studies that can provide further insight into the factors affecting the solar wind energy transfer rate.

<title>On the Origin of Solar Hemispheric Helicity Rules: Rise of 3D Magnetic Flux Concentrations through a Background Magnetic Field</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Sunspots and active regions observed on the solar surface are widely believed to be manifestations of compact predominantly toroidal magnetic field structures (“flux tubes”) that emerge by magnetic buoyancy from the deeper interior of the Sun. Much work has examined the evolution of such magnetic structures, typically considering them as idealized isolated magnetic entities and not as more realistic magnetic concentrations in a volume-filling background magnetic field. Here, we report results that explore the buoyant rise dynamics of magnetic concentrations in a volume-filling field in the full three dimensions. Earlier 2.5D work in this series established the remarkable fact that the twist orientation of a flux concentration relative to the background field affected its likelihood to rise and emerge, regardless of whether the buoyant rise took place in the absence or presence of convection. The contrasting dynamics between structures with differing orientations lead to a selection mechanism that reproduces characteristics of the “solar hemispheric helicity rule(s)” observations strikingly well. Here, we show that this two-dimensional selection mechanism persists in the face of the added complexity of three-dimensional dynamics. Arching of the magnetic structure in the third dimension, as might be expected in the solar application, is introduced. The role of tension force leading to this selection mechanism is elucidated and subtle differences that arise due to the three-dimensional geometry are discussed.

<title>Insights from Optical Fe ii Emission in Quasars</title>

The complexity of the energy levels in Fe ii has made it difficult to theoretically interpret its observational emission spectrum. However, addressing this challenge could provide valuable insights into the main sequence of QSOs using “eigenvector 1” and the chemical evolution of the Universe. Although the templates based on I Zw 1 are widely used, their universality remains unexplained. To address this, we utilized the CLOUDY spectral synthesis code to generate theoretical blends of Fe ii optical emission near the Hβ region. Our results indicate that the optimal cloud density and photon flux align with previous studies at gas density 1011 cm−3 and photon flux 1020.5 cm−2 s−1. We discovered a broad parameter region that fits the data well, encompassing a diverse range of densities and photon fluxes. This helps to explain the general applicability of optical templates. Additionally, we investigated the effects of different spectral energy distributions (SEDs), Eddington ratios, turbulence, and cloud column densities and found that they provided a sufficiently broad range for typical emitting clouds. We found different SEDs had a negligible impact on the template shape, further expanding the usability of empirical templates. However, they significantly affected the absolute intensity of Fe ii emission, consistent with previous research. Furthermore, we determined that a turbulence of approximately 100 km s−1 is necessary to produce sufficiently strong optical Fe ii, and either a column density greater than 1024 cm−2, which is typical for Fe ii UV emission, or an abundance higher than solar is preferred.

总结:
本研究使用Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager/Solar Dynamics Observatory数据，对2010年5月至2015年5月的62个太阳活动区进行分析。研究表明，磁螺度与磁螺度通量和磁扭曲存在关系，但与动力学螺度无关。这表明太阳活动区上空的磁螺度主要来源于磁扭曲，而在光球以下区域的流体动力学并非太阳活动区磁螺度的主要来源。 <div>
Using Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager/Solar Dynamics Observatory data, we search for a relationship between kinetic helicity and magnetic helicity in solar active regions (ARs) using a sample of 62 ARs from 2010 May to 2015 May. The sample includes 32 mature ARs and 30 emerging ARs. We calculate kinetic helicity in the interior in the depth range from 0.6 to 11.6 Mm, magnetic helicity in the corona, helicity flux across the photosphere, and the magnetic twist and magnetic writhe of the ARs at the photosphere. From these data, relationships are found between magnetic helicity, helicity flux, and magnetic twist. However, magnetic writhe appears not to be related to the other magnetic quantities. No relationship is found between the kinetic helicity and any magnetic quantity. In particular, no relationship is found between the kinetic helicity and any of the following: magnetic helicity, magnetic helicity flux, magnetic twist, or magnetic writhe. These results suggest that (1) the magnetic helicity in the corona above ARs is mainly derived from the magnetic twist, and (2) the flow dynamics in the region from 0.6 to 11.6 Mm below the photosphere is not the primary source for the generation of magnetic helicity in ARs.

The Kepler mission reveals a peculiar trough-peak feature in the orbital spacing of close-in planets near mean-motion resonances: a deficit and an excess that are, respectively, a couple of percent interior to and wide of the resonances. This feature has received two main classes of explanations: one involving eccentricity damping and the other scattering with small bodies. Here, we point out a few issues with the damping scenario and study the scattering scenario in more detail. We elucidate why scattering small bodies tends to repel two planets. As the small bodies random-walk in energy and angular momentum space, they tend to absorb fractionally more energy than angular momentum. This, which we call “ping-pong repulsion,” transports angular momentum from the inner to the outer planet and pushes the two planets apart. Such a process, even if ubiquitous, leaves identifiable marks only near first-order resonances: diverging pairs jump across the resonance quickly and produce the mean-motion resonance asymmetry. To explain the observed positions of the trough-peaks, a total scattering mass of order a few percent of the planet masses is required. Moreover, if this mass is dominated by a handful of Mercury-sized bodies, one can also explain the planet eccentricities as inferred from transit-time variations. Last, we suggest how these conditions may have naturally arisen during the late stages of planet formation.

本文研究了银河系中铋的来源问题，通过在恒星天体物理实验模块中模拟新星的演化过程，发现元素扩散可以显著增加新星中的7Be丰度，从而解释了观测到的几乎所有新星。通过群体合成方法计算了银河中铋的产量，发现大约73%的铋是由新星产生的，这表明新星是银河系中铋的重要来源。 <div>
The source of the Galactic lithium (Li) has long been a puzzle. With the discovery of Li in novae, extensive research has been conducted. However, there still exists a significant disparity between the observed abundance of Li in novae and the existing theoretical predictions. Using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics, we simulate the evolution of novae with element diffusion and appropriately increase the amount of 3He in the mixtures. Element diffusion enhances the transport efficiency between the nuclear reaction zone and the convective region on the surface of the white dwarf (WD) during nova eruptions, which results in more 7Be being transmitted to the WD surface and ultimately ejected. Compared to the previous predictions, the abundance of 7Be in novae simulated in our model significantly increases. The result is able to explain almost all observed novae. Using the method of population synthesis, we calculate Li yield in the Galaxy. We find that the Galactic occurrence rate of novae is about 130 yr−1, and about 110 M⊙ Li produced by nova eruption is ejected into the interstellar medium (ISM). About 73% of Li in the Galactic ISM originates from novae and approximately 15%–20% of the entire Galaxy. This means that novae are the important source of Li in the Galaxy.

总结: 
本研究探讨了在相对论性高温未磁化电子-正电子等离子体中传播的无碰撞激波。我们估计了相对论热等离子体中激波的耗散比例，表明即使激波不是高度相对论性，耗散也足够大，可以解释伽马射线暴的观测结果。通过二维粒子在格模拟表明，与冷上游等离子体不同，在模拟时间内激波前面的韦贝尔不稳定性产生了磁场，然而没有粒子被加速。在热等离子体情况下，下游区域中磁场的衰减速度与激波速度较慢。基于下游磁场的缓慢衰减，我们提出了一个模型，用于在大范围下游区域生成磁场，这是伽马射线暴余辉的标准模型所要求的。 <div>
In this work, we investigate collisionless shocks propagating in a relativistically hot unmagnetized electron–positron plasma. We estimate the dissipation fraction at shocks in the relativistically hot plasma, showing that it is sufficiently large to explain the observation of gamma-ray bursts even when the shock is not highly relativistic. It is shown by two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations that magnetic fields are generated around the shock front by the Weibel instability, as in the cold upstream plasma. However, in contrast to the cold upstream plasma, no particles are accelerated at the shock in the simulation time of . The decay of the magnetic field in the downstream region is slower for slower shock velocities in the hot plasma cases. Applying the slow decay of the downstream magnetic field, we propose a model that generates magnetic fields in the large downstream region, which is required from the standard model of the gamma-ray burst afterglow.

Energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) from the heliosphere are a unique means to remotely image the boundary regions of our heliosphere. The Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) has been very successful in measuring these ENAs since 2008 at energies from tens of eV to 6 keV. The main question raised by one solar cycle of IBEX-Lo observations at 0.05–2 keV is the strong and ubiquitous underestimation of several model predictions compared with actually measured ENA intensities at energies between 100 and 500 eV. This study converts the observed ENA intensities into plasma pressures for different sky directions and considers the implications for our understanding of the heliosheath and the source of the observed ENAs.

We present ultraviolet/optical/near-infrared observations and modeling of Type II supernovae (SNe II) whose early time (δt < 2 days) spectra show transient, narrow emission lines from shock ionization of confined (r < 1015 cm) circumstellar material (CSM). The observed electron-scattering broadened line profiles (i.e., IIn-like) of H i, He i/ii, C iv, and N iii/iv/v from the CSM persist on a characteristic timescale (tIIn) that marks a transition to a lower-density CSM and the emergence of Doppler-broadened features from the fast-moving SN ejecta. Our sample, the largest to date, consists of 39 SNe with early time IIn-like features in addition to 35 “comparison” SNe with no evidence of early time IIn-like features, all with ultraviolet observations. The total sample includes 50 unpublished objects with a total of 474 previously unpublished spectra and 50 multiband light curves, collected primarily through the Young Supernova Experiment and Global Supernova Project collaborations. For all sample objects, we find a significant correlation between peak ultraviolet brightness and both tIIn and the rise time, as well as evidence for enhanced peak luminosities in SNe II with IIn-like features. We quantify mass-loss rates and CSM density for the sample through the matching of peak multiband absolute magnitudes, rise times, tIIn, and optical SN spectra with a grid of radiation hydrodynamics and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium radiative-transfer simulations. For our grid of models, all with the same underlying explosion, there is a trend between the duration of the electron-scattering broadened line profiles and inferred mass-loss rate: (0.01 M⊙ yr−1)] days.

Low-surface-brightness galaxies are excellent laboratories, where stars and baryonic matter act as tracers of the gravitational potential of the dark matter halo. If dark matter is modeled as a perfect fluid, then spherically symmetric and static dark matter halos in hydrostatic equilibrium demand that dark matter should have an intrinsic pressure that counteracts the gravitational attraction that the dark matter halo exerts on itself. This static fluid (a dark-matter-dominated system, where the presence of baryons is negligible) has a specific equation of state for each rotational velocity profile of the stars in galaxies. In this work, we study the dark matter equation of state needed for the self-gravitating object to produce a gravitational potential such that the tracers follow the universal rotational velocity profile for stars of spiral galaxies proposed by Persic et al. and analyze the properties of the self-gravitating structures that emerge from this equation of state. The resulting configurations explaining the observed rotational speeds are found to be unstable. We conclude that the halo is not in hydrostatic equilibrium, it is nonspherically symmetric, or it is not static if the universal velocity profile should be valid for fitting the rotational velocity curve of the galaxies.

Updated plots of the final run of the comparison of the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) and Cepheid distances with metallicity, as seen in the lower panels of Figures 1 and 2 in the published article, are shown in the composite figure given here (Figure 1). The main conclusion of the published article, that there is no statistically significant correlation of the zero-point of the Cepheid period–luminosity relation with metallicity, is unchanged. The updated “statistically flat” regression is now found to be Δμo(Cepheid − TRGB) = −0.028 (±0.019) × ([O/H] − 8.50) − 0.014 (±0.042).

Omega Centauri (ω Cen) is the most massive globular cluster of the Milky Way. It is thought to be the nucleus of an accreted dwarf galaxy because of its high mass and its complex stellar populations. To decipher its formation history and study its dynamics, we created the most comprehensive kinematic catalog for its inner region, by analyzing both archival and new Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data. Our catalog contains 1,395,781 proper-motion measurements out to the half-light radius of the cluster ( ) and down to mF625W ≈ 25 mag. The typical baseline for our proper-motion measurements is 20 yr, leading to a median 1D proper motion precision of ∼11 μas yr−1 for stars with mF625W ≈ 18 mag, with even better precision (∼6.6 μas yr−1) achieved in the extensively observed centermost ( ) region. In addition to our astrometric measurements, we also obtained precise HST photometry in seven filters spanning from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared. This allows detailed color–magnitude diagram studies and separation of the multiple stellar populations of the cluster. In this work, we describe the data reduction used to obtain both the photometric and the proper-motion measurements. We also illustrate the creation and the content of our catalog, which is made publicly available. Finally, we present measurements of the plane-of-sky rotation of ω Cen in the previously unprobed inner few arcminutes and a precise measurement of the inclination, i = 43.°9 ± 1.°3.

<div> NGC 7789, M67, blue straggler stars, barium abundances, asymptotic-giant-branch mass transfer
<br />
这项研究调查了NGC 7789（年龄1.6亿年）和M67（年龄4亿年）两个开放星团中蓝跳巨星中钡（Ba）的丰度，作为巨星分支的质量转移的标志。研究结合了之前对NGC 6819（年龄2.5亿年）和NGC 188（年龄7亿年）的钡丰度分析。在研究的35颗BSSs中，43% ± 11%的星体富集了钡，而NGC 188中的BSSs没有富集钡。富集了钡的BSSs的丰度与星团的年龄呈反相关，从NGC 7789中的钡富集约为[Ba/Fe]∼+1.5 dex到M67中的约为[Ba/Fe]∼+1.0 dex。富集了钡的BSSs都位于H-R图的相同区域，而与星团的年龄或距离主序转折点的距离无关。数据表明了AGB捐赠者质量和BSSs质量转移效率之间的关联，较小质量的AGB捐赠者倾向于进行更保守的质量转移。40% ± 16%的富集了钡的BSSs是具有小于5000天轨道周期的长周期光谱双星。那些表现出径向速度变化的富集了钡的BSSs表明通过风质量转移或风罗奇波溢出在宽双星中进行AGB质量转移。考虑到M67和NGC 188中BSSs的长轨道周期的普遍性以及在NGC 7789、NGC 6819和M67中富集了钡的频率，AGB质量转移可能是1亿年以上的开放星团中BSS形成的主要机制。 
<br />
总结: NGC 7789和M67中发现43%的蓝跳巨星富集了钡，这与星团年龄呈反相关。AGB捐赠者的质量与BSSs质量转移的效率呈关联，而40%的富集了钡的BSSs是长周期光谱双星。AGB质量转移可能是1亿年以上开放星团中BSS形成的主要机制。 <div>
We investigate barium (Ba) abundances in blue straggler stars (BSSs) in two open clusters, NGC 7789 (1.6 Gyr) and M67 (4 Gyr), as signatures of asymptotic-giant-branch (AGB) mass transfer. We combine our findings with previous Ba abundance analyses of NGC 6819 (2.5 Gyr) and NGC 188 (7 Gyr). Out of 35 BSSs studied in NGC 7789, NGC 6819, and M67, 15 (43% ± 11%) are Ba enriched; no BSSs in NGC 188 are Ba enriched. The Ba abundances of enriched BSSs show an anticorrelation with cluster age, ranging from an enrichment of [Ba/Fe] ∼ +1.5 dex in NGC 7789 to [Ba/Fe] ∼ +1.0 dex in M67. The Ba-enriched BSSs all lie in the same region of the H-R diagram, irrespective of cluster age or distance from the main-sequence turnoff. Our data suggest a link between AGB donor mass and mass-transfer efficiency in BSSs, in that less massive AGB donors tend to undergo more conservative mass transfer. We find that 40% ± 16% of the Ba-enriched BSSs are in longer-period spectroscopic binaries with orbital periods less than 5000 days. Those Ba-enriched BSSs that do not exhibit radial-velocity variability suggest AGB mass transfer in wide binaries by either wind mass transfer or wind Roche-lobe overflow. Given the preponderance of long orbital periods in the BSSs of M67 and NGC 188 and the frequency of Ba enrichment in NGC 7789, NGC 6819, and M67, it may be that AGB mass transfer is the dominant mechanism of BSS formation in open clusters older than 1 Gyr.

这篇论文介绍了利用机器学习技术来增加具有多种金属元素的白矮星的数量。研究使用了来自Gaia DR3 BP/RP (XP)光谱的96,134颗白矮星，通过应用一种名为均匀流形近似和投影（UMAP）的无监督机器学习技术，将这些白矮星组织成可识别的光谱区域的2D地图。污染的白矮星是在地图中被识别出来的一个明显的光谱群体。研究表明，这种选择方法有潜力将已知白矮星大气中五种或更多金属物质的数量增加一个数量级。这些系统对于表征外行星的多样性和地质学是至关重要的。 
<br /><br />总结：本文介绍了利用机器学习技术增加白矮星的数量，通过分析96,134颗白矮星的光谱，并使用UMAP技术得出一个2D地图，将污染的白矮星从其他光谱区域中区分开来，这种选择方法有望将已知白矮星大气中五种或更多金属物质的数量增加一个数量级。 <div>
White dwarfs (WDs) polluted by exoplanetary material provide the unprecedented opportunity to directly observe the interiors of exoplanets. However, spectroscopic surveys are often limited by brightness constraints, and WDs tend to be very faint, making detections of large populations of polluted WDs difficult. In this paper, we aim to increase considerably the number of WDs with multiple metals in their atmospheres. Using 96,134 WDs with Gaia DR3 BP/RP (XP) spectra, we constructed a 2D map using an unsupervised machine-learning technique called Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) to organize the WDs into identifiable spectral regions. The polluted WDs are among the distinct spectral groups identified in our map. We have shown that this selection method could potentially increase the number of known WDs with five or more metal species in their atmospheres by an order of magnitude. Such systems are essential for characterizing exoplanet diversity and geology.

<br />总结:<br />本研究对LIGO-Virgo网络第三次观测期间的所有双黑洞事件进行了引力透镜特征的搜索，并采用多种方法进行了分析。通过针对亚阈信号的有针对性搜索、对信号的内在参数和天空位置的重叠度计算、对信号的频谱图相似性的比较以及考虑选择效应和天体物理知识的双信号贝叶斯分析等方式进行搜索，虽未发现明显的引力透镜迹象。最终，研究利用未发现引力波透镜效应对透镜率进行了限制，基于最新的合并率估计和暗物质由致密物体构成的分数。 <div>
Gravitational lensing by massive objects along the line of sight to the source causes distortions to gravitational wave (GW) signals; such distortions may reveal information about fundamental physics, cosmology, and astrophysics. In this work, we have extended the search for lensing signatures to all binary black hole events from the third observing run of the LIGO-Virgo network. We search for repeated signals from strong lensing by (1) performing targeted searches for subthreshold signals, (2) calculating the degree of overlap among the intrinsic parameters and sky location of pairs of signals, (3) comparing the similarities of the spectrograms among pairs of signals, and (4) performing dual-signal Bayesian analysis that takes into account selection effects and astrophysical knowledge. We also search for distortions to the gravitational waveform caused by (1) frequency-independent phase shifts in strongly lensed images, and (2) frequency-dependent modulation of the amplitude and phase due to point masses. None of these searches yields significant evidence for lensing. Finally, we use the nondetection of GW lensing to constrain the lensing rate based on the latest merger-rate estimates and the fraction of dark matter composed of compact objects.

在这项研究中，研究人员利用UVCANDELS对0.5≤z≤3范围内约16,000个类似盘状星系的半光半径进行了测量。他们发现，在整个红移范围内，盘状星系的恒星质量-大小关系在紫外光学和光学区域的斜率不同，主要受到质量较大的星系（≳1010M⊙）的影响，这些星系也隶属于最富含尘埃的星系之一。研究结果与已有的文献一致，一般被解释为星系内部的先内后外增长。然而，他们还指出这可能是因为质量较大的星系中心区域的遮挡作用更强。通过对VELA模拟组中z=2的星系进行建模和选择，研究人员表明，仅仅是尘埃的影响就能解释在z=2时所测得的大小差异。这表明在不同波长下，大小差异和恒星质量-大小关系的不同斜率并不构成星系内部先内后外增长的证据。<br /><br />总结: 这项研究利用UVCANDELS对类似盘状星系的大小进行测量，发现在不同波长下的大小差异以及恒星质量-大小关系的不同斜率并不构成星系内部先内后外增长的证据。这些差异可能仅仅是由尘埃的影响造成的。 <div>
We use the Ultraviolet Imaging of the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey fields (UVCANDELS) to measure half-light radii in the rest-frame far-UV for ∼16,000 disk-like galaxies over 0.5 ≤ z ≤ 3. We compare these results to rest-frame optical sizes that we measure in a self-consistent way and find that the stellar mass–size relation of disk galaxies is steeper in the rest-frame UV than in the optical across our entire redshift range. We show that this is mainly driven by massive galaxies (≳1010M⊙), which we find to also be among the most dusty. Our results are consistent with the literature and have commonly been interpreted as evidence of inside-out growth wherein galaxies form their central structures first. However, they could also suggest that the centers of massive galaxies are more heavily attenuated than their outskirts. We distinguish between these scenarios by modeling and selecting galaxies at z = 2 from the VELA simulation suite in a way that is consistent with UVCANDELS. We show that the effects of dust alone can account for the size differences we measure at z = 2. This indicates that, at different wavelengths, size differences and the different slopes of the stellar mass–size relation do not constitute evidence for inside-out growth.

High-redshift (z > 3) γ-ray blazars are rare, but they are crucial for our understanding of jet evolution, γ-ray production and propagation, and the growth of supermassive black holes in the early Universe. A new analysis of Fermi-LAT data reveals a significant (5σ), spectrally soft (Γ ≃ 3.0) γ-ray source in a specific 4 month epoch, cospatial with PKS 0201+113 (z = 3.64). Monitoring of PKS 0201+113 at 15 GHz by the Owens Valley Radio Observatory 40 m telescope from 2008 to 2023 shows a prominent flare that dominates the radio light curve. The maximum of the radio flare coincides with the γ-ray flare, strongly suggesting an association (p-value = 0.023) between the γ-ray and the radio sources. PKS 0201+113 is only the third γ-ray blazar to be identified with z > 3.5, and it is the first such object to be identified by the detection of quasi-simultaneous γ-ray and radio flares. The jet properties of this peculiar blazar have been investigated. A detailed study of a two-zone leptonic model is presented that fits the broadband spectral energy distribution. An alternative scenario is also briefly discussed.

We estimate the absolute age of the globular cluster NGC 3201 using 10,000 sets of theoretical isochrones constructed through Monte Carlo simulation using the Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Program. These isochrones take into consideration the uncertainty introduced by the choice of stellar evolution parameters. We fit isochrones with three detached eclipsing binaries and obtained an age independent of distance. We also fit isochrones with differential reddening corrected Hubble Space Telescope photometry data utilizing two different Hess diagram-based fitting methods. Results from three different methods analyzing two different types of data agree to within 1σ, and we find the absolute age of NGC 3201 = 11.85 ± 0.74 Gyr. We also perform a variable importance analysis to study the uncertainty contribution from individual parameters, and we find the distance is the dominant source of uncertainty in photometry-based analysis, while total metallicity, helium abundance, α-element abundance, mixing length, and treatment of helium diffusion are an important source of uncertainties for all three methods.

<br />总结:
太阳极区的经向流动对太阳的磁场结构和强度以及太阳活动周期起着重要作用。然而，关于太阳极区的经向流动仍不清楚。Hinode观测显示，极区的磁通量密度从较低的纬度向极点减小。使用表面磁通输运模型，我们模拟了全球径向磁场，以探索导致观测到的极区磁分布模式的物理过程。首次使用Hinode直接观测到的极区磁场高分辨率数据来约束模拟结果。我们的模拟重现了观测到的极区磁场的特性，表明太阳极区存在一个反向的经向流，其最大振幅约为3 m/s。 <div>
As a large-scale motion on the Sun, the meridional flow plays an important role in determining magnetic structure and strength and solar cycle. However, the meridional flow near the solar poles is still unclear. The Hinode observations show that the magnetic flux density in polar caps decreases from the lower latitudes to the poles. Using a surface flux transport model, we simulate the global radial magnetic field to explore the physical process leading to the observed polar magnetic distribution pattern. For the first time, the high-resolution observations of the polar magnetic fields observed by Hinode are used to directly constrain the simulation. Our simulation reproduces the observed properties of the polar magnetic fields, suggesting the existence of a counter-cell meridional flow in the solar polar caps with a maximum amplitude of about 3 m s−1.

We report the first time-dependent spectral atlas of a coronal mass ejection (CME) observed by the Hinode/Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS). EIS observed the Cartwheel CME on 2008 April 9 at 09:30–10:00 UT in its full wavelength range and captured the bright core containing prominence material as it passed across the slit field of view. The measurement of the differential emission measure (DEM) showed that the observation captured two plasma components, a coronal component at Log T ≈ 6.05 K and a cold component at Log T ≈ 5.30 K, which we interpret as the prominence material in the CME core. We used this DEM to develop a spectral atlas for the four EIS spectra containing the CME material and the pre- and postevent spectra. These observations provide the basis for studying CME plasma evolution in the low solar corona, as well as guide observations from the current and upcoming spectrometers, including Solar Orbiter/SPICE, Solar-C/EUVST, and MUSE, which will advance our understanding of CME plasma evolution.

<div> 关键词: ΛCDM, subhalo populations, Symfind, Rockstar, dark matter simulation

总结: 
ΛCDM理论意味着对亚星团种群特性的实际预测存在着困难，新的Symfind粒子跟踪亚星团发现者可以追踪亚星团到数量级较低的质量。相比常用的Rockstar和consistent-trees方法，Symfind可以发现更多的亚星团并且在分辨率提高时亚星团数量也增加。实验结果显示Rockstar在小亚星团计数上似乎已经收敛。此外，研究还发现Rockstar对于亚星团质量函数、径向分布和破裂质量存在假解。Symfind可以追踪已解决的亚星团直至典型星系破裂点，而无需后期孤儿模型。作者还公开发布了Symfind在Symphony模拟套件中的目录和粒子数据。  <div>
A major question in ΛCDM is what this theory actually predicts for the properties of subhalo populations. Subhalos are difficult to accurately simulate and to find within simulations, and this propagates into uncertainty in theoretical predictions for satellite galaxies. We present Symfind, a new particle-tracking-based subhalo finder, and demonstrate that it can track subhalos to orders-of-magnitude lower masses than commonly used halo-finding tools, with a focus on Rockstar and consistent-trees. These longer survival times mean that at a fixed peak subhalo mass, we find ≈ 15%–40% more subhalos within the virial radius, Rvir, and ≈35%–120% more subhalos within Rvir/4 in the Symphony dark-matter-only simulation suite. More subhalos are found as the resolution is increased, in contrast to the Rockstar halo finder, which appears to be converged at smaller subhalo counts. We perform extensive numerical testing. In agreement with idealized simulations, we show that the , the maximum circular velocity, is systematically biased low until high resolutions (npeak ≳ 3 × 104) are achieved, but that mass loss itself can be resolved at much more modest resolutions (npeak ≳ 4 × 103). We show that Rockstar converges to false solutions for the mass function, radial distribution, and disruption masses of subhalos. We argue that our new method can trace resolved subhalos until the point of typical galaxy disruption without invoking post hoc orphan modeling. We outline a concrete set of steps for determining whether other subhalo finders meet the same criteria. We publicly release Symfind catalogs and particle data for the Symphony simulation suite at http://web.stanford.edu/group/gfc/symphony.

总结: 研究发现太阳辐射中存在薄的细胞样结构spicules，通过多波段观测证实着这些spicules是多温性质，一些向上流动的spicules温度达到对应的过渡区和日冕温度，而向下流动的spicules显示日冕到色球温度的等离子运动。同时还观察到了轨迹呈抛物线状的序列上流和下流运动，以及相同空间位置上同时存在上行和下行运动。此外，利用协调的接口区成像光谱仪(IRIS)观测结果表明，在过渡区和色球存在红移/下流的时空分布，暗示观测到的一部分强红移/下流是由于日球上空流的等离子体的返回。<br /> <div>
Spicules are the thin hair/grass-like structures that are prominently observed at the chromospheric solar limb. It is believed that fibrils and rapid blueshifted and redshifted excursions (RBEs and RREs; collectively referred to as REs) correspond to on-disk counterparts of type I spicules and type II spicules, respectively. Our investigation focuses on observing the response of these REs alongside similar spectral features in the chromosphere, transition region (TR), and corona, utilizing space–time plots derived from coordinated observations from the Swedish 1 m Solar Telescope/Hα, Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS), and Solar Dynamics Observatory. Our analysis reveals upflowing REs, promptly reaching temperatures characteristic of the TR and corona, indicating a multithermal nature. Similarly, downflowing features exhibiting similar spectral signatures over the disk display plasma motion from the corona to chromospheric temperatures, demonstrating a multithermal nature. In addition to distinct upflows and downflows, we observe sequential upflow and downflow along the same path, depicting a distinctive parabolic trajectory in space–time plots of observations sampling TR and various coronal passbands. Similar to isolated upflows and downflows, these REs also exhibit a multithermal nature throughout their trajectory. Furthermore, our results reveal a more intricate motion of the REs in which both upflow and downflow coexist at the same spatial location. On a different note, our analysis, utilizing coordinated IRIS spectral observations, shows spatiotemporal redshifts/downflows in both the TR and chromosphere, suggesting that at least subsets of the strong redshifts/downflows observed in TR temperature spectra result from the return from the upper atmosphere flow of plasma in the form of bundles of spicules or features exhibiting similar spectra.

<div> Monte Carlo Physarum Machine, cosmic web filaments, IllustrisTNG, galaxy formation, quenching<br />
新方法识别宇宙网状结构，使用Monte Carlo Physarum Machine密度场估计，优于Delaunay tessellation方法。90%的星系位于纤维轴附近，而且星系的形成与周围的纤维密度有关。质量较小的星系更容易受到纤维的影响。总结:<br /><br /> <div>
We present a novel approach for identifying cosmic web filaments within the DisPerSE structure identification framework, using cosmic density field estimates from the Monte Carlo Physarum Machine (MCPM), inspired by the slime mold organism. We apply our method to the IllustrisTNG (TNG100) cosmological simulations and investigate the impact of filaments on galaxies. The MCPM density field is superior to the Delaunay tessellation field estimator in tracing the true underlying matter distribution and allows filaments to be identified with higher fidelity, finding more low-prominence/diffuse filaments. Using our new filament catalogs, we find that ≳90% of galaxies are located within ∼1.5 Mpc of a filamentary spine, with little change in the median star formation activity with distance to the nearest filament. Instead, we uncover a differential effect of the local filament line density, Σfil (MCPM)—the total MCPM overdensity per unit length along a filament segment—on galaxy formation: most galaxies are quenched and gas-poor near high-line density filaments at z ≤ 1. At earlier times, the filamentary environment appears to have no effect on galactic gas supply and quenching. At z = 0, quenching in galaxies is mainly driven by mass, while lower-mass galaxies are significantly affected by the filament line density. Satellites are far more susceptible to filaments than centrals. The local environments of massive halos are not sufficient to account for the effect of filament line density on gas removal and quenching. Our new approach holds great promise for observationally identifying filaments from galaxy surveys such as SDSS and DESI.

<br /><br />总结:
这项研究调查了火星大气和挥发性进化航天器上的Langmuir探测和波仪器所检测到的短脉冲。研究旨在通过对2015年记录的36万个中频爆发电场波形的统计分析，确定和分析这些瞬态脉冲的特征。研究使用自动例行程序检测电场数据中的快速波动波形，包括偶极和单极配置中的超过12000个事件。研究发现，单极配置中大多数脉冲很可能是干扰而非尘埃冲击所致。研究主要集中在偶极观测上，这些观测主要包括通常与尘埃冲击相关的双极事件。在火星电离层中检测到了这些事件，航天器带负电时检测到的事件较少，最大高度为1200公里。在电离层之外，灰尘冲击信号的低检测率表明该行星最有可能是这些尘埃颗粒的来源。然而，从行星表面抬升尘埃颗粒至高空的物理过程尚不清楚，因此需要进一步调查以确定所观察到的信号可能不是由尘埃冲击产生的可能性。 <div>
This study investigates short (millisecond) pulses detected by the Langmuir Probe and Waves instrument on board the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution spacecraft. We present a statistical analysis of 360,000 medium-frequency burst electric field waveforms recorded in 2015; the study aims to identify and analyze the characteristics of these transient pulses. An automatic routine is used to detect waveforms with rapid fluctuations in the electric field data; this comprises over 12,000 events in the dipole and nearly 5000 in the monopole configurations. Our findings reveal that most of the pulses in monopole configuration are likely the result of interference rather than dust impacts. Our analysis mainly focuses on dipole observations, which predominantly consist of bipolar events typically associated with dust impacts. These events are mainly detected in the Martian ionosphere, where the spacecraft is negatively charged. Fewer events are recorded when the spacecraft is positively charged, with a maximum at an altitude of 1200 km. The low detection rate of dust impact signals outside the ionosphere suggests that the planet is the most probable source of these dust particles. However, the physical processes by which dust grains are lifted from the surface of the planet to high altitudes are not clear, and thus a possibility that the signals observed might not be generated by dust impacts remains for further investigation.

总结：<br /><br />这项研究开发了一个扩散生成模型，用于从星系中重建暗物质场。模型在CAMELS模拟套件上进行训练，可以预测给定恒星密度场的底层暗物质场的无偏后验分布，同时能够消除宇宙学和天体物理模型中的不确定性。这一模型的预测还具有泛化能力，能够泛化到比其训练数据大约500倍的模拟体积以及不同的星系形成模型。该研究为研究暗物质和星系分布之间的关系提供了新的方法。GitHub链接：https://github.com/victoriaono/variational-diffusion-cdm<br /> <div>
Galaxies are biased tracers of the underlying cosmic web, which is dominated by dark matter (DM) components that cannot be directly observed. Galaxy formation simulations can be used to study the relationship between DM density fields and galaxy distributions. However, this relationship can be sensitive to assumptions in cosmology and astrophysical processes embedded in galaxy formation models, which remain uncertain in many aspects. In this work, we develop a diffusion generative model to reconstruct DM fields from galaxies. The diffusion model is trained on the CAMELS simulation suite that contains thousands of state-of-the-art galaxy formation simulations with varying cosmological parameters and subgrid astrophysics. We demonstrate that the diffusion model can predict the unbiased posterior distribution of the underlying DM fields from the given stellar density fields while being able to marginalize over uncertainties in cosmological and astrophysical models. Interestingly, the model generalizes to simulation volumes ≈500 times larger than those it was trained on and across different galaxy formation models. The code for reproducing these results can be found at https://github.com/victoriaono/variational-diffusion-cdm✎.

We present wave and turbulence observations from the DSCOVR spacecraft during the 2017 September solar flare and coronal mass ejection (CME) events. On September 4–12, the spectral index within the magnetic field power spectral density inertial range was consistent with Kolmogorov −5/3. This is despite the 9 days being composed of a complex mix of different features, including solar flares, solar energetic particle events, and CMEs. When analyzing shorter time periods, the spectral index varies. For two days where there were consecutive CMEs, the index follows Kraichnan–Iroshinikov −3/2, while on two quiet days, it was a mixture of −1, −3/2, and −2. The inertial range spectral index taken over the entire 9 days hides or averages out spectral features that occur over shorter time periods. We use a more realistic estimate of the amount of Doppler shifting into the spacecraft frame a show that the break frequencies on most days were located close to the H+ cyclotron frequency. We present evidence of wave–wave modulation and suggest that lower-frequency waves in the solar wind can modulate the growth rates/propagation of ion cyclotron waves, providing a method to transfer energy in the solar wind to smaller scales. Furthermore, we suggest that the indices in the inertial range can be explained by combining containment due to wave generation/propagation and stochastic Brownian motion in the solar wind. When these two phenomena are equal, they combine to create a −3/2 index.

Any astrophysical object can, in principle, serve as a probe of the interaction between dark matter (DM) and regular baryonic matter. This method is based on the potential observable consequences annihilations of captured DM have on the surface temperature of the object itself. In a series of previous papers we developed and validated simple analytic approximations for the total capture rates of DM valid in four distinct regions of the DM–nucleon scattering cross section (σ) versus DM particle mass (mX) parameter space. In this work, we summarize those previous results and extend them significantly by deriving a completely general closed-form solution for the total capture rate of DM in the multiscatter regime. Moreover, we demonstrate the existence of a region in the σ versus mX parameter space where the constraining power of any astrophysical object heated by annihilations of captured DM is lost. This corresponds to a maximal temperature (Tcrit) any astrophysical object can have, such that it can still serve as a DM probe. Any object with observed temperature Tobs > Tcrit loses its DM constraining power. We provide analytic formulae that can be used to estimate Tcrit for any object.

JWST observations demonstrate that supermassive black holes (SMBHs) exist by redshifts z ≳ 10, providing further evidence for “direct collapse” black hole (BH) formation, whereby massive (∼103–5M⊙) SMBH seeds are generated within a few million years as a byproduct of the rapid inflow of gas into the centers of protogalaxies. Here we analyze the intermediate “quasi-star” phase that accompanies some direct-collapse models, during which a natal BH accretes mass from and energetically sustains (through accretion) an overlying gaseous envelope. We argue that previous estimates of the maximum BH mass that can be reached during this stage, ∼1% of the total quasi-star mass, are unphysical, and arise from underestimating the efficiency with which energy can be transported outward from regions close to the BH. We construct new quasi-star models that consist of an inner, “saturated convection” region (which conforms to a convection-dominated accretion flow near the BH) matched to an outer, adiabatic envelope. These solutions exist up to a BH mass of ∼60% of the total quasi-star mass, at which point the adiabatic envelope contains only 2% of the mass (with the remaining ∼38% in the saturated-convection region), and this upper limit is reached within a time of 20–40 Myr. We conclude that quasi-stars remain a viable route for producing SMBHs at large redshifts, which is consistent with recent JWST observations.

研究发现Sgr A*的闪耀可能是由磁重联和冲击波导致的。模拟结果表明磁场线的重联会产生慢激波，加热等等。这些结果有助于解释星系黑洞吸积盘的瞬时亮度变化。 <div>
Sgr A* often shows bright, episodic flares observationally, but the mechanism of the flares' intermittent brightening is not very clear. Many people believe the flares may be formed by the nonthermal particles, which can be a consequence of the magnetic reconnection and shock waves. In this work, we use the larger magnetic loop in the presence of pseudo-Newtonian potential, which mimics general relativistic effects. The simulation results show that the reconnection of magnetic field lines passes through a current sheet, which bifurcates into two pairs of slow shocks. We also find the shock waves heat the plasma, especially when the plasma density is low. The shock wave heating effect by the magnetic reconnection is confirmed by the simulation results, and thus the process of instantaneous brightening of the flares on the accretion disk can be explained.

Stellar abundance measurements are subject to systematic errors that induce extra scatter and artificial correlations in elemental abundance patterns. We derive empirical calibration offsets to remove systematic trends with surface gravity in 17 elemental abundances of 288,789 evolved stars from the SDSS APOGEE survey. We fit these corrected abundances as the sum of a prompt process tracing core-collapse supernovae and a delayed process tracing Type Ia supernovae, thus recasting each star’s measurements into the amplitudes Acc and AIa and the element-by-element residuals from this two-parameter fit. As a first application of this catalog, which is 8× larger than that of previous analyses that used a restricted range, we examine the median residual abundances of 14 open clusters, nine globular clusters, and four dwarf satellite galaxies. Relative to field Milky Way disk stars, the open clusters younger than 2 Gyr show ≈0.1−0.2 dex enhancements of the neutron-capture element Ce, and the two clusters younger than 0.5 Gyr also show elevated levels of C+N, Na, S, and Cu. Globular clusters show elevated median abundances of C+N, Na, Al, and Ce, and correlated abundance residuals that follow previously known trends. The four dwarf satellites show similar residual abundance patterns despite their different star formation histories, with ≈0.2–0.3 dex depletions in C+N, Na, and Al and ≈0.1 dex depletions in Ni, V, Mn, and Co. We provide our catalog of corrected APOGEE abundances, two-process amplitudes, and residual abundances, which will be valuable for future studies of abundance patterns in different stellar populations and of additional enrichment processes that affect galactic chemical evolution.

本研究使用VLBA对3C 84的parsec尺度喷流进行观测，发现自2003年以来，C3成分的视向速度基本保持在0.259 ± 0.003c。此外，还观测到从C3中出现了四个新的次成分，每个都表现出比C3更高的视向速度，其中最快的成分表现出超光速运动。研究表明，仅仅是观测角度的改变无法解释新次成分的快速视向速度，这表明它们本质上比C3更快。可能的物理机制包括喷流进动（或重定向）、喷流与云的碰撞以及磁重新连接。<br /><br /> <div>
We present the kinematics of the parsec-scale jet in 3C 84 from 2003 November to 2022 June observed with the Very Long Baseline Array at 43 GHz. We find that the C3 component, a bright feature at the termination region of the jet component ejected from the core in 2003, has maintained a nearly constant apparent velocity of 0.259 ± 0.003c over the period covered by observations. We observe the emergence of four new subcomponents from C3, each exhibiting apparent speeds higher than that of C3. Notably, the last two subcomponents exhibit apparent superluminal motion, with the fastest component showing an apparent speed of 1.22 ± 0.14c. Our analysis suggests that a change in viewing angle alone cannot account for the fast apparent speeds of the new subcomponents, indicating that they are intrinsically faster than C3. We identify jet precession (or reorientation), a jet–cloud collision, and magnetic reconnection as possible physical mechanisms responsible for the ejection of the new subcomponents.

在模拟重元素核合成过程中，对尚未测量的核性质需要进行输入。这些偏移稳定性核性质数值的不确定性会传播到元素和同位素丰度的预测中。针对任何给定的天体物理爆炸，都会有许多不同的轨迹，即，流出物质所经历的温度和密度历史，因此不同的核性质可能会发挥作用。研究来自黑洞吸积盘的46万条轨迹的复合核合成结果，发现仅由于未知核性质而导致的元素预测的差异性因素为几。分析核变化引起的模型预测相对差异，得出结论，这些不确定性可以归因于丰度模式中给定区域的性质组合。我们计算了质量变化和丰度变化之间的交叉相关性，展示了参与核的性质变化可能会如何被探索。我们的结果进一步推动了在现代实验设施上对个别短寿命中子丰富同位素的多个数量进行测量。

The simulation of heavy element nucleosynthesis requires input from yet-to-be-measured nuclear properties. The uncertainty in the values of these off-stability nuclear properties propagates to uncertainties in the predictions of elemental and isotopic abundances. However, for any given astrophysical explosion, there are many different trajectories, i.e., temperature and density histories, experienced by outflowing material, and thus different nuclear properties can come into play. We consider combined nucleosynthesis results from 460,000 trajectories from a black hole accretion disk and find the spread in elemental predictions due solely to unknown nuclear properties to be a factor of a few. We analyze this relative spread in model predictions due to nuclear variations and conclude that the uncertainties can be attributed to a combination of properties in a given region of the abundance pattern. We calculate a cross-correlation between mass changes and abundance changes to show how variations among the properties of participating nuclei may be explored. Our results provide further impetus for measurements of multiple quantities on individual short-lived neutron-rich isotopes at modern experimental facilities.

Accretion physics has become more important recently due to the detection of the first horizon-scale images of the supermassive black holes of M 87* and Sgr A* by the Event Horizon Telescope. General relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of magnetized accretion flows onto a Kerr black hole have been used to interpret them. However, further testing the theory of gravity by using horizon-scale images requires performing consistent GRMHD simulations in non-Kerr spacetime. In this paper, we revisited the hydrodynamical equilibrium solution of the Fishbone and Moncrief (FM) torus that can be used to study any stationary, axisymmetric, vacuum, or nonvacuum spacetime. Further, we check the stability of the FM torus in non-Kerr spacetime by general relativistic hydrodynamic simulations. We find that FM torus in non-Kerr spacetime is indeed stable under long-term evolution. We conclude that the generalized FM torus solution would be very useful for creating new GRMHD libraries in extended Kerr black holes.

这项研究发现，流动的宇宙射线（CRs）会产生电阻电场，可以加速CR电离产生的次级电子。研究通过数值求解一维玻尔兹曼方程和欧姆定律，研究了次级电子能谱的演变。结果显示，加速的次级电子进一步电离气体，产生电子雪崩，导致气体的电离和激发增加。虽然电阻电场比CR放电前要弱，但仍会微弱地加速次级电子。准稳态状态几乎不依赖于初始电阻电场，但取决于气体中的电子分数。在准稳态状态下，电子分数越高，电阻电场越大，能够电离气体的次级电子数量越多，导致更高的电离率。CR放电可以解释一些分子云中观察到的高电离率。 
<br /><br />总结: 这项研究发现了宇宙射线引起的电离现象，并通过数值模拟进行了深入研究。研究发现，加速的次级电子会导致气体的电离和激发增加，表现为电子雪崩现象。同时，准稳态状态下的电阻电场大小取决于气体中的电子分数，进而影响气体的电离率。这对于解释一些分子云中观察到的高电离率具有重要意义。 <div>
We recently found that streaming cosmic rays (CRs) induce a resistive electric field that can accelerate secondary electrons produced by CR ionization. In this work, we study the evolution of the energy spectrum of secondary electrons by numerically solving the one-dimensional Boltzmann equation and Ohm’s law. We show that the accelerated secondary electrons further ionize a gas, that is, an electron avalanche occurs, resulting in increased ionization and excitation of the gas. Although the resistive electric field becomes weaker than the one before the CR discharge, the weak resistive electric field weakly accelerates the secondary electrons. The quasi-steady state is almost independent of the initial resistive electric field but depends on the electron fraction in the gas. The resistive electric field in the quasi-steady state is larger for the higher electron fraction, which makes the number of secondary electrons that can ionize the gas larger, resulting in a higher ionization rate. The CR discharge could explain the high ionization rate that is observed in some molecular clouds.

总结: 
本文介绍了使用同步辐射自康普顿冷却（SSC）以及Klein-Nishina（KN）修正进行伽马射线暴（GRB）余辉建模的方法。通过提供一个公开可用的Python代码来计算康普顿Y参数并计算出KN修正后的余辉光谱和光变曲线，我们展示了新的光谱形态和其观测意义。此外，还讨论了KN修正如何解释一些GRB X射线余辉中观测到的硬谱和衰减速率较缓的现象。这一框架的目标是简化将SSC+KN修正引入相对论性爆发的多波段建模。 <div>
Multiwavelength modeling of the synchrotron radiation from relativistic transients such as gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows is a powerful means of exploring the physics of relativistic shocks and of deriving properties of the explosion, such as the kinetic energy of the associated relativistic outflows. Capturing the location and evolution of the synchrotron cooling break is critical to break parameter degeneracies associated with such modeling. However, the shape of the spectrum above the cooling break, as well as the location and evolution of the break itself can be significantly altered by synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) cooling. We present an observer’s guide to applying SSC cooling with and without Klein–Nishina (KN) corrections to GRB afterglow modeling. We provide a publicly available Python code to calculate the Compton Y-parameter as a function of electron Lorentz factor, from which we compute changes to the electron distribution, along with KN-corrected afterglow spectra and light curves. In this framework, the canonical synchrotron spectral shapes split into multiple subregimes. We summarize each new spectral shape and describe its observational significance. We discuss how KN corrections can account for harder spectra and shallower decline rates observed in some GRB X-ray afterglows. Our overall aim is to provide an easy application of SSC+KN corrections into analytical multiwavelength modeling frameworks for relativistic transients.

Primordial black holes (PBHs), theorized to have originated in the early Universe, are speculated to be a viable form of dark matter. If they exist, they should be detectable through photometric and astrometric signals resulting from gravitational microlensing of stars in the Milky Way. Population Synthesis for Compact-object Lensing Events, or PopSyCLE, is a simulation code that enables users to simulate microlensing surveys, and is the first of its kind to include both photometric and astrometric microlensing effects, which are important for potential PBH detection and characterization. To estimate the number of observable PBH microlensing events, we modify PopSyCLE to include a dark matter halo consisting of PBHs. We detail our PBH population model, and demonstrate our PopSyCLE + PBH results through simulations of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment-IV (OGLE-IV) and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman) microlensing surveys. We provide a proof-of-concept analysis for adding PBHs into PopSyCLE, and thus include many simplifying assumptions, such as fDM, the fraction of dark matter composed of PBHs, and , mean PBH mass. Assuming M⊙, we find ∼3.6fDM times as many PBH microlensing events than stellar evolved black hole events, a PBH average peak Einstein crossing time of ∼91.5 days, estimate on order of 102fDM PBH events within the 8 yr OGLE-IV results, and estimate Roman to detect ∼1000fDM PBH microlensing events throughout its planned microlensing survey.

总结: 
太阳光球的磁力线磁图是太阳物理研究的重要基础，本文介绍了一种名为SuperSynthIA的学习方法，该方法利用SDO/HMI的Stokes偏振图像作为输入，模拟Hinode/SOT-SP管道的反演和消歧输出。与之前的方法相比，SuperSynthIA提供了物理上可用的矢量磁图，并减轻了不合理的角度喜好和SynthIA中的带状伪影。SuperSynthIA数据在低信号区域噪声更少，并且显示出与SDO/HMI记录的磁场演变一致。文章还讨论了SuperSynthIA的局限性和已知伪影，并展示了一系列评估来测试SuperSynthIA，表明其输出已经可以供社区使用，同时学习方法适用于物理上可用的磁图。 <div>
Vector magnetograms of the Sun’s photosphere are cornerstones for much of solar physics research. These data are often produced by data-analysis pipelines combining per-pixel Stokes polarization vector inversion with a disambiguation that resolves an intrinsic 180° ambiguity. We introduce a learning-based method, SuperSynthIA, that produces full-disk vector magnetograms from Stokes vector observations. As input, SuperSynthIA uses Stokes polarization images from Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI). As output, SuperSynthIA simultaneously emulates the inversion and disambiguation outputs from the Hinode/Solar Optical Telescope-Spectro-Polarimeter (SOT-SP) pipeline. Our method extends our previous approach SynthIA with heliographic outputs as well as using an improved data set and inference method. SuperSynthIA provides a new tool for improved magnetic fields from full-disk SDO/HMI observations using information derived from the enhanced capabilities of Hinode/SOT-SP. Compared to our previous SynthIA, SuperSynthIA provides physics-ready vector magnetograms and mitigates unphysical angle preferences and banding artifacts in SynthIA. SuperSynthIA data are substantially more temporally consistent than those from the SDO/HMI pipeline, most notably seen in, e.g., evolving active regions. SuperSynthIA substantially reduces noise in low-signal areas, resulting in less center-to-limb bias outside of strong-signal areas. We show that outputs from SuperSynthIA track the SDO/HMI-recorded evolution of the magnetic field. We discuss the limitations of SuperSynthIA that the user must understand, and we demonstrate a broad set of evaluations to test SuperSynthIA and discuss remaining known artifacts. Our tests provide both methodology and evidence that SuperSynthIA outputs are ready for use by the community, and that learning-based approaches are suitable for physics-ready magnetograms.

<div> Neutron stars, Black holes, X-ray binaries, M31, NuSTAR
<br /><br />总结:
使用NuSTAR进行硬X射线（E > 10 keV）观测，可以区分M31中X射线双星系统中的黑洞和中子星的星体类型。在M31盘的10次中等深度（20-50ks）观测中，检测到20个源，其中14个被认为是X射线双星系统。通过色-强度和色-色图分离出9个源，确定其中3个为黑洞，6个为中子星。此外，创建了X射线光度函数，并发现和之前的模型存在一致性。总体而言，这项研究提供了对M31中X射线双星系统的深入了解，显示出了它们的光度函数和星体类型之间的差异。 <div>
Using hard (E > 10 keV) X-ray observations with NuSTAR, we are able to differentiate between the accretion states, and thus compact object types, of neutron stars (NSs) and black holes (BHs) in X-ray binaries (XRBs) in M31, our nearest Milky Way–type neighbor. Using 10 moderate-depth (20–50 ks) observations of the disk of M31 covering a total of ∼0.45 deg2, we detect 20 sources at 2σ in the 4–25 keV bandpass, 14 of which we consider to be XRB candidates. This complements an existing, deeper (100–400 ks) survey covering ∼0.2 deg2 of the bulge and the northeastern disk. We make tentative classifications of nine of these sources with the use of diagnostic color–intensity and color–color diagrams, which separate sources into various NS and BH regimes, identifying three BHs and six NSs. In addition, we create X-ray luminosity functions (XLFs) for both the full (4–25 keV) and hard (12–25 keV) bands, as well as subpopulations of the full band based on compact object type and association with globular clusters. Our best-fit globular cluster XLF is shallower than the field XLF, and preliminary BH and NS XLFs suggest a difference in shape based on compact object type. We find that the cumulative disk XLFs in the full and hard band are best fit by power laws with indices of 1.32 and 1.28, respectively. This is consistent with models of the Milky Way XLF from Grimm et al., Voss & Ajello, and Doroshenko et al.

Stellar spin down is a critical yet poorly understood component of stellar evolution. In particular, results from the Kepler Mission imply that mature age, solar-type stars have inefficient magnetic braking, resulting in a stalled spin-down rate. However, a large number of precise asteroseismic ages are needed for mature (≥3 Gyr) stars in order to probe the regime where traditional and stalled spin-down models differ. In this paper, we present a new asteroseismic benchmark star for gyrochronology discovered using reprocessed Kepler short cadence data. KIC 11029516 (Papayu) is a bright (Kp = 9.6 mag) solar-type star with a well-measured rotation period (21.1 ± 0.8 days) from spot modulation using 4 yr of Kepler long-cadence data. We combine asteroseismology and spectroscopy to obtain Teff = 5888 ± 100 K, [Fe/H] = 0.30 ± 0.06 dex, M = 1.24 ± 0.05 M⊙, R = 1.34 ± 0.02 R⊙, and age of 4.0 ± 0.4 Gyr, making Papayu one of the most similar stars to the Sun in terms of temperature and radius with an asteroseismic age and a rotation period measured from spot modulation. We find that Papayu sits at the transition of where traditional and weakened spin-down models diverge. A comparison with stars of similar zero-age main-sequence temperatures supports previous findings that weakened spin-down models are required to explain the ages and rotation periods of old solar-type stars.

During cluster assembly, a cluster’s virialization process leaves behind signatures that can provide information on its dynamical state. However, no clear consensus yet exists on the best way to achieve this. Therefore, we attempt to derive improved recipes for classifying the dynamical states of clusters in observations using cosmological simulations. The cluster halo mass and their subhalos’ mass are used to 1014 M⊙ h−1 and 1010 M⊙ h−1 to calculate five independent dynamical state indicators. We experiment with recipes by combining two to four indicators for detecting specific merger stages, like recent and ancient mergers. These recipes are made by plotting merging clusters and a control sample of relaxed clusters in multiple-indicator parameter space, then applying a rotation matrix method to derive the best way to separate mergers from the control sample. The success of the recipe is quantified using the success rate and overlap percentage of the merger and control histograms along the newly rotated x-axis. This provides us with recipes using different numbers of combined indicators and for different merger stages. Among the recipes, the stellar mass gap and center offset are the first and second most dominant of the indicators, and using more indicators improves the effectiveness of the recipe. When applied to observations, our results show good agreement with literature values of cluster dynamical states.

During our spectroscopic survey of central stars of faint planetary nebulae (PNe), we found that the nucleus of Abell 57 exhibits strong nebular emission lines. Using synthetic narrowband images, we show that the emission arises from an unresolved compact emission knot (CEK) coinciding with the hot (90,000 K) central star. Thus Abell 57 belongs to the rare class of “EGB 6-type” PNe, characterized by dense emission cores. Photometric data show that the nucleus exhibits a near-infrared excess, due to a dusty companion body with the luminosity of an M0 dwarf but a temperature of ∼1800 K. Emission-line analysis reveals that the CEK is remarkably dense (electron density ∼ 1.6 × 107 cm−3), and has a radius of only ∼4.5 au. The CEK suffers considerably more reddening than the central star, which itself is more reddened than the surrounding PN. These puzzles may suggest an interaction between the knot and central star; however, Hubble Space Telescope imaging of EGB 6 itself shows that its CEK lies more than ∼125 au from the PN nucleus. We discuss a scenario in which a portion of the asymptotic giant branch wind that created the PN was captured into a dust cloud around a distant stellar companion; this cloud has survived to the present epoch, and has an atmosphere photoionized by radiation from the hot central star. However, in this picture EGB 6-type nuclei should be relatively common, yet they are actually extremely rare; thus they may arise from a different transitory phenomenon. We suggest future observations of Abell 57 that may help unravel its mysteries.

核心坍缩超新星是大质量恒星的终结爆炸现象。其中，电子俘获超新星是略小质量恒星的爆炸现象，对于恒星演化理论的完善具有重要意义。研究发现，基于合适的爆发能量和星周介质分布，电子俘获超新星的合成光变曲线在图像上比铁核坍缩超新星更短、更亮、更蓝。通过采用多色观测方法，可以确定电子俘获超新星的特征。研究人员基于这一方法确定了SN 2018zd为电子俘获超新星，这被认为是利用现代观测技术发现的第一个电子俘获超新星。 <br /><br /> <div>
Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are the terminal explosions of massive stars. While most massive stars explode as iron-core-collapse supernovae (FeCCSNe), slightly less massive stars explode as electron-capture supernovae (ECSNe), shaping the low-mass end of CCSNe. ECSNe were proposed ∼40 yr ago and first-principles simulations also predict their successful explosions. Observational identification and investigation of ECSNe are important for the completion of stellar evolution theory. To date, only one promising candidate has been proposed, SN 2018zd, other than the historical progenitor of the Crab Nebula, SN 1054. We present representative synthetic light curves of low-mass FeCCSNe and ECSNe, i.e., with theoretically or observationally plausible explosion energies and distributions of circumstellar media (CSM). The ECSNe have shorter, brighter, and bluer plateaus than the FeCCSNe. To investigate the robustness of their intrinsic differences, we also calculated light curves of ECSNe and low-mass FeCCSNe adopting various explosion energies and CSM. Although they may have similar bolometric light-curve plateaus, ECSNe are bluer than FeCCSNe in the absence of strong CSM interaction, illustrating that multicolor observations are essential to identify ECSNe. This provides a robust indicator of ECSNe because the bluer plateaus stem from the low-density envelopes of their super-asymptotic-giant-branch progenitors. We propose a distance-independent method to identify ECSNe: , i.e., blue g – r at the middle of the plateau , where tPT is the transition epoch from plateau to tail. Using this method, we identified SN 2018zd as an ECSN, which we believe to be the first ECSN identified with modern observing techniques.

<br />总结:
该研究分析了59个太阳活跃区的磁极性倒转线上未中和电流的总量，并观察到总未中和电流INN,tot的时间序列呈现出明显的峰谷结构。与垂直电流Iz的时间序列相比，INN,tot呈现出更为复杂的结构。具有δ-斑的活跃区表现出更高的磁通量出现速率和INN,tot增加率。开发了自动检测算法来确定非中和电流的注入事件，发现随着活跃区复杂度的增加，注入速率和持续时间均增加，δ-斑的活跃区表现出最强和最长的事件。这些事件并不一定与磁通量的增加同时发生，尽管它们存在适度的相关性。研究得出结论，电流在磁通量出现过程中被注入，但也受到活跃区演化的极大影响。 <div>
We study the evolution of electric currents during the emergence of magnetic flux in the solar photosphere and the differences exhibited between solar active regions of different Hale complexity classes. A sample of 59 active regions was analyzed using a method based on image segmentation and error analysis to determine the total amount of nonneutralized electric current along their magnetic polarity inversion lines. The time series of the total unsigned nonneutralized electric current, INN,tot, exhibit intricate structure in the form of distinct peaks and valleys. This information is largely missing in the respective time series of the total unsigned vertical electric current Iz. Active regions with δ-spots stand out, exhibiting a 1.9 times higher flux emergence rate and 2.6 times higher INN,tot increase. The median value of their peak INN,tot is equal to 3.6 × 1012 A, which is more than three times higher than that of the other regions of the sample. An automated detection algorithm was also developed to pinpoint the injection events of nonneutralized electric current. The injection rates and duration of these events were higher with increasing complexity of active regions, with regions containing δ-spots exhibiting the strongest and longest events. These events do not necessarily coincide with increasing magnetic flux, although they exhibit moderate correlation. We conclude that net electric currents are injected during flux emergence but are also shaped drastically by the incurred photospheric evolution as active regions grow and evolve.

总结:<br /><br />Abell 1758是一个由两个结构A1758N和A1758S组成的星系团，它们之间存在一个未被发现的桥梁。文章通过N体流体动力学模拟探讨了不同的轨道探测方式，并发现了轨道接近的模拟方案与观测数据相吻合。其中，切向接近的方案表现出最佳匹配。模拟结果在X射线图像中显示出可检测的桥梁，但过估了X射线过量。这项研究的结论对理解星系团之间的相互作用具有重要意义。 <div>
Abell 1758 (z ∼ 0.278) is a galaxy cluster composed of two structures, A1758N and A1758S, separated by ∼2.2 Mpc. The northern cluster is itself a dissociative merging cluster that has already been modeled by dedicated simulations. Recent radio observations revealed the existence of a previously undetected bridge connecting A1758N and A1758S. New simulations are now needed to take into account the presence of A1758S. We wish to evaluate which orbital configuration would be compatible with a bridge between the clusters. Using N-body hydrodynamical simulations that build upon the previous model, we explore different scenarios that could have led to the current observed configuration. Five types of orbital approaches were tested: radial, tangential, vertical, postapocentric, and outgoing. We found that the incoming simulated scenarios are generally consistent with mild enhancements of gas density between the approaching clusters. The mock X-ray images exhibit a detectable bridge in all cases. Compared to measurements of Chandra data, the amplitude of the X-ray excess is overestimated by a factor of ∼2–3 in the best simulations. The scenario of tangential approach proved to be the one that best matches the properties of the profiles of X-ray surface brightness. The scenarios of radial approach of vertical approach are also marginally compatible.

这项研究使用大量宇宙模拟数据，探讨了暗暗物质质量对星系内部性质的影响。通过训练正常流模型学习参数后发现，即使给定宇宙学和天体物理参数的值，模型仍无法推断出暗暗物质质量的值。而模型可以从星系性质中推断出Ωm的值，精度约为10％，而对于暗暗物质质量与星系性质之间的相互信息几乎没有显著的依赖关系。<br /><br />总结: 暗暗物质质量对星系性质影响有限，正常流模型无法推断暗暗物质质量，但可以从星系性质中推断Ωm的值。 <div>
We study the impact of warm dark matter (WDM) mass on the internal properties of individual galaxies using a large suite of 1024 state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamic simulations from the DREAMS project. We take individual galaxies’ properties from the simulations, which have different cosmologies, astrophysics, and WDM masses, and train normalizing flows to learn the posterior of the parameters. We find that our models cannot infer the value of the WDM mass, even when the values of the cosmological and astrophysical parameters are given explicitly. This result holds for galaxies with stellar mass larger than 2 × 108M⊙h−1 at both low and high redshifts. We calculate the mutual information and find no significant dependence between the WDM mass and galaxy properties. On the other hand, our models can infer the value of Ωm with a ∼10% accuracy from the properties of individual galaxies while marginalizing astrophysics and WDM masses.

<div> 数值计算，二进制交互，气体盘，数值方法，收敛解<br />
总结：<br />
这项研究的目标是确定是否所有代码在数值上都能达成一致的解，并确定收敛所需的分辨率以及必须计算的二进制轨道数，以达到二进制-盘系统的一致放松状态。研究发现，多数代码在二进制组件附近需要大约二进制间距的1%才能达到对盘对二进制施加的力矩的收敛测量。对于我们的盘模型达到放松状态，代码必须至少运行200个二进制轨道，这相当于我们参数的一个粘性时间，即0.2(a^2ΩB/ν)个二进制轨道，其中ν为动力粘度。代码之间出现的最大差异来自设置的维度（3D与2D盘）。研究发现，在代码之间总扭矩上存在较好的一致性，尽管这种扭矩在引力扭矩、轨道吸积扭矩和自旋吸积扭矩之间的分配取决于采用的sink处方。与先前的研究相一致，我们发现2D和3D盘模型之间的扭矩和吸积变化方面存在适度差异。我们发现凹陷进动速率在3D中比在2D中明显更快。 <div>
We have performed numerical calculations of a binary interacting with a gas disk, using 11 different numerical methods and a standard binary−disk setup. The goal of this study is to determine whether all codes agree on a numerically converged solution and to determine the necessary resolution for convergence and the number of binary orbits that must be computed to reach an agreed-upon relaxed state of the binary−disk system. We find that all codes can agree on a converged solution (depending on the diagnostic being measured). The zone spacing required for most codes to reach a converged measurement of the torques applied to the binary by the disk is roughly 1% of the binary separation in the vicinity of the binary components. For our disk model to reach a relaxed state, codes must be run for at least 200 binary orbits, corresponding to about a viscous time for our parameters, 0.2(a2ΩB/ν) binary orbits, where ν is the kinematic viscosity. The largest discrepancies between codes resulted from the dimensionality of the setup (3D vs. 2D disks). We find good agreement in the total torque on the binary between codes, although the partition of this torque between the gravitational torque, orbital accretion torque, and spin accretion torque depends sensitively on the sink prescriptions employed. In agreement with previous studies, we find a modest difference in torques and accretion variability between 2D and 3D disk models. We find cavity precession rates to be appreciably faster in 3D than in 2D.

Strong gravitational lensing offers a powerful probe of the detailed distribution of matter in lenses, while magnifying and bringing faint background sources into view. Observed strong lensing by massive galaxy clusters, which are often in complex dynamical states, has also been used to map their dark matter (DM) substructures on smaller scales. Deep high-resolution imaging has revealed the presence of strong lensing events associated with these substructures, namely galaxy-scale sub-halos. However, an inventory of these observed galaxy–galaxy strong lensing (GGSL) events is noted to be discrepant with state-of-the-art ΛCDM simulations. Cluster sub-halos appear to be over-concentrated compared to their simulated counterparts yielding an order-of-magnitude higher value of GGSL. In this paper, we explore the possibility of resolving this observed discrepancy by redistributing the mass within observed cluster sub-halos in ways that are consistent within the ΛCDM paradigm of structure formation. Lensing mass reconstructions from data provide constraints on the mass enclosed within apertures and are agnostic to the detailed mass profile within them. Therefore, as the detailed density profile within cluster sub-halos currently remains unconstrained by data, we are afforded the freedom to redistribute the enclosed mass. We investigate if rearranging the mass to a more centrally concentrated density profile helps alleviate the GGSL discrepancy. We report that refitting cluster sub-halos to the ubiquitous ΛCDM-motivated Navarro–Frenk–White profile, and further modifying them to include significant baryonic components, does not resolve this tension. A resolution to this persisting GGSL discrepancy may require more careful exploration of alternative DM models.

这篇文章介绍了一种分析方法，通过控制注入和恢复实验，评估了解决(二氧化碳)光谱线数据的星周盘气体质量测量的方法。在数据质量足够的情况下，该方法对于大质量的盘( Md/M* = 0.1)表现良好，并能够恢复出真实值，且偏差小(≲20%)，不确定性在两倍标准差范围内。该方法还被用于阿塔卡马大型毫米/亚毫米阵列观测的MWC 480盘，测量得到了气体质量，并识别出与表面密度间隙相一致的动力学亚结构。这项研究表示这些动力学测量提供了足够精确和准确的新约束，以量化Md/M*分布的高端气体质量和表面密度，因此可以成为详细热化学模拟的关键基准。文章也讨论了未来工作的一些展望、各种警示和限制。 <br /><br />总结: 本研究介绍了一种通过控制注入和恢复实验评估解决光谱线数据的星周盘气体质量测量的方法，针对大质量盘(Md/M* = 0.1)的数据质量良好，且方法也被应用于实际观测，并展示了测量结果的准确性和对动力学的约束力。文章还讨论了未来工作的展望和一些限制。 <div>
Using controlled injection and recovery experiments, we devised an analysis prescription to assess the quality of dynamical measurements of protoplanetary disk gas masses based on resolved (CO) spectral line data, given observational limitations (resolution, sampling, noise), measurement bias, and ambiguities in the geometry and physical conditions. With sufficient data quality, this approach performed well for massive disks (Md/M* = 0.1): we inferred Md posteriors that recovered the true values with little bias (≲20%) and uncertainties within a factor of two (2σ). The gas surface density profiles for such cases are recovered with remarkable fidelity. Some experimentation indicates that this approach becomes insensitive when Md/M* ≲ 5%, due primarily to degeneracies in the surface density profile parameters. Including multiple lines that probe different vertical layers, along with some improvements in the associated tools, might push that practical boundary down by another factor of ∼two in ideal scenarios. We also demonstrated this analysis approach using archival Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array observations of the MWC 480 disk: we measured (corresponding to Md/M* = 7% ± 1%) and identified kinematic substructures consistent with surface density gaps around 65 and 135 au. Overall, this (and similar work) suggests that these dynamical measurements offer powerful new constraints with sufficient accuracy and precision to quantify gas masses and surface densities at the high end of the Md/M* distribution, and therefore can serve as key benchmarks for detailed thermo-chemical modeling. We address some prospects for improvements, and discuss various caveats and limitations to guide future work.

总结:
ω Centauri是银河系中最大质量的球状星团，被怀疑是一颗侵入银河系的矮星系的剥离核心。研究使用了新的Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer光谱和哈勃空间望远镜光度目录来调查该星团内部金属丰度分布及其空间变化。文章基于11,050颗成员星，发现[M/H]分布的中位数为(−1.614 ± 0.003) dex，分布范围约为1.37 dex，最金属丰富为−0.67 dex，最金属贫为−2.04 dex。此外，文章展示了该星团的染色体图，将红巨星分支星分为不同亚群，并分析了金属贫最组分的亚群。最后，文章发现在半光半径内没有金属丰度梯度，不同亚群混合程度较高。<br /><br /> <div>
ω Centauri, the most massive globular cluster in the Milky Way, has long been suspected to be the stripped nucleus of a dwarf galaxy that fell into the Galaxy a long time ago. There is considerable evidence for this scenario including a large spread in metallicity and an unusually large number of distinct subpopulations seen in photometric studies. In this work, we use new Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer spectroscopic and Hubble Space Telescope photometric catalogs to investigate the underlying metallicity distributions as well as the spatial variations of the populations within the cluster up to its half-light radius. Based on 11,050 member stars, the [M/H] distribution has a median of (−1.614 ± 0.003) dex and a large spread of ∼1.37 dex, reaching from −0.67 to −2.04 dex for 99.7% of the stars. In addition, we show the chromosome map of the cluster, which separates the red giant branch stars into different subpopulations, and analyze the subpopulations of the most metal-poor component. Finally, we do not find any metallicity gradient within the half-light radius, and the different subpopulations are well mixed.

本研究引入了质量超平面（MH），将恒星动力质量比（M⋆/Mdyn）重构为线性距离指示器。通过对最近FP研究的建立，我们展示了星形和静止星系都遵循相同的经验MH，然后利用这一指标对2496个红移小于0.12的星系样本测量奇异速度。根据模型独立地建模Q和SF星系，我们发现MH推导的距离/奇异速度估计的限制精度取决于大小的固有离散度，对于Q和SF星系来说大约为0.1 dex，当所有星系一起建模时约为0.11 dex，表明MH与FP一样出色。为了经验验证我们的框架和距离/奇异速度估计，我们比较利用Q或SF星系推导的与之前不可辨别的偏差或偏移的群体推断的距离。得到了约0.05 dex约12%的分散。<br /><br />总结: 本研究引入了质量超平面作为距离指示器，通过对星系样本测量奇异速度并比较不同星系派生的距离估计来验证了这一框架的有效性。研究结果表明MH与FP一样出色，并可以在未来的调查中得到进一步的改进。 <div>
Empirical correlations connecting starlight to galaxy dynamics (e.g., the fundamental plane (FP) of elliptical/quiescent (Q) galaxies and the Tully–Fisher relation of spiral/star-forming (SF) galaxies) provide cosmology-independent distance estimation and are central to local Universe cosmology. In this work, we introduce the mass hyperplane (MH), which is the stellar-to-dynamical mass relation (M⋆/Mdyn) recast as a linear distance indicator. Building on recent FP studies, we show that both SF and Q galaxies follow the same empirical MH, then use this to measure the peculiar velocities (PVs) for a sample of 2496 galaxies at z < 0.12 from GAMA. The limiting precision of MH-derived distance/PV estimates is set by the intrinsic scatter in size, which we find to be ≈0.1 dex for both Q and SF galaxies (when modeled independently) and ≈0.11 dex when all galaxies are modeled together, showing that the MH is as good as the FP. To empirically validate our framework and distance/PV estimates, we compare the inferred distances to groups as derived using either Q or SF galaxies. A good agreement is obtained with no discernible bias or offset, having a scatter of ≈0.05 dex ≈12% in distance. Further, we compare our PV measurements for the Q galaxies to the previous PV measurements of the galaxies in common between GAMA and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, which shows similarly good agreement. Finally, we provide comparisons of PV measurements made with the FP and the MH, then discuss possible improvements in the context of upcoming surveys such as the 4MOST Hemisphere Survey.

Drifts due to the gradients in, and curvatures of, the heliospheric magnetic field (HMF) play a significant role in the transport of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) in the heliosphere. Although this has been well studied for the Parker HMF, the influence of Fisk-type fields, with their unique geometry, has hitherto received less attention. Here, drift velocity profiles computed for a Schwadron–Parker hybrid field are compared with those for a purely Parkerian field. Furthermore, the influence of this field on GCR modulation, as computed with a 3D, ab initio, modulation model, is investigated. Globally, the differences between the computed intensities are small. Nevertheless, local measures, such as azimuthal variations in the GCR intensities, show a significant influence of the Schwadron–Parker hybrid field on GCR transport.

总结:
盘风模型用于研究活动星系核的外流，其中高能辐射会导致离子化问题。研究发现，辐射场属性依赖于位置，但不同场量的依赖性并不相同。平均强度的位置依赖性影响了气体的光学厚度，从而减轻了过度离子化问题。另外，对于垂直加速流动，由于辐射力的几何加权和平均强度的位置依赖性，导致辐射力不与辐射通量平行。这些发现为理解活动星系核的能量传输和气体动力学提供了重要线索。 <div>
In disk-wind models for active galactic nuclei outflows, high-energy radiation poses a significant problem wherein the gas can become overionized, effectively disabling what is often inferred to be the largest force acting on the gas: the radiation force due to spectral line opacity. Calculations of this radiation force depend on the magnitude of ionizing radiation, which can strongly depend on the position above a disk where the radiation is anisotropic. As our first step to quantify the position and direction dependence of the radiation field, we assumed free streaming of photons and computed energy distributions of the mean intensity and components of flux as well as energy-integrated quantities such as mean photon energy. We find a significant dependence of radiation-field properties on position, but this dependence is not necessarily the same for different field quantities. A key example is that the mean intensity is much softer than the radial flux at many points near the disk. Because the mean intensity largely controls ionization, this softening decreases the severity of the overionization problem. The position dependence of mean intensity implies the position dependence of gas opacity, which we illustrate by computing the radiation force a fluid element feels in an accelerating wind. We find that in a vertical accelerating flow, the force due to radiation is not parallel to the radiation flux. This misalignment is due to the force’s geometric weighting by both the velocity field’s directionality and the position dependence of the mean intensity.

<title>Why Observations at Mid-infrared Wavelengths Partially Mitigate M Dwarf Star Host Stellar Activity Contamination in Exoplanet Transmission Spectroscopy</title>

总结: 
本文讨论了围绕M矮星运转的外行星大气透射光谱学面临的挑战，特别是来自恒星磁特征（如斑和光斑）的污染。作者指出，在红外波长下进行观测可以部分减轻恒星污染的影响，因为在这些波长下，温度对光强度的敏感度减弱，从而减少了斑和光斑对光谱的影响。此外，作者还指出，在红外波长下，恒星的光谱特征会减弱，这是由于普朗克函数随温度呈线性变化的结果。外行星大气透射光谱特征的深度则主要由行星大气垂直尺度决定，并不会随波长基本变化。因此，在中红外波长下，恒星污染会减弱几倍，但是否足以规避恒星污染最终取决于斑点覆盖区域的大小。尽管如此，红外波长下热发射光谱特征的平坦化是普遍存在的。 <br /><br /> <div>
Exoplanet atmosphere transmission spectroscopy for planets orbiting M dwarf stars faces significant challenges due to contamination from stellar magnetic features, i.e., spots and faculae. These features make the stellar surface inhomogeneous and introduce wavelength-dependent signals in the transmission spectrum that complicate its analysis. We identify and explain why using observations at infrared wavelengths greater than a few microns partially mitigates stellar contamination. At these wavelengths the intensity sensitivity to temperature weakens, with two significant consequences. First, the contribution of spots and faculae has a diminished effect because their flux contrast to the quiet-star regions lessens. Second, the star’s spectral features compress in magnitude, an outcome of spectral features being shaped by the star’s photospheric vertical temperature gradient. Both factors are due to the Planck function moving from exponential to linear in temperature toward mid-infrared (mid-IR) wavelengths (the “Rayleigh–Jeans tail”). In contrast to stellar spectra, the depth of the transmission spectroscopy features does not fundamentally vary with wavelength as it is primarily determined by the planet’s atmospheric scale height. The magnitude of reduction in stellar contamination is a factor of a few to several at mid-IR versus near-IR wavelengths, but whether or not this is enough to bypass stellar contamination ultimately depends on the spot coverage area. Nonetheless, the flattening of thermal emission spectral features at IR wavelengths is universal.

Chew-Goldberger-Low系统描述了磁场中的双Maxwell等离子体，在太阳圈层和地球空间环境中经常观察到呈各向异性状态，具有明显不同的平行和垂直压力分量。CGL系统代表了对常见各向同性MHD模型的最简单的一阶修正，该模型仍允许融合后者的最理想特性。然而，CGL系统存在一些数值挑战：系统不是守恒形式，源项僵硬，并且与MHD不同，如果平行和垂直压力变得过于不同，它容易失去双曲性。通常的方法是使平行和垂直压力彼此靠近，但这通常是以一种临时的方式完成的。文章提出了一种基于偏角散射思想的压力松弛的物理资讯方法，该方法保持了数值系统的双曲性，并在等离子体β非常大的极限下自然地导致各向同性。因此，基于CGL方程的数值代码可以在任何磁场强度下牢固地运行，包括磁场接近零的极限。我们使用了几个严格的测试问题来演示我们的新算法的功能，这些问题提供了在弱碰撞和强碰撞极限下CGL方程的比较。这包括一个模拟冲击波与2D磁层环境相互作用的测试问题。<br /><br />总结: Chew-Goldberger-Low系统描述了具有各向异性的等离子体，该系统引入了一种基于偏角散射的物理资讯方法来解决数值挑战，保持系统的双曲性，并在等离子体β非常大的极限下自然地导致各向同性。作者使用了几个严格的测试问题来演示新算法的功能。 <div>
We present a new numerical model for solving the Chew–Goldberger–Low system of equations describing a bi-Maxwellian plasma in a magnetic field. Heliospheric and geospace environments are often observed to be in an anisotropic state with distinctly different parallel and perpendicular pressure components. The Chew–Goldberger–Low (CGL) system represents the simplest leading order correction to the common isotropic MHD model that still allows the incorporation of the latter’s most desirable features. However, the CGL system presents several numerical challenges: the system is not in conservation form, the source terms are stiff, and unlike MHD, it is prone to a loss of hyperbolicity if the parallel and perpendicular pressures become too different. The usual cure is to bring the parallel and perpendicular pressures closer to one another, but that has usually been done in an ad hoc manner. We present a physics-informed method of pressure relaxation based on the idea of pitch-angle scattering that keeps the numerical system hyperbolic and naturally leads to zero anisotropy in the limit of very large plasma beta. Numerical codes based on the CGL equations can, therefore, be made to function robustly for any magnetic field strength, including the limit where the magnetic field approaches zero. The capabilities of our new algorithm are demonstrated using several stringent test problems that provide a comparison of the CGL equations in the weakly and strongly collisional limits. This includes a test problem that mimics the interaction of a shock with a magnetospheric environment in 2D.

Type IIP supernovae (SNe IIP) are thought to originate from the explosion of massive stars >10 M⊙. Their luminosity is primarily powered by the explosion energy and the radioactive decay energy of 56Co, with the photosphere location regulated by hydrogen recombination. However, the physical connections between SNe IIP and their progenitor stars remain unclear. This paper presents a comprehensive study of SNe IIP and their progenitor stars by using the one-dimensional stellar evolution code, MESA. Our model grids consider the effects of stellar metallicity, mass, and rotation in the evolution of massive stars, as well as the explosion energy and 56Ni production in modeling supernovae. To elucidate the observed SNe IIP and their origins, we compare their light curves (LCs) with our models. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of stellar parameters on LCs by considering stellar mass, metallicity, rotation, explosion energy, and 56Ni production. We find that more massive stars exhibit longer plateaus due to increased photon diffusion time caused by massive ejecta. Higher metallicity leads to increased opacity and mass loss of progenitor stars. Rapid rotation affects internal stellar structures, enhancing convective mixing and mass loss, potentially affecting the plateau’s brightness and duration. Higher explosion energy results in brighter but shorter plateaus due to faster-moving ejecta. 56Ni mass affects late-time luminosity and plateau duration, with larger masses leading to slower declines.

本文介绍了在太空等离子体中利用Cairns分布对非热属性进行表征的重要性。文章提到，传统上非热波动被认为是在Maxwellian分布等离子体中的回旋半径修正项，但作者介绍了一种基于动力学理论和Cairns分布的创新视角。研究重点是在太阳冠中基于Cairns分布函数的动能阿尔夫文波的扰动电磁场比和Poynting流的比率。此外，文章还探讨了垂直分量和平行归一化Poynting流的功率率的细微评估。研究发现，相比于Maxwellian分布，大值的Λ表现出更有利的属性，特别是在沿环境磁场线延伸的距离上对等离子体的充能过程有显著影响。这些分析结果在理解太阳大气中的现象、尤其是在观测到的加热过程中非热粒子所起的重要作用上具有实际应用意义。 <div>

In these intricate plasma environments, extensive measurements have been conducted to monitor the fluctuations inherent in the perturbed electromagnetic (EM) field and the associated Poynting flux, specifically concerning kinetic Alfvén waves (KAWs). Traditionally, these fluctuations have been attributed to gyroradius correction terms within the framework of Maxwellian distributed plasmas. However, our study introduces an innovative perspective grounded in kinetic theory coupled with the Cairns distribution, adept at encapsulating the nonthermal nuances characterized by the index parameter Λ. Within the domain of the solar corona, our investigation centers on the perturbed EM field ratios and the Poynting flux of KAWs, with a foundation in the Cairns distribution function. It is noteworthy that the perpendicular components, although deemed less significant due to the dominance of k⊥ over k∥, remain unquantified regarding their relative insignificance. Similarly, the exploration of the imaginary part of the normalized EM field ratio has been a relatively understudied domain. Furthermore, we delve into the nuanced assessment of the power rate Ix/Iz characterizing the perpendicular and parallel normalized Poynting fluxes (Sx and Sz). Intriguingly, we discern that large values of Λ, compared to their Maxwellian counterparts, manifest advantageous attributes, particularly concerning the energization of the plasma over extended distances along the ambient magnetic field lines. The analytical insights gleaned from this study find practical application in understanding phenomena within the solar atmosphere, particularly shedding light on the significant role played by nonthermal particles in the observed heating processes.

<div> 高红移、大质量星系、恒星形成、SED拟合、宇宙学

这项研究使用了FourStar Galaxy Evolution Survey目录中的200个V形光谱能量分布非活动星系的数据，通过对它们的SED进行拟合，得出了它们的平均年龄。研究发现，在红移较高的星系中，它们的平均年龄较年轻，但在红移大于2.5的星系中，平均年龄并没有显著的变化，大多数星系的平均年龄在1到2亿年之间。此外，研究还发现，大质量星系的年龄较大，通常在10亿年以上，并且比较小质量星系的形成时间更早。这些发现有助于对标准宇宙学中的星系形成模型进行讨论。 <br /><br />总结: 这项研究利用星系的SED数据，发现高红移星系的平均年龄较年轻，但随着红移的增加，星系的平均年龄并没有显著变化，大质量星系的年龄较大且形成较早。这些发现对于讨论标准宇宙学中的星系形成模型具有重要意义。 <div>
Observations of large amounts of massive galaxies with relatively old populations found at high redshifts are challenging galaxy formation scenarios within the standard cosmology. Precise determinations of the average age of these galaxies would be useful for the discussion of this problem. Here we carry out a better constraint of the age of 200 V-shaped spectral energy distribution (SED) nonactive galactic nucleus galaxies at redshifts 2 < z < 4 of the catalog of the FourStar Galaxy Evolution Survey, identified by the V shape in their SED with a Lyman and a Balmer break. The SED fitting includes a main stellar population in addition to a residual younger population and extinction. The galaxies are younger at a higher redshift on average. However, for the galaxies with z > 2.5, we do not see a significant evolution of their average age, with all average ages of the galaxies mostly remaining between 1 and 2 Gyr. Our research finds that most massive galaxies (∼1010M⊙) are older (typically > ∼1 Gyr old) and formed earlier than less massive galaxies in our sample.

<div> 线偏振、C18O、13CO分子线、磁场、丝状星云

总结:
850μm线偏振和C18O (3 − 2)以及13CO (3 − 2)分子线观测表明，Cocoon星云(IC 5146)中的F13和F13S丝状结构是热过临界的，其中有识别出沿其顶部的密集核心。磁场向量在核心尺度上倾向于与丝状结构平行，但在高密度区域会受到扰动。通过Davis–Chandrasekhar–Fermi方法测量的磁场强度为58 ± 31μG和40 ± 9μG，表明这些丝状结构是次临界的和次Alfvén速度的，强调了磁场在Cocoon星云中的重要性。此外，通过观测到的C18O (3 − 2)速度和密度分布以及13CO (3 − 2)数据的大尺度速度场，我们提出了F13和F13S的形成和演化情景。辐射冲击波产生于大约1.4百万年前与类B星发生碰撞，丝状结构成为热过临界，随后通过重力分割形成了密集核心，同时伴随着磁场的扰动。 <div>
We present 850 μm linear polarization and C18O (3 − 2) and 13CO (3 − 2) molecular line observations toward the filaments (F13 and F13S) in the Cocoon Nebula (IC 5146) using the JCMT POL-2 and Heterodyne Array Receiver Program instruments. F13 and F13S are found to be thermally supercritical with identified dense cores along their crests. Our findings include that the polarization fraction decreases in denser regions, indicating reduced dust grain alignment efficiency. The magnetic field vectors at core scales tend to be parallel to the filaments, but disturbed at the high density regions. Magnetic field strengths measured using the Davis–Chandrasekhar–Fermi method are 58 ± 31 and 40 ± 9 μG for F13 and F13S, respectively, and it reveals subcritical and sub-Alfvénic filaments, emphasizing the importance of magnetic fields in the Cocoon region. Sinusoidal C18O (3 − 2) velocity and density distributions are observed along the filaments’ skeletons, and their variations are mostly displaced by ∼1/4 × the wavelength of the sinusoid, indicating core formation occurred through the fragmentation of a gravitationally unstable filament, but with shorter core spacings than predicted. Large-scale velocity fields of F13 and F13S, studied using 13CO (3 − 2) data, present a V-shape transverse velocity structure. We propose a scenario for the formation and evolution of F13 and F13S, along with the dense cores within them. A radiation shock front generated by a B-type star collided with a sheet-like cloud about 1.4 Myr ago. The filaments became thermally critical due to mass infall through self-gravity ∼1 Myr ago, and subsequently, dense cores formed through gravitational fragmentation, accompanied by the disturbance of the magnetic field.

<div> kappa distributions, plasma, electromagnetic fluctuations, magnetized plasma, electron cyclotron whistler mode fluctuations
<br />总结:
本文研究了在内太阳圈中的kappa分布等离子体，在这种分布中，等离子体会自发地发出电磁波动。 当超热电子参与其中时，这些自发辐射会得到增强。此外，文章还通过比较磁谱对电子回旋骚扰模式波动进行了系统的定量比较。结果表明，磁场波动的能量水平随着β值的增加和κ值的减小而增加。另外，对于kappa分布而言，当κ值减小时，磁场波动的总能量会减少。 <div>
In the inner heliosphere, space measurements have revealed that plasma is well described by the kappa distributions, which are characterized by the value of the κ parameter. This parameter indicates how far plasma is from the ideal Maxwell–Boltzmann equilibrium distribution and gives the distribution a typical high-energy power-law tail. In these quasi-equilibrium conditions, the plasma spontaneously emits electromagnetic fluctuations. When suprathermal electrons are involved, these spontaneous emissions get enhanced, and the kappa distributions improve the description of the related nonthermal effects by taking into account the contribution of these high-energy electrons. Nevertheless, the kappa distributions describe different scenarios in which the velocity distribution may obey a power-law decay. Here, we present a systematic and quantitative comparison of kappa-distributed magnetized plasma through a comparison of magnetic spectra for electron cyclotron whistler mode fluctuations. Our results show that for a kappa distribution with a thermal speed equal to the one obtained in thermal equilibrium, the magnetic field fluctuations exhibit higher energy levels that scale with increasing values of β and decreasing values of κ, even though the same thermal speed is considered for all studied cases. Conversely, for a kappa distribution with a kappa-dependent thermal speed, the magnetic field fluctuations tend to exhibit less total energy with lower kappa values, even when compared to the Maxwellian distribution equilibrium results in the same range of parameters.

<br /><br />总结:
这项研究对886颗脉冲星的光谱特性进行了广泛分析，发现大多数脉冲星的光谱呈现幂律行为。研究采用了五种不同的光谱模型，其中发现简单幂律模型的平均谱指数为-1.64 ± 0.80。此外，在毫秒脉冲星中观察到了光谱指数与特征参数之间的显著相关性，同时在正常脉冲星中并没有观察到强相关性。各种模型显示出与光谱指数相关的最显著特征参数的变化，表明毫秒脉冲星中存在多种主导辐射机制。最后，基于Akaike信息准则，该研究首次确定了22颗呈现千兆赫峰谱类型的脉冲星。 <div>
This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the spectral properties of 886 pulsars across a wide frequency range from 20 MHz–343.5 GHz, including a total of 86 millisecond pulsars (MSPs). The majority of the pulsars exhibit power-law behavior in their spectra, although some exceptions are observed. Five different spectral models, namely, simple power law, broken power law, low-frequency turnover, high-frequency cutoff, and double turnover, were employed to explore the spectral behaviors. The average spectral index for pulsars modeled with a simple power law is found to be −1.64 ± 0.80, consistent with previous studies. Additionally, significant correlations between the spectral index and characteristic parameters are observed, particularly in MSPs, while no strong correlation is observed in normal pulsars. Different models show variations in the most influential characteristic parameters associated with the spectral index, indicating diverse dominant radiation mechanisms in MSPs. Finally, this study identifies 22 pulsars of the gigahertz-peaked spectra type for the first time based on the Akaike information criterion.

<div> 关键词: 磁场, 光球, 微小极性, 太阳活动层, 加热机制

总结: 
这篇文章研究了太阳活动层的加热机制，通过对GREGOR望远镜获取的数据进行分析，作者发现光球和上层色球中的微小极性磁场对日冕的加热没有显著影响，未能支持假设。进一步的物理论证表明，任何未解决的少数极性通量也不能到达相邻于上色球的冠层脚点，并且即使如此，由此产生的色球重连释放的能量也不足以解释日冕的能量损失。作者得出结论，明亮的色球、过渡区和冠层环等等必须通过涉及单极性场的机制进行加热。 <div>
We examine the hypothesis that multipolar magnetic fields advected by photospheric granules can contribute to heating the active chromosphere and corona. On 2020 September 28 the Gregor Infrared Spectrograph (GRIS) and HiFI+ instruments at the GREGOR telescope obtained data of NOAA 12773. We analyze Stokes profiles of spectral lines of Si i and He i, to study magnetic fields from the photosphere to the upper chromosphere. Magnetogram and EUV data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager and Atmospheric Imaging Assembly instruments on the Solar Dynamics Observatory spacecraft are coaligned and studied in relation to the GRIS data. At coronal loop footpoints, minor polarity fields comprise just 0.2% and 0.02% of the flux measured over the 40″ × 60″ area observed in the photosphere and upper chromosphere, centered 320″ from the disk center. Significantly, the minority fields are situated ≳12″ from bright footpoints. We use physical arguments to show that any unresolved minority flux cannot reach coronal footpoints adjacent to the upper chromosphere. Even if it did, the most optimistic estimate of the energy released through chromospheric reconnection is barely sufficient to account for the coronal energy losses. Further, dynamical changes accompanying reconnection between uni- and multipolar fields are seen neither in the He i data nor in narrowband movies of the Hα line core. We conclude that the hypothesis must be rejected. Bright chromospheric, transition region, and coronal loop plasmas must be heated by mechanisms involving unipolar fields.

<div> Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope, Galactic bubbles, AGN jets, relativistic hydrodynamic simulations, cosmic rays 

总结:
通过三维相对论流体动力学模拟，研究表明银河盘内密集的气体会破坏射流的整理，形成热气泡。这些气泡受到银河大气层的浮力作用，使它们垂直排列成对称的Fermi和eROSITA气泡。研究还发现，假设一个轻子模型，可以通过CR的动力谱指数为2.4来复制观测到的伽马射线气泡和微波暗区。这些模拟与观测到的多波长特征的一致性表明，通过斜向AGN失败的射流形成银河气泡是一种合理的情景。 <div>
The Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope reveals two large bubbles in the Galaxy, extending nearly symmetrically ∼50° above and below the Galactic center (GC). Previous simulations of bubble formation invoking active galactic nucleus (AGN) jets have assumed that the jets are vertical to the Galactic disk; however, in general, the jet orientation does not necessarily correlate with the rotational axis of the Galactic disk. Using three-dimensional special relativistic hydrodynamic simulations including cosmic rays (CRs) and thermal gas, we show that the dense clumpy gas within the Galactic disk disrupts jet collimation (“failed jets” hereafter), which causes the failed jets to form hot bubbles. Subsequent buoyancy in the stratified atmosphere renders them vertical to form the symmetric Fermi and eROSITA bubbles (collectively, Galactic bubbles). We find that (1) despite the relativistic jets emanating from the GC at various angles ≤45° with respect to the rotational axis of the Galaxy, the Galactic bubbles nonetheless appear aligned with the axis; (2) the edge of the eROSITA bubbles corresponds to a forward shock driven by the hot bubbles; (3) followed by the forward shock is a tangling contact discontinuity corresponding to the edge of the Fermi bubbles; (4) assuming a leptonic model we find that the observed gamma-ray bubbles and microwave haze can be reproduced with a best-fit CR power-law spectral index of 2.4; The agreements between the simulated and the observed multiwavelength features suggest that forming the Galactic bubbles by oblique AGN failed jets is a plausible scenario.

The polarized images of the supermassive black hole Messier 87* (M87*) produced by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) provide a direct view of the near-horizon emission from a black hole accretion and jet system. The EHT theoretical analysis of the polarized M87* images compared thousands of snapshots from numerical models with a variety of spins, magnetization states, viewing inclinations, and electron energy distributions, and found a small subset consistent with the observed image. In this article, we examine two models favored by EHT analyses: a magnetically arrested disk with moderate retrograde spin and a magnetically arrested disk with high prograde spin. Both have electron distribution functions that lead to strong depolarization by cold electrons. We ray trace five snapshots from each model at 22, 43, 86, 230, 345, and 690 GHz to forecast future very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations and examine limitations in numerical models. We find that even at low frequencies where optical and Faraday rotation depths are large, approximately rotationally symmetric polarization persists, suggesting that shallow depths dominate the polarization signal. However, morphology and spectra suggest that the assumed thermal electron distribution is not adequate to describe emission from the jet. We find 86 GHz images show a ringlike shape determined by a combination of plasma and spacetime imprints, smaller in diameter than recent results from the Global mm-VLBI Array. We find that the photon ring becomes more apparent with increasing frequency, and is more apparent in the retrograde model, leading to large differences between models in asymmetry and polarization structure.

We simulate the emission in the shallow decay phase of gamma-ray burst afterglows using a time-dependent code. We test four models: the energy injection model, evolving the injection efficiency of nonthermal electrons, evolving the amplification of the magnetic field, and the wind model with a relatively low bulk Lorentz factor. All of the four models can reproduce the typical X-ray afterglow lightcurve. The spectral shape depends on not only the parameter values at the time corresponding to the observer time but also the past evolution of the parameters. The model differences appear in the evolution of the broadband spectrum, especially in the inverse Compton component. Future gamma-ray observations with imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array will reveal the mechanism of the shallow decay phase.

Our understanding of how exoplanets form and evolve relies on analyses of both the mineralogy of protoplanetary disks and their detailed structures; however, these key complementary aspects of disks are usually studied separately. We present initial results from a hybrid model that combines the empirical characterization of the mineralogy of a disk, as determined from its mid-infrared spectral features, with the MCFOST radiative transfer disk model, a combination we call the Empirical and Radiative Transfer Hybrid (EaRTH) Disk Model. With the results of the mineralogy detection serving as input to the radiative transfer model, we generate mid-infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) that reflect both the mineralogical and structural parameters of the corresponding disk. Initial fits of the SED output by the resulting integrated model of Spitzer Space Telescope mid-infrared spectra of the protoplanetary disk orbiting the nearby T Tauri star MP Mus demonstrate the potential advantages of this approach by revealing details like the dominance of micron-sized olivine and micron-sized forsterite in this dusty disk. The simultaneous insight into disk composition and structure provided by the EaRTH Disk methodology should be directly applicable to the interpretation of mid-infrared spectra of protoplanetary disks that will be produced by the James Webb Space Telescope.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章讨论了太阳磁场模型的问题，提出了三个评估参数来量化评估磁场模型，并通过真实观测约束太阳冠状磁场和行星际磁场中的自由参数。研究发现，采用特定模型和观测数据可以减少开放通量问题，对于太阳极小期的Carrington旋转2231，建议使用PFSS+PFCS模型的最佳参数为Rss = 2.2–2.5 R☉和Rscs = 10.5–14.0 R☉。然而，通过人工增加极地磁场，虽然行星际磁场与观测数据一致，但太阳附近的磁场仍然被低估。研究指出，改进对微弱磁场和极地磁场的精确度以及考虑行星际物理过程产生的磁活动可能有助于解决开放通量问题。 <div>
Solar magnetic fields are closely related to various physical phenomena on the Sun, which can be extrapolated with different models from photospheric magnetograms. However, the open flux problem (OFP), the underestimation of the magnetic field derived from the extrapolated model, is still unsolved. To minimize the impact of the OFP, we propose three evaluation parameters to quantitatively evaluate magnetic field models and determine the optimal free parameters in the models by constraining the coronal magnetic fields and the interplanetary magnetic fields (IMFs) with real observations. Although the OFP still exists, we find that magnetic field lines traced from the coronal models effectively capture the intricate topological configurations observed in the corona, including streamers and plumes. The OFP is lessened by using the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager synoptic map instead of the Global Oscillation Network Group daily synoptic maps, and the potential field source surface + potential field current sheet (PFSS+PFCS) model instead of the current sheet source surface (CSSS) model. For Carrington Rotation 2231 at the solar minimum, we suggest that the optimal parameters for the PFSS+PFCS model are Rss = 2.2–2.5 R☉ and Rscs = 10.5–14.0 R☉, as well as for the CSSS model, are Rcs = 2.0–2.4 R☉, Rss = 11.0–14.7 R☉, and a = 1.0 R☉. Despite the IMFs at 1 au being consistent with the measurements by artificially increasing the polar magnetic fields, the IMFs near the Sun are still underestimated. The OFP might be advanced by improving the accuracy of both the weak magnetic fields and polar magnetic fields, especially considering magnetic activities arising from interplanetary physical processes.

该研究分析了太阳冕层等离子体环的加热不仅取决于Poynting流量，而且还取决于尚未确定的过程。这一发现反映并细化了早期提出的问题，即为什么和如何整个磁流体结构只间歇性地加载了明亮的冕层等离子体。研究者通过分析更多的色球和冕层数据，以找到对冕层加热机制的可重复性观测约束。他们研究了六次独立的色球活动区磁场扫描，并将其与上方热等离子体环联系起来。首次，他们将超过30个明亮等离子体环的足点与从上色球测量的Poynting流量的标量代理相关联。尽管不完美，这些代理均表明足点Poynting流量和环亮度之间普遍缺乏相关性。研究结果巩固了未观测到的物理过程正在发挥作用，这些过程控制着长寿命的冕层环的加热。 <br /><br /> <div>
A recent analysis has suggested that the heating of plasma loops in the solar corona depends not just on the Poynting flux but also on processes yet to be identified. This discovery reflects and refines earlier questions such as, Why and how are entire hydromagnetic structures only intermittently loaded with bright coronal plasma? The present work scrutinizes more chromospheric and coronal data, with the aim of finding reproducible observational constraints on coronal heating mechanisms. Six independent scans of chromospheric active-region magnetic fields are investigated and correlated to overlying hot plasma loops. For the first time, the footpoints of over 30 bright plasma loops are thus related to scalar proxies for the Poynting fluxes measured from the upper chromosphere. Although imperfect, the proxies all indicate a general lack of correlation between footpoint Poynting flux and loop brightness. Our findings consolidate the claim that unobserved physical processes are at work, which govern the heating of long-lived coronal loops.

<div> 磁化中子星，超Eddington吸积盘，自相似解，磁屏蔽，NS自旋 

研究了磁化中子星（NS）被超Eddington吸积盘包围的吸积过程。通过构建吸积盘结构的自相似解，详细研究了NS磁屏蔽和吸积盘内部区域之间的相互作用，并揭示了这种相互作用发生在一个薄边界层内。发现磁屏蔽半径大约与阿尔文半径成正比，系数在0.34-0.71之间，受磁场的对流和扭曲、NS自转以及NS吸积柱发射的辐射的影响。在超Eddington吸积条件下，NS可以很容易地加速成为一个快速旋转体。提出的模型可以用来探索不同天体物理背景下NS的吸积和演化，如超亮X射线双星或活跃星系核盘。<br /><br />总结: 研究了磁化中子星被超Eddington吸积盘包围的吸积过程，通过构建吸积盘结构的自相似解，揭示了磁屏蔽半径与阿尔文半径的关系，以及NS在超Eddington吸积条件下可能的自旋加速。该模型可用于探究不同天体物理背景下NS的吸积和演化。 <div>
The properties of super-Eddington accretion disks exhibit substantial distinctions from the sub-Eddington ones. In this paper, we investigate the accretion process of a magnetized neutron star (NS) surrounded by a super-Eddington disk. By constructing self-similar solutions for the disk structure, we study in detail an interaction between the NS magnetosphere and the inner region of the disk, revealing that this interaction takes place within a thin boundary layer. The magnetosphere truncation radius is found to be approximately proportional to the Alfvén radius, with a coefficient ranging between 0.34–0.71, influenced by the advection and twisting of a magnetic field, NS rotation, and radiation emitted from an NS accretion column. Under super-Eddington accretion, the NS can readily spin up to become a rapid rotator. The proposed model can be employed to explore the accretion and evolution of NSs in diverse astrophysical contexts, such as ultraluminous X-ray binaries or active galactic nucleus disks.

<div> 低质量X射线双星，Ser X-1，软谱状态，射电发射，长期变化

总结:
Ser X-1是一颗低质量中子星X射线双星，自上世纪60年代发现以来一直持续吸积，并且一直处于软谱状态，从未显示出实质性的长期X射线变化。研究人员最近对其进行了10次射电观测，发现8次未探测到射电发射，而2次探测到了射电发射。在对这两次探测到的射电发射进行分析后，发现其并未检测到偏振，排除了极高的偏振水平。这与黑洞X射线双星的行为相矛盾，因此对于Ser X-1其长期变化的射电行为令人困惑。 <div>
Ser X–1 is a low-mass neutron star X-ray binary and has been persistently accreting since its discovery in the 1960s. It has always been observed to be in a soft spectral state and has never showed substantial long-term X-ray variability. Ser X–1 has one previous radio observation in the literature in which radio emission was detected during this soft state, which is contrary to the behavior of black hole X-ray binaries. We have recently obtained 10 randomly sampled radio epochs of Ser X–1 in order to further investigate its anomalous soft-state radio emission. Out of 10 epochs, we find 8 nondetections and 2 detections at 10 GHz flux densities of 19.9 ± 4.2 μJy and 32.2 ± 3.6 μJy, respectively. We do not detect polarization in either epoch, ruling out very high polarization levels (≲63% and 34%). We compare these Ser X–1 results to other X-ray binaries and consider explanations for its long-term variable radio behavior.

<div> SNR, RCW 103, Fermi-LAT, γ-ray emission, hadronic scenario
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章分析了费米伽马射线空间望远镜在RCW 103年轻超新星遗迹区域获得的超过15年的γ射线数据。研究表明，4FGL J1616.2−5054e，即HESS J1616−518的对应源，距离SNR约13′，并且被确定为最近的费米-LAT源目录中的延伸源。研究还发现，具有幂律（PL）光谱的点源（PS）最能描述检测到的γ射线发射，而这一点源位于SNR的南边缘。PL发射的光子指数为Γ≈2.31（或者在对数抛物线模型中为α≈2.4），比之前报道的考虑HESS J1616−518对应源为PS时的Γ≈2.0要软（这可能导致了对RCW 103的延伸发射的误认）。为了在强子场景中产生γ射线发射，估计需要具有指数约为2.4的PL能量分布的质子。这些结果与多波段观测的结果相吻合，后者指出南缘的遗迹正在与分子云相互作用。 <div>
We analyze more than 15 yr of γ-ray data obtained with the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi) for the region of the young supernova remnant (SNR) RCW 103, since the nearby source 4FGL J1616.2−5054e, counterpart to HESS J1616−518 and ≃13′ away from the SNR, is determined to be extended in the more recent Fermi-LAT source catalog. Different templates for 4FGL J1616.2−5054e and RCW 103 are tested, and we find that a point source (PS) with a power-law (PL) spectrum at the southern limb of the SNR best describes the detected γ-ray emission. The photon index of the PL emission is Γ ≃ 2.31 (or α ≃ 2.4 in a log-parabola model), softer than the previously reported Γ ≃ 2.0 when the counterpart to HESS J1616−518 was considered to be a PS (which likely caused misidentification of extended emission at RCW 103). In order to produce the γ-ray emission in a hadronic scenario, we estimate that protons with an index ∼2.4 PL energy distribution are needed. These results fit with those from multiwavelength observations that have indicated the remnant at the southern limb is interacting with a molecular cloud.

ALMA观测揭示了原行星盘中丰富的亚结构，但仍无法分辨出数值模拟预测的小尺度尘埃结构。本文提出了一种方法来找到原行星盘中未解析的光学厚尘埃环的证据。作者展示了，在存在未解析的环的情况下，倾斜的盘亮度在短轴方向上呈现出独特的发射峰值。此外，方位角亮度取决于环的几何形状和尘埃光学特性；因此，可以利用方位角亮度的变化来检测未解析的环并探测其性质。通过分析由流动不稳定性形成的环状亚结构的方位角亮度，在典型的盘参数下，我们展示了ALMA很可能可以检测到由模拟产生的峰值。此外，作者提出了一个解析模型，不仅定性地而且定量地重现了模拟中发现的峰值，验证了其对推断观测中未解析环的存在以及表征其光学特性和形状的适用性。这将有助于确定流动不稳定性（以及行星形成）正在发生的盘区域。 <br /><br />总结: ALMA观测揭示了原行星盘中丰富的亚结构，但仍无法分辨出数值模拟预测的小尺度尘埃结构。作者提出了一种方法来找到原行星盘中未解析的光学厚尘埃环的证据。通过分析方位角亮度的变化，可以检测未解析的环并探测其性质。作者还提出了一个解析模型，验证了其对推断观测中未解析环的存在以及表征其光学特性和形状的适用性。 <div>
While high-resolution Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations reveal a wealth of substructure in protoplanetary disks, they remain incapable of resolving the types of small-scale dust structures predicted, for example, by numerical simulations of the streaming instability. In this article, we propose a method to find evidence for unresolved, optically thick dusty rings in protoplanetary disks. We demonstrate that, in presence of unresolved rings, the brightness of an inclined disk exhibits a distinctive emission peak at the minor axis. Furthermore, the azimuthal brightness depends on both the geometry of the rings and the dust optical properties; we can therefore use the azimuthal brightness variations to both detect unresolved rings and probe their properties. By analyzing the azimuthal brightness in the test case of ringlike substructures formed by streaming instability, we show that the resulting peak is likely detectable by ALMA for typical disk parameters. Moreover, we present an analytic model that not only qualitatively but also quantitatively reproduces the peak found in the simulations, validating its applicability to infer the presence of unresolved rings in observations and characterize their optical properties and shape. This will contribute to the identification of disk regions where streaming instability (and thus planet formation) is occurring.

<div> 高能爆发，射电余辉，短时宇宙射线暴，余辉模型，红移
发现射电余辉，确定为短时宇宙射线暴210726A的射电余辉，红移约为z∼2.4的星系。在爆发后开始射电观测不到1天内，并没有探测到射电辐射，直到约11天后才出现。余辉随后在一周内明显增加约3倍，随后迅速衰减（“射电耀斑”）。研究人员发现，前向冲击余辉模型不能自洽地描述多波段X射线和射电数据，并且低估了射电耀斑的流量约5倍。他们发现，注入大量能量，增加射束动能，使爆发的各向同性动能增加约4倍，或者来自壳层碰撞的逆向冲击是匹配宽带行为的有效解决方案。在z∼2.4，GRB 210726A是迄今发现的最高红移的短时宇宙射线暴之一，也是射电和X射线中最亮的。结合和比较所有先前的短时宇宙射线暴射电余辉观测，研究人员发现，大多数已发表的射电搜索在爆发后≲10天内结束，有可能错过这些后期出现、明亮的射电余辉。<br /><br />总结: 高红移的短时宇宙射线暴210726A的射电余辉显示出异常的特征，迅速的增亮和快速衰减。标准的前向冲击余辉模型无法解释观测数据，而能量注入或壳层碰撞对解释这一特征提供了可行的解释。这表明现有的射电观测可能需要更长时间，以捕获这些特殊情况下射电余辉的演变。 <div>
We present the discovery of the radio afterglow of the short gamma-ray burst (GRB) 210726A, localized to a galaxy at a photometric redshift of z ∼ 2.4. While radio observations commenced ≲1 day after the burst, no radio emission was detected until ∼11 days. The radio afterglow subsequently brightened by a factor of ∼3 in the span of a week, followed by a rapid decay (a “radio flare”). We find that a forward shock afterglow model cannot self-consistently describe the multiwavelength X-ray and radio data, and underpredicts the flux of the radio flare by a factor of ≈5. We find that the addition of substantial energy injection, which increases the isotropic kinetic energy of the burst by a factor of ≈4, or a reverse shock from a shell collision are viable solutions to match the broadband behavior. At z ∼ 2.4, GRB 210726A is among the highest-redshift short GRBs discovered to date, as well as the most luminous in radio and X-rays. Combining and comparing all previous radio afterglow observations of short GRBs, we find that the majority of published radio searches conclude by ≲10 days after the burst, potentially missing these late-rising, luminous radio afterglows.

<div> 关键词: 碳含量，热解物质，星际微粒，低质量原恒星，热气体

总结:
本文研究了地球和原始流星与太阳和星际微粒的低碳含量差异，表明碳质颗粒在年轻太阳系的内部几个天文单位内被破坏。研究发现在七个低质量和一个中等质量原恒星（Lbol∼2-300L⊙）的观测结果中，所有源都存在>300 K的热气体，暗示热气体可能是普遍存在的。此外，通过相同观测获得的CH3OH的激发温度始终较低（∼135-250 K），表明CH3CN和CH3OH有不同的空间分布。1mm和3mm处的柱密度比较显示，CH3CN在3mm处的增加幅度比CH3OH更大，这表明CH3CN在热气体中增加超过了CH3OH。如果这种CH3CN增加是碳颗粒热解的结果，这些结果表明地球的初始形成条件可能并不罕见。 <div>
The low carbon content of Earth and primitive meteorites compared to the Sun and interstellar grains suggests that carbon-rich grains were destroyed in the inner few astronomical units of the young solar system. A promising mechanism to selectively destroy carbonaceous grains is thermal sublimation within the soot line at ≳300 K. To address whether such hot conditions are common among low-mass protostars, we observe CH3CN transitions at 1, 2, and 3 mm with the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array toward seven low-mass and one intermediate-mass protostar (Lbol ∼ 2–300L⊙), as CH3CN is an excellent temperature tracer. We find >300 K gas toward all sources, indicating that hot gas may be prevalent. Moreover, the excitation temperature for CH3OH obtained with the same observations is always lower (∼135–250 K), suggesting that CH3CN and CH3OH have a different spatial distribution. A comparison of the column densities at 1 and 3 mm shows a stronger increase at 3 mm for CH3CN than for CH3OH. Since the dust opacity is lower at longer wavelengths, this indicates that CH3CN is enhanced in the hot gas compared to CH3OH. If this CH3CN enhancement is the result of carbon-grain sublimation, these results suggest that Earth’s initial formation conditions may not be rare.

研究表明，星爆条件下存在偏向大质量恒星的恒星初始质量函数（IMF），与银河系不同。我们利用ALMA对4个高红移主序星系进行了观测，发现其中的SDSS J0901+1814存在13CO和C18O的清晰信号，首次在高红移主序星系中检测到CO同位素。观测结果显示，13C/18O比值明显低于本地主序星系。化学演化模型估计，这些星系的IMF更偏向于银河系IMF的大质量恒星。因此，高红移宇宙中的主序星系和星爆星系相似，存在更多大质量恒星。 <br /><br />总结: 近期观测和理论挑战了恒星初始质量函数在极端环境中的普遍性。高红移主序星系中检测到的CO同位素信号表明，这些星系的IMF更偏向于大质量恒星，类似于星爆星系，与银河系的IMF存在差异。 <div>
Recent observations and theories have presented a strong challenge to the universality of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) in extreme environments. A notable example has been found for starburst conditions, where evidence favors a top-heavy IMF, i.e., there is a bias toward massive stars compared to the IMF that is responsible for the stellar mass function and elemental abundances observed in the Milky Way. Local starburst galaxies have star formation rates similar to those in high-redshift main-sequence galaxies, which appear to dominate the stellar mass budget at early epochs. However, the IMF of high-redshift main-sequence galaxies is yet to be probed. Since 13CO and C18O isotopologues are sensitive to the IMF, we have observed these lines toward four strongly lensed high-redshift main-sequence galaxies using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. Of our four targets, SDSS J0901+1814, at z ≈ 2.26, is seen clearly in 13CO and C18O, the first detection of CO isotopologues in the high-redshift main-sequence galaxy population. The observed 13C/18O ratio, 2.4 ± 0.8, is significantly lower than that of local main-sequence galaxies. We estimate the isotope ratio, oxygen abundance, and stellar mass using a series of chemical evolution models with varying star formation histories and IMFs. All models favor an IMF that is more top-heavy than that of the Milky Way. Thus, as with starburst galaxies, main-sequence galaxies in the high-redshift Universe have a greater fraction of massive stars than a Milky Way IMF would imply.

该研究利用西藏ASγ实验中收集到的4TeV宇宙射线数据，通过非线性插值模型回归来提取标准化因子，从而得到真实的相对强度天空图。研究采用各种测试统计量表明，非线性拟合在模拟宇宙射线各向异性方面的表现明显优于直接线性拟合。研究还通过该程序生成标准化常数，以追踪实验响应宇宙射线强度的纬度变化。在对西藏ASγ数据进行纬度响应函数修正后，研究生成了真实相对强度的天空图。结果表明，测量和修正后的天空图在强度和角谱功率上存在显著差异。最终的全向异性真实相对强度天空图反驳了经纬度平均通量变化可忽略不计的假设。结果进一步证实了TeV宇宙射线各向异性由与星际磁场方向一致的偶极子（ℓ = 1）主导，并确认了在ℓ = 2和ℓ = 13之间存在着更弱的中尺度星际各向异性。 <br /><br />总结: 西藏ASγ实验的4TeV宇宙射线观测数据经过非线性插值模型回归，得到了真实的相对强度天空图，结果显示宇宙射线各向异性受星际磁场方向影响显著，并证实了中尺度星际各向异性的存在。 <div>
We use data from the Tibet ASγ experiment for 4 teraelectronvolt (TeV) cosmic rays as an example to perform a nonlinear interstellar distribution model regression according to the way the observed anisotropy is typically presented, from which we extract normalization factors that allow us to obtain a true relative intensity sky map from the measurements. By using various test statistics, we show that the nonlinear fit significantly outperforms the direct linear fit in its ability to model cosmic-ray anisotropy. The procedure also allows us to produce normalization constants that can trace minute latitudinal variations of experimental response to cosmic-ray intensity. Applying the correction of the latitudinal response function to the Tibet ASγ data, we generate a sky map of true relative intensity. As a result, we observe that the measured and corrected sky maps show significant differences in intensity and angular spectral power. Our full anisotropy sky map of true relative intensity contradicts the assumption that the latitudinal variation in longitudinally averaged flux is negligible. The result further confirms that TeV cosmic-ray anisotropy is dominated by a dipole (ℓ = 1) aligned with the interstellar magnetic field’s direction. Our results also confirm the existence of much weaker middle-scale interstellar anisotropy between ℓ = 2 and ℓ = 13.

<div> 关键词: preliminary interplanetary disturbance index, spectral whitening method, solar wind measurements, geomagnetic disturbance index, space weather monitoring

总结:
通过对太阳风测量数据的能量耦合函数进行频谱白化处理，我们得到了初步的行星间扰动指数（J），该指数可作为近地太阳风扰动的指标。我们对167次地磁风暴进行了详细分析，发现J和地磁扰动指数（J ）之间存在明显的时间延迟，J相对于J有不同的变化。对147次选定事件进行的统计分析显示，J的较大值和J的较小幅度通常伴随着增强的向南磁场，这意味着更多的太阳风能量进入磁层，从而引发强烈的地磁风暴。此外，对两个指数进行线性拟合表明，可以根据J预测J的发展约2小时，这表明J可以提供可能的地磁场扰动的及时警告，对太空天气监测和操作预报至关重要。 <br /><br /> <div>
We develop a preliminary interplanetary disturbance index (J ) by applying the spectral whitening method to an energy coupling function with solar wind measurements during the years 1998–2014 as the input, which can be used as an indicator of perturbations in the near-Earth solar wind. The correlation and temporal variation between J and the geomagnetic disturbance index (J ) constructed from the same method have been analyzed in detail for 167 geomagnetic storms with the minimum Dst index less than or equal to −50 nT. The time delay between J and J is clearly observable and varies for different events, according to which J is shifted backward with respect to J . We obtain a fairly good negative correlation between the shifted J and the J indices for the majority of events, and the significance level for 88% of the events (i.e., 147 events) does not exceed 0.05. A statistical analysis of the shifted J and the J indices for 147 selected events reveals that larger values of J and smaller magnitudes of J are commonly accompanied by enhanced southward magnetic fields, which implies that more solar wind energy is entering the magnetosphere and thus causing strong geomagnetic storms. Furthermore, a linear fit of the two indices suggests that the evolution of J can be predicted about 2 hr in advance based on J , indicating that J can provide early warnings of possible disturbances in the geomagnetic fields, which is crucial for space weather monitoring and operational forecasting.

<div> LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA, BBH mergers, stellar progenitors, metallicity-dependent efficiency, delay times
<br /><br />总结:
LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA观测到的二进制黑洞（BBH）合并与它们的恒星祖体之间的联系还不确定。研究模拟合并率，结合宇宙恒星形成，金属丰度相关效率 ϵ 和延迟时间分布 τ，并从第三次引力波瞬变目录的数据中推断这些参数。结果表明，合并的BBH祖体在低金属丰度环境中形成的机会更高，对应的效率为低金属高，高金属低，延迟时间偏好较短。模型还允许我们对BBH质量密度进行高红移的外推。今天，BBH合并仅占所形成的>10 M⊙祖体的总星质量密度的 ∼0.01%，但由于大质量恒星寿命短，合并的BBH质量可能在早于 ∼2.5 Gyr 时就超过活跃的大质量恒星的总质量。同时，与超大质量黑洞的质量相比，它们在 ∼12.5 Gyr 时的密度相当，但到了 z ∼ 1 时，超大质量黑洞的密度快速增加至合并恒星质量 BBH 的 ∼75 倍。 <div>
The connection between the binary black hole (BBH) mergers observed by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA and their stellar progenitors remains uncertain. Specifically, the fraction ϵ of stellar mass that ends up in BBH mergers and the delay time τ between star formation and merger carry information about the astrophysical processes that produce merging BBHs. We model the merger rate in terms of cosmic star formation, coupled with a metallicity-dependent efficiency ϵ and a distribution of delay times τ, and infer these parameters with data from the Third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog. The progenitors to merging BBHs preferentially form in low-metallicity environments with a low-metallicity efficiency of and a high-metallicity efficiency of at 90% credibility. The data also prefer short delay times. For a power-law distribution p(τ) ∝ τα, we find and α < −1.32 at 90% credibility. Our model allows us to extrapolate the mass density in BBHs to high redshifts. We cumulatively integrate our density rate over time to get the total density of merging stellar-mass BBHs as a function of redshift. Today, BBH mergers are only ∼0.01% of the total stellar-mass density created by >10 M⊙ progenitors. However, because massive stars are short lived, there may be more mass in merging BBHs than in living massive stars as early as ∼2.5 Gyr ago. We also compare to the mass in supermassive black holes, finding that the densities were comparable ∼12.5 Gyr ago, but their densities quickly increased to ∼75 times the density in merging stellar-mass BBHs by z ∼ 1.

Merging of stellar-mass binary black holes (BBHs) could take place within the accretion disks of active galactic nuclei (AGN). The resulting BH remnant is likely to accrete the disk gas at a super-Eddington rate, launching a fast, quasi-spherical outflow (wind). Particles will be accelerated by shocks driven by the wind, subsequently interacting with the shocked disk gas or radiation field through hadronic processes and resulting in the production of high-energy neutrinos and potential electromagnetic (EM) emission. This study delves into the intricate evolution of the shock driven by a merged BH wind within an AGN disk. Subsequently, we calculated the production of neutrinos and the expected detection numbers for a single event, along with their contributions to the overall diffuse neutrino background. Our analysis, which considers various scenarios, reveals considerable neutrino production and possible detection by IceCube for nearby events. The contribution of merged BH winds on the diffuse neutrino background is minor due to the low event rate density, but it can be improved to some extent for some optimistic parameters. We also propose that there could be two neutrino/EM bursts, one originating from the premerger BBH wind and the other from the merged BH wind, with the latter typically having a delay to the gravitational wave (GW) event of around tens of days. When combined with the anticipated GWs emitted during the BBH merger, such a system emerges as a promising candidate for joint observations involving neutrinos, GWs, and EM signals.

<div> NGIMS, Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN mission, ionosphere, altitude, model output

总结: NGIMS是火星大气和挥发性物质演化任务上的中性气体和离子质谱仪，用于测量火星上层大气中中性和离子物种的浓度。许多模型可以在关键离子物种的垂直密度剖面上实现几倍的精度，但在多个离子物种在广泛高度范围内达到几十个百分点的一致性方面却面临挑战。研究探索了在保持简化化学模型的情况下，利用光化学平衡的假设和NGIMS数据没有测量误差的假设的手段来克服这个问题。研究考虑了一个想法，即电荷转移反应的速率系数可能会随着高度的变化而变化，这是由于受压力控制的能量分布的结果。 <div>
Measurements of concentrations of neutral and ion species in the upper atmosphere of Mars by the Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer (NGIMS) on board the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN mission have served as model input and/or for comparison with model output in numerous earlier studies of the Martian dayside ionosphere. While many models reproduce the altitudinal density profiles of key ion species within a factor of a few, it has proven challenging to achieve a level of agreement within tens of percent for multiple ion species over a wide range of altitudes. We explore means to overcome this issue while keeping with a reduced chemical model and utilizing the assumptions of photochemical equilibrium and that the NGIMS data are devoid of any measurement errors. We entertain, for instance, the idea that the rate coefficient for the charge-transfer reaction between and O may vary with altitude as a result of a pressure-controlled internal energy distribution of the population.

总结: 
X射线源产生的短脉冲辐射被银河系中的尘埃云散射而形成扩张的X射线环。研究了亮度最高的伽玛射线暴GRB 221009A的X射线环，发现了五个主要的扩张环，模拟显示它们是散射自距离观测者0.4-13 kpc处的五个尘埃云。根据GRB的X射线辐射量，这些环的通量表明这些尘埃云的尘埃粒子柱密度约为10^7-8 cm^-2。通过时间相关的光谱分析发现，这些环都经历了光谱软化，即随着扩张变得更软，光谱指数范围从2.2到5，与尘埃散射模型的预测一致。<br /><br /> <div>
An expanding X-ray halo or rings appear when short pulses of X-ray radiation from a background source are scattered by clouds of dust in the Milky Way. We study the X-ray rings of the brightest gamma-ray burst (GRB) 221009A, detected by the Swift X-Ray Telescope. The rings center on the GRB position, and their angular radii increase with time. We identify five major expanding rings, and our modeling of their expansion history suggests that they are scattered off from five dusty clouds at distances of 0.4–13 kpc from the observer. Given an assumed prompt X-ray fluence of this GRB, the fluxes of those rings suggest that these clouds have dust grain column densities of 107∼8 cm−2. More interestingly, our time-dependent spectral analysis of these rings shows that they all experience spectral softening, i.e., getting softer as they expand, with spectral indices ranging from 2.2 to 5, consistent with what the dust-scattering model predicts.

Vapor pressure is a relevant quantity that is necessary in order to improve the study of the atmosphere dynamics that take place within astrophysical scenarios. The aim of this study was to obtain the vapor pressure values of the following molecules: C2H4, C2H6, CH3OH, CH4, CO, CO2, H2O, and N2 through experimentation, as well as to determine their empirical relationship with the temperature, applying the results to the persistence of volatiles in trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) and Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs). The experimental determination was performed by measuring the sublimation rate for each molecule at different temperatures. The Hertz–Knudsen equation was used to obtain the vapor pressures for the aforementioned molecules, taking the necessary considerations into account, and the sublimation rate was measured using a quartz crystal microbalance. In order to check the validity of the methods used, the results obtained for water ice were compared with those of previous studies from the literature. The values obtained for CO, N2, and CH4 are of particular interest in the study of the TNOs' and KBOs' atmosphere composition. The results of this study improve the understanding of the surface and atmospheric composition of objects in the cold scenarios of the solar system, in particular, in KBOs and TNOs.

总结:<br /><br />本研究介绍了Augustus星表，该表基于Pan-STARRS、2MASS、UKIDSS和unWISE的光学至近红外光度测量以及Gaia DR2和3D尘埃消光地图的视差测量，对1.7亿颗恒星进行了距离、消光和恒星参数的估计。经过质量筛选后，有1.25亿个目标具有高质量的后验概率，恒星类型确定后的统计距离不确定性约为10%。研究结果显示，该星表能够准确重现去除消光效应后的Gaia颜色-星等图，并且能够清晰地检测到包括Monoceros环和人马座流在内的大型、动力学上连贯的亚结构。研究结果已公开可用，并附有交互式可视化工具。 <div>
We present Augustus, a catalog of distance, extinction, and stellar parameter estimates for 170 million stars from 14 mag < r < 20 mag and with ∣b∣ > 10° drawing on a combination of optical to near-infrared photometry from Pan-STARRS, 2MASS, UKIDSS, and unWISE along with parallax measurements from Gaia DR2 and 3D dust extinction maps. After applying quality cuts, we find 125 million objects have “high-quality” posteriors with statistical distance uncertainties of ≲10% for objects with well-constrained stellar types. This is a substantial improvement over the distance estimates derived from Gaia parallaxes alone and in line with the recent results from Anders et al. We find the fits are able to reproduce the dereddened Gaia color–magnitude diagram accurately, which serves as a useful consistency check of our results. We show that we are able to detect large, kinematically coherent substructures in our data clearly relative to the input priors, including the Monoceros Ring and the Sagittarius Stream, attesting to the quality of the catalog. Our results are publicly available at doi:10.7910/DVN/WYMSXV. An accompanying interactive visualization can be found at http://allsky.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com.

总结: <br /><br />这篇论文提出了一种新的半监督学习方法，结合了一种名为动态相互训练（DMT）边界引导语义分割（BGSeg）的语义分割方法，即DMT_BGSeg，以充分利用来自紫金山天文台（PMO）的标记数据和其他五个观测站的未标记数据，来检测和分割中国六个观测站的所有太阳黑子图纸中的太阳黑子组件。该方法有效地检测和分割了中国太阳黑子图纸中的太阳黑子，测试结果显示PMO，YNAO，BJP，NJU，QDOS和SSOS的平均IoU值分别为85.29，72.65，73.82，64.28，62.26和60.07。结果比较还表明DMT_BGSeg在中国太阳黑子图纸中检测和分割太阳黑子方面是有效的。太阳黑子的数量和面积被分别测量，所有详细数据都在中国虚拟天文台上公开分享，这将促进全球历史太阳黑子数据库的全面增加，并进一步促进对长期太阳活动周期和太阳动力学的理解。 <div>
China has six observing stations, providing over 52,000 handwritten sunspot drawings from 1947–2016. The observing stations are the Purple Mountain Astronomical Observatory (PMO), Yunnan Astronomical Observatory (YNAO), Qingdao Observatory Station (QDOS), Sheshan Observatory Station (SSOS), Beijing Planetarium (BJP), and Nanjing University (NJU). In this paper, we propose a new cotraining semisupervised learning method combining a semantic segmentation method named dynamic mutual training (DMT) boundary-guided semantic segmentation (BGSeg), i.e., DMT_BGSeg, which makes full use of the labeled data from PMO and the unlabeled data from the other five stations to detect and segment sunspot components in all sunspot drawings of the six Chinese stations. The sunspot is detected and segmented. Additionally, each sunspot is split into four types of components: pore, spot, umbra, and hole. The testing results show the mIoU values of PMO, YNAO, BJP, NJU, QDOS and SSOS are 85.29, 72.65, 73.82, 64.28, 62.26, and 60.07, respectively. The results of the comparison also show that DMT_BGSeg is effective in detecting and segmenting sunspots in Chinese sunspot drawings. The numbers and areas of sunspot components are measured separately. All of the detailed data are publicly shared on China-VO, which will advance the comprehensive augmentation of the global historical sunspot database and further the understanding of the long-term solar activity cycle and solar dynamo.

Light echoes give us a unique perspective on the nature of supernovae and nonterminal stellar explosions. Spectroscopy of light echoes can reveal details on the kinematics of the ejecta, probe asymmetry, and reveal details of ejecta interaction with circumstellar matter, thus expanding our understanding of these transient events. However, the spectral features arise from a complex interplay between the source photons, the reflecting dust geometry, and the instrumental setup and observing conditions. In this work, we present an improved method for modeling these effects in light echo spectra, one that relaxes the simplifying assumption of a light-curve-weighted sum, and instead estimates the true relative contribution of each phase of a transient event to the observed spectrum. We discuss our logic, the gains we obtain over light echo analysis methods used in the past, and prospects for further improvements. Lastly, we show how the new method improves our analysis of echoes from Tycho’s supernova (SN 1572) as an example.

The classical T Tauri star (CTTS) stage is a critical phase of the star and planet formation process. In an effort to better understand the mass accretion processes, which can dictate future stellar evolution and planet formation, a multiepoch, multiwavelength photometric and spectroscopic monitoring campaign of four CTTSs (TW Hya, RU Lup, BP Tau, and GM Aur) was carried out in 2021 and 2022/2023 as part of the Outflows and Disks around Young Stars: Synergies for the Exploration of ULLYSES Spectra program. Here we focus on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) UV spectra obtained by the HST Director’s Discretionary Time UV Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential Standards (ULLYSES) program. Using accretion shock modeling, we find that all targets exhibit accretion variability, varying from short increases in accretion rate by up to a factor of 3 within 48 hr to longer decreases in accretion rate by a factor of 2.5 over the course of 1 yr. This is despite the generally consistent accretion morphology within each target. Additionally, we test empirical relationships between accretion rate and UV luminosity and find stark differences, showing that these relationships should not be used to estimate the accretion rate for an individual target. Our work reinforces that future multiepoch and simultaneous multiwavelength studies are critical in our understanding of the accretion process in low-mass star formation.

TDE AT2018fyk被解释为与质量黑洞双星相关的一次性TDE。X射线，紫外线和光学光谱显示出不同于一般的特点，且在约600天后衰减，之后再次增强，并在1200天左右再次衰减。这种行为发生在一个黑洞中断了碎片再次回落到另一个黑洞时，自然地呈现出了t-5/3幂律的陡峭下降。黑洞质量M•从X射线光谱拟合和早期紫外/光学光谱拟合中得出，比从M•-σ*宿主星系关系预测的M•要小两个数量级，这表明碎片被吸积到了辅助黑洞上，而主黑洞则停止了回落。再者，如果增亮是与主黑洞相关的话，它应该在5000天左右而不是观察到的1200天左右发生。次要的质量和无量纲自旋都表明了一个中等质量的次要黑洞，这与观察到的紫外/光学光谱衰减一致，即次要黑洞的外部吸积盘过于微弱而无法产生可检测的辐射底线。第一次吸积中断的时间限制了二进制系统的间隔为(6.7±1.2)×10−3 pc。X射线光谱拟合和时间分析表明，硬X射线来自于次要黑洞盘上方的辐射区域。早期的紫外/光学辐射，暗示次要黑洞的超Eddington阶段，可能起源于碎片轨道化产生的激波。 <br /><br />总结: AT2018fyk是一次与大质量黑洞双星相关的潮撕裂事件。其X射线，紫外线和光学光谱显示出特殊的特点，这被解释为主黑洞中断了碎片再次回落到辅助黑洞所致。辅助黑洞的质量和维度自旋表明其为中等质量黑洞。X射线和早期紫外/光学辐射的分析显示了黑洞之间的二进制系统间隔。同时，X射线来自于次要黑洞盘上方的辐射区域，而早期的紫外/光学辐射可能源自于碎片轨道化产生的激波。 <div>
The tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2018fyk has unusual X-ray, UV, and optical light curves that decay over the first ∼600 days, rebrighten, and decay again around 1200 days. We explain this behavior as a one-off TDE associated with a massive black hole (BH) binary. The sharp drop-offs from t−5/3 power laws at around 600 days naturally arise when one BH interrupts the debris fallback onto the other BH. The BH mass M• derived from fitting X-ray spectra with a slim disk accretion model and, independently, from fitting the early UV/optical light curves, is smaller by 2 orders of magnitude than predicted from the M•–σ* host galaxy relation, suggesting that the debris is accreted onto the secondary, with the fallback cut off by the primary. Furthermore, if the rebrightening were associated with the primary, it should occur around 5000 days, not the observed 1200 days. The secondary’s mass and dimensionless spin is and a•,s > 0.3 (X-ray spectral fitting), while the primary’s mass is M•,p = 107.7±0.4M⊙ (M•–σ* relation). An intermediate mass BH secondary is consistent with the observed UV/optical light-curve decay, i.e., the secondary’s outer accretion disk is too faint to produce a detectable emission floor. The time of the first accretion cutoff constrains the binary separation to be (6.7 ± 1.2) × 10−3 pc. X-ray spectral fitting and timing analyses indicate that the hard X-rays arise from a corona above the secondary’s disk. The early UV/optical emission, suggesting a super-Eddington phase for the secondary, possibly originates from shocks arising from debris circularization.

<div> Hubble Space Telescope, COS/G160M, C IV, circumgalactic medium (CGM), supermassive black holes (SMBH)

对Hubble Space Telescope进行的COS/G160M观测研究了8个红移为z∼0、光度约为L⋆的星系的内部环星系介质（CGM）中的C IV，并与紫外明亮的类星体配对，它们的冲击参数（Rproj）在25到130千秒差距之间。这些星系的质量控制样本（log10M⋆/M⊙∼10.2–10.9 M⊙）中的恒星黑洞的质量经过动力学测量，范围在log10MBH/M⊙∼6.8–8.4之间；这使得我们能够将结果与模型进行比较，这些模型中，恒星黑洞的综合反馈历史改变了长时间尺度上的CGM。我们发现C IV柱密度测量（NC IV;平均log10NC IV,CH=13.94±0.09 cm−2）在很大程度上与其他调查中CGM中NC IV的现有测量（平均log10NC IV,Lit=13.90±0.08 cm−2）一致，但不会因为SMBH质量的函数而明显变化。相比之下，特定星形成率（sSFR）与CGM中的电离物质含量高度相关。对于具有log10MBH/M⊙>7.0的星系，我们发现sSFR存在较大的分散，其中CGM的C IV含量与星系的sSFR明显相关，但与MBH无关。我们的结果不表明CGM中C IV与星系SMBH质量存在明显的因果关系；然而，通过与EAGLE、Romulus25和IllustrisTNG模拟的比较，我们发现我们的样本可能太小，无法限制这样的因果关系。<br /><br />总结:该研究利用Hubble Space Telescope对C IV进行了研究，发现星系的C IV含量与SMBH质量无明显因果关系，但与特定星形成率相关。然而，研究也指出样本可能太小，无法排除因果关系。 <div>
We present an analysis of Hubble Space Telescope COS/G160M observations of C IV in the inner circumgalactic medium (CGM) of a novel sample of eight z ∼ 0, L ≈ L⋆ galaxies, paired with UV-bright QSOs at impact parameters (Rproj) between 25 and 130 kpc. The galaxies in this stellar-mass-controlled sample (log10M⋆/M⊙ ∼ 10.2–10.9 M⊙) host supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with dynamically measured masses spanning log10MBH/M⊙ ∼ 6.8–8.4; this allows us to compare our results with models of galaxy formation where the integrated feedback history from the SMBH alters the CGM over long timescales. We find that the C IV column density measurements (NC IV; average log10NC IV,CH = 13.94 ± 0.09 cm−2) are largely consistent with existing measurements from other surveys of NC IV in the CGM (average log10NC IV,Lit = 13.90 ± 0.08 cm−2), but do not show obvious variation as a function of the SMBH mass. By contrast, specific star formation rate (sSFR) is highly correlated with the ionized content of the CGM. We find a large spread in sSFR for galaxies with log10MBH/M⊙ > 7.0, where the CGM C IV content shows a clear dependence on galaxy sSFR but not MBH. Our results do not indicate an obvious causal link between CGM C IV and the mass of the galaxy’s SMBH; however, through comparisons to the EAGLE, Romulus25, and IllustrisTNG simulations, we find that our sample is likely too small to constrain such causality.

The Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array has revolutionized the field of dust polarization in protoplanetary disks across multiple wavelengths. Previous observations and empirical modeling have suggested multiple mechanisms of dust polarization toward HL Tau, including grain alignment and dust scattering. However, a detailed modeling of dust polarization based on grain alignment physics is not yet available. Here, using an updated POLARIS code, we perform numerical modeling of dust polarization arising from both grain alignment by the magnetically enhanced radiative torque mechanism and self-scattering to reproduce the HL Tau polarization observed at three wavelengths of 0.87, 1.3, and 3.1 mm. Our modeling results show that the observed multiwavelength polarization could be reproduced only when large grains contain embedded iron inclusions and those with slow internal relaxation must have wrong internal alignment (i.e., the grain’s major axis parallel to its angular momentum). The abundance of iron embedded inside grains in the form of clusters is constrained to be ≳16%, and the number of iron atoms per cluster is Ncl ∼ 9 × 102. Maximum grain sizes probed at wavelengths of λ = 0.87, 1.3, and 3.1 mm are constrained at ∼60, 80, and 90 μm, respectively.

Hα emission is a clear indicator of circumstellar activity in Be stars, historically employed to assess the classical Be star (CBe) population in young open clusters (YOCs). The YOC NGC 330 in the Small Magellanic Cloud exhibits a large known fraction of CBe stars and was selected for a pilot study to establish a comprehensive methodology for identifying Hα emitters in the Magellanic Clouds, encompassing the entire B-type spectral range. Using the SOAR Adaptive Module Imager (SAMI), we investigated the stellar population of NGC 330 using multiband BVRI+Hα imaging. We identified Hα emitters within the entire V-band range covered by SAMI/SOAR observations (V ≲ 22), comprising the complete B-type stellar population and offering a unique opportunity to explore the Be phenomenon across all spectral subclasses. The stellar radial distribution shows a clear bimodal pattern between the most massive (B5 or earlier) and the lower mass main-sequence objects (later than B6) within the cluster. The former is concentrated toward the cluster center (showing a dispersion of σ = 4.26 ± 0.20 pc), whereas the latter extends across larger radii (σ = 10.83 ± 0.65 pc), indicating mass stratification within NGC 330. The total fraction of emitters is 4.4% ± 0.5%, notably smaller than previous estimates from flux- or seeing-limited observations. However, a higher fraction of Hα emitters is observed among higher mass stars (32.8% ± 3.4%) than within lower mass (4.4% ± 0.9%). Consequently, the putative CBe population exhibits distinct dynamical characteristics compared to the bulk of the stellar population in NGC 330. These findings highlight the significance of the current observations in providing a complete picture of the CBe population in NGC 330.

<div> gravitational scattering, three-body binary formation, unequal masses, wide-binary formation, energy dissipation<br />
总结:<br />
本研究探讨了三体双星形成问题，考虑了质量不相等、有限大小和后牛顿效应等因素。研究发现，三体双星形成多通过非共振相互作用实现，并且偏好形成宽双星。在宽双星中，三体双星形成时偏心率较高，这或许有助于解释天文观测中观测到的偏心率较高的宽双星。相比之下，硬双星形成相对较少，且具有热力学偏心率分布。能量耗散通过引力辐射导致从三个最初无关联体系中形成绑定的分级三体系统的概率较小。总的来说，本研究揭示了三体双星形成的一些重要特征和概率分布。 <div>
We explore three-body binary formation (3BBF), the formation of a bound system via gravitational scattering of three initially unbound bodies (3UB), using direct numerical integrations. For the first time, we consider systems with unequal masses, as well as finite-size and post-Newtonian effects. Our analytically derived encounter rates and numerical scattering results reproduce the 3BBF rate predicted by Goodman & Hut for hard binaries in dense star clusters. We find that 3BBF occurs overwhelmingly through nonresonant encounters and that the two most-massive bodies are never the most likely to bind. Instead, 3BBF favors pairing the two least-massive bodies (for wide binaries) or the most- plus least-massive bodies (for hard binaries). 3BBF overwhelmingly favors wide-binary formation with superthermal eccentricities, perhaps helping to explain the eccentric wide binaries observed by Gaia. Hard-binary formation is far rarer, but with a thermal eccentricity distribution. The semimajor axis distribution scales cumulatively as a3 for hard and slightly wider binaries. Although mergers are rare between black holes when including relativistic effects, direct collisions occur frequently between main-sequence stars—more often than hard 3BBF. Yet, these collisions do not significantly suppress hard 3BBF at the low-velocity dispersions typical of open or globular clusters. Energy dissipation through gravitational radiation leads to a small probability of a bound, hierarchical triple system forming directly from 3UB.

<br />这篇文章研究了附近非均匀性对观测者对哈勃常数推断的影响。大尺度结构引起了宇宙学参数对观察者位置的依赖性，以及这些参数在观察者视野中的各向异性方差。作者使用数值相对论模拟的大尺度结构和光线追踪相结合，生成了合成目录，模仿低红移Pantheon超新星数据集。数据包含模拟中测地线上距离和红移的广义相对论贡献。他们使用这些合成观测来约束一组随机位置的观察者的H0。研究了观察者位置的依赖性以及旋转SNe样本对观察者的天空的影响。他们发现当观察者使用各向同性样本时，H0在不同观察者之间有1%–2%的变化。然而，他们发现当观察者简单地在天空上旋转他们的Pantheon数据集时，推断的H0值可能会变化高达3%–6%。尽管我们发现的方差低于“哈勃张力”的水平，但我们的结果可能表明，如果能够正确考虑扩张的各向异性，张力的重要性可能会减少。<br /><br />总结: 本文研究了大尺度结构对观测者哈勃常数推断的影响，发现观察者位置和超新星样本旋转会对H0的推断产生1%–6%的变化。这可能暗示着在正确考虑扩张的各向异性情况下，哈勃张力的重要性可能会减少。 <div>
We study the impact of nearby inhomogeneities on an observer’s inference of the Hubble constant. Large-scale structures induce a dependence of cosmological parameters on observer position as well as an anisotropic variance of those parameters across an observer’s sky. While the former has been explored quite thoroughly, the latter has not. Incomplete sampling of an anisotropic sky could introduce a bias in our cosmological inference if we assume an isotropic expansion law. In this work, we use numerical relativity simulations of large-scale structure combined with ray tracing to produce synthetic catalogs mimicking the low-redshift Pantheon supernova (SN) data set. Our data contain all general-relativistic contributions to fluctuations in the distances and redshifts along geodesics in the simulation. We use these synthetic observations to constrain H0 for a set of randomly positioned observers. We study both the dependence on observer position as well as the impact of rotating the sample of SNe on the observer’s sky. We find a 1%–2% variance in H0 between observers when they use an isotropic sample of objects. However, we find the inferred value of H0 can change by up to 3%–6% when observers simply rotate their Pantheon data set on the sky. While the variances we find are below the level of the “Hubble tension,” our results may suggest a reduction in the significance of the tension if anisotropy of expansion can be correctly accounted for.

Prominence bubbles, the dark arch-shaped voids below quiescent prominences, are generally believed to be caused by the interaction between the prominences and the slowly emerging or quasi-stable underlying magnetic loops. However, this scenario could not explain some short-lived bubbles with extremely dynamic properties of evolution. Based on high-resolution Hα observations, here we propose that bubbles should be classified into two categories according to their dynamic properties: quasi-steady Type-I bubbles and transient Type-II bubbles. Type-I bubbles could remain relatively stable and last for several hours, indicating the existence of a quasi-stable magnetic topology, while Type-II bubbles grow and collapse quickly within 1 hr without stability duration, which are usually associated with erupting minifilaments. Analysis of several typical Type-II bubbles from different views, especially including an on-disk event, reveals that Type-II bubbles quickly appear and expand at a velocity of ∼5–25 km s−1 accompanied by an erupting minifilament below. The minifilament’s rising velocity is slightly larger than that of the Type-II bubbles’ boundary, which will lead to the collision with each other in a short time, subsequent collapse of Type-II bubbles, and formation of a large plume into the above prominence. We also speculate that only if the angle between the axis of the erupting minifilament and the line of sight is large enough, the interaction between the erupting minifilament and the overlying prominence could trigger a Type-II bubble with a typical arch-shaped but quickly expanding bright boundary.

红外光谱观测表明星际介质和太阳系冰中存在固体甲醇(CH3OH)，但冰中CH3OH的丰度需要准确的带强度、光学常数和参考光谱来推导。本文识别了文献中关于甲醇冰红外强度的分歧、遗漏和空白，包括几十年来未解决的问题。我们呈现了新的光谱，并通过固体CH3OH的折射率和密度的新数据来辅助强度测量。结果是不同实验室组的大量不一致结果现在可以得到解决。多种冰用于确定已知成分的H2O + CH3OH混合物的红外强度，可用于对星际冰的观测。也是首次，用不同厚度的CH3OH冰进行了测量，报告了行星科学家使用的两个近红外特征的带强度和光学常数。我们利用新的红外结果确定了固体CH3OH的蒸气压，并将其与石英晶体微天平测量进行了比较。对甲醇冰进行了热退火，并研究了固态中的相变。在可能的情况下将我们的结果与以前的工作进行了比较，并提供了我们新结果的电子版本。<br /><br />总结: 本文通过红外光谱观测确定了固体甲醇的存在，并消除了不同实验室组的不一致结果。还首次测量了H2O + CH3OH混合物和不同厚度的CH3OH冰的红外强度和光学常数。同时，还对固态甲醇的蒸气压和相变进行了研究。 <div>
Infrared spectroscopic observations have established the presence of solid methanol (CH3OH) in the interstellar medium and in solar system ices, but the abundance of frozen CH3OH cannot be deduced without accurate band strengths, optical constants, and reference spectra. In this paper we identify disagreements, omissions, and gaps in the literature on infrared (IR) intensities of methanol ices, including unaddressed concerns that reach back several decades. New spectra are presented with intensity measurements aided by new data on the index of refraction and density of solid CH3OH. The result is that the large discordant results from different laboratory groups can now be reconciled. Multiple ices have been used to determine, apparently for the first time, IR intensities of H2O + CH3OH mixtures of accurately known composition for use with observations of interstellar ices. Also for the first time, measurements on CH3OH ices with different thicknesses have allowed us to report both near-IR band strengths and optical constants for two near-IR features used by planetary scientists. We have used our new IR results to determine vapor pressures of solid CH3OH and have compared them to measurements made with a quartz-crystal microbalance. Thermal annealings of methanol ices have been carried out and phase changes in the solid state examined. Comparisons of our results to earlier work are presented where possible, and electronic versions of our new results are made available.

总结:<br />
本研究针对嵌入在活动星系核盘中的双黑洞系统进行了三维模拟，发现逆行双黑洞会比顺行双黑洞收缩得更快，并且其轨道离心率增长速度随着离心率呈单调递增趋势。结果表明，逆行双黑洞可能经历离心率快速增长，导致它们在近日点距离足够接近，从而被引力波辐射驱使合并。而顺行双黑洞收缩速度远快于其轨道离心率减小速度，因此它们在合并过程中可能保持适度的离心率。此外，由活动星系核盘驱动的双黑洞进动可能会主导，取决于双黑洞的吸积率和其在盘中的位置，这可能抑制了时间晕共振和von Ziepel–Lidov–Kozai循环效应。 <div>
Binary black holes (BBHs) embedded within the accretion disks that fuel active galactic nuclei (AGN) are promising progenitors for the source of gravitational wave (GW) events detected by LIGO/VIRGO. Several recent studies have shown that when these binaries form, they are likely to be highly eccentric and retrograde. However, many uncertainties remain concerning the orbital evolution of these binaries as they either inspiral toward merger or disassociate. Previous hydrodynamical simulations exploring their orbital evolution have been predominantly two-dimensional or have been restricted to binaries on nearly circular orbits. We present the first high-resolution, three-dimensional local shearing-box simulations of both prograde and retrograde eccentric BBHs embedded in AGN disks. We find that retrograde binaries shrink several times faster than their prograde counterparts and exhibit significant orbital eccentricity growth, the rate of which monotonically increases with binary eccentricity. Our results suggest that retrograde binaries may experience runaway orbital eccentricity growth, which may bring them close enough together at pericenter for GW emission to drive them to coalescence. Although their eccentricity is damped, prograde binaries shrink much faster than their orbital eccentricity decays, suggesting they should remain modestly eccentric as they contract toward merger. Finally, binary precession driven by the AGN disk may dominate over precession induced by the supermassive black hole depending on the binary accretion rate and its location in the AGN disk, which can subdue the evection resonance and von Ziepel–Lidov–Kozai cycles.

总结:<br />
这篇文章主要研究了太阳耀斑期间的两种重要现象，即色球蒸发（CE）和日冕雨（CR），并且使用了IRIS和AIA进行观测和比较。研究发现CE标志着热量流入耀斑环的开始，而CR标志着以冷、致密凝结的形式流出的末端。CE的观测结果显示，其上升平均速度为138 ± 35 km/s，温度为9.03 ± 3.28 × 106 K。此外，CR在耀斑过程中的变化也得到了观测，其质量和密度增加约4.4和6倍，速度增加约1.4倍，而团块宽度变化不明显。研究结果还发现，CE的位置和形态与CR的位置和形态非常相似，说明它们在质量和能量传输方面起着关键作用。此外，研究还得出CR的能量相当于CE能量的一半，表明CR在耀斑的质量-能量循环中起着重要作用。 <div>
Chromospheric evaporation (CE) and coronal rain (CR) represent two crucial phenomena encompassing the circulation of mass and energy during solar flares. While CE marks the start of the hot inflow into the flaring loop, CR marks the end, indicating the outflow in the form of cool and dense condensations. With the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on the Solar Dynamics Observatory, we examine and compare the evolution, dynamics, morphology, and energetics of the CR and CE during a C2.1 flare. The CE is directly observed in imaging and spectra in the Fe xxi line with IRIS and in the Fe xviii line of AIA, with upward average total speeds of 138 ± 35 km s−1 and a temperature of 9.03 ± 3.28 × 106 K. An explosive-to-gentle CE transition is observed, with an apparent reduction in turbulence. From quiescent to gradual flare phase, the amount and density of CR increase by a factor of ≈4.4 and 6, respectively. The rain’s velocity increases by a factor of 1.4, in agreement with gas pressure drag. In contrast, the clump width variation is negligible. The location and morphology of CE match closely those of the rain showers, with similar CE substructure to the rain strands, reflecting fundamental scales of mass and energy transport. We obtain a CR outflow mass three times larger than the CE inflow mass, suggesting the presence of unresolved CE, perhaps at higher temperatures. The CR energy corresponds to half that of the CE. These results suggest an essential role of CR in the mass−energy cycle of a flare.

The chemical abundances of Milky Way’s (MW's) satellites reflect their star formation histories (SFHs), yet, due to the difficulty of determining the ages of old stars, the SFHs of most satellites are poorly measured. Ongoing and upcoming surveys will obtain around 10 times more medium-resolution spectra for stars in satellites than are currently available. To correctly extract SFHs from large samples of chemical abundances, the relationship between chemical abundances and SFHs needs to be clarified. Here, we perform a high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulation of a MW-like galaxy with detailed models of star formation, supernova (SN) feedback, and metal diffusion. We quantify SFHs, metallicity distribution functions, and the α-element (Mg, Ca, and Si) abundances in satellites of the host galaxy. We find that star formation in most simulated satellites is quenched before infalling to their host. Star formation episodes in simulated satellites are separated by a few hundred Myr owing to SN feedback; each star formation event produces groups of stars with similar [α/Fe] and [Fe/H]. We then perform a mock observation of the upcoming Subaru Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) observations. We find that Subaru PFS will be able to detect distinct groups of stars in [α/Fe] versus [Fe/H] space, produced by episodic star formation. This result means that episodic SFHs can be estimated from the chemical abundances of ≳1000 stars determined with medium-resolution spectroscopy.

总结: 
内部重力波可能会在恒星内部引起混合。研究表明，这些波造成的混合会随着年龄和质量的变化而发生显著改变。本文通过考虑零龄主序和中期主序时的7太阳质量模型，来研究旋转对这种波混合的影响。我们比较了一系列旋转速率（1 × 10^-5, 2 × 10^-5, 3 × 10^-5, 4 × 10^-5, 和 1 × 10^-4 rad s^-1）时的混合剖面，观察到随着罗斯贝数的减小，混合减少。这可以归因于旋转对对流的影响，它影响了在对流-辐射界面附近激发波的振幅。 <br /><br /> <div>
Internal gravity waves are likely to cause mixing in stellar interiors. Studies show that the mixing by these waves changes drastically across age and mass. Here, we study the effect of rotation on this wave mixing by considering a 7 M⊙ model at zero-age main sequence and mid-main sequence. We compare the mixing profiles at a range of rotation rates (1 × 10−5, 2 × 10−5, 3 × 10−5, 4 × 10−5, and 1 × 10−4 rad s−1) and observe that the mixing decreases with decreasing Rossby number. This can be attributed to the effect of rotation on convection, which influences the amplitude with which the waves are excited near the convective–radiative interface.

We present photometric and spectroscopic observations and analysis of the Type IIb supernova (SN) SN 2019tua, which exhibits multiple bumps in its declining light curves between 40 and 65 days after discovery. SN 2019tua shows a time to peak of about 25 days, similar to other Type IIb SNe. Our observations indicate a decrease in its brightness of about 1 mag in the 60 days after the peak. At about days 50 and 60, its multiband light curves exhibit bumpy behavior. The complex luminosity evolution of SN 2019tua could not be well modeled with a single currently popular energy source model, e.g., radioactive decay of 56Ni, magnetar, interaction between the ejecta and a circumstellar shell. Even though the magnetar model has a smaller χ2/dof value, the complex changes in SN 2019tua’s brightness suggest that more than one physical process might be involved. We propose a hybrid circumstellar medium (CSM) interaction plus 56Ni model to explain the bolometric light curve of SN 2019tua. The fitting results show that the ejecta mass Mej ≈ 2.4 M⊙, the total CSM mass MCSM ≈ 1.0 M⊙, and the 56Ni mass MNi ≈ 0.4 M⊙. The total kinetic energy of the ejecta is Ek ≈ 0.5 × 1051 erg. Preexisting multiple shells suggest that the progenitor of SN 2019tua experienced mass ejections within approximately ∼6–44 yr prior to the explosion.

总结:<br />
SN H0pe是在红移z=1.78处使用James Webb太空望远镜发现的一个三重成像超新星。通过NIRSpec的跟进光谱，首先确定了SN的分类为Ia型，并测量了三个影像的相对时间延迟。利用Hsiao07 SN模板，确定了三个影像的绝对相位，并得出了它们之间的时间延迟。通过SALT3-NIR模型验证了这些值的一致性。研究还发现，在使用Hsiao07模板光谱进行模拟时，对推断出的影像延迟有一些影响，但是这种影响在统计上并不显著。 <div>
SN H0pe is a triply imaged supernova (SN) at redshift z = 1.78 discovered using the James Webb Space Telescope. In order to classify the SN spectroscopically and measure the relative time delays of its three images (designated A, B, and C), we acquired NIRSpec follow-up spectroscopy spanning 0.6–5 μm. From the high signal-to-noise spectra of the two bright images B and C, we first classify the SN, whose spectra most closely match those of SN 1994D and SN 2013dy, as a Type Ia SN. We identify prominent blueshifted absorption features corresponding to Si iiλ6355 and Ca ii H λ3970 and K λ3935. We next measure the absolute phases of the three images from our spectra, which allow us to constrain their relative time delays. The absolute phases of the three images, determined by fitting the three spectra to Hsiao07 SN templates, are days, days, and days for the brightest to faintest images. These correspond to relative time delays between Image A and Image B and between Image B and Image C of days and days, respectively. The SALT3-NIR model yields phases and time delays consistent with these values. After unblinding, we additionally explored the effect of using Hsiao07 template spectra for simulations through 80 days instead of 60 days past maximum, and found a small (11.5 and 1.0 days, respectively) yet statistically insignificant (∼0.25σ and ∼0.1σ) effect on the inferred image delays.

该研究通过观察彗星Leonard（C/2021 A1）的尾巴与太阳风的相互作用，采用太阳风模型和新的数据同化技术进行对比分析。结果表明，尾巴的脱离是由于穿越日地电流片和进入SIR（流相互作用区）导致的。这一结果更加符合数据同化模型的预测，表明了这种方法的价值。这些案例研究扩展了我们对彗星与太阳风相互作用的理解，同时也展示了数据同化在太阳风建模中的实用性。研究还指出，彗星可以作为添加的太阳风条件的实时测量方式，特别是在没有现有实时探测器的区域，这有望进一步改进未来的太阳风数据同化。 <br /><br />总结: <div>
Cometary tails display dynamic behavior attributed to interactions with solar wind structures. Consequently, comet-tail observations can serve as in situ solar wind monitors. During 2021 December, Comet Leonard (C/2021 A1) was observed by the STEREO-A heliospheric imager. The comet tail exhibited various signatures of interactions with the solar wind including bending, kink formation, and finally complete disconnection. In this study, we compare the timing of these events with solar wind structures predicted by the Heliospheric Upwind eXtrapolation model with a time-dependency (or HUXt) solar wind model using new solar wind data assimilation (DA) techniques. This serves both to provide the most accurate solar wind context to interpret the cometary processes, but also as a test of the DA and an example of how comet observations can be used in model validation studies. Coronal mass ejections, stream interaction regions (SIRs), and heliospheric current sheet (HCS) crossings were all considered as potential causes of the tail disconnection. The results suggest the tail disconnection at Comet Leonard was the result of it crossing the HCS and into an SIR. The timing of these features agree better with the DA model results than the non-DA model, showing the value of this approach. Case studies such as this expand our understanding of comet–solar wind interactions, and in demonstrating the utility of DA for solar wind modeling. We note that this could lead to comets acting as additional in situ measures for solar wind conditions for regions where no in situ spacecraft are available, potentially improving solar wind DA in the future.

<div> 关键词: 太阳大气结构, 小型丝状结构, 耀斑, 磁场模型, 等离子体爆发 

总结:

这篇文章研究了太阳大气中的小型丝状结构的形成和爆发机制。观察到的变化包括丝状结构从弓形线转变为两个J形弧，并最终形成S形。同时，在丝状结构的南部发生了两次等离子体耀斑。爆发起始于南部，然后与上方的大型丝状结构相互作用并失败。观测到的磁场异常与观测结果相一致。研究结果表明，爆发是由于丝状结构核心磁场与外部磁场由于磁通消除而引起的磁重连。这项研究揭示了丝状结构爆发的新触发机制，以及丝状结构爆发和等离子体耀斑之间的新关系。 <div>
Minifilaments are widespread small-scale structures in the solar atmosphere. To better understand their formation and eruption mechanisms, we investigate the entire life of a sigmoidal minifilament located below a large quiescent filament observed by Big Bear Solar Observatory/Goode Solar Telescope on 2015 August 3. The Hα structure initially appears as a group of arched threads, then transforms into two J-shaped arcades, and finally forms a sigmoidal shape. Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly observations in 171 Å show that two coronal jets occur around the southern footpoint of the minifilament before the minifilament eruption. The minifilament eruption starts from the southern footpoint, then interacts with the overlying filament and fails. The aforementioned observational changes correspond to three episodes of flux cancellations observed by SDO/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager. Unlike previous studies, the flux cancellation occurs between the polarity where the southern footpoint of the minifilament is rooted and an external polarity. We construct two magnetic field models before the eruption using the flux rope insertion method and find a hyperbolic flux tube above the flux cancellation site. The observation and modeling results suggest that the eruption is triggered by the external magnetic reconnection between the core field of the minifilament and the external fields due to flux cancellations. This study reveals a new triggering mechanism for minifilament eruptions and a new relationship between minifilament eruptions and coronal jets.

We present a suite of models of the coherent magnetic field of the Galaxy based on new divergence-free parametric functions describing the global structure of the field. The model parameters are fit to the latest full-sky Faraday rotation measures (RMs) of extragalactic sources and polarized synchrotron intensity (PI) maps from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe and Planck. We employ multiple models for the density of thermal and cosmic-ray electrons in the Galaxy, needed to predict the sky maps of RMs and PI for a given Galactic magnetic field (GMF) model. The robustness of the inferred properties of the GMF is gauged by studying many combinations of parametric field models and electron density models. We determine the pitch angle of the local magnetic field (11° ± 1°), explore the evidence for a grand-design spiral coherent magnetic field (inconclusive), determine the strength of the toroidal and poloidal magnetic halo fields below and above the disk (magnitudes the same for both hemispheres within ≈10%), set constraints on the half-height of the cosmic-ray diffusion volume (≥2.9 kpc), investigate the compatibility of RM- and PI-derived magnetic field strengths (compatible under certain assumptions), and check if the toroidal halo field could be created by the shear of the poloidal halo field due to the differential rotation of the Galaxy (possibly). A set of eight models is identified to help quantify the present uncertainties in the coherent GMF spanning different functional forms, data products, and auxiliary input. We present the corresponding sky maps of rates for axion–photon conversion in the Galaxy and deflections of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章通过对34个正常类型II超新星（SNe II）的样本进行研究，提供了多波段的UV光曲线以及X射线观测数据。研究表明，早期UV-光学颜色和黑体的演变与冲击冷却（SC）一致，即使存在“闪烁电离”特征。此外，文章提出了一个适合SC模型的框架，可以复现多组模拟的参数。通过X射线数据，得出大多数SN II的母体恒星在爆炸前几年失去了。研究还发现，红超巨星（RSGs）爆炸成为SNe II的半径符合观测到的RSGs半径分布，但尾部延伸至更大的半径，这可能是由于周围存在星周物质的存在。 <div>
We present a sample of 34 normal Type II supernovae (SNe II) detected with the Zwicky Transient Facility, with multiband UV light curves starting at t ≤ 4 days after explosion, and X-ray observations. We characterize the early UV-optical color, provide empirical host-extinction corrections, and show that the t > 2 day UV-optical colors and the blackbody evolution of the sample are consistent with shock cooling (SC) regardless of the presence of “flash ionization” features. We present a framework for fitting SC models that can reproduce the parameters of a set of multigroup simulations up to 20% in radius and velocity. Observations of 15 SNe II are well fit by models with breakout radii <1014 cm. Eighteen SNe are typically more luminous, with observations at t ≥ 1 day that are better fit by a model with a large >1014 cm breakout radius. However, these fits predict an early rise during the first day that is too slow. We suggest that these large-breakout events are explosions of stars with an inflated envelope or with confined circumstellar material (CSM). Using the X-ray data, we derive constraints on the extended (∼1015 cm) CSM density independent of spectral modeling and find that most SN II progenitors lose up to a few years before explosion. We show that the overall observed breakout radius distribution is skewed to higher radii due to a luminosity bias. We argue that the of red supergiants (RSGs) explode as SNe II with breakout radii consistent with the observed distribution of RSGs, with a tail extending to large radii, likely due to the presence of CSM.

总结: 
TNJ1338-1942星系是一个具有强大离子化气体流出的高红移星系，通过JWST的近红外光谱仪(NIRSpec)观测到了15千秒巨大的流出，并测量了流出速率。观测显示出流出的气体速度超过900 km/s，宽度超过1200 km/s，空间上与最亮的无线电叶重叠。这表明无线电射流对流出动力学负责。总质量流出率约为500 M⊙年，动能远大于流出离子化气体的能量。这意味着动能从射流转移到气体的效率不高。由此推测大部分的能量可能以热X射线为形式。
<br /><br /> <div>
We report observations of a powerful ionized gas outflow in the z = 4.1 luminous radio galaxy TNJ1338-1942 hosting an obscured quasar using the Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) on board JWST. We spatially resolve a large-scale (∼15 kpc) outflow and measure outflow rates. The outflowing gas shows velocities exceeding 900 km s−1 and broad line profiles with widths exceeding 1200 km s−1 located at an ∼10 kpc projected distance from the central nucleus. The outflowing nebula spatially overlaps with the brightest radio lobe, indicating that the powerful radio jets are responsible for the outflow kinematics. The gas is possibly ionized by the obscured quasar with a contribution from shocks induced by the jets. The mass outflow rate map shows that the region with the broadest line profiles exhibits the strongest outflow rates. The total mass outflow rate is ∼500 M⊙ yr−1, and the mass loading factor is ∼1, indicating that a significant part of the gas is displaced outwards by the outflow. Our hypothesis is that the overpressured shocked jet fluid expands laterally to create an expanding ellipsoidal “cocoon” that causes the surrounding gas to accelerate outwards. The total kinetic energy injected by the radio jet is about 3 orders of magnitude larger than the energy in the outflowing ionized gas. This implies that kinetic energy must be transferred inefficiently from the jets to the gas. The bulk of the deposited energy possibly lies in the form of hot X-ray-emitting gas.

总结: <br /><br />这篇文章总结了Super-Kamiokande (SK)在探测银河系核心坍缩超新星爆发的多信使观测中的关键作用，特别是通过增加水中的钆浓度来提高中子探测能力，改进了实时超新星监测系统，并介绍了SK_SN Notice预警系统的发布和功能。文章还通过模拟银河系超新星，分析了SK-Gd对不同超新星模型的指向精度，发现其指向精度在3°至7°之间。此外，文章还提到了SK_SN Notice可以在距离小于10千秒差距的情况下提供3度精度的报警，有利于天文望远镜的后续观测。 <div>
Among multimessenger observations of the next Galactic core-collapse supernova, Super-Kamiokande (SK) plays a critical role in detecting the emitted supernova neutrinos, determining the direction to the supernova (SN), and notifying the astronomical community of these observations in advance of the optical signal. In 2022, SK has increased the gadolinium dissolved in its water target (SK-Gd) and has achieved a Gd concentration of 0.033%, resulting in enhanced neutron detection capability, which in turn enables more accurate determination of the supernova direction. Accordingly, SK-Gd’s real-time supernova monitoring system has been upgraded. SK_SN Notice, a warning system that works together with this monitoring system, was released on 2021 December 13, and is available through GCN Notices. When the monitoring system detects an SN-like burst of events, SK_SN Notice will automatically distribute an alarm with the reconstructed direction to the supernova candidate within a few minutes. In this paper, we present a systematic study of SK-Gd’s response to a simulated Galactic SN. Assuming a supernova situated at 10 kpc, neutrino fluxes from six supernova models are used to characterize SK-Gd’s pointing accuracy using the same tools as the online monitoring system. The pointing accuracy is found to vary from 3° to 7° depending on the models. However, if the supernova is closer than 10 kpc, SK_SN Notice can issue an alarm with three-degree accuracy, which will benefit follow-up observations by optical telescopes with large fields of view.

<div> 关键词: Parker Solar Probe, 冠状物质抛射, 等离子体加速, 磁流体结构, 电子通量

总结:
帕克太阳探测器在0.2天文单位观察到了一个事件，该事件显示了成像和原位测量的一致性，证实了冠状物质抛射（CME）的磁流体结构内存在磁力线圈。在CME的边缘结构中，存在孤立的磁通管、湍流护层以及CME本身。湍流护层和CME区间的分布更均匀，谱线更软，Fe/O和He/H的丰度比低于孤立的磁通管，但高于典型的等离子体和太阳高能粒子丰度。这表明了来自耀斑和等离子体的加速粒子增强。孤立的磁通管显示了大的流动、硬谱线和较大的Fe/O和He/H比值，表明有耀斑源。在CME区间，从超热到高能粒子能量范围内，能量粒子通量增强，表明有粒子加速和在封闭磁结构内的约束。CME的磁力线圈形态有助于局部调制和困留高能粒子，特别是沿着螺旋度通道和其他等离子体边界。因此，CME有助于积聚高能粒子群，使它们在内部太阳圈层内被输送到后续的高能粒子加速。 <div>
We present an event observed by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) at ∼0.2 au on 2022 March 2 in which imaging and in situ measurements coincide. During this event, PSP passed through structures on the flank of a streamer blowout coronal mass ejection (CME) including an isolated flux tube in front of the CME, a turbulent sheath, and the CME itself. Imaging observations and in situ helicity and principal variance signatures consistently show the presence of flux ropes internal to the CME. In both the sheath and the CME interval, the distributions are more isotropic, the spectra are softer, and the abundance ratios of Fe/O and He/H are lower than those in the isolated flux tube, and yet elevated relative to typical plasma and solar energetic particle abundances. These signatures in the sheath and the CME indicate that both flare populations and those from the plasma are accelerated to form the observed energetic particle enhancements. In contrast, the isolated flux tube shows large streaming, hard spectra, and large Fe/O and He/H ratios, indicating flare sources. Energetic particle fluxes are most enhanced within the CME interval from suprathermal through energetic particle energies (∼keV to >10 MeV), indicating particle acceleration, as well as confinement local to the closed magnetic structure. The flux-rope morphology of the CME helps to enable local modulation and trapping of energetic particles, in particular along helicity channels and other plasma boundaries. Thus, the CME acts to build up energetic particle populations, allowing them to be fed into subsequent higher-energy particle acceleration throughout the inner heliosphere where a compression or shock forms on the CME front.

总结:
本文通过对四个开放星团的研究发现，星团的潮汐尾巴中的星星数量存在对称性偏差，明显偏向于前导尾巴。研究表明，在牛顿引力下，星团的演化速度比Milgromian 动力学下更慢，COIN-Gaia 13星团已经几乎完全解散。这一发现对牛顿引力的正确性提出了质疑。由此引出了对广义相对论的相关测试和银河系的旋转曲线的讨论。 <div>
Stars that evaporate from their star cluster by the energy equipartition process end up in either a leading or a trailing tidal tail. In Newtonian gravitation and for open star clusters in the solar vicinity, the tidal threshold, or práh, for escape is symmetrical, such that the leading and trailing tails are equally populated. The data from six independent teams that applied the convergent point method to map out the tidal tails of four open clusters (the Hyades, Praesepe, Coma Berenices, and COIN-Gaia 13) using Gaia DR2 and DR3 are here applied to test for the expected symmetry. All tidal tails contain more stars in the leading tail. The combined confidence amounts to an 8σ falsification of the práh symmetry. The same test using Milgromian dynamics leads to consistency with the data. More effort needs to be exerted on this matter, but the data indicate with high confidence that the tidal práh of an open star cluster is asymmetrical, with the corresponding confidence that Newtonian gravitation is falsified. Open star clusters depopulate more rapidly in Milgromian than in Newtonian dynamics, and the COIN-Gaia 13 cluster is here found to be nearly completely dissolved. In view of these results, the wide-binary star test and the finding of a Keplerian Galactic rotation curve are briefly discussed.

In star clusters, close stellar encounters can strongly impact the architecture of a planetary system or even destroy it. We present a systematic study of the effects of stellar flybys on two-planet systems. When such a system experiences flybys, one or both planets can be ejected, forming free-floating planets (FFPs), captured planets (CPs) around the flyby star, and free-floating binary planets (BPs); the remaining single-surviving planets (SSPs) can have their orbital radii and eccentricities greatly changed. Through numerical experiments, we calculate the formation fractions (or branching ratios) of FFPs, SSPs, CPs, and BPs as a function of the pericenter distance of the flyby, and use them to derive analytical expressions for the formation rates of FFPs, SSPs, CPs and BPs in general cluster environments. We find that the production rates of FFPs and SSPs are similar (for the initial planet semimajor axis ratio a1/a2 = 0.6–0.8), while the rate for CPs is a few times smaller. The formation fraction of BPs depends strongly on a1/a2 and on the planet masses. For Jupiter-mass planets, the formation fraction of BPs is always less than 1% (for a1/a2 = 0.8) and typically much smaller (≲0.2% for a1/a2 ≲ 0.7). The fraction remains less than 1% when considering 4MJ planets. Overall, when averaging over all flybys, the production rate of BPs is less than 0.1% of that of FFPs. We also derive the velocity distribution of FFPs produced by stellar flybys, and the orbital parameter distributions of SSPs, CPs, and BPs. These results can be used in future studies of exotic planets (including FFPs) and planetary systems.

ASKAP J173608.2–321635是一种射电瞬变现象，在2020年的观测中表现出多个特征，包括不同时期的通量密度、带内谱指数、旋转测量值和极化特征。根据数据解释，该源被推测为与不断变化的环境相互作用的高声速中子星。 <div>
The radio transient ASKAP J173608.2–321635, at the position (ℓ, b) = (356.°0872, −0.°0390), was serendipitously observed by The H i/OH/Recombination line survey of the Galactic center at three epochs in 2020 March, 2020 April, and 2021 February. The source was detected only on 2020 April 11 with a flux density of 20.6 ± 1.1 mJy at 1.23 GHz and in-band spectral index of α = −3.1 ± 0.2. The commensal Very Large Array Low-band Ionsophere and Transient Experiment simultaneously detected the source at 339 MHz with a flux density of 122.6 ± 20.4 mJy, indicating a spectral break below 1 GHz. The rotation measure (RM) in 2020 April was 63.9 ± 0.3 rad m−2, which almost triples the range of the variable RM observed by Wang et al. to ∼130 rad m−2. The polarization angle, corrected for Faraday rotation, was 97° ± 6°. The 1.23 GHz linear polarization was 76.7% ± 3.9% with wavelength-dependent depolarization, indicating a Faraday depth dispersion of . We find an upper limit to the circular polarization of ∣V∣/I < 10.1%. Interpretation of the data in terms of diffractive scattering of radio waves by a plasma near the source indicates an electron density and a line-of-sight magnetic field strength within a factor of 3 of ne ∼ 2 cm−3 and B∥ ∼ 2 × 105μG. Combined with causality limits to the size of the source, these parameters are consistent with the low-frequency spectral break resulting from synchrotron self-absorption, not free–free absorption. A possible interpretation of the source is a highly supersonic neutron star interacting with a changing environment.

这篇文章研究了f(R)引力理论下的宇宙大爆炸核合成，并考虑了辐射时代原始黑洞对引力的修改所引入的额外自由度。研究发现，在一定范围的scalaron质量下，锂的丰度降低了3-4倍，这有助于解决宇宙锂问题。同时，氦的丰度符合观测界限。然而，氘的丰度提高了3-6倍，这需要恒星形成和演化过程对原始氘的破坏具有高效率，这在scalaron引力理论中是可能的。文章还提出了scalaron质量与黑洞质量的新关系，并指出了在这一scalaron质量范围内的原始黑洞可作为非重子暗物质的潜在候选者。最后，文章推断了幂律f(R)引力与原始黑洞的大爆炸等效性，并指出这种黑洞可以被即将到来的引力波探测器所探测到。<br /><br />总结: 这篇文章研究了f(R)引力理论下的宇宙大爆炸核合成，发现特定范围的scalaron质量下，锂的丰度降低，氦的丰度符合观测界限，氘的丰度增加。文章还提出了scalaron质量与黑洞质量的关系，并推断了幂律f(R)引力与原始黑洞的大爆炸等效性。 <div>
f(R) gravity is one of the serious alternatives of general relativity with a large range of astronomical consequences. In this work, we study Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) in f(R) gravity theory. We consider a modification to gravity due to the existence of primordial black holes (PBHs) in the radiation era that introduce additional degrees of freedom known as scalarons. We calculate the light element abundances by using the BBN code PArthENoPE. It is found that for a range of scalaron mass (2.2 − 3.5) × 104 eV, the abundance of lithium is lowered by 3−4 times the value predicted by general relativistic BBN, which is a level desired to address the cosmological lithium problem. For the above scalaron mass range, the helium abundance is within the observed bound. However, the deuterium abundance is found to be increased by 3−6 times the observed primordial abundance. It calls for a high efficiency of stellar formation and evolution processes for the destruction of primordial deuterium, which is suggested as possible in scalaron gravity. A novel relation between scalaron mass and black hole mass has been used to show that the above scalaron mass range corresponds to PBHs of subplanetary mass (∼1019 g) serving as one of the potential candidates of nonbaryonic dark matter. We infer Big Bang equivalence of power-law f(R) gravity with PBHs that are detectable with upcoming gravitational wave detectors.

<div> 关键词: 总质量分布, 强引力透镜, 透镜建模, 红移, 动力学观测

总结: 本文介绍了对AGEL调查中七个星系尺度透镜的透镜模型。利用HST/WFC3-F140W图像和GLEE软件进行建模，测量了折射器星系的总密度分布和γ-z关系。通过比较观测和模型预测的速度离散度，验证了透镜模型；得出平均密度梯度斜率为-1.95±0.09和γ-z关系在z<1时不随红移变化的结论。文章指出观测和模拟之间的冲突可能是由于透镜和动力学模型中的系统误差，观测与模拟之间的比较难度，以及假定总质量分布为简单的幂律。AGEL调查将提供更多zdefl>0.5的透镜，为当前理论模型预测的质量分布随红移演化提供更强的约束。<br /><br /> <div>
Observed evolution of the total mass distribution with redshift is crucial to testing galaxy evolution theories. To measure the total mass distribution, strong gravitational lenses complement the resolved dynamical observations that are currently limited to z ≲ 0.5. Here we present the lens models for a pilot sample of seven galaxy-scale lenses from the ASTRO3D Galaxy Evolution with Lenses (AGEL) survey. The AGEL lenses, modeled using HST/WFC3-F140W images with Gravitational Lens Efficient Explorer (GLEE) software, have deflector redshifts in the range 0.3 < zdefl < 0.9. Assuming a power-law density profile with slope γ, we measure the total density profile for the deflector galaxies via lens modeling. We also measure the stellar velocity dispersions (σobs) for four lenses and obtain σobs from SDSS-BOSS for the remaining lenses to test our lens models by comparing observed and model-predicted velocity dispersions. For the seven AGEL lenses, we measure an average density profile slope of −1.95 ± 0.09 and a γ–z relation that does not evolve with redshift at z < 1. Although our result is consistent with some observations and simulations, it differs from other studies at z < 1 that suggest the γ–z relation evolves with redshift. The apparent conflicts among observations and simulations may be due to a combination of (1) systematics in the lensing and dynamical modeling; (2) challenges in comparing observations with simulations; and (3) assuming a simple power law for the total mass distribution. By providing more lenses at zdefl > 0.5, the AGEL survey will provide stronger constraints on whether the mass profiles evolve with redshift as predicted by current theoretical models.

这篇文章研究了小尺度动力机的特性，其中假设速度场的相关时间为零。然后使用不为零的相关时间模型来研究动力机性能的影响。文章假设速度场为不可压缩的高斯随机场，并在傅里叶空间中推导了磁场的两点相关的演化方程的最低阶修正。然后得到了在非螺旋紊流中磁场的纵向相关函数（ML）的演化方程，该方程适用于任意的普朗特尔数。在高普朗特尔数的极限下进一步简化了这个方程，并发现磁场能量的增长率比先前报道的要小得多。尽管如此，磁场功率谱仍然在高普朗特尔数下保留了 Kazantsev形式。

The small-scale dynamo is typically studied by assuming that the correlation time of the velocity field is zero. Some authors have used a smooth renovating flow model to study how the properties of the dynamo are affected by the correlation time being nonzero. Here, we assume the velocity is an incompressible Gaussian random field (which need not be smooth), and derive the lowest-order corrections to the evolution equation for the two-point correlation of the magnetic field in Fourier space. Using this, we obtain the evolution equation for the longitudinal correlation function of the magnetic field (ML) in nonhelical turbulence, valid for arbitrary Prandtl number. The nonresistive terms of this equation do not contain spatial derivatives of ML of order greater than 2. We further simplify this equation in the limit of high Prandtl number, and find that the growth rate of the magnetic energy is much smaller than previously reported. Nevertheless, the magnetic power spectrum still retains the Kazantsev form at high Prandtl number.

As a classical approach, the dynamics of the Universe, influenced by its dark components, are unveiled through prior modifications of Einstein’s equations. Cosmography, on the other hand, is a highly efficient tool for reconstructing any modified theory in a model-independent manner. By employing kinematic variables, it offers a profound explanation for cosmic expansion. Although the cosmographical approach has been highly successful in several geometric theories in recent years, it has not been extensively explored in coupled gravities. With this in mind, we intend to constrain an extended teleparallel gravity model, , through cosmographic parameters. We utilize Taylor series expansion, assuming a minimally coupled form, to constrain the unknowns involved in the series. To achieve this, we conduct a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis using three different data sets (cosmic chronometers, baryon acoustic oscillations, and Pantheon+SH0ES). The constrained results obtained from MCMC are then compared and verified using various cosmological parameters. Finally, we compare the resulting models with three well-known models.

双中子星合并被认为是短γ射线爆发的主要来源，并且产生了重元素。然而，对于双中子星的空间速度分布仍知之甚少。本研究利用VLBA确定了两个银河系双中子星的视运动和视差，并对所有11个具有准确视运动测量的双中子星进行了横向速度的估计。研究发现，双中子星的横向速度可能与自转周期、轨道离心率和伴星质量相关。得出的速度分布结果表明双中子星能够从宿主星系中逃逸，并留在超微弱暗星系中，为这些星系的重元素丰度作出了解释。研究还探讨了未来通过星表确定的双中子星的速度分布的多模态特征。

The mergers of double neutron star (DNS) systems are believed to drive the majority of short γ-ray bursts (SGRBs), while also serving as production sites of heavy r-process elements. Despite being key to (i) confirming the nature of the extragalactic SGRBs, (ii) addressing the poorly understood r-process enrichment in the ultrafaint dwarf galaxies (UFDGs), and (iii) probing the formation process of DNS systems, the space velocity distribution of DNSs is still poorly constrained, due to the small number of DNSs with well-determined astrometry. In this work, we determine new proper motions and parallaxes of two Galactic DNSs, PSR J0509+3801 and PSR J1930−1852, using the Very Long Baseline Array, and we estimate the transverse velocities v⊥ of all 11 isolated Galactic DNSs having proper-motion measurements in a consistent manner. Our correlation analysis reveals that the DNS v⊥ is tentatively correlated with three parameters: spin period, orbital eccentricity, and companion mass. With the preliminary v⊥ distribution, we obtain the following findings. First, the refined v⊥ distribution is confirmed to agree with the observed displacements of the localized SGRBs from their host galaxy birth sites. Second, we estimate that around 11% and 25% of DNSs remain gravitationally bound to UFDGs with escape velocities of 15 and 25 km s−1, respectively. Hence, the retained DNSs might indeed be responsible for the r-process enrichment confirmed so far in a few UFDGs. Finally, we discuss how a future ensemble of astrometrically determined DNSs may probe the multimodality of the v⊥ distribution.

总结:<br />
本文研究了2022年3月25日观测到的一个扭曲的、指向地球的日冕物质抛射（CME）。文章采用了三个远程感知与三个原位观测卫星的数据，并发现CME前端在纬度和经度上都出现了扭曲，其中Solar Orbiter观测显示出的地向纬度扭曲低至约6个太阳半径。同时，近地区极紫外观测表明这种扭曲是由于CME与附近赤道日冕孔的更快风速相互作用所致。研究还采用了改进的GCS模型来评估CME扭曲对其传播的影响，并将结果与拖曳模型和WSA-Enlil MHD模型进行比较。结果表明，虽然该事件复杂，但在不同的距离处到达时间的误差要比文献中的典型误差（约8-10小时）低得多（约4小时误差）。 <div>
Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs), drivers of the most severe Space Weather disturbances, are often assumed to evolve self-similarly during their propagation. However, open magnetic field structures in the corona, leading to higher-speed streams in the ambient solar wind, can be source of strong distortions of the CME front. In this paper, we investigate a distorted and Earth-directed CME observed on 2022 March 25 combining three remote sensing with three in situ observatories at different heliocentric distances (from 0.5 to 1 au). Near quadrature observations by Solar Orbiter and the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory revealed a distortion of the CME front in both latitude and longitude, with Solar Orbiter observations showing an Earth-directed latitudinal distortion as low as ≈6 R⊙. Near-Earth extreme-ultraviolet observations indicated the distortion was caused by interaction with faster wind from a nearby equatorial coronal hole. To evaluate the effect of the distortion on the CME's propagation, we adopted a three-point-of-view graduated cylindrical shell (GCS) fitting approach. For the first time, the GCS results are combined with an additional heliospheric single-viewpoint that looks further out in the heliosphere, revealing a deceleration in the CME before reaching ≈100 R⊙. The CME geometry and velocity determined by this enhanced GCS are used to initialize a drag-based model and a WSA-Enlil MHD model. The estimated times of arrival are compared with in situ data at different heliocentric distances and, despite the complexity of the event, the error in the arrival times at each spacecraft results much lower (≈4 hr error) than the typical errors in literature (≈8–10 hr).

The role of metallicity in shaping protoplanetary disk evolution remains poorly comprehended. This study analyzes the disk fraction of 10 young (0.9–2.1 Myr) and low-metallicity (0.34–0.83 Z⊙) clusters located in the outer Milky Way with Galactocentric distances between 10 and 13 kpc. Using JHK data obtained from UKIDSS, the calculated disk fraction values for low-mass stars (0.2–2 M⊙) ranged from 42% to 7%. To enhance the statistical reliability of our analysis, eight additional low-metallicity clusters are sourced from previous studies with metallicity range 0.25–0.85 Z⊙ along with our sample, resulting in a total of 18 regions with low metallicity. We find that low-metallicity clusters exhibit on average a 2.6 ± 0.2 times lower disk fraction compared to solar-metallicity clusters in all the age bins we have. Within the age range we can probe, our study does not find evidence of faster disk decay in subsolar-metallicity regions compared to solar-metallicity regions. Furthermore, we observe a positive correlation between cluster disk fraction and metallicity for two different age groups of 0.3–1.4 and 1.4–2.5 Myr. We emphasize that both cluster age and metallicity significantly affect the fraction of stars with evidence of inner disks.

研究人员在近邻的亮红外塞弗特星系NGC 7469的中心3.3千秒差距范围内，结合JWST/MIRI成像、CO(2-1)数据和22 GHz射电数据，以及1.3mm尘埃连续数据，探索星形成过程。NGC 7469拥有一个主导整体星形成活动的星暴环。通过22 GHz射电数据和CO(2-1)发现全球星形成速率(SFR)约为11.5 M⊙ yr−1，冷分子气体质量M(H2)约为6.4 × 10^9M☉。1.3mm地图显示出与22 GHz和JWST观测到的7.7微米多环芳烃(PAH)发射相似的形态。三种迹象很好地重现了星暴环的形态。研究了PAHs、SFR和冷分子气体之间的相关性，发现PAHs与星形成的相关性比与CO的相关性更强，在星暴环内的相关性比外部地区更陡。推导了SFR和冷分子气体质量面密度之间的相关性，即Kennicutt-Schmidt (K-S)星形成定律。将NGC 7469与其他星暴星系和活动星系核等星系进行比较，突显出NGC 7469在K-S关系中呈现出中间行为。 
<br /><br />总结: 该研究利用多种观测数据和方法探索了NGC 7469星系中心3.3千秒差距范围内的星形成过程，并发现了星暴环的主导作用、PAHs与星形成的相关性以及星形成定律的相关性。与其他星系的比较表明，NGC 7469在星形成方面呈现出中间行为。 <div>
We investigate the star formation process within the central 3.3 kpc region of the nearby luminous infrared Seyfert NGC 7469, probing scales ranging from 88 to 330 pc. We combine JWST/MIRI imaging with the F770W filter, with CO(2 – 1) and the underlying 1.3 mm dust continuum data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, along with Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array radio continuum observations at 22 GHz. NGC 7469 hosts a starburst ring which dominates the overall star formation activity. We estimate the global star formation rate (SFR) ∼ 11.5 M⊙ yr−1 from the radio at 22 GHz, and a cold molecular gas mass M(H2) ∼ 6.4 × 109M☉ from the CO(2 – 1) emission. We find that the 1.3 mm map shows a morphology remarkably similar to those traced by the 22 GHz and the 7.7 μm polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission observed with JWST. The three tracers reproduce the morphology of the starburst ring with good agreement. We further investigate the correlations between the PAHs, the SFR, and the cold molecular gas. We find a stronger correlation of the PAHs with star formation than with CO, with steeper correlations within the starburst ring (n > 2) than in the outer region (n < 1). We derive a correlation between the SFR and the cold molecular gas mass surface densities, the Kennicutt–Schmidt (K-S) star formation law. Comparisons with other galaxy populations, including starburst galaxies and active galactic nuclei, highlighted that NGC 7469 exhibits an intermediate behavior to the K-S relations found for these galaxy populations.

这篇文章讨论了太阳上的六次丝状物喷发事件，并展示了丝状物遮挡部分太阳盘造成的He ii 304 Å光度曲线的变暗特征。事件具有类似的形态特征，起源于活跃区内的小丝状物，随后迅速扩张遮挡大面积的太阳盘或明亮的耀斑区域。分析结果显示，这些变暗事件的持续时间为0.4-7.0小时，最大变暗深度为6.2%，最大变暗面积占太阳盘面积的5.6%。还发现变暗深度和面积之间存在正相关关系，这有助于在恒星观测中限制丝状物的尺寸。 <div>
Filament eruptions often lead to coronal mass ejections (CMEs) on the Sun and are one of the most energetic eruptive phenomena in the atmospheres of other late-type stars. However, the detection of filament eruptions and CMEs on stars beyond the solar system is challenging. Here, we present six filament eruption cases on the Sun and show that filament material obscuring part of the solar disk can cause detectable dimming signatures in Sun-as-a-star flux curves of He ii 304 Å. Those filament eruptions have similar morphological features, originating from small filaments inside active regions and subsequently strongly expanding to obscure large areas of the solar disk or the bright flare regions. We have tracked the detailed evolution of six obscuration dimmings and estimated the dimming properties, such as dimming depths, dimming areas, and duration. The largest dimming depth among the six events under study is 6.2% accompanied by the largest dimming area of 5.6% of the solar disk area. Other events have maximum dimming depths in a range of around 1%–3%, with maximum areas varying between about 3%–4% of the solar disk area. The duration of the dimming spans from around 0.4–7.0 hr for the six events under study. A positive correlation was found between the dimming depth and area, which may help to set constraints on the filament sizes in stellar observations.

The existence of two distinct and apparently unrelated populations of dusty stellar objects in the Nuclear Stellar Cluster of the Milky Way, namely IRS 13 and the S-cluster, are potentially prone to a general process describing the star formation history in the Galactic center (GC). The former cluster is thought to be entangled in the clockwise and counterclockwise disks, a large-scale stellar distribution revealed by the analysis of stars at different distances from Sgr A*, the supermassive black hole in the GC. Recently, this large-scale distribution was reported to exhibit a multidisk structure with at least four components. Motivated by this finding, we revisit the anisotropic IRS 13 cluster and find strong evidence for a disk-like structure. An examination of about 50 individual stellar orbits reveals a new structure that does not follow any trend known in the literature. Furthermore, we investigate the possibility of an inspiral cluster undergoing star formation processes, as proposed by several authors. Using a simplified N-body simulation to reproduce our observational results, we conclude that, under certain conditions, a massive cluster can migrate from the Circum Nuclear Disk toward the inner parsec. Based on this classification, we revisit the large-scale NACO Very Large Telescope (VLT) observations of IRS 13 and find evidence for a separation of the cluster into a gravitationally stable core remnant and a dissipating part. With the velocity-resolved H30α line and the broadband spectral energy distribution of IRS 13 E3, we provide tentative support for the existence of an intermediate-mass black hole of ∼3 × 104M⊙ surrounded by a hot gaseous stream.

A tidal disruption event (TDE) may occur when a star is torn apart by the tidal force of a black hole (BH). Eventually, an accretion disk is thought to form out of stellar debris falling back toward the BH. If the star’s orbital angular momentum vector prior to disruption is not aligned with the BH spin angular momentum vector, the disk will be tilted with respect to the BH equatorial plane. The disk will eventually be drawn into the BH equatorial plane due to a combination of the Bardeen–Petterson effect and internal torques. Here, we analyze the X-ray and UV observations of the TDE AT2020ocn obtained by Swift, XMM-Newton, and Neutron star Interior Composition ExploreR. The X-ray light curve shows strong flares during the first ≈100 days, while, over the same period, the UV emission decays gradually. We find that the X-ray flares can be explained by a model that also explains the spectral evolution. This model includes a slim disk viewed under a variable inclination plus an inverse-Comptonization component processing the slim disk emission. A scenario where the ongoing Lense–Thirring precession during the disk alignment process is responsible for the observed inclination variations is consistent with the data. In later observations, we find that the X-ray spectrum of AT2020ocn becomes harder, while the mass accretion rate remains at super-Eddington levels, suggesting the formation of a corona in line with accretion onto other compact objects. We constrain the BH mass to be M⊙ at the 1σ (68%) confidence level.

Partially ionized plasmas consist of charged and neutral particles whose mutual collisions modify magnetic reconnection compared with the fully ionized case. The collisions alter the rate and locations of the magnetic dissipation heating and the distribution of energies among the particles accelerated into the nonthermal tail. We examine the collisional regimes for the onset of fast reconnection in two environments: the partially ionized layers of the solar atmosphere, and the protoplanetary disks that are the birthplaces for planets around young stars. In both these environments, magnetic nulls readily develop into resistive current sheets in the regime where the charged and neutral particles are fully coupled by collisions, but the current sheets quickly break down under the ideal tearing instability. The current sheets collapse repeatedly, forming magnetic islands at successively smaller scales, until they enter a collisionally decoupled regime where the magnetic energy is rapidly turned into heat and charged-particle kinetic energy. Small-scale, decoupled fast reconnection in the solar atmosphere may lead to preferential heating and energization of ions and electrons that escape into the corona. In protoplanetary disks such reconnection causes localized heating in the atmospheric layers that produce much of the infrared atomic and molecular line emission observed with the Spitzer and James Webb Space Telescopes.

<div> 超大质量黑洞，变化现象，活跃星系核，特征时间尺度，环核气体供应

研究旨在通过关注涵盖所有已知重复变化现象的活跃星系核样本，阐明“变化现象”现象的起源。通过鉴别“变化现象”的特征时间尺度，观察到较大的超大质量黑洞具有较短的特征时间尺度，而较小的超大质量黑洞表现出较长的时间尺度。这些发现揭示了“变化现象”与传统活跃星系核变化的显着对比，传统变化已被活跃星系核盘不稳定模型充分解释。这一鲜明的差异突出了“变化现象”的独特起源，将其区别于传统的活跃星系核变化。通过正确预测特征时间尺度及其对超大质量黑洞质量的依赖，我们提出“变化现象”很可能是由于在活跃和被动超大质量黑洞供油阶段过渡时，周围环核气体供应的突然变化导致的流量变化。 <br /><br />总结: 本研究通过观察活跃星系核样本，发现超大质量黑洞的变化现象存在特征时间尺度，且与传统变化不同。提出变化现象可能是由于活跃和被动超大质量黑洞供油阶段转换时，环核气体供应突然变化导致的流量变化。 <div>
The origin of the “changing-look” (CL) phenomenon in supermassive black holes (SMBHs) remains an open issue. This study aims to shed light on this phenomenon by focusing on a sample that encompasses all known repeating CL active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Through the identification of a characteristic timescale for the CL phenomenon, it was observed that larger SMBHs possess shorter characteristic timescales, while smaller SMBHs exhibit longer timescales. These findings reveal a significant contrast to the traditional AGN variability that has been adequately explained by the AGN’s disk instability model. This stark discrepancy highlights a distinct origin of the CL phenomenon, distinguishing it from traditional AGN variability. By properly predicting the characteristic timescale and its dependence on SMBH mass, we propose that the CL phenomenon is likely a result of a variation in accretion rate caused by a sudden change in the supply of circumnuclear gas during the transition between active and passive SMBH fueling stages.

<div> tSZ, MUSTANG2, 90 GHz, Galaxy clusters, Source contamination

这篇论文报告了利用热Sunyaev–Zel'dovich效应（tSZ）在243个星系团中进行的盲目调查，使用Green Bank望远镜上的MUSTANG2在90 GHz进行了调查，将5σ检测限定为每个星系团中心的1 mJy。文章发现了24个离散源，其中大多数（18个）对应于已知的射电源，其中有五个显示出明显的变化迹象，要么是随时间变化，要么是频谱指数变化。其余的源在其他波长没有明确的对应物。通过tSZ强烈依赖于90 GHz的观测来搜索星系团，而发现的源可能会对星系团的质量估计产生偏差。文章将结果与Websky模拟进行了比较，发现模拟与观测在星系团中心的匹配良好，但在外围的源分布上不匹配。在距离星系团中心104″以上的源使tSZ信号偏高，部分源的偏差可高达50%。在整个星系团种群中平均后，效应较小，但仍在1%–2%的水平。文章还发现，与先前的测量和模拟不同，他们在星系团外围观察到了源计数的增加，而在tSZ选择的样本的中心观察到的源较少。 <br /><br />总结: tSZ观测在90 GHz进行了Galaxy clusters的盲目调查，发现了24个离散源，其中大多数对应已知的射电源，还比较了观测结果与模拟结果，在星系团的外围发现了源计数的增加并发现了一些源对tSZ信号的偏差。 <div>
In this paper, we present the results of a blind survey for compact sources in 243 Galaxy clusters that were identified using the thermal Sunyaev–Zel'dovich effect (tSZ). The survey was carried out at 90 GHz using MUSTANG2 on the Green Bank Telescope and achieved a 5σ detection limit of 1 mJy in the center of each cluster. We detected 24 discrete sources. The majority (18) of these correspond to known radio sources, and of these, five show signs of significant variability, either with time or in spectral index. The remaining sources have no clear counterparts at other wavelengths. Searches for galaxy clusters via the tSZ strongly rely on observations at 90 GHz, and the sources found have the potential to bias mass estimates of clusters. We compare our results to the Websky simulation that can be used to estimate the source contamination in galaxy cluster catalogs. While the simulation shows a good match to our observations at the clusters’ centers, it does not match our source distribution further out. Sources over 104″ from a cluster’s center bias the tSZ signal high, for some of the sources found, by over 50%. When averaged over the whole cluster population, the effect is smaller but still at a level of 1%–2%. We also discovered that unlike previous measurements and simulations, we see an enhancement of source counts in the outer regions of the clusters and fewer sources than expected in the centers of this tSZ-selected sample.

<div> 星系、椭圆星系、星的形成、光谱、形态图<br />
通过空间分辨光谱学的研究，我们发现了一群罕见的具有星形成特征的椭圆星系。我们利用星际介质综合模型输出、深度学习目录的形态学结果以及MaNGA Pipe3D增值目录的解析和综合特性相结合，识别出了59个星形成椭圆星系。与我们的主要样本SF-E相比，我们还构建了两个控制样本：星形成螺旋星系（SF-Sps；2419个星系）和静止椭圆星系（Q-Es；684个星系）。SF-E的Hα发射线通量与螺旋星系相似，D4000光谱指数表明SF-E具有老年和年轻的恒星群。SF-E的质量加权恒星年龄和金属丰度低于Q-E，67%的主要样本的恒星和气体速度图显示出动力学扰动的迹象。所有这些结果表明，SF-E通过近期的合并或与其他星系的相互作用获得了贫金属气体，并且正在形成新一代的星。此外，我们还将主要样本的SF-E分为四类，根据它们的球状星系/总发光度比（B/T）和自旋参数。这四类具有各自独特的演化历史和形成方式。基于这些结果，我们建议哈勃图不能准确捕捉星系演化过程，我们需要一个修订的形态图，如梳形态图，才能完整地了解星系的演化过程。<br /><br />总结: 通过空间分辨光谱学研究发现了59个星形成的椭圆星系，它们通过合并或与其他星系互动获取了贫金属气体，并产生了新一代的星。此外，作者还根据恒星年龄和金属丰度将这些星系分为四类，具有不同的演化历史和形成方式。作者建议需要一个修订的形态图来更好地理解星系演化过程。 <div>
Using “spatially” resolved spectroscopy, we investigated the characteristics and different modes of formation of stars in elliptical galaxies. We identified an unusual population of 59 star-forming elliptical (SF-E) galaxies in SDSS-MaNGA, our primary sample. To identify these rare star-forming ellipticals, we combined GSWLC-A2 containing outputs of stellar population synthesis models with morphological results from the deep-learning catalog and resolved and integrated properties from the MaNGA Pipe3D value-added catalog. We have also constructed two control samples of star-forming spirals (SF-Sps; 2419 galaxies) and quenched ellipticals (Q-Es; 684 galaxies) to compare with our primary sample of SF-Es. Hα emission line flux of SF-Es is similar to spiral galaxies. The D4000 spectral index indicates that SF-Es have a mixture of old and young stellar populations. Mass-weighted stellar age and metallicity for the SF-Es are lower than the Q-Es and 67% of stellar- and gas-velocity maps of the primary sample show signs of kinematic disturbance. All of these indicate that SF-Es have acquired metal-poor gas through recent mergers or interactions with other galaxies and are forming a new generation of stars. Further, we subdivide our primary sample of SF-Es into four classes based on their bulge to total luminosity ratio (B/T) and spin parameter . These four classes have their distinct evolutionary history and modes of formation. Based on these results, we suggest that the Hubble diagram does not accurately capture galaxy evolution processes, and we need a revised morphology diagram like the comb morphology diagram to get a complete picture of the galaxy evolution processes.

<div> 关键词: H2O ices, 近红外光谱, 空间冰, 光谱特征, 仪器曝光时间
总结: <br /><br />这项研究利用实验室得到的纯非晶和晶态冰的近红外光谱，在80-180K温度范围内进行了研究。研究的目的是提供光谱参考数据，以便远程访问冰的性质，如冰卫星、彗星冰或土星环等冰的物质特性。研究特别识别了评估空间冰三个重要属性的新的光谱标记：(i) 孔隙度/蓬松度，(ii) 非晶冰的体密度，(iii) 结晶冰的立方性。研究分析了OH-伸展泛频（2νOH）和5000cm^{-1}/2μm的组合带，这些是这些属性的有力光谱标记。通过比较蒸发沉积的微孔非晶固态水、无孔低、高和非常高密度非晶冰的光谱，能够在非晶冰的近红外光谱中将(体)密度效应与孔隙度效应分离开来。这一点澄清了一直存在的问题，即詹尼斯肯斯和布莱克首次提出的低温蒸发沉积的非晶冰密度不一致问题。通过将近红外光谱与粉末X射线衍射图进行直接比较，可以将光谱特征与堆叠失序冰Isd中的立方叠层数相关联，范围从完全立方冰Ic到完全六角冰Ih。研究还表明，詹姆斯·韦伯空间望远镜上的仪器曝光时间在小时范围内可区分这些属性，证明了被忽视的近红外光谱范围对于识别空间中的冰是有用的。 <div>
We present laboratory spectra of pure amorphous and crystalline H2O ices in the near-infrared (NIR, 1–2.5 μm/10,000–4000 cm−1) at 80–180 K. The aim of this study is to provide spectroscopic reference data that allow remotely accessing ice properties for icy objects such as icy moons, cometary ice, or Saturn rings. Specifically, we identify new spectral markers for assessing three important properties of ices in space: (i) porosity/fluffiness, (ii) bulk density of amorphous ice, and (iii) cubicity in crystalline ice. The analysis is based on the first OH-stretching overtone (2νOH) and the combinational band at 5000 cm−1/2 μm, which are potent spectral markers for these properties. By comparison of vapor-deposited, microporous amorphous solid water, pore-free low-, high-, and very-high-density amorphous ice, we are able to separate the effect of (bulk) density from the effect of porosity on NIR-spectra of amorphous ices. This allows for clarifying a longstanding inconsistency about the density of amorphous ice vapor-deposited at low temperatures, first brought up by Jenniskens & Blake. Direct comparison of NIR spectra with powder X-ray diffractograms allows us to correlate spectral features with the number of cubic stacking layers in stacking-disordered ice Isd, ranging from fully cubic ice Ic to fully hexagonal ice Ih. We show that exposure times for instruments on the James Webb Space Telescope are in the hour range to distinguish these properties, demonstrating the usefulness of the neglected NIR spectral range for identifying ices in space.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了通过观测的UV连续斜率（β）和红外过剩（IRX）之间的关系，来理解高红移星系的尘埃衰减规律。研究使用了来自AstroSat UV Deep Field北部的83个UV选择的星系数据，估算了52个星系的观测IRX。通过多波段光度数据进行SED建模，发现IRX-β值存在较大散布，表明尘埃衰减存在多样性。研究发现在IRX-β平面上最佳拟合的修正Calzetti关系的幂律斜率（δ）存在明显关联，SMC类似的更陡的衰减规律更偏好较低的δ值。SED模型的IRX-β关系显示偏好于更陡的SMC类似的衰减规律，这与用Hα发射线推导的星形成率和观测的远紫外加重处理的远红外辐射得出的结果吻合。这项研究揭示了IRX和星系的恒星质量之间的强正相关，表明更大质量的星系会产生更多的尘埃。 <div>
The relation between the observed UV continuum slope (β) and the infrared excess (IRX) is used as a powerful probe to understand the nature of dust attenuation law in high-redshift galaxies. We present a study of 83 UV-selected galaxies between a redshift of 0.5 and 0.7 from the AstroSat UV Deep Field north that encloses the GOODS-North field. Using empirical relation, we estimate the observed IRX of 52 galaxies that are detected in either one or both of the Herschel PACS 100 and 160 μm bands. We further utilize the multiband photometric data in 14–18 filters from the Ultra-Violet Imaging Telescope, KPNO, Hubble Space Telescope, Spitzer, and Herschel telescopes to perform spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling. Both the observed and model-derived IRX–β values show a large scatter within the span of previously known relations, signifying diversity in dust attenuation. We found a distinct relation between the best-fit power-law slope of the modified Calzetti relation (δ) in the IRX–β plane, where the steeper SMC-like attenuation law prefers lower δ values. Our SED model-based IRX–β relation shows a preference for steeper SMC-like attenuation, which we further confirm from the agreement between extinction-corrected star formation rates derived using the Hα emission line and the observed far-ultraviolet plus reprocessed far-IR fluxes. The current study reveals a strong positive correlation between IRX and the galaxy's stellar mass between 109.5 and 1011.0M⊙, signifying increased dust production in more massive star-forming galaxies.

<div> Parker Solar Probe, solar encounter, magnetic structure, heliospheric current sheet, streamer blobs
总结:
Parker Solar Probe于2019年3月30日至4月11日期间进行了第二次太阳遭遇，期间观测到了大量大小不一的流量增强体（流星团）在赤道附近流动。WISPR的高分辨率和灵敏度揭示了这些增强体的结构，显示出其中一些流星团具有暗色中心核心，暗示其为磁通绳。通过对四个典型流星团的3D轨迹和大小进行跟踪，确认它们的位置与太阳赤道帽相关联。这些流星团在15 R☉以上的区域被观测到，证实了在HCS附近的慢风中重新连接的过程主导着慢风的形成。 <br /><br /> <div>
Parker Solar Probe's second solar encounter from 2019 March 30 to April 11 occurred during a period when the corona had a simple magnetic structure and relatively flat heliospheric current sheet (HCS), which was in the field of view of the Wide-field Imager for Solar Probe (WISPR) throughout. The images show an almost continual flow of transient density enhancements (streamer blobs) of various sizes near the latitude of the HCS during the entire 11 day encounter period. The high resolution and sensitivity of WISPR reveal the structure of some of the individual blobs not seen in observations from 1 au. Many of the blobs show dark central cores, suggesting that they are magnetic flux ropes. The 3D trajectories and sizes of four representative streamer blobs have been determined using the tracking and fitting technique of Liewer et al. (2020). Comparison of the location of these blobs with synoptic white-light maps for this time period, created using data from the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (Brueckner et al. 1995) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, confirms that the blobs are at the location of the helmet streamer associated with the HCS. The blobs were observed in the region beyond 15 R☉. The continual flow of blobs, the confirmation of their location at the HCS, and their flux-rope-like appearance provide strong evidence that the process of reconnection across the current sheet dominates the slow wind near the HCS.

总结:
本文报道了来自南天MWA Rapid Two-meter脉冲星调查的长周期脉冲星PSR J0452−3418的发现。该脉冲星表现出准周期性的闪烁和亚脉冲漂移。文章描述了脉冲星的发现和后续跟踪，包括使用uGMRT进行高分辨率成像的位置测定，使用MWA和uGMRT数据进行初步定时分析，以及在MWA频段（140–170 MHz）内对闪烁和漂移特性的详细表征。研究发现，该脉冲星的闪烁分数为34% ± 6%，闪烁周期为脉冲。此外，文章还对比了观察到的特性与其他表现出亚脉冲漂移和准周期性闪烁现象的脉冲星的特征，并发现大多数这类对象倾向于处于“死亡谷”中。研究还讨论了脉冲星发射物理学的广泛含义以及使用下一代脉冲星调查方法检测类似对象的可行性。 <div>
The phenomenon of pulsar nulling, where pulsars temporarily and stochastically cease their radio emission, is thought to be indicative of a “dying” pulsar, where radio emission ceases entirely. Here we report the discovery of a long-period pulsar, PSR J0452−3418, from the ongoing Southern-sky MWA Rapid Two-meter pulsar survey. The pulsar has a rotation period of ∼1.67 s and a dispersion measure of 19.8 pc cm−3, and it exhibits both quasiperiodic nulling and subpulse drifting. Periodic nulling is uncommon, reported in only <1% of the pulsar population, with even a smaller fraction showing periodic nulling and subpulse drifting. We describe the discovery and follow-up of the pulsar, including a positional determination using high-resolution imaging with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT), initial timing analysis using the combination of Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) and uGMRT data, and detailed characterization of the nulling and drifting properties in the MWA’s frequency band (140–170 MHz). Our analysis suggests a nulling fraction of 34% ± 6% and a nulling periodicity of pulses. We measure the phase (P2) and time modulation (P3) caused by the subpulse drifting, with an average P2 of 7.1 degrees and a P3 of 4.8 pulses. We compare and contrast the observed properties with those of other pulsars that exhibit subpulse drifting and quasiperiodic nulling phenomena, and find that the majority of these objects tend to be in the “death valley” in the period–period derivative (P– ) diagram. We also discuss some broader implications for pulsar emission physics and the detectability of similar objects using next-generation pulsar surveys.

总结:
脉冲非定期脉动（QPPs）在2024年2月22日（SOL2024-02-22T22:08）的X6.4耀斑的冲击阶段同时在硬X射线（HXR）、微波、Lyα和紫外线（UV）发射波长中观测到。X6.4耀斑在HXR和微波波段显示出三次重复和连续的脉动，并且具有极大的调制深度。耀斑QPPs的发生几乎与正负磁场的磁消除的开始几乎同时发生。小波功率谱表明存在两个中心在∼200和∼95秒左右的双周期。在耀斑区域还可以在Lyα和UV波段检测到长周期QPP，并且它可以在相邻的太阳黑子中观察到。我们的观测表明，耀斑QPPs很可能是由与周期性磁重连接相关的加速电子触发的。∼200秒的长周期可能受到来自邻近太阳黑子的慢磁声波的调制，而∼95秒的短周期可以被视为它的第二谐波模式。 <div>
We report the simultaneous observations of quasiperiodic pulsations (QPPs) in wavelengths of hard X-ray (HXR), microwave, Lyα, and ultraviolet (UV) emissions during the impulsive phase of an X6.4 flare on 2024 February 22 (SOL2024-02-22T22:08). The X6.4 flare shows three repetitive and successive pulsations in HXR and microwave wavebands, and they have an extremely large modulation depth. The onset of flare QPPs is almost simultaneous with the start of magnetic cancellation between positive and negative fields. The wavelet power spectra suggest the presence of double periods, which are centered at ∼200 and ∼95 s, respectively. The long-period QPP can also be detected in Lyα and UV wavebands at the flare area, and it could be observed in the adjacent sunspot. Our observations indicate that the flare QPPs are most likely triggered by accelerated electrons that are associated with periodic magnetic reconnections. The long period at ∼200 s is probably modulated by the slow magnetoacoustic wave originating from the neighboring sunspot, while the short period at ∼95 s could be regarded as its second harmonic mode.

<title>The Sun’s Magnetic Power Spectra over Two Solar Cycles. II. Cycle Dependence of Active Regions, a Magnetic Network, and Their Relation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The multiscaled solar magnetic field consists of two major components: active regions (ARs) and magnetic network. Unraveling the cycle-dependent properties and interrelations of these components is crucial for understanding the evolution of the solar magnetic field. In this study, we investigate these components using magnetic power spectra derived from high-resolution and continuous synoptic magnetograms since cycle 23 onward. Our results show that the size of the magnetic network ranges from 26 to 41 Mm without dependence on the solar cycle. The power of the network field (PNW) accounts for approximately 20% of the total power during any phase of solar cycles. In contrast to the AR power (PAR), PNW displays a weaker cycle dependence, as described by the relationship PNW ≈ 0.6* PAR + 40. The power-law index between AR sizes and magnetic network sizes presents a strong anticorrelation with the activity level. Additionally, our study indicates that in the absence of sunspots on the solar disc, the magnetic power spectra remain time-independent, consistently exhibiting similarity in both shape and power. This study introduces a new method to investigate the properties of the magnetic network and provides magnetic power spectra for high-resolution simulations of the solar magnetic field at the surface at various phases of solar cycles.

<div> SNe Ia, Hubble constant, distance calibrators, near-infrared, systematic errors 

总结: 本研究分析了Ia型超新星（SNe Ia）的数据，利用光学到近红外波段（uBgVriYJH）扩展了哈勃图。利用不同的距离校准器（Cepheids、TRGB和SBFs）计算了哈勃常数H0，得到了B波段的H0 = 71.76 ± 0.58（stat）± 1.19（sys）km s−1 Mpc−1和H波段的H0 = 73.22 ± 0.68（stat）± 1.28（sys）km s−1 Mpc−1。通过将Cepheid、TRGB和SBF校准器赋予相等的权重，得出了距离阶梯的第一层的系统误差约为1.2∼1.3 km s−1 Mpc−1，从而减小了我们的结果与宇宙微波背景提供的早期H0之间的张力。研究发现在Y波段有最高的SNe Ia发光精度（0.12 ± 0.01 mag）。另外，确认了SNe Ia的余辉主机质量相关性在光学和近红外波长间基本没有变化。最后，发现距离宿主中心超过10 kpc爆炸的SNe Ia发光分散较小，这可能是由于在主机外围灰尘的影响减小所导致的。 <div>
We present an analysis of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from the Carnegie Supernova Project I and II and extend the Hubble diagram from optical to near-infrared wavelengths (uBgVriYJH). We calculate the Hubble constant, H0, using various distance calibrators: Cepheids, the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB), and surface brightness fluctuations (SBFs). Combining all methods of calibration, we derive H0 = 71.76 ± 0.58 (stat) ± 1.19 (sys) km s−1 Mpc−1 from the B band and H0 = 73.22 ± 0.68 (stat) ± 1.28 (sys) km s−1 Mpc−1 from the H band. By assigning equal weight to the Cepheid, TRGB, and SBF calibrators, we derive the systematic errors required for consistency in the first rung of the distance ladder, resulting in a systematic error of 1.2 ∼ 1.3 km s−1 Mpc−1 in H0. As a result, relative to the statistics-only uncertainty, the tension between the late-time H0 we derive by combining the various distance calibrators and the early-time H0 from the cosmic microwave background is reduced. The highest precision in SN Ia luminosity is found in the Y band (0.12 ± 0.01 mag), as defined by the intrinsic scatter (σint). We revisit SN Ia Hubble residual-host mass correlations and recover previous results that these correlations do not change significantly between the optical and near-infrared wavelengths. Finally, SNe Ia that explode beyond 10 kpc from their host centers exhibit smaller dispersion in their luminosity, confirming our earlier findings. A reduced effect of dust in the outskirts of hosts may be responsible for this effect.

总结: 
本研究利用表面亮度波动来间接探测星系团介质中的湍流特性，包括湍流速度、注入尺度以及波动功率谱向较小尺度的倾斜。通过南极望远镜对SZ星系团的研究，结合X射线观测，选取了两个典型星系团进行了初步研究。研究结果显示，两个星系团中涡流的注入尺度都超过500千秒差距，其中SPT-CLJ0232-4421的马赫数约为0.5，SPT-CLJ0638-5358的马赫数约为0.6-1.6，并且后者有已知的激波。此外，对于M500，SPT-CLJ0232-4421的静压偏差值小于0.2，而SPT-CLJ0638-5358的静压偏差值小于0.1。这些结果表明，通过多波段的详细观测方法来定量评估数据的重要性，同时也暗示了湍流驱动可能出现在相当大的尺度上。 <br /><br /> <div>
Studies of surface brightness fluctuations in the intracluster medium present an indirect probe of turbulent properties such as the turbulent velocities, injection scales, and the slope of the power spectrum of fluctuations toward smaller scales. With the advancement of Sunyaev–Zel’dovich (SZ) studies and surveys relative to X-ray observations, we seek to investigate surface brightness fluctuations in a sample of South Pole Telescope (SPT)-SZ clusters which also have archival XMM-Newton data. Here we present a pilot study of two typical clusters in that sample: SPT-CLJ0232-4421 and SPT-CLJ0638-5358. We infer injection scales larger than 500 kpc in both clusters and Mach numbers ≈ 0.5 in SPT-CLJ0232-4421 and Mach numbers ≈ 0.6–1.6 in SPT-CLJ0638-5358, which has a known shock. We find hydrostatic bias values for M500 less than 0.2 for SPT-CLJ0232-4421 and less than 0.1 for SPT-CLJ0638-5358. These results show the importance to assess quantitative values via a detailed multiwavelength approach and suggest that the drivers of turbulence may occur at quite large scales.

Using Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer high-resolution (R ∼ 35,000) spectroscopy from 2.29 to 2.49 μm, we present uniform atmospheric retrievals for eight young substellar companions with masses of ∼10–30 MJup, orbital separations spanning ∼50–360 au, and Teff between ∼1500 and 2600 K. We find that all companions have solar C/O ratios and metallicities to within the 1σ–2σ level, with the measurements clustered around solar composition. Stars in the same stellar associations as our systems have near-solar abundances, so these results indicate that this population of companions is consistent with formation via direct gravitational collapse. Alternatively, core accretion outside the CO snowline would be compatible with our measurements, though the high mass ratios of most systems would require rapid core assembly and gas accretion in massive disks. On a population level, our findings can be contrasted with abundance measurements for directly imaged planets with m < 10 MJup, which show tentative atmospheric metal enrichment compared to their host stars. In addition, the atmospheric compositions of our sample of companions are distinct from those of hot Jupiters, which most likely form via core accretion. For two companions with Teff ∼ 1700–2000 K (κ And b and GSC 6214–210 b), our best-fit models prefer a nongray cloud model with >3σ significance. The cloudy models yield 2σ−3σ lower Teff for these companions, though the C/O and [C/H] still agree between cloudy and clear models at the 1σ level. Finally, we constrain 12CO/13CO for three companions with the highest signal-to-noise ratio data (GQ Lup b, HIP 79098b, and DH Tau b) and report and radial velocities for all companions.

总结:<br />
本文使用了高分辨率的宇宙学模拟来研究恒星晕的性质和组成成分，模拟结果表明FOGGIE模拟的恒星晕质量、金属丰度梯度和表面亮度分布与观测一致。恒星晕中有30%-40%的质量来源于原位恒星，这部分恒星更为集中在中心区域，不会使恒星晕外围过亮。剩下的恒星主要来自于10-50个其他星系，其中大部分来自于2-4个星系。预计未来的宽景天文台，如南希·格雷斯·罗曼太空望远镜，将能够观测到银河系附近的恒星晕，甚至可以通过色-星等图来区分矮星系的残骸与恒星晕的区别。 <div>
Over the next decade, the astronomical community will be commissioning multiple wide-field observatories well suited for studying stellar halos in both integrated light and resolved stars. In preparation for this, we use five high-resolution cosmological simulations of Milky Way–like galaxies from the FOGGIE suite to explore the properties and components of stellar halos. These simulations are run with high time (5 Myr) and stellar mass (1000 M⊙) resolution to better model the properties and origins of low-density regions like stellar halos. We find that the FOGGIE stellar halos have masses, metallicity gradients, and surface brightness profiles that are consistent with observations. In agreement with other simulations, the FOGGIE stellar halos receive 30%–40% of their mass from in situ stars. However, this population is more centrally concentrated in the FOGGIE simulations and therefore does not contribute excess light to the halo outskirts. The remaining stars are accreted from ∼10–50 other galaxies, with the majority of the accreted mass originating in two to four galaxies. While the inner halo (r < 50 kpc) of each FOGGIE galaxy has a large number of contributors, the halo outskirts of three of the five galaxies are primarily made up of stars from only a few contributors. We predict that upcoming wide-field observatories, like the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, will probe stellar halos around Milky Way–like galaxies out to ∼100 kpc in integrated light and will be able to distinguish the debris of dwarf galaxies with extended star formation histories from the underlying halo with resolved color–magnitude diagrams.

<div> 关键词: massive quiescent galaxies, z ≥ 3, JWST NIRCam imaging data, color selection technique, SED fitting

总结:
本研究提出了一种新的经验性颜色选择技术，旨在利用JWST NIRCam成像数据在3≤z≤6的范围内选择大质量寂静星系。通过使用经验约束的星系光谱能量分布（SED）模板，确定了F277W-F444W与F150W-F277W色彩平面上的一个区域，捕捉了z>3的寂静星系。在CEERS调查中应用这些颜色选择标准，并对该区域内的源进行SED拟合，鉴定出了44个z≳3的寂静星系候选体。其中超过一半的源是新发现的，平均具有后爆发星系的特定星形成率。大多数这些源在传统UVJ图中是无法发现的。我们估算出3<5时的体密度为n∼1-4×10^-5 Mpc^-3，与CEERS领域类似群体的现有报告非常一致。借助NIRCam的波长覆盖范围和灵敏度，这种技术提供了一种高效的工具，可以搜索到大量这种罕见的星系。 <div>
Substantial populations of massive quiescent galaxies at z ≥ 3 challenge our understanding of rapid galaxy growth and quenching over short timescales. In order to piece together this evolutionary puzzle, more statistical samples of these objects are required. Established techniques for identifying massive quiescent galaxies are increasingly inefficient and unconstrained at z > 3. As a result, studies report that as much as 70% of quiescent galaxies at z > 3 may be missed from existing surveys. In this work, we propose a new empirical color selection technique designed to select massive quiescent galaxies at 3 ≲ z ≲ 6 using JWST NIRCam imaging data. We use empirically constrained galaxy spectral energy distribution (SED) templates to define a region in the F277W − F444W versus F150W − F277W color plane that captures quiescent galaxies at z > 3. We apply these color selection criteria to the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) Survey and use SED fitting on sources in the region to identify 44 candidate z ≳ 3 quiescent galaxies. Over half of these sources are newly discovered and, on average, exhibit specific star formation rates of poststarburst galaxies. Most of these sources would not be discovered using canonical UVJ diagrams. We derive volume density estimates of n ∼ 1–4 × 10−5 Mpc−3 at 3 < z < 5, finding excellent agreement with existing reports on similar populations in the CEERS field. Thanks to NIRCam’s wavelength coverage and sensitivity, this technique provides an efficient tool to search for large samples of these rare galaxies.

<div> 关键词: gamma-ray bursts, spectral analysis, outflow properties, Amati relation, Yonetoku relation
总结: 
gamma-ray bursts 研究者对21个Fermi GRBs进行了系统的分析，发现几乎所有的precursors和主爆发都表现出热组分，并且它们的能谱指数存在相关演化。此外，他们也发现大部分的情况下precursors和主爆发有着类似的发射特性和光谱特征，并且它们在Amati关系和Yonetoku关系中处于相似的分布区域。因此，研究结论认为主爆发是precursors的延续，可能有着共同的物理起源。 <div>
There is no consensus yet on whether the precursor and the main burst of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have the same origin, and their jet composition is still unclear. In order to further investigate this issue, we systematically search 21 Fermi GRBs with both a precursor and main burst for spectral analysis. We first perform Bayesian time-resolved spectral analysis and find that almost all the precursors and the main bursts (94.4%) exhibit thermal components and that the vast majority of them have a low-energy spectral index (α; 72.2%) that exceeds the limit of synchrotron radiation. We then analyze the evolution and correlation of the spectral parameters and find that approximately half of the α (50%) of the precursors and the main bursts evolve in a similar pattern, while peak energy (Ep; 55.6%) behaves similarly, and their evolution is mainly characterized by flux tracking; for the α−F (the flux) relation, more than half of the precursors and the main bursts (61.1%) exhibit roughly similar patterns; the Ep−F relation in both the precursor and main burst (100%) exhibits a positive correlation of at least moderate strength. Next, we constrain the outflow properties of the precursors and the main bursts and find that most of them exhibit typical properties of photosphere radiation. Finally, we compare the time-integrated spectra of the precursors and the main bursts and find that nearly all of them are located in similar regions of the Amati relation and follow the Yonetoku relation. Therefore, we conclude that main bursts are continuations of precursors and may share a common physical origin.

总结: <br /><br />这篇文章主要介绍了太阳大气中的磁场几何以及投影效应对波的传播路径进行精确映射的困难。研究人员利用Dunn太阳望远镜的干涉双向光谱仪，对一个太阳黑子进行了高分辨率的Hα光谱扫描，并对一个突出的超边暗纤维的横向振荡进行了深入研究。他们发现这个纤维在椭圆偏振下进行传播的扭曲振荡，振荡周期为430秒，相速度为69±4 km/s。随着振荡传播离开太阳黑子，能量逐渐耗散，导致能量流量呈现约460 W m-2/Mm的速率减小。另外，研究还发现Hα线宽随着距离太阳黑子的增加而增加，可能是温度的迹象。虽然研究了不同线性和非线性机制对波能量流的耗散，但它们的简单叠加效果无法解释观察到的耗散长度。研究人员预计，本文展示的重投影方法将有助于未来对纤维结构中横向波的研究。 <div>
The magnetic geometry of the solar atmosphere, combined with projection effects, makes it difficult to accurately map the propagation of ubiquitous waves in fibrillar structures. These waves are of interest due to their ability to carry energy into the chromosphere and deposit it through damping and dissipation mechanisms. To this end, the Interferometric Bidimensional Spectrometer at the Dunn Solar Telescope was employed to capture high-resolution Hα spectral scans of a sunspot, with the transverse oscillations of a prominent superpenumbral fibril examined in depth. The oscillations are reprojected from the helioprojective Cartesian frame to a new frame of reference oriented along the average fibril axis through nonlinear force-free field extrapolations. The fibril was found to be carrying an elliptically polarized, propagating kink oscillation with a period of 430 s and a phase velocity of 69 ± 4 km s−1. The oscillation is damped as it propagates away from the sunspot with a damping length of approximately 9.2 Mm, resulting in the energy flux decreasing at a rate on the order of 460 W m−2/Mm. The Hα line width is examined and found to increase with distance from the sunspot, a potential sign of a temperature increase. Different linear and nonlinear mechanisms are investigated for the damping of the wave energy flux, but a first-order approximation of their combined effects is insufficient to recreate the observed damping length by a factor of at least 3. It is anticipated that the reprojection methodology demonstrated in this study will aid with future studies of transverse waves within fibrillar structures.

总结:<br />
NGC 777是一个椭圆星系核的研究对象，其温度分布与辐射天体活动关联紧密。通过深度的Chandra X射线观测和uGMRT 400 MHz的射电成像，研究发现其核区存在热核现象，同时发现周围存在微弱的射电辐射。通过观测结果推测，该热核可能是由于活动星系核喷流作用或者来自老的射电喷流残留的粒子加热导致。同时，通过X射线亮度的减小，可以说明可能存在喷流在10-20kpc范围内的扩展，此喷流可能已经持续至少240百万年，可以平衡辐射冷却效应。 <div>
NGC 777 provides an example of a phenomenon observed in some group-central ellipticals, in which the temperature profile shows a central peak, despite the short central cooling time of the intragroup medium. We use deep Chandra X-ray observations of the galaxy, supported by uGMRT 400 MHz radio imaging, to investigate the origin of this hot core. We confirm the centrally peaked temperature profile and find that the entropy and cooling time both monotonically decline to low values (2.62 keV cm2 and Myr, respectively) in the central ∼700 pc. Faint diffuse radio emission surrounds the nuclear point source, with no clear jets or lobes but extending to ∼10 kpc on the northwest–southeast axis. This alignment and extent agree well with a previously identified filamentary Hα + [N ii] nebula. While cavities are not firmly detected, we see X-ray surface brightness decrements on the same axis at 10–20 kpc radii, which are consistent with the intragroup medium having been pushed aside by expanding radio lobes. Any such outburst must have occurred long enough ago for lobe emission to have faded below detectability. Cavities on this scale would be capable of balancing radiative cooling for at least ∼240 Myr. We consider possible causes of the centrally peaked temperature profile, including gravitational heating of gas as the halo relaxes after a period of active galactic nucleus jet activity, and heating by particles leaking from the remnant relativistic plasma of the old radio jets.

Recent James Webb Space Telescope data analyses have shown that massive red galaxies existed at redshifts z ≳ 6, a discovery that is difficult to understand in the context of standard cosmology (ΛCDM). Here, we analyze these observations more deeply, by fitting a stellar population model to the optical and near-infrared photometric data. These fits include a main stellar population in addition to a residual younger population and with the same extinction for both (a lower extinction for the younger population is unphysical). Extra stellar populations or the inclusion of an active galactic nucleus component do not significantly improve the fits. These galaxies are being viewed at very high redshifts, with an average 〈z〉 ≈ 8.2, when the ΛCDM Universe was only ≈600 Myr old. This result conflicts with the inferred ages of these galaxies, however, which were on average between 0.9 and 2.4 Gyr old within a 95% confidence level. Given the sequence of star formation and galaxy assembly in the standard model, these galaxies should instead be even younger than 290 Myr on average, for which our analysis assigns a probability of only <3 × 10−4 (≳3.6σ tension). This outcome may indicate the need to consider nonstandard cosmologies. Nevertheless, our conclusions result from several approximations in stellar astrophysics and extinction, so they should be taken with a grain of salt. Further research is necessary to corroborate the possible existence of galaxies older than the ΛCDM Universe at their observed redshifts.

Planetary-mass objects and brown dwarfs at the transition (Teff ∼ 1300 K) from relatively red L dwarfs to bluer mid-T dwarfs show enhanced spectrophotometric variability. Multiepoch observations support atmospheric planetary-scale (Kelvin or Rossby) waves as the primary source of this variability; however, large spots associated with the precipitation of silicate and metal clouds have also been theorized and suggested by Doppler imaging. We applied both wave and spotted models to fit near-infrared (NIR), multiband (Y/J/H/K) photometry of SIMP J013656.5+093347 (hereafter SIMP0136) collected at the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope using the Wide-field InfraRed Camera. SIMP0136 is a planetary-mass object (12.7 ± 1.0 MJ) at the L/T transition (T2 ± 0.5) known to exhibit light-curve evolution over multiple rotational periods. We measure the maximum peak-to-peak variability of 6.17% ± 0.46%, 6.45% ± 0.33%, 6.51% ± 0.42%, and 4.33% ± 0.38% in the Y, J, H, and K bands, respectively, and find evidence that wave models are preferred for all four NIR bands. Furthermore, we determine that the spot size necessary to reproduce the observed variations is larger than the Rossby deformation radius and Rhines scale, which is unphysical. Through the correlation between light curves produced by the waves and associated color variability, we find evidence of planetary-scale, wave-induced cloud modulation and breakup, similar to Jupiter’s atmosphere and supported by general circulation models. We also detect a 93.°8 ± 7.°4 (12.7σ) phase shift between the H − K and J − H color time series, providing evidence for complex vertical cloud structure in SIMP0136's atmosphere.

本研究测试了恒星形成率（SFRs）与7.7微米多环芳烃发光在z∼0–2星系中的关系。通过利用来自哈勃太空望远镜、CFHT、JWST、Spitzer和Herschel的多波段光度测量数据，对CEERS调查中的星系进行了谱能分布（SED）建模。研究测量了经过尘埃校正的远紫外线（FUV）光度LFUV和UV导出的SFR。然后使用JWST/MIRI 7.7-21微米数据对SED模型进行拟合，得到了其余波段7.7微米光度L770。研究发现L770与LFUV之间存在相关性。对于低金属含量、较低尘埃遮挡和受到演化恒星群体主导的星系，L770与这一关系有所偏离。研究得出了L770的“单波长”SFR校准，其与模型估计的SFRs的离散度（σΔSFR）为0.24 dex。此外，还得出了FUV光度（未经尘埃校正）和余波段7.7微米光度的线性组合的“多波段”校准，其离散度σΔSFR = 0.21 dex。这些结果表明，JWST/MIRI约束的余波段7.7微米发射对于远处星系的SFR是一个可靠的追踪器，其精度为0.21-0.24 dex，前提是星系以中等到高水平的遮挡和金属含量主导星形成。 <div>
We test the relationship between UV-derived star formation rates (SFRs) and the 7.7 μm polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon luminosities from the integrated emission of galaxies at z ∼ 0–2. We utilize multiband photometry covering 0.2–160 μm from the Hubble Space Telescope, CFHT, JWST, Spitzer, and Herschel for galaxies in the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) Survey. We perform spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling of these data to measure dust-corrected far-UV (FUV) luminosities, LFUV, and UV-derived SFRs. We then fit SED models to the JWST/MIRI 7.7–21 μm CEERS data to derive rest-frame 7.7 μm luminosities, L770, using the average flux density in the rest-frame MIRI F770W bandpass. We observe a correlation between L770 and LFUV, where . L770 diverges from this relation for galaxies at lower metallicities, lower dust obscuration, and for galaxies dominated by evolved stellar populations. We derive a “single-wavelength” SFR calibration for L770 that has a scatter from model estimated SFRs (σΔSFR) of 0.24 dex. We derive a “multiwavelength” calibration for the linear combination of the observed FUV luminosity (uncorrected for dust) and the rest-frame 7.7 μm luminosity, which has a scatter of σΔSFR = 0.21 dex. The relatively small decrease in σ suggests this is near the systematic accuracy of the total SFRs using either calibration. These results demonstrate that the rest-frame 7.7 μm emission constrained by JWST/MIRI is a tracer of the SFR for distant galaxies to this accuracy, provided the galaxies are dominated by star formation with moderate-to-high levels of attenuation and metallicity.

<title>A Protocluster of Massive Quiescent Galaxies at z = 4</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report on discovery of a concentration of massive quiescent galaxies located at z = 4. The concentration is first identified using high-quality photometric redshifts based on deep, multiband data in Subaru/XMM-Newton Deep Field. Follow-up near-infrared spectroscopic observations with MOSFIRE on Keck confirm a massive (∼1011M⊙) quiescent galaxy at z = 3.99. Our spectral energy distribution analyses reveal that the galaxy experienced an episode of starburst about 500 Myr prior to the observed epoch, followed by rapid quenching. Since its spectrum is sufficiently good to measure the stellar velocity dispersion, we infer its dynamical mass and find that it is consistent with its stellar mass. The galaxy is surrounded by four massive (>1010M⊙) quiescent galaxies on a ∼1 physical Mpc scale, all of which are consistent with being located at the same redshift based on high-accuracy spectrophotometric redshifts. This is likely a (proto)cluster dominated by quiescent galaxies, the first of the kind reported at such a high redshift as z = 4. Interestingly, it is in a large-scale structure revealed by spectroscopic redshifts from VANDELS. Furthermore, it also exhibits a red sequence, adding further support to the physical concentration of the galaxies. We find no such concentration in the Illustris-TNG300 simulation; it may be that the cluster is such a rare system that the simulation box is not sufficiently large to reproduce it. The total halo mass of the quiescent galaxies is ∼1013M⊙, suggesting that they form a group-sized halo once they collapse together. We discuss the implications of our findings for the quenching physics and conclude with future prospects.

<title>Modeling the Propagation of Slow Magnetoacoustic Waves in a Multistranded Coronal Loop</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We study the propagation properties of slow magnetoacoustic waves in a multithermal coronal loop using a 3D MHD model, for the first time. A bundle of 33 vertical cylinders, each of 100 km radius, randomly distributed over a circular region of radius 1 Mm, is considered to represent the coronal loop. The slow waves are driven by perturbing the vertical velocity (vz) at the base of the loop. We apply forward modeling to the simulation results to generate synthetic images in the coronal channels of the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly. Furthermore, we add appropriate data noise to enable direct comparison with the real observations. It is found that the synthetic images at the instrument resolution show noncospatial features in different temperature channels in agreement with previous observations. Time–distance maps are constructed from the synthetic data to study the propagation properties. The results indicate that the oscillations are only visible in specific channels, depending on the temperature range of the plasma existing within the loop. Additionally, the propagation speed of slow waves is also found to be sensitive to the available temperature range. Overall, we propose that the cross-field thermal properties of coronal structures can be inferred using a combination of numerical simulations and observations of slow magnetoacoustic waves.

<div> UV Ceti, radio spectrum, magnetic field, nonthermal particle acceleration, dynamo processes
总结:
UV Ceti是一个近邻（2.7 pc）的双星系统，其大规模磁场导致其与BL Ceti有非常不同的磁活动特征。文章通过对UV Ceti的射电频谱进行多时期的观测，并展示了类似太阳冕层活动的耀斑辐射、类似行星磁层的极光辐射，以及缓慢变化的持续辐射。射电观测是探究UV Ceti大规模磁场在非热粒子加速中的作用的有效手段。观测结果显示所有波段均存在时间变化，并且在40 GHz以下存在循环偏振度的旋转调制迹象。持续辐射在1到105 GHz范围内基本稳定，排除了来自各向同性螺旋角分布的电子的光厚辐射或光薄吉罗同步辐射机制。文章讨论了类似于木星辐射带的辐射机制可能性。 <div>
BL and UV Ceti are a nearby (2.7 pc) binary system with similar masses, spectral types, and rapid rotation rates, but very different magnetic activity. UV Ceti’s much stronger large-scale magnetic field may cause this difference, highlighting key unanswered questions about dynamo processes in fully convective objects. Here, we present multiepoch characterization of the radio spectrum of UV Ceti spanning 1–105 GHz, exhibiting flared emission similar to coronal activity, auroral-like emission analogous to planetary magnetospheres, and slowly varying persistent emission. Radio observations are a powerful means to probe the role that the large-scale magnetic field of UV Ceti has in nonthermal particle acceleration because radio-frequency phenomena result from both the activity of small-scale field features as well as large-scale auroral current systems. We find temporal variability at all bands observed, and a hint of rotational modulation in the degree of circular polarization up to 40 GHz. The persistent component of the emission is fairly constant from 1 to 105 GHz, making optically thick emission or optically thin gyrosynchrotron from electrons with an isotropic pitch angle distribution unlikely. We discuss the possibility of emission mechanisms analogous to Jupiter’s radiation belts.

该研究对YZ Ret古典新星进行了研究，发现在喷发后77天和115天分别观测到了两个高分辨率的X射线光栅谱。这两个谱中均显示出蓝移速度为-1500 km s-1的发射线，其宽度为500 km s-1。研究结果表明，这两个谱均可以被约70eV的碰撞电离等离子体所描述，并且在两次观测之间减弱了约40倍。此外，谱中还观测到了C+4、C+5和N+5的窄辐射复合连续谱，表明热离子化等离子体与约2eV的冷电子发生相互作用。研究还发现C+4的高n-Rydberg系列异常明亮，可通过连续谱降低来测量电子密度，这与He样N+5的密度诊断结果相吻合。研究认为这些高n能级的高密度是迄今为止在天体物理离子化等离子体中发生带中子氢的最好证据。此外，尽管密度高且通量减少，但令人惊讶的是，在38天后速度和等离子体温度仍然相同，这是持续加热的证据。研究提出这种加热是由于新星喷射物中的反冲冲击产生了一个薄的X射线壳。窄的辐射复合连续谱和带中子氢的反应被归因于与冷气体的直接混合，它们从冲击波前或通过接触不连续面超越了热等离子体。 <br /><br />总结: 该研究对新星YZ Ret进行了X射线谱的观测，发现了碰撞电离等离子体的特征，以及与冷电子和中子氢的互动，揭示了新星喷发后的物理过程。 <div>
The origin of bright X-ray emission lines that appear late in a nova eruption remains largely a puzzle. We present two high-resolution X-ray grating spectra of the classical nova YZ Ret, observed 77 and 115 days post-eruption, using XMM-Newton and Chandra, respectively. Both spectra feature resolved emission lines blueshifted by v = –1500 km s−1 and broadened by σv = 500 km s−1. The two spectra are well described by a collisionally ionized plasma of kT ∼ 70 eV that dimmed by a factor of ∼40 between the two exposures. The spectra also show narrow radiative recombination continua (RRCs) of C+4, C+5, and N+5, indicating the interaction of the hot ionized plasma with cold electrons of kT ∼ 2 eV. The high-n Rydberg series of C+4 is anomalously bright, allowing us to measure the electron density through continuum lowering, which is in agreement with the He-like N+5 density diagnostic of ne = (1.7 ± 0.4) × 1011 cm−3. The high population of these high-n levels constitutes the best evidence to date of charge exchange (CX) with neutral H in an astrophysical ionized plasma. The remarkable fact that the velocity and plasma temperature are the same after 38 days, despite the high density and decreasing flux, is evidence for ongoing heating. We suggest the heating is due to a reverse shock in the nova ejecta, which forms a thin X-ray shell. The narrow RRCs and CX are attributed to direct mixing with cold gas, which overtakes the hot plasma either from the shock front or through the contact discontinuity.

总结: 本文提出了关于脉冲星的电场振荡源自自相干e±对产生的假设，并通过粒子-网格模拟展示了对此过程的电场屏蔽效应。接着，作者通过发展一个简化的时间演化动力学模型来再现e±对产生和电场屏蔽的极限循环行为。该模型考虑了磁层电流的影响、e±的逃逸以及产生率对等离子体密度和能量的动态依赖。最后，通过这一简单的理论模型，作者展示了电场振荡的功率谱在多个极限循环中的平均值与观测到的脉冲星无线电谱是一致的。 <div>
It was recently proposed that the electric field oscillation as a result of self-consistent e± pair production may be the source of coherent radio emission from pulsars. Direct particle-in-cell simulations of this process have shown that the screening of the parallel electric field by this pair cascade manifests as a limit cycle, as the parallel electric field is recurrently induced when pairs produced in the cascade escape from the gap region. In this work, we develop a simplified time-dependent kinetic model of e± pair cascades in pulsar magnetospheres that can reproduce the limit-cycle behavior of pair production and electric field screening. This model includes the effects of a magnetospheric current, the escape of e±, as well as the dynamic dependence of pair production rate on the plasma density and energy. Using this simple theoretical model, we show that the power spectrum of electric field oscillations averaged over many limit cycles is compatible with the observed pulsar radio spectrum.

<br /><br />总结:
太阳耀斑中的丝带前缘是耀斑能量沉积到色球层的初始迹象，具有较长的持续时间。研究表明，在注入非热电子能通量很低的情况下，丝带前缘的特性会持续更长时间。在色球层变得足够炽热和密集时，丝带前缘会转变为常规明亮的丝带。因此，丝带前缘的持续时间是衡量相对较低能通量的高能电子在耀斑能通量较大的轰击之前沉积到色球层的持续时间。 <div>
Solar flare ribbon fronts appear ahead of the bright structures that normally characterize solar flares, and can persist for an extended period of time in spatially localized patches before transitioning to “regular” bright ribbons. They likely represent the initial onset of flare energy deposition into the chromosphere. Chromospheric spectra (e.g., He i 10830 Å and the Mg ii near-UV lines) from ribbon fronts exhibit properties rather different to typical flare behavior. In prior numerical modeling efforts we were unable to reproduce the long lifetime of ribbon fronts. Here we present a series of numerical experiments that are rather simple but which have important implications. We inject a very low flux of nonthermal electrons (F = 5 × 108 erg s−1 cm−2) into the chromosphere for 100 s before ramping up to standard flare energy fluxes (F = 1010−11 erg s−1 cm−2). Synthetic spectra not only sustained their ribbon-front-like properties for significantly longer: in the case of harder nonthermal electron spectra, the ribbon front behavior persisted for the entirety of this weak-heating phase. Lengthening or shortening the duration of the weak-heating phase commensurately lengthened or shortened the ribbon front lifetimes. Ribbon fronts transitioned to regular bright ribbons when the upper chromosphere became sufficiently hot and dense, which happened faster for softer nonthermal electron spectra. Thus, the lifetime of flare ribbon fronts are a direct measure of the duration over which a relatively low flux of high-energy electrons precipitates to the chromosphere prior to the bombardment of a much larger energy flux.

Recent high-resolution and sensitivity Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations have unveiled the carbon isotope ratios (12C/13C) of complex organic molecules (COMs) in a low-mass protostellar source. To understand the 12C/13C ratios of COMs, we investigated the carbon isotope fractionation of COMs from prestellar cores to protostellar cores with a gas-grain chemical network model. We confirmed that the 12C/13C ratios of small molecules are bimodal in the prestellar phase: CO and species formed from CO (e.g., CH3OH) are slightly enriched in 13C compared to the local interstellar medium (by ∼10%), while those from C and C+ are depleted in 13C owing to isotope exchange reactions. COMs are mainly formed on the grain surface and in the hot gas (> 100 K) in the protostellar phase. The 12C/13C ratios of COMs depend on which molecules the COMs are formed from. In our base model, some COMs in the hot gas are depleted in 13C compared to the observations. Thus, we additionally incorporate reactions between gaseous atomic C and H2O ice or CO ice on the grain surface to form H2CO ice or C2O ice, as suggested by recent laboratory studies. The direct C-atom addition reactions open pathways to form 13C-enriched COMs from atomic C and CO ice. We find that these direct C-atom addition reactions mitigate 13C-depletion of COMs, and the model with the direct C-atom addition reactions better reproduces the observations than our base model. We also discuss the impact of the cosmic-ray ionization rate on the 12C/13C ratio of COMs.

Effective temperatures, surface gravities, and iron abundances were derived for 109 stars observed by the K2 mission using equivalent width measurements of Fe i and Fe ii lines. Calculations were carried out in local thermodynamic equilibrium using Kurucz model atmospheres. Stellar masses and radii were derived by combining the stellar parameters with Gaia Data Release 3 parallaxes, V magnitudes, and isochrones. The derived stellar and planetary radii have a median internal precision of 1.8% and 2.3%, respectively. The radius gap near Rplanet ∼ 1.9 R⊕ was detected in this K2 sample. Chromospheric activity was measured from the Ca ii H and K lines using the values of , which were investigated as a function of stellar rotational period (Prot), and we found that chromospheric activity decreases with increasing Prot, although there is a large scatter in (∼0.5) for a given Prot. The activity levels in this sample reveal a paucity of F and G dwarfs with intermediate activity levels (the Vaughan–Preston gap). The effect that stellar activity might have on the derivation of stellar parameters was investigated by including magnetically sensitive Fe i lines in the analysis and we find no significant differences between parameters with and without magnetically sensitive lines, although the more active stars ( ) exhibit a larger scatter in the differences in Teff and [Fe/H].

We present the luminosity functions and stellar mass functions of supernova (SN) host galaxies and test if they differ from the functions of normal field galaxies. We utilize homogeneous samples consisting of 273 SNe Ia (z ≤ 0.3) and 44 core-collapse (CC) SNe (z ≤ 0.1) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey II Supernova Survey and the high-signal-to-noise-ratio photometry of galaxies from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program. SN hosts are classified into star-forming and passive galaxy groups based on the spectral energy distribution fitting. We find that the SN host luminosity functions and stellar mass functions deviate from those of normal field galaxies. Star-forming galaxies dominate the low-mass end of the SN Ia host mass function, while passive galaxies dominate the high-mass end. CC SNe are predominantly hosted by star-forming galaxies. In addition, intermediate-mass hosts produce CC SNe with the highest efficiency, while the efficiency of producing SNe Ia monotonically increases as the hosts become more massive. Furthermore, we derive the pseudo mass normalized SN rates (pSNuM) based on the mass functions. We find that the star-forming component of pSNuMIa is less sensitive to the changes in stellar mass, in comparison with the total rate. The behavior of pSNuMCC suggests that the CC rate is proportional to the star-forming rate.

The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) shows a large variation in ultraviolet (UV) dust extinction curves, ranging from Milky Way (MW) like to significantly steeper curves with no detectable 2175 Å bump. This result is based on a sample of only nine sight lines. From Hubble Space Telescope Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph and IUE spectra of OB stars, we have measured UV extinction curves along 32 SMC sight lines where eight of these curves were published previously. We find 16 sight lines with steep extinction with no detectable 2175 Å bump, four sight lines with MW-like extinction with a detectable 2175 Å bump, two sight lines with fairly flat UV extinction and weak/absent 2175 Å bumps, and 10 sight lines with unreliable curves due to low SMC dust columns. Our expanded sample shows that the sight lines with and without the 2175 Å bump are located throughout the SMC and not limited to specific regions. The average extinction curve of the 16 bump-less sight lines is very similar to the previous average based on four sight lines. We find no correlation between dust column and the strength of the 2175 Å bump. We test the hypothesis that the 2175 Å bump is due to the same dust grains that are responsible for the mid-infrared carbonaceous (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) emission features and find they are correlated, confirming recent work in the MW. Overall, the slope of the UV extinction increases as the amplitudes of the 2175 Å bump and far-ultraviolet curvature decrease. Finally, the UV slope is correlated with N(H i)/A(V) and the 2175 Å bump and nonlinear far-ultraviolet rise amplitudes are anticorrelated with N(H i)/A(V).

11 Lyα emitters detected, observed LAE yield, ionized bubble at z = 7.68, Keck+JWST synergistic efforts <br /><br />总结: 本研究报告了来自WEB Epoch of Reionization Lyα Survey（WERLS）的首批结果，这是一项利用Keck I/MOSFIRE和LRIS进行的光谱观测的Lyα发射测量。研究目标是在三个JWST深场（CEERS，PRIMER和COSMOS-Web）中的EoR内的亮度（J < 26）星系候选者，他们通过预JWST成像中的光度红移选取，红移范围为5.5≲z≲8。报告了在WERLS MOSFIRE数据的前五个夜晚中探测到的11个z∼7-8 Lyα发射者（LAEs;三个确定和八个有待考证的候选者）。作者估计观测到的LAE产额约为13％，这与预期大体一致，假设红移不确定性损失，来自天空OH线的污染，并且在这个时期宇宙大约一半是被电离的，因此在处于中性星际介质中的星系中，可能不太可能观测到Lyα发射。这些目标被选择为UV明亮，并且其绝对UV星等范围为−23.1 < MUV < −19.8。此外，在z=7.68处探测到两个LAE，作者还考虑了在这个红移处存在电离气泡的可能性。未来Keck+JWST的协同工作将为定位电离时期的信标和绘制质量的大尺度分布相对于宇宙的电离状态提供强大工具。 <div>
We present the first results from the Web Epoch of Reionization Lyα Survey (WERLS), a spectroscopic survey of Lyα emission using Keck I/MOSFIRE and LRIS. WERLS targets bright (J < 26) galaxy candidates with photometric redshifts of 5.5 ≲ z ≲ 8 selected from pre-JWST imaging embedded in the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) within three JWST deep fields: CEERS, PRIMER, and COSMOS-Web. Here, we report 11 z ∼ 7–8 Lyα emitters (LAEs; three secure and eight tentative candidates) detected in the first five nights of WERLS MOSFIRE data. We estimate our observed LAE yield is ∼13%, which is broadly consistent with expectations assuming some loss from redshift uncertainty, contamination from sky OH lines, and that the Universe is approximately half-ionized at this epoch, whereby observable Lyα emission is unlikely for galaxies embedded in a neutral intergalactic medium. Our targets are selected to be UV-bright, and span a range of absolute UV magnitudes with −23.1 < MUV < −19.8. With two LAEs detected at z = 7.68, we also consider the possibility of an ionized bubble at this redshift. Future synergistic Keck+JWST efforts will provide a powerful tool for pinpointing beacons of reionization and mapping the large-scale distribution of mass relative to the ionization state of the Universe.

总结: <br />
本研究通过对中国空间测量望远镜的宇宙剪切和大型同步巡天望远镜的超新星宇宙放大进行自相关和交叉相关的研究，旨在确定通过添加放大数据，能够在多大程度上消除宇宙剪切测量中的系统偏差。通过基于不同层次分析的相关性生成模拟的剪切/放大地图，得到了校正的功率谱。采用马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛技术拟合理论模型，研究了宇宙学和没用参数的限制。研究发现，仅使用宇宙剪切数据时，σ8和固有对齐模型参数存在1σ的偏差。但通过添加放大数据，可以完全消除这些偏差。<br /><br /> <div>
Cosmic shear and cosmic magnification reflect the same gravitational lensing field. Each of these two probes are affected by different systematics. We study the auto- and cross-correlations of cosmic shear from the China Space Survey Telescope and cosmic magnification of supernovae from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope. We want to determine to what extent, by adding the magnification data, we can remove the systematic bias in cosmic shear measurements. We generate mock shear/magnification maps based on the correlation between different tomographic bins. After obtaining the corrected power spectra, we adopt the Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique to fit the theoretical models and investigate the constraints on the cosmological and nuisance parameters. We find that, with only the cosmic shear data, there are 1σ biases in the σ8 and intrinsic alignment model parameters. By adding the magnification data, we are able to remove these biases perfectly.

<div> 关键词：超大质量黑洞、活动星系核、热吹流、离子化铁发射线、X射线光谱

总结：<br /><br />本文报告了在M81*和NGC 7213两个典型的低光度活动星系核中，探测到了高离化铁发射线的Doppler位移，并进一步确认了软X射线谱中的蓝移H-like O/Ne发射线。这些线被解释为与额外的具有几千千米每秒速度和较低温度的流组件相关联。经过详细的数值模拟，发现新增检测到的蓝移发射线应来自被热风冲击加热的核周气体。热风可以在颗粒状核周气体上提供比中央黑洞引力更大的冲压力，有效阻碍了黑洞对气体的吸积。这些结果为热AGN风的能量和动量反馈提供了强有力的证据。 <div>
Supermassive black holes in galaxies spend the majority of their lifetime in the low-luminosity regime, powered by hot accretion flow. Strong winds launched from the hot accretion flow have the potential to play an important role in active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback. Direct observational evidence for these hot winds with temperatures around 10 keV, has been obtained through the detection of highly ionized iron emission lines with Doppler shifts in two prototypical low-luminosity AGNs, namely M81* and NGC 7213. In this work, we further identify blueshifted H-like O/Ne emission lines in the soft X-ray spectra of these two sources. These lines are interpreted to be associated with additional outflowing components possessing velocity around several 103 km s−1 and lower temperature (∼0.2–0.4 keV). Blueshifted velocity and the X-ray intensity of these additional outflowing components are hard to explain by previously detected hot wind freely propagating to larger radii. Through detailed numerical simulations, we find the newly detected blueshifted emission lines would come from circumnuclear gas shock-heated by the hot wind instead. Hot wind can provide a larger ram pressure force on the clumpy circumnuclear gas than the gravitational force from the central black hole, effectively impeding the black hole accretion of gas. Our results provide strong evidence for the energy and momentum feedback by the hot AGN wind.

<br />
超级地球和次海王星是两种亚类的小型外行星。研究发现，大部分超级地球通过热驱动风失去了其原初积聚的氢气大气，并且氢气会被有效地嵌入到内部，氧化铁并产生约0.5%至1.0%的水。由于大气不断被加工和化学平衡，尽管按摩尔比例氢气仍然占主导地位，按质量比例而言却变成了以蒸汽为主导。这可能可以通过JWST观测到具有过渡性质量的行星。有效地将氢气嵌入到内部的一个主要效果是使得整体内部密度低于地球。我们预测1M⊕行星的整体密度约为5.0 g cm−3，这与高精度的质量测量以及大气逸出模型的族群级推断分析是一致的。 
<br /><br />总结: 本文研究了超级地球和次海王星的化学平衡，发现大部分超级地球通过热驱动风失去了氢气大气，并且氢气会被有效地嵌入到内部，导致产生约0.5%至1.0%的水。大气通过加工和化学平衡持续演变，并且氢气逐渐被嵌入到内部。根据预测，这种有效的氢气嵌入会使得超级地球整体内部密度低于地球。 <div>
Small, close-in exoplanets are divided into two subpopulations: super-Earths and sub-Neptunes. Most super-Earths are thought to have lost their primordially accreted hydrogen-dominated atmospheres via thermally driven winds. We consider the global chemical equilibrium of super-Earths and the lasting impacts of their fleeting hydrogen atmospheres. We find that hydrogen is efficiently sequestered into the interior, oxidizing iron and endogenously producing ∼0.5%–1.0% water by mass. As the atmospheres of super-Earths are continuously sculpted by mass loss and chemical equilibration, they remain hydrogen-dominated by mole (number) fraction but become steam-dominated by mass, which may be observable with JWST for planets transitioning across the radius valley. One of the main effects of efficient sequestration of hydrogen into the interior is to produce an underdense bulk interior compared to that of Earth. We predict bulk densities of super-Earths to be ∼5.0 g cm−3 for a 1M⊕ planet, which is consistent with high-precision mass measurements and also population-level inference analyses from atmospheric escape models.

总结: 这项研究强调了暗物质晕的角动量分布对盘状星系中棒状结构的形成和演化具有重要作用。通过N体模拟实验发现，角动量分布连续的暗物质晕会增强棒状结构的强度，而分布不连续的暗物质晕会减弱棒状结构的强度。这一发现有助于解决近期文献中关于高自旋暗物质晕中棒状结构演化的矛盾结果。因此，该研究显示了盘状星系系统初始条件设置的重要性，特别是暗物质晕角动量分布的不连续性，对棒状结构的演化产生了重要影响。 <div>
The dark matter halo properties, for example, mass, spin, and concentration, play a significant role in the formation and evolution of bars in disk galaxies. This study highlights the importance of a new parameter: the dark matter halo angular momentum distribution in the disk’s central region. We experiment with N-body galaxy models having a disk and dark matter similar to Milky Way–type galaxies. In these models, we vary the discontinuity of the angular momentum distribution of the halo (the total spin is the same for all models). Our N-body experiments suggest that bar forms in all models after a few Gyr of disk evolution. However, in the secular evolution of the bar, as we evolve these models until 9.78 Gyr, the bar gains its strength in the model with the most continuous halo angular momentum distribution, and the bar loses strength for the most discontinuous halo angular momentum distribution. The secular evolution of the bar suggests that box/peanut/x-shaped bulges similar to those found in the Milky Way disk should be more pronounced in halos with continuous halo angular momentum distributions. This study demonstrates the importance of the initial condition setup of galaxy systems, namely the discontinuity in the dark matter halo angular momentum distribution for a given density distribution, on the bar secular evolution in the disk galaxy simulations. Further, this study helps reconcile the conflicting results of bar secular evolution in a high-spinning halo of the recent literature.

We present an implementation of a Bayesian mixture model using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo techniques to search for the spatial separation of Galactic dust populations. Utilizing intensity measurements from the Planck High Frequency Instrument, we apply this model to high-latitude Galactic dust emission. Our analysis reveals a strong preference for a spatially varying two-population dust model over a one-population dust model, when the latter must capture the total variance in the sky. Each dust population is well characterized by a single-component spectral energy distribution (SED) and accommodates small variations. These populations could signify two distinct components or may originate from a one-component model with different temperatures resulting in different SED scalings. While no spatial information is built into the likelihood, our investigation unveils large-scale spatially coherent structures with high significance, pointing to a physical origin for the observed spatial variation. These results are robust to our choice of likelihood and input data. Furthermore, this spatially varying two-population model is the most favored from Bayesian evidence calculations. Incorporating IRAS 100 μm to constrain the Wein side of the blackbody function, we find the dust populations differ at the 2.5σ level in the spectral index (βd) versus temperature (Td) plane. The presence of multiple dust populations has implications for component separation techniques frequently employed in the recovery of the cosmic microwave background.

Magnetic fields in the stellar interiors are key candidates to explain observed core rotation rates inside solar-like stars along their evolution. Recently, asteroseismic estimates of radial magnetic field amplitudes near the hydrogen-burning shell (H-shell) inside about 24 red giants (RGs) have been obtained by measuring frequency splittings from their power spectra. Using general Lorentz-stress (magnetic) kernels, we investigated the potential for detectability of near-surface magnetism in a 1.3 M⊙ star of supersolar metallicity as it evolves from a mid subgiant to a late subgiant into an RG. Based on these sensitivity kernels, we decompose an RG into three zones—deep core, H-shell, and near-surface. The subgiants instead required decomposition into an inner core, an outer core, and a near-surface layer. Additionally, we find that for a low-frequency g-dominated dipolar mode in the presence of a typical stable magnetic field, ∼25% of the frequency shift comes from the H-shell and the remaining from deeper layers. The ratio of the subsurface tangential field to the radial field in the H-burning shell decides if subsurface fields may be potentially detectable. For p-dominated dipole modes close to , this ratio is around two orders of magnitude smaller in subgiant phases than the corresponding RG. Further, with the availability of magnetic kernels, we propose lower limits of field strengths in crucial layers in our stellar model during its evolutionary phases. The theoretical prescription outlined here provides the first formal way to devise inverse problems for stellar magnetism and can be seamlessly employed for slow rotators.

研究团队对 z ∼ 6.6 类星体 J0923+0402 的黑洞驱动流进行了多尺度和多相特征化，并评估了这些气流对冷气体储库的影响。他们发现在约210 pc的尺度上存在一个强劲的电离气流，并且ALMA观测发现了高速度的[C ii]发射，可能与主宇宙体内含的冷中性气体有关，以及一个大小约15 kpc的[C ii]光晕。该研究首次准确限制了离子化和原子中性气体相的气流能量学特征，发现这种特征与高效反馈机制相一致，并且可能存在排出和预防性反馈模式。离子化气流和原子气流的尺度和能量特征表明它们可能与不同的类星体吸积事件相关联。该研究结果表明在 z ≳ 6 处的类星体中存在强烈的黑洞反馈作用，很可能塑造了冷气体储库的性质，直至周银河范围。 <div>
Although the mass growth of supermassive black holes during the epoch of reionization is expected to play a role in shaping the concurrent growth of their host galaxies, observational evidence of feedback at z ≳ 6 is still sparse. We perform the first multiscale and multiphase characterization of black-hole-driven outflows in the z ∼ 6.6 quasar J0923+0402 and assess how these winds impact the cold gas reservoir. We employ the SimBAL spectral synthesis to fit broad absorption line features and find a powerful ionized outflow on a ≲210 pc scale, with a kinetic power ∼2%–100% of the quasar luminosity. Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of [C ii] emission allow us to study the morphology and kinematics of the cold gas. We detect high-velocity [C ii] emission, likely associated with a cold neutral outflow at ∼0.5−2 kpc scale in the host galaxy, and a bright extended [C ii] halo with a size of ∼15 kpc. For the first time at such an early epoch, we accurately constrain the outflow energetics in both the ionized and the atomic neutral gas phases. We find such energetics to be consistent with expectations for an efficient feedback mechanism, and both ejective and preventative feedback modes are likely at play. The scales and energetics of the ionized and atomic outflows suggest that they might be associated with different quasar accretion episodes. The results of this work indicate that strong black hole feedback is occurring in quasars at z ≳ 6 and is likely responsible for shaping the properties of the cold gas reservoir up to circumgalactic scales.

We present an extension of the massively parallel, GPU native, astrophysical hydrodynamics code Cholla to magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). Cholla solves the ideal MHD equations in their Eulerian form on a static Cartesian mesh utilizing the Van Leer + constrained transport integrator, the HLLD Riemann solver, and reconstruction methods at second and third order. Cholla’s MHD module can perform ≈260 million cell updates per GPU-second on an NVIDIA A100 while using the HLLD Riemann solver and second order reconstruction. The inherently parallel nature of GPUs combined with increased memory in new hardware allows Cholla’s MHD module to perform simulations with resolutions ∼5003 cells on a single high-end GPU (e.g., an NVIDIA A100 with 80 GB of memory). We employ GPU direct Message Passing Interface to attain excellent weak scaling on the exascale supercomputer Frontier, while using 74,088 GPUs and simulating a total grid size of over 7.2 trillion cells. A suite of test problems highlights the accuracy of Cholla’s MHD module and demonstrates that zero magnetic divergence in solutions is maintained to round off error. We also present new testing and CI tools using GoogleTest, GitHub Actions, and Jenkins that have made development more robust and accurate and ensure reliability in the future.

长期模拟研究恒星和盘的形成过程，采用三维非理想磁流体动力学。模拟从原恒星云开始，经过盘的长期演化，最终距离原恒星形成约1.5x10^5年。主要的磁力制动和磁驱动的流出作用导致主要的吸积阶段盘的大小约为50天文单位并且主要没有次级结构。当流出突破云层时，导致包层质量迅速减少，主要吸积阶段结束。流出在质量吸积率减小的同时也减弱。盘的包层吸积结束后，盘逐渐增长并出现瞬时的螺旋结构，这是由于引力不稳定性导致的。当包层吸积结束后，盘变得稳定并且达到约300天文单位大小。此外，约30%的初始云质量被流出排斥。研究的一个重要发现是，包层消散后，流出出现再次活跃，盘表面有质量排出，这种排出（或盘风）是因为此时磁压显著支配了盘的上下方面的动压和热压。利用估计的角动量通量和质量损失率，估算盘消散的时间尺度约为10^6年。 <br /><br />总结: 本研究使用三维非理想磁流体动力学模拟了恒星和盘的形成过程。模拟表明，磁性制动和磁驱动的流出在主要的吸积阶段起到重要作用。当主要吸积阶段结束后，盘逐渐增长并发展出临时的螺旋结构，最终盘变得稳定并且达到较大规模。研究还发现，包层消散后，盘表面出现质量排出，推测盘的消散时间尺度约为10^6年。 <div>
We perform a long-term simulation of star and disk formation using three-dimensional nonideal magnetohydrodynamics. The simulation starts from a prestellar cloud and proceeds through the long-term evolution of the circumstellar disk until ∼1.5 × 105 yr after protostar formation. The disk has size ≲50 au and little substructure in the main accretion phase because of the action of magnetic braking and the magnetically driven outflow to remove angular momentum. The main accretion phase ends when the outflow breaks out of the cloud, causing the envelope mass to decrease rapidly. The outflow subsequently weakens as the mass accretion rate also weakens. While the envelope-to-disk accretion continues, the disk grows gradually and develops transient spiral structures, due to gravitational instability. When the envelope-to-disk accretion ends, the disk becomes stable and reaches a size ≳300 au. In addition, about 30% of the initial cloud mass has been ejected by the outflow. A significant finding of this work is that after the envelope dissipates a revitalization of the wind occurs, and there is mass ejection from the disk surface that lasts until the end of the simulation. This mass ejection (or disk wind) is generated because the magnetic pressure significantly dominates both the ram pressure and thermal pressure above and below the disk at this stage. Using the angular momentum flux and mass-loss rate estimated from the disk wind, the disk dissipation timescale is estimated to be ∼106 yr.

Due to their inability to self-regulate, ultrafaint dwarfs are sensitive to prescriptions in subgrid physics models that converge and regulate at higher masses. We use high-resolution cosmological simulations to compare the effect of bursty star formation histories (SFHs) on dwarf galaxy structure for two different subgrid supernova (SN) feedback models, superbubble and blastwave, in dwarf galaxies with stellar masses from 5000 < M*/M⊙ < 109. We find that in the “MARVEL-ous Dwarfs” suite both feedback models produce cored galaxies and reproduce observed scaling relations for luminosity, mass, and size. Our sample accurately predicts the average stellar metallicity at higher masses, however low-mass dwarfs are metal poor relative to observed galaxies in the Local Group. We show that continuous bursty star formation and the resulting stellar feedback are able to create dark matter (DM) cores in the higher dwarf galaxy mass regime, while the majority of ultrafaint and classical dwarfs retain cuspy central DM density profiles. We find that the effective core formation peaks at M*/Mhalo ≃ 5 × 10−3 for both feedback models. Both subgrid SN models yield bursty SFHs at higher masses; however, galaxies simulated with superbubble feedback reach maximum mean burstiness values at lower stellar mass fractions relative to blastwave feedback. As a result, core formation may be better predicted by stellar mass fraction than the burstiness of SFHs.

总结:
本研究使用Chintzoglou & Zhang的3D可视化技术结合11504太阳活动区星冕中的局部逆FIP效应观测，确定了磁重连的潜在位置以及在太阳大气中可能产生的后果。我们在太阳黑子光桥之间的磁通管内观察到了周期性加热和重连流的微妙迹象。此外，在光桥的两侧，我们观察到了小的反平行水平磁场分量，支持了我们观测到逆FIP等离子体的重连可能发生的地方。当这些微妙迹象与逆FIP效应观测结果结合在一起时，这为太阳色球分层下重连的间接观测证据提供了有力支持，然而直接证据仍然难以获得。 <br /><br /> <div>
Within the coronae of stars, abundances of those elements with low first ionization potential (FIP) often differ from their photospheric values. The coronae of the Sun and solar-type stars mostly show enhancements of low-FIP elements (the FIP effect) while more active stars such as M dwarfs have coronae generally characterized by the inverse-FIP (I-FIP) effect. Highly localized regions of I-FIP effect solar plasma have been observed by Hinode's EUV Imaging Spectrometer in a number of highly complex active regions (ARs), usually around strong light bridges of the umbrae of coalescing/merging sunspots. These observations can be interpreted in the context of the ponderomotive force fractionation model, which predicts that plasma with I-FIP effect composition is created by the refraction of waves coming from below the plasma fractionation region in the chromosphere. A plausible source of these waves is thought to be reconnection in the (high-plasma-β) subchromospheric magnetic field. In this study, we use the 3D visualization technique of Chintzoglou & Zhang combined with observations of localized I-FIP effect in the corona of AR 11504 to identify potential sites of such reconnection and its possible consequences in the solar atmosphere. We found subtle signatures of episodic heating and reconnection outflows in the expected places, in between magnetic flux tubes forming a light bridge, within the photosphere of the AR. Furthermore, on either side of the light bridge, we observed small antiparallel horizontal magnetic field components, supporting the possibility of reconnection occurring where we observe I-FIP plasma. When taken together with the I-FIP effect observations, these subtle signatures provide a compelling case for indirect observational evidence of reconnection below the fractionation layer of the chromosphere, however direct evidence remains elusive.

太阳丰度问题是太阳模型中的持续争论话题。研究人员构建了旋转太阳模型，并分析了不同丰度尺度对模型的影响。他们发现，使用Magg的丰度尺度的模型具有更好的声速和密度轮廓，能够复制观测到的频率分离比例r02和r13，以及与地震推断的表面氦丰度和对流区深度相匹配。此外，模拟的中微子流量与检测到的中微子流量一致。研究人员还发现，核反应会对中微子流量和密度轮廓产生影响，可以用于诊断天体物理S因子。利用更新的中微子流量和地震推断结果所偏爱的S因子可能会显著改善太阳模型。 <br /><br />总结: 太阳丰度问题是太阳模型中的持续争论话题。研究人员发现使用Magg的丰度尺度的模型在多个方面具有优势，并对S因子的研究有所启发。 <div>
The ratio of metal abundance to hydrogen abundance of the solar photosphere, (Z/X)s, has been revised several times. Standard solar models, based on these revised solar abundances, are in disagreement with seismically inferred results. Recently, Magg et al. introduced a new value for (Z/X)s, which is still under debate in the community. The solar abundance problem or solar modeling problem remains a topic of ongoing debate. We constructed rotating solar models in accordance with various abundance scales where the effects of convection overshoot and enhanced diffusion were included. Among these models, those utilizing Magg’s abundance scale exhibit superior sound speed and density profiles compared to models using other abundance scales. Additionally, they reproduce the observed frequency separation ratios r02 and r13. These models also match the seismically inferred surface helium abundance and convection zone depth within the 1σ level. Furthermore, the calculated neutrino fluxes from these models agree with detected ones at the level of 1σ. We found that neutrino fluxes and density profile are influenced by nuclear reactions, allowing us to use the combination of detected neutrino fluxes and seismically inferred density for diagnosing astrophysical S-factors. This diagnostic approach shows that S11 may be underestimated by 2%, while S33 may be overestimated by about 3% in previous determinations. The S-factors favored by updated neutrino fluxes and helioseismic results can lead to significant improvements in solar models.

CMEs是太阳大气事件的关键组成部分，其周期性变化对于理解太阳大尺度磁场的循环演化至关重要。本文利用太阳和日球际观测卫星的CDAW目录，采用连续小波变换方法，对CME的速度和加速度进行分析。研究结果发现，不同速度的CME在时间上的分布存在明显差异，出现了Rieger型周期和准二年振荡的CME。这两种周期信号在太阳23和24周期中有显著差异。此外，北半球和南半球的周期性模式也存在差异。文章对结果进行了潜在机制和解释的讨论。<br /><br />总结: CME是太阳大气事件的关键组成部分，其周期性变化对于理解太阳大尺度磁场的循环演化至关重要。文章利用CDAW目录和连续小波变换方法对CME进行了分析，发现了不同速度CME的时间分布差异、Rieger型周期和准二年振荡的CME等现象，并讨论了太阳23和24周期中的差异以及北半球和南半球的周期性模式差异。 <div>
Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) exhibit a wide range of quasiperiodic variations and are crucial for our understanding of the cyclical evolution of large-scale magnetic fields. However, the mid-term periodicities of different types of CMEs associated with different processes at the source location need to be clearly understood. Based on the CDAW catalog released by the Large Angle and Spectroscopic Coronagraph mission on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, we investigated the period of CMEs based on the speeds and accelerations using the continuous wavelet transformation method. Our results revealed that the distribution of CMEs over time is quite distinctly different for different speeds, and there are Rieger-type periods and quasi-biennial oscillations of the CMEs. The two types of periodic signals show significant differences in solar cycles 23 and 24. Furthermore, the periodicity patterns for the northern hemisphere differ from those in the southern hemisphere. The potential mechanisms and explanations of the results are also discussed.

<div> 观测，James Webb Space Telescope, NIRCam, 信噪比，观测数据，测光精度
总结:
观测了局部星系目标的解析星的数据，使用 James Webb Space Telescope NIRCam Exposure Time Calculator (ETC) v3.0 进行了实证评估。对于明亮的恒星，发现ETC和观测之间的纯泊松估计的信噪比一致良好，但非理想效应是目前可以达到的光度精度的限制因素。对于暗淡的恒星，发现ETC的信噪比估计受到光度精度影响的选择，可以影响曝光时间的估计长达5倍。最后，还量化了拥挤对信噪比的影响，并提供了估计ETC预测拥挤效应的指导方针。 <div>
We empirically assess estimates from v3.0 of the James Webb Space Telescope NIRCam Exposure Time Calculator (ETC) using observations of resolved stars in Local Group targets taken as part of the Resolved Stellar Populations Early Release Science (ERS) Program. For bright stars, we find that (i) purely Poissonian estimates of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are in good agreement between the ETC and observations, but nonideal effects (e.g., flat-field uncertainties) are the current limiting factor in the photometric precision that can be achieved; (ii) source position offsets, relative to the detector pixels, have a large impact on the ETC saturation predictions and introducing subpixel dithers in the observation design can improve the saturation limits by up to ∼1 mag. For faint stars, for which the sky dominates the error budget, we find that the choice in the ETC extraction strategy (e.g., aperture size relative to point-spread function size) can affect the exposure time estimates by up to a factor of 5. We provide guidelines for configuring the ETC aperture photometry to produce SNR predictions in line with the ERS data. Finally, we quantify the effects of crowding on the SNRs over a large dynamic range in stellar density and provide guidelines for approximating the effects of crowding on SNRs predicted by the ETC.

<div> solar coronal magnetic field, WSA model, spherical harmonic expansion, finite-difference potential field solutions, side-by-side comparisons<br />总结:<br />该论文比较了传统的基于球谐展开的WSA模型实现和最近开源的有限差分代码POT3D所产生的WSA模型。比较了模型的末端太阳风速度和磁场，观察了在计算过程、参数和输入微小扰动的情况下WSA模型的变化。同时比较了外边界处磁场线的足点和模型中开放磁场的位置。研究发现，追踪的磁场线足点显示出显著的一致性，在磁中性线和极区存在最大差异。 <div>
The Wang–Sheeley–Arge (WSA) model has been in use for decades and remains a popular, economical approach to modeling the solar coronal magnetic field and forecasting conditions in the inner heliosphere. Given its usefulness, it is unsurprising that a number of WSA implementations have been developed by various groups with different computational approaches. While the WSA magnetic field model has traditionally been calculated using a spherical harmonic expansion of the solar magnetic field, finite-difference potential field solutions can offer speed and/or accuracy advantages. However, the creation of new versions of WSA requires that we ensure the solutions from these new models are consistent with established versions and that we quantify for the user community to what degree and in what ways they differ. In this paper, we present side-by-side comparisons of WSA models produced using the traditional, spherical harmonic–based implementation developed by Wang, Sheeley, and Arge with WSA models produced using a recently open-sourced finite-difference code from the CORHEL modeling suite called POT3D. We present comparisons of the terminal solar wind speed and magnetic field at the outer boundaries of the models, weighing these against the variation of the WSA model in the presence of small perturbations in the computational procedure, parameters, and inputs. We also compare the footpoints of magnetic field lines traced from the outer boundaries and the locations of open field in the models. We find that the traced field-line footpoints show remarkable agreement, with the greatest differences near the magnetic neutral line and in the polar regions.

总结:<br />
研究发现，银河系的形成与宇宙中其他星系的盘形成具有密切联系。星系盘的组装受到同一平面内的气体流入、平面外的气体流出以及盘内恒星形成的相互影响。最新的光谱和光度调查表明，银河系的镁丰度和星形成速率在不同的回顾时间内呈现出不同的径向分布。这些结果与"泄漏式吸积盘"模型的预测相吻合，支持了银河系的组装是符合该模型的。另外，银河系的有效产出约束与恒星化学演化模型的理论预测也基本一致。这些结果将我们对银河系盘的形成贯穿到了宇宙中其他星系盘形成的大局之中。 <div>
Both simulations and observations suggest that the disk assembly of galaxies is governed by the interplay between coplanar gas inflow, ex-planar gas outflow, and in situ star formation on the disk, known as the leaky accretion disk. This scenario predicts a strong connection between radial distributions of star formation and chemical abundances. The Milky Way, being the sole Galaxy where we can reliably measure star formation histories and the corresponding temporally resolved chemical abundances with individual stars, provides a unique opportunity to scrutinize this scenario. Based on the recent large spectroscopic and photometric surveys of Milky Way stars, we obtain the radial profiles of magnesium abundance ([Mg/H]) and star formation rate surface density at different lookback times. We find the radial profiles of [Mg/H] can be well-reproduced using the leaky accretion disk model with only two free parameters for stars formed within 4 Gyr, as well as the flattening at large radii of metallicity profiles traced by H ii regions and Cepheids. Furthermore, the constraint effective yield of the Milky Way and nearby galaxies shows broad consistency with the theoretical predictions from the stellar chemical evolution model with a mass-loading factor of 0–2. These results support that the recent assembly of the Milky Way adheres to the leaky accretion disk scenario, bridging the disk formation of our home Galaxy to the big picture of disk formation in the Universe.

We characterize the earliest galaxy population in the JADES Origins Field, the deepest imaging field observed with JWST. We make use of ancillary Hubble Space Telescope optical images (five filters spanning 0.4–0.9 μm) and novel JWST images with 14 filters spanning 0.8−5 μm, including seven medium-band filters, and reaching total exposure times of up to 46 hr per filter. We combine all our data at >2.3 μm to construct an ultradeep image, reaching as deep as ≈31.4 AB mag in the stack and 30.3–31.0 AB mag (5σ, r = 0.″1 circular aperture) in individual filters. We measure photometric redshifts and use robust selection criteria to identify a sample of eight galaxy candidates at redshifts z = 11.5−15. These objects show compact half-light radii of R1/2 ∼ 50−200 pc, stellar masses of M⋆ ∼ 107−108 M☉, and star formation rates ∼ 0.1−1 M☉ yr−1. Our search finds no candidates at 15 < z < 20, placing upper limits at these redshifts. We develop a forward-modeling approach to infer the properties of the evolving luminosity function without binning in redshift or luminosity that marginalizes over the photometric redshift uncertainty of our candidate galaxies and incorporates the impact of nondetections. We find a z = 12 luminosity function in good agreement with prior results, and that the luminosity function normalization and UV luminosity density decline by a factor of ∼2.5 from z = 12 to z = 14. We discuss the possible implications of our results in the context of theoretical models for evolution of the dark matter halo mass function.

We describe the Stagger code for simulations of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) systems. This is a modular code with a variety of physics modules that will let the user run simulations of deep stellar atmospheres, sunspot formation, stellar chromospheres and coronae, proto-stellar disks, star formation from giant molecular clouds, and even galaxy formation. The Stagger code is efficiently and highly parallelizable, enabling such simulations with large ranges of both spatial and temporal scales. We describe the methodology of the code and present the most important of the physics modules, as well as its input and output variables. We show results of a number of standard MHD tests to enable comparison with other, similar codes. In addition, we provide an overview of tests that have been carried out against solar observations, ranging from spectral line shapes, spectral flux distribution, limb darkening, intensity and velocity distributions of granulation, to seismic power spectra and the excitation of p-modes. The Stagger code has proven to be a high-fidelity code with a large range of uses.

总结: 本文对0.8 < z < 1.3的16 μm流量密度限制的星系样本进行了形态学分析。研究发现，在目标红移处，16 μm发射对应于来自强烈恒星形成的多环芳烃特征，或者活跃星系核加热的尘埃。样本中67%为LIRGs，主要分为AGN主导型、星形成主导型、复合型和蓝色紧凑星系。大部分样本（71%）呈盘状形态，少数AGN主导星系比星形成主导型和复合型星系更偏向球状。ULIRGs子样本遵循陡峭的大小-质量关系，与早期星系更为接近。此外，随着4.5 μm亮度过剩（AGN强度的代理）的增加，样本呈现更多的球状特征。根据特定恒星形成率和紧凑性图，大部分LIRG主导的星系样本沿着渐进演化轨迹发展，与任何并合活动无关。样本中的16个ULIRGs中有6个紧凑并且具有强烈AGN贡献，可能沿着更激烈活动的快速轨迹演化。 <div>
We present a morphological analysis of the 16 μm flux-density-limited galaxy sample at 0.8 < z < 1.3 from Huang et al. (2021). At the targeted redshift, the 16 μm emission corresponds to the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon feature from intense star formation, or dust heated by active galactic nuclei (AGN). Our sample of 479 galaxies are dominated by luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs; 67%) in three CANDLES fields (Extended Groth Strip, Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey North and South fields), and are further divided into AGN-dominated, star-forming dominated, composite, and blue compact galaxies by their spectral energy distribution types. The majority of our sample (71%) have disk morphologies, with the few AGN-dominated galaxies being more bulge-dominated than the star-forming-dominated and composite galaxies. The distribution of our sample on the Gini versus M20 plane is consistent with previous studies, where the Sérsic index n shows an increasing trend toward the smaller M20 and higher Gini region below the dividing line for mergers. The subsample of ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) follows a steep size–mass relation that is closer to the early-type galaxies. In addition, as the 4.5 μm luminosity excess ( , proxy for AGN strength) increases, our sample appears to be more bulge dominated (i.e., higher n). Based on the specific star formation rate and compactness ( ) diagram, the majority of our LIRG-dominated galaxy sample follows a secular evolution track, and their distribution can be explained without involving any merging activities. Out of the 16 ULIRGs in our sample, six are compact with strong AGN contributions, likely evolving along the fast track from more violent activities.

<br />
使用IRIS观测的太阳耀斑数据显示，色球凝聚（CCs）的形成与演化时间尺度和速度与之前的理论模型存在较大差异。研究发现，CCs的寿命平均为1分钟，且随最大速度（vmax）的增加而延长。这表明太阳耀斑的大气层和加热场景可能比Fisher最初假设的要复杂。此外，约90%的样本显示存在可观测的加速阶段，这些加速阶段不仅可作为耀斑模型的诊断指标，还可以用来计算其他模型诊断，如初始加速质量。总结: <br /><br /> <div>
Chromospheric condensations (CCs) are a prominent feature of flare footpoint heating in the solar flare standard model, yet their timescales and velocities are not well understood. Fisher derived several important analytical relationships, which have rarely been examined with modern spectral observations. The Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) provides a wealth of flare data with a high enough cadence to sufficiently capture CC evolution. We analyzed Doppler shifts in Mg ii 2791 and Fe ii 2814 from a sample of flare footpoint pixels observed by IRIS to compare with Fisher's analytics and recent flare models. We found a detection lifetime of 1 minute occurs in 50% of the sample, with Mg ii showing several pixels with longer values and Fe ii almost categorically shorter, and both growing with the maximum velocity, vmax. The shifts’ half-life is commonly <40 s and is inversely related to vmax, indicating that the first half of the CC evolution has more efficient kinetic energy loss. The lifetime’s wide range and growth with vmax indicate that the footpoint atmospherics and heating scenarios can vary more widely than first postulated in Fisher. Around 90% of the sample had observable acceleration periods, lasting an average of 38 and 32 s for Mg ii and Fe ii, respectively. These acceleration periods, as well as serving as flare model diagnostics themselves, could potentially be used to calculate other model diagnostics such as the initially accelerated mass.

<div> 关键词: HZ, 气候调节, 硅酸盐风化, 大气CO2分压, 行星

总结:
行星的大气CO2分压对气候稳定有重要影响，特别是在行星太阳辐射较低的外部Habitable Zone范围内。研究表明，在这种情况下，随着大气CO2分压和温度的增加，全球蒸发和降水会减少，导致硅酸盐风化减少，从而可能导致CO2累积或CO2耗尽，进而导致气候失稳和可能的“雪球地球”情况。这暗示着在HZ的外部范围内，硅酸盐风化可能无法维持适宜的气候条件。 <div>
Implicit in the definition of the classical circumstellar habitable zone (HZ) is the hypothesis that the carbonate-silicate cycle can maintain clement climates on exoplanets with land and surface water across a range of instellations by adjusting atmospheric CO2 partial pressure (pCO2). This hypothesis is made by analogy to the Earth system, but it is an open question whether silicate weathering can stabilize climate on planets in the outer reaches of the HZ, where instellations are lower than those received by even the Archean Earth and CO2 is thought likely to dominate atmospheres. Since weathering products are carried from land to ocean by the action of water, silicate weathering is intimately coupled to the hydrologic cycle, which intensifies with hotter temperatures under Earth-like conditions. Here, we use global climate model simulations to demonstrate that the hydrologic cycle responds counterintuitively to changes in climate on planets with CO2-H2O atmospheres at low instellations and high pCO2, with global evaporation and precipitation decreasing as pCO2 and temperatures increase at a given instellation. Within the Maher & Chamberlain (or MAC) weathering formulation, weathering then decreases with increasing pCO2 for a range of instellations and pCO2 typical of the outer reaches of the HZ, resulting in an unstable carbon cycle that may lead to either runaway CO2 accumulation or depletion of CO2 to colder (possibly snowball) conditions. While the behavior of the system has not been completely mapped out, the results suggest that silicate weathering could fail to maintain habitable conditions in the outer reaches of the nominal HZ.
