<div> Galactic globular cluster, Australia Telescope Compact Array, radio continuum survey, radio source, X-ray source
<br />总结: 本研究对47 Tucanae星团进行了超深度射电连续波观测，获得了迄今为止最深的星团射电图像。研究发现了一个与星团中心位置重合的微弱无线电源ATCA J002405.702-720452.361，并且可能与微弱X射线源有关。通过无线电、X射线、光学和紫外数据分析，排除了背景活跃星系核、色球活跃双星或白矮星双星等解释，认为该源可能是未发现的毫秒脉冲星或微弱的黑洞吸积体。如果X射线源与无线电源相关联，则黑洞活动基本平面表明黑洞质量约为54-6000太阳质量，表明这可能是中等质量黑洞或重型恒星质量黑洞。 <div>
We present the results of an ultradeep radio continuum survey, containing ∼480 hr of observations, of the Galactic globular cluster 47 Tucanae with the Australia Telescope Compact Array. This comprehensive coverage of the cluster allows us to reach rms noise levels of 1.19 μJy beam−1 at 5.5 GHz, 940 nJy beam−1 at 9 GHz, and 790 nJy beam−1 in a stacked 7.25 GHz image. This is the deepest radio image of a globular cluster and the deepest image ever made with the Australia Telescope Compact Array. We identify ATCA J002405.702-720452.361, a faint (6.3 ± 1.2 μJy at 5.5 GHz, 5.4 ± 0.9 μJy at 9 GHz), flat-spectrum (α = −0.31 ± 0.54) radio source that is positionally coincident with the cluster center and potentially associated with a faint X-ray source. No convincing optical counterpart was identified. We use radio, X-ray, optical, and UV data to show that explanations involving a background active galactic nucleus, a chromospherically active binary, or a binary involving a white dwarf are unlikely. The most plausible explanations are that the source is an undiscovered millisecond pulsar or a weakly accreting black hole. If the X-ray source is associated with the radio source, the fundamental plane of black-hole activity suggests a black hole mass of ∼54–6000 M⊙, indicating an intermediate-mass black hole or a heavy stellar-mass black hole.

<div> Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite Objects of Interest (TOI), pulsation, δ Sct, γ Dor, RR Lyrae<br />
发现了三颗TOI，具有脉动特征，观测超过一个扇区。分析显示，在3901颗有光曲线的TOI中，有两颗有δ Sct特征，一颗有γ Dor特征。目前已知的脉动星中，寄托行星的数量非常有限。这一发现也成为一个研究不同天体现象的激动人心的实验室，包括星球互相作用对脉动以及行星伴星检测时间的影响。此外，我们还发现了16颗TOI恒星，其周期性和光曲线形态与不同的经典脉动类别相符，但其中大多数的主频信号源于污染源。 <br /><br />总结:发现了具有脉动特征的三颗TOI，并发现了两颗具有δ Sct特征和一颗具有γ Dor特征。此外，还发现了其他16颗TOI恒星可能具有不同的脉动特征，但主频信号来自污染源。 <div>
We report the discovery of three Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite Objects of Interest (TOI) with signatures of pulsation, observed in more than one sector. Our main goal is to explore how large is the variety of classical pulsators such as δ Sct, γ Dor, RR Lyrae and Cepheid among TOI pulsators. The analysis reveals two stars with signatures of δ Sct and one of γ Dor, out of a sample of 3901 TOIs with available light curves (LCs). To date, there is a very scarce number of known pulsating stars hosting planets. The present finding also emerges as an exciting laboratory for studying different astrophysical phenomena, including the effects of star–planet interaction on pulsation and timing detection of planetary companions. We have also identified 16 TOI stars with periodicities and LCs morphology compatible with different classical pulsating classes, but for most of them, the dominant frequency signals originate from contaminating sources.

Cardinal mocks是Buzzard模拟的新版本，支持进行中和未来的宇宙学调查，包括DES、DESI和LSST。这些目录基于一个四分之一的天空模拟，将星系填充到z = 2.35的红移深度上。相比Buzzard模拟，Cardinal mocks包括更新的亚星系丰度匹配模型，考虑了孤立星系，并包括了光度和暗物质性质之间的质量相关的分散度。这个模型可以同时拟合三个不同光度阈值样本中测量的星系聚类和群-星系交叉相关性。Cardinal mocks还具有一个新的颜色分配模型，可以同时拟合三个不同光度箱中的颜色相关星系聚类。我们开发了一个算法，利用光度数据进一步改进颜色分配模型，并开发了一种改进小尺度透镜效应的新方法。这些改进使Cardinal mocks能够准确地复制DES数据中的星系团丰度和透镜星系的属性。因此，这些模拟将是基于大规模天空调查的未来宇宙学分析的宝贵工具。<br /><br />总结: Cardinal mocks是Buzzard模拟的新版本，支持进行中和未来的宇宙学调查，包括DES、DESI和LSST。模拟中有更新的亚星系丰度匹配模型和颜色分配模型，并且能够准确地复制DES数据中的星系团丰度和透镜星系的属性。 <div>
We present the Cardinal mock galaxy catalogs, a new version of the Buzzard simulation that has been updated to support ongoing and future cosmological surveys, including the Dark Energy Survey (DES), DESI, and LSST. These catalogs are based on a one-quarter sky simulation populated with galaxies out to a redshift of z = 2.35 to a depth of mr = 27. Compared to the Buzzard mocks, the Cardinal mocks include an updated subhalo abundance matching model that considers orphan galaxies and includes mass-dependent scatter between galaxy luminosity and halo properties. This model can simultaneously fit galaxy clustering and group–galaxy cross-correlations measured in three different luminosity threshold samples. The Cardinal mocks also feature a new color assignment model that can simultaneously fit color-dependent galaxy clustering in three different luminosity bins. We have developed an algorithm that uses photometric data to further improve the color assignment model and have also developed a novel method to improve small-scale lensing below the ray-tracing resolution. These improvements enable the Cardinal mocks to accurately reproduce the abundance of galaxy clusters and the properties of lens galaxies in the DES data. As such, these simulations will be a valuable tool for future cosmological analyses based on large sky surveys.

<div> Sagittarius B2, peptide-like molecules, IRAM 30 m telescope, excitation temperature, column density

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章使用IRAM 30 m 望远镜对Sagittarius B2区域进行了观测，检测到了与生命起源密切相关的肽类分子。研究利用旋转图解法得出了HCONH2的激发温度和柱密度的空间分布，并推导出了CH3CONH2的柱密度。结果表明，在Sgr B2的分子包层中，激发温度的范围为6到46K。通过计算得出CH3CONH2/HCONH2和HCONH2/HNCO的丰度比，发现CH3CONH2在Sgr B2的西北部区域相对于HCONH2有所增加。此外，还检测到了H13CONH2，得出了12C/13C的比值为28.7。研究还使用了一个时变化的化学模型来解释HCONH2和CH3CONH2的丰度，最佳拟合结果表明尘埃温度为53-56K。需要在模型中包括更多的化学反应以解释观测到的丰度。 <div>
Peptide-like molecules, which have a close connection with the origin of life, have been detected in the Universe. Mapping observations of HCONH2 and CH3CONH2, two of the simplest peptide-like molecules, are performed toward the Sagittarius B2 (Sgr B2) complex with the IRAM 30 m telescope. Seven transitions of HCONH2 and five transitions of CH3CONH2 are used in the analysis. The spatial distributions of the excitation temperature and column density of HCONH2 in the molecular envelope of Sgr B2 are obtained by rotation diagrams. Assuming the same excitation temperature of HCONH2, the column densities of CH3CONH2 are also calculated. The results show that the excitation temperature ranges from 6 to 46 K in the molecular envelope of Sgr B2. The abundance ratios between HCONH2 and CH3CONH2 are calculated to explore the relationship between them, as are those between HCONH2 and HNCO. The abundance ratio of CH3CONH2/HCONH2 varies from 10% to 20%, while that of HCONH2/HNCO ranges from 1.5% to 10%. CH3CONH2 is enhanced with respect to HCONH2 in the northwest region of Sgr B2. One transition of H13CONH2 is detected toward 12 positions of Sgr B2, from which a 12C/13C ratio of 28.7 is obtained. A time-dependent chemical model with a short-duration X-ray burst is used to explain the observed abundances of HCONH2 and CH3CONH2, with the best-fitting result at Tdust = 53–56 K. More chemical reactions are required to be included in the model since the modeled abundance is lower than the observed one at the observed Tdust.

Hess J1809-193是一个极高能γ射线源，被LHAASO和HAWC观测站在100 TeV能量以上探测到。它由超新星残骸、脉冲星和附近的分子云等天文现象组成，是探索γ射线产生机制的有趣候选对象。文章考虑了过去爆炸释放的高能宇宙射线注入，这些遗迹可能是HESS J1809-193范围内的SNR G011.0-00.0。他们解释了HESS J1809-193区域的多波段数据，包括宇宙射线电子的同步辐射、逆康普顿效应以及与当地分子云中的冷质子相互作用产生的次级γ射线。观测数据是基于时间演化的宇宙射线谱产生的次级光子进行建模，假设爆炸的年龄为4500年。

Hess J1809-193是一个极高能γ射线源，由LHAASO和HAWC观测到。文章讨论了宇宙射线注入、γ射线产生机制和观测数据建模。 <div>
The very-high-energy γ-ray source HESS J1809-193 has been detected by the LHAASO and HAWC observatory beyond 100 TeV energy. It is an interesting candidate for exploring the underlying mechanisms of γ-ray production due to the presence of supernova remnants, pulsars, and molecular clouds close to it. We have considered the injection of the energetic cosmic rays from a past explosion, whose reminiscent may be SNR G011.0-00.0, which is located within the extended γ-ray source HESS J1809-193. We explain the multiwavelength data from the region of HESS J1809-193 with synchrotron, inverse Compton, and bremsstrahlung emission of cosmic-ray electrons and secondary γ-ray production in interactions of cosmic-ray protons with the cold protons in the local molecular clouds within a time-dependent framework including the diffusion loss of cosmic rays. The observational data have been modeled with the secondary photons produced by the time-evolved cosmic-ray spectrum assuming the age of the explosion is 4500 yr.

<div> Alfvén wave turbulent heating, plasma loops, active region, energy balance, solar atmosphere<br />
总结:<br />
这篇论文旨在回答Alfvén波湍流加热在太阳大气模型中的物理过程如何展开在一个活动区的个体等离子体环中。通过对波耗散和反射、温度分布、加热比例定律和沿着环的能量平衡进行全面的统计调查，提供了对太阳下层大气能量分配的深入见解。研究表明，我们的3D全球模型与Alfvén波湍流加热的基于物理现象的公式得出的加热速率从环的脚点到顶部呈指数下降，这是过去文献中经验性假设的结果。还进行了对活动区的详细差分发射度（DEM）分析，并且与Hinode/极紫外成像光谱仪观测得到的DEM曲线相比，模拟结果良好。这是第一项使用高数值分辨率检验我们AWSoM模型的详细活动区能量学特性的工作，并进一步展示了低频Alfvén波湍流加热在产生活动区内实际等离子体性质和能量学方面的能力。 <div>
The coronal heating problem has been a major challenge in solar physics, and a tremendous amount of effort has been made over the past several decades to solve it. In this paper, we aim at answering how the physical processes behind the Alfvén wave turbulent heating adopted in the Alfvén Wave Solar atmosphere Model (AWSoM) unfold in individual plasma loops in an active region (AR). We perform comprehensive investigations in a statistical manner on the wave dissipation and reflection, temperature distribution, heating scaling laws, and energy balance along the loops, providing in-depth insights into the energy allocation in the lower solar atmosphere. We demonstrate that our 3D global model with a physics-based phenomenological formulation for the Alfvén wave turbulent heating yields a heating rate exponentially decreasing from loop footpoints to top, which had been empirically assumed in the past literature. A detailed differential emission measure (DEM) analysis of the AR is also performed, and the simulation compares favorably with DEM curves obtained from Hinode/Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer observations. This is the first work to examine the detailed AR energetics of our AWSoM model with high numerical resolution and further demonstrates the capabilities of low-frequency Alfvén wave turbulent heating in producing realistic plasma properties and energetics in an AR.

总结: 本文介绍了MIST项目，其旨在通过仿真观测研究土壤和MIST波束直达性对探测宇宙黎明时期的全球21厘米信号的影响。结果表明，单层土壤模型可以比较容易地恢复信号，而双层模型则更具挑战性，其中对底层土壤电导率较高的模型需要进行波束色散校正。这些结果将有助于选择有利于探测宇宙黎明信号的观测点。 <div>
The Mapper of the IGM Spin Temperature (MIST) is a new ground-based, single-antenna, radio experiment attempting to detect the global 21 cm signal from the Dark Ages and Cosmic Dawn. A significant challenge in this measurement is the frequency dependence, or chromaticity, of the antenna beam directivity. MIST observes with the antenna above the soil and without a metal ground plane, and the beam directivity is sensitive to the electrical characteristics of the soil. In this paper, we use simulated observations with MIST to study how the detection of the global 21 cm signal from Cosmic Dawn is affected by the soil and the MIST beam directivity. We simulate observations using electromagnetic models of the directivity computed for single- and two-layer models of the soil. We test the recovery of the Cosmic Dawn signal with and without beam chromaticity correction applied to the simulated data. We find that our single-layer soil models enable a straightforward recovery of the signal even without chromaticity correction. Two-layer models increase the beam chromaticity and make the recovery more challenging. However, for the model in which the bottom soil layer has a lower electrical conductivity than the top layer, the signal can be recovered even without chromaticity correction. For the other two-layer models, chromaticity correction is necessary for the recovery of the signal, and the accuracy requirements for the soil parameters vary between models. These results will be used as a guideline to select observation sites that are favorable for the detection of the Cosmic Dawn signal.

In this paper we explore the idea of using multi-spacecraft observations of Jovian electrons to measure the 3D distribution of these particles in the inner heliosphere. We present simulations of Jovian electron intensities along selected spacecraft trajectories for 2021 and compare these, admittedly qualitatively, to these measurements. Using the data–model comparison we emphasize how such a study can be used to constrain the transport parameters in the inner heliosphere, and how this can lead to additional insight into energetic particle transport. Model results are also shown along the expected trajectories of selected spacecraft, including the off-ecliptic phase of the Solar Orbiter mission from 2025 onward. Lastly, we revisit the use of historical data and discuss upcoming missions that may contribute to Jovian electron measurements.

总结: <br />
本研究利用Kodaikanal Solar Observatory（KoSO）的Ca ii K光谱图（1907-2007）进行分析，揭示了太阳色球的不同旋转速率以及与太阳黑子旋转速率的比较。研究发现，色球光辉区域的赤道旋转速率比光球快1.59%，纬度梯度也较小。此外，对罗马、梅东和蒙特威尔逊天文台的数据进行分析，结果支持了KoSO数据的发现。最后，研究未发现过去一个世纪色球的不同旋转存在显著的南北不对称或系统性变化。 <div>
Chromospheric differential rotation is a key component in comprehending the atmospheric coupling between the chromosphere and the photosphere at different phases of the solar cycle. In this study, we therefore utilize the newly calibrated multidecadal Ca ii K spectroheliograms (1907–2007) from the Kodaikanal Solar Observatory (KoSO) to investigate the differential rotation of the solar chromosphere using the technique of image cross-correlation. Our analysis yields the chromospheric differential rotation rate Ω(θ) = (14.61 ± 0.04–2.18 ± 0.37 {\sin }^{2}\theta -1.10\pm 0.61{\sin }^{4}\theta )^\circ day−1. These results suggest the chromospheric plages exhibit an equatorial rotation rate 1.59% faster than the photosphere when compared with the differential rotation rate measured using sunspots and also a smaller latitudinal gradient compared to the same. To compare our results to those from other observatories, we have applied our method on a small sample of Ca ii K data from Rome, Meudon, and Mount Wilson observatories, which support our findings from KoSO data. Additionally, we have not found any significant north–south asymmetry or any systematic variation in chromospheric differential rotation over the last century.

<div> 星系、环境影响、星体形成率、星体形成主序、质量抑制<br />
<br />
在这项研究中，我们使用完整质量的样本对低于4的红移z的约170k个星系进行了环境对星体形成活动的影响的系统研究。在z < 1时，我们发现所有星系的平均星体形成率（SFR）随着环境密度的增加而减少。然而，当我们只考虑星体形成星系时，平均SFR在z < 1时与环境无关。在z > 2时，我们观察到所有星系的SFR与环境密度之间存在明显的正相关关系。另一方面，星系的恒星质量在所有红移下除了z < 1的星体形成星系外都明显随环境增加。在z < 2时，隐化星系的比例随着环境密度的增加而增加，并且在z∼1附近确认了形态密度关系的存在。我们还发现在z > 1时，环境抑制可忽略，而质量抑制是所有红移下巨大星系的主要抑制机制。基于这些结果，我们认为恒星质量调节的物理过程可能是星系星体形成活动的主要驱动力。在低红移（z < 1）时，由于其较高质量，巨大星系主要被抑制，导致正常的SFR-密度关系。在高红移（z > 2）时，大多数星系都是紧密遵循星体形成主序的星体形成星系，它们在不同环境中的恒星质量差异自然导致SFR-密度关系的逆转。<br /><br />总结: 该研究使用了COSMOS2020目录中的大样本数据，发现了星系星体形成活动与环境密度的关系在不同红移下的变化规律。在低红移时，星体形成率与环境密度呈负相关，主要受到质量抑制的影响；而在高红移时，星体形成率与环境密度呈正相关，主要受到质量抑制和环境影响的共同作用。这一研究为我们了解星系形成演化过程提供了重要的参考。 <div>
We present a systematic study of the environmental impact on star formation activities of galaxies using a mass-complete sample of ∼170k galaxies at z &lt; 4 from the latest COSMOS2020 catalog. At z &lt; 1, we find that the mean star formation rate (SFR) of all galaxies decreases with increasing density of the environment. However, when we only consider star-forming galaxies, the mean SFR becomes independent of the environment at z &lt; 1. At z &gt; 2, we observe a clear positive correlation between the SFR and the density of the environment for all the galaxies. On the other hand, the stellar mass of the galaxies increases significantly with the environment at all redshifts except for star-forming galaxies at z &lt; 1. The fraction of quiescent galaxies increases with increasing density of the environment at z &lt; 2, and the morphology–density relation is confirmed to be present up to z ∼ 1. We also find that environmental quenching is negligible at z &gt; 1, whereas mass quenching is the dominant quenching mechanism for massive galaxies at all redshifts. Based on these results, we argue that stellar mass-regulated physical processes might be the major driving force for star formation activities of galaxies. At low redshift (z &lt; 1) massive galaxies are quenched primarily due to their high mass, resulting in a normal SFR–density relation. At high redshift (z &gt; 2) most of the galaxies are star-forming ones tightly following the star-forming main sequence, and the difference in their stellar mass in different environments naturally leads to a reversal of the SFR–density relation.

这项研究报道了一项在红移为1.34的TXS 1206+549窄线塞弗特1星系的g-和r-带光变曲线中检测到的光学拟周期振荡（QPO），使用了Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF)的观测数据。在考虑试验因子后，两个波段中的显著性水平分别为3.1σ和2.6σ。QPO信号在2018年3月至2021年12月之间大约有10个周期，持续了约4年。通过相位分析，折叠后的光变曲线显示出近乎正弦的轮廓。有趣的是，在ZTF观测的同时光变曲线中，在Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System数据的o-带光变曲线中检测到了一个类似周期的潜在周期信号；此外，在来自Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope数据的γ射线光变曲线中也检测到了一个类似周期的弱峰。文中还讨论了活动星系核中周期性的潜在起源。 <br /><br />总结:
1. 在TXS 1206+549星系中检测到约134天的光学拟周期振荡。
2. 信号持续了约4年，且呈现近乎正弦的轮廓。
3. 在其他波段和光变曲线数据中也检测到了类似周期的信号。
4. 对于这种周期性的潜在起源进行了讨论。 <div>
Here we report an optical quasiperiodic oscillation (QPO) with a period of ∼134 days detected in g- and r-band light curves of the narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy TXS 1206+549 at a redshift of 1.34 with data from observations at the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). After considering the trial factor, the significance levels in the two bands are 3.1σ and 2.6σ, respectively. The QPO signal presents about 10 cycles ranging from 2018 March to 2021 December, thus lasting ∼4 yr. A nearly sinusoidal profile also appears in the folded light curves by using a phase-resolved analysis. Interestingly, in the simultaneous light curve with the timescale of ZTF observations, a potential periodic signal with a similar period is detected in the o-band light curve from Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System data; additionally, a weak peak is also detected at a similar period in the γ-ray light curve obtained from Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope data. Some potential origins of periodicities in active galactic nuclei are discussed for the QPO reported here.

星系形成和演化涉及各种在不同时间尺度上运行的有效随机过程。扩展的调节器模型提供了一个分析框架，用于解释由这些过程造成的星系整体恒星形成的变化（或“爆发性”）。它通过使用功率谱密度（PSD）形式主义，将Fourier空间中的变化性与影响巨大分子云的创造和破坏的随机气体流入、平衡和动力学过程的有效时间尺度联系起来。我们利用功率谱密度和自相关函数之间的连接，将这个模型重新表述为自相关函数，然后使用物理上有动机的高斯过程在对数恒星形成率（SFR）空间中对星系恒星形成史（SFHs）的变化性进行建模。然后，我们利用恒星群合成模型，探讨模型随机性的变化如何影响类似银河系和现今矮星的星系群在高红移下的光谱特征。我们发现，即使在固定的散射情况下，对随机性模型的干扰（改变时间尺度与总体变化性）也会在理想化和更真实的星系群中留下独特的光谱特征。基于Hubble空间望远镜、詹姆斯·韦伯空间望远镜和南希·格雷斯·罗曼空间望远镜的现有和未来调查，光谱特征的分布，包括基于Hα和紫外线的SFR指标、Hδ和Ca H和K吸收线强度、Dn(4000)和宽带颜色，提供了可验证的预测。高斯过程SFH框架为下一代光谱能量分布建模工具提供了一种快速、灵活的物理协方差模型的实现。可在https://github.com/kartheikiyer/GP-SFH找到用于重现我们结果的代码。<br /><br />总结: 该研究探讨了星系形成和演化中的随机过程，并提出了扩展的调节器模型来解释星系恒星形成的变化。这项研究使用物理上有动机的高斯过程在对数恒星形成率空间中对星系恒星形成史的变化性进行建模，并发现即使在固定的散射情况下，对随机性模型的干扰也会在星系群中留下独特的光谱特征。研究结果提供了对未来观测的可验证预测，并为下一代光谱能量分布建模工具提供了一种快速、灵活的实现。 <div>
Galaxy formation and evolution involve a variety of effectively stochastic processes that operate over different timescales. The extended regulator model provides an analytic framework for the resulting variability (or “burstiness”) in galaxy-wide star formation due to these processes. It does this by relating the variability in Fourier space to the effective timescales of stochastic gas inflow, equilibrium, and dynamical processes influencing giant molecular clouds' creation and destruction using the power spectral density (PSD) formalism. We use the connection between the PSD and autocovariance function for general stochastic processes to reformulate this model as an autocovariance function, which we use to model variability in galaxy star formation histories (SFHs) using physically motivated Gaussian processes in log star formation rate (SFR) space. Using stellar population synthesis models, we then explore how changes in model stochasticity can affect spectral signatures across galaxy populations with properties similar to the Milky Way and present-day dwarfs, as well as at higher redshifts. We find that, even at fixed scatter, perturbations to the stochasticity model (changing timescales vs. overall variability) leave unique spectral signatures across both idealized and more realistic galaxy populations. Distributions of spectral features including Hα and UV-based SFR indicators, Hδ and Ca H and K absorption-line strengths, Dn(4000), and broadband colors provide testable predictions for galaxy populations from present and upcoming surveys with the Hubble Space Telescope, James Webb Space Telescope, and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. The Gaussian process SFH framework provides a fast, flexible implementation of physical covariance models for the next generation of spectral energy distribution modeling tools.

总结:<br /><br />这篇论文介绍了Shack-Hartmann波前传感器(SH-WFS)在扩展目标上的理论分析，特别关注了归一化交叉相关(NCC)算法的实施。通过利用NCC算法的计算公式直接表达相关函数矩阵中最大值的坐标，以获得准确的误差描述。此外，通过误差传递函数确定了质心位置的方差，量化了测量误差。与Michau等人之前的发现相比，我们的结果显示出系数差异，具体结果比其工作高出1.5倍。广泛的太阳颗粒模拟和实验结果验证了理论误差公式。这些误差公式可以有效地估计SH-WFS的准确度，为光学系统设计提供了理论基础。 <div>
Correlating the Shack–Hartmann wave front sensor (SH-WFS) with extended targets is widely used in solar adaptive optics systems. This paper aims to introduce a theoretical analysis that evaluates the accuracy of the SH-WFS on extended sources, with a specific focus on the implementation of the Normalized Cross-correlation (NCC) algorithm. To obtain an accurate error description, we utilized the calculation formula of the NCC algorithm to directly express the coordinates of the maximum value in the correlation function matrix. Furthermore, we determined the variance of the centroid position through the error transfer function, which quantifies the measurement error. In comparison with the previous findings of Michau et al., our result exhibits a coefficient disparity, specifically obtaining results 1.5 times higher than their work. The extensive solar granulation simulation and experimental results validate the theoretical error formulas. These error formulas can effectively estimate the accuracy of the SH-WFS, providing a theoretical foundation for the design of optical systems.

本研究利用自监督机器学习探索了高红移（z ≥ 3）的星系形态多样性，在TNG50模拟中校准的数据驱动星系形态表示方案显示出对噪声的鲁棒性，并与模拟星系的物理性质（包括其3D结构）良好相关。对JWST/NIRCam CEERS数据发布的3 ≤ z ≤ 6质量完备样本的F200W和F356W星系图像应用该方法，发现模拟和观测星系在对比学习的表示空间中并不完全相同。同时发现被分类为盘状星系的一半星系与TNG50模拟中具有低恒星特定角动量和非椭球结构的星系位于表示空间的类似区域。尽管数据驱动研究无法确定这些星系的真实性质，但暗示高红移时期的盘状星系比传统监督分类可能被高估。深入的成像和光谱跟进以及与其他模拟的比较将有助于明确确定这些星系的真实性质，并建立更可靠的限制高红移时期盘状星系的出现。

Visual inspections of the first optical rest-frame images from JWST have indicated a surprisingly high fraction of disk galaxies at high redshifts. Here, we alternatively apply self-supervised machine learning to explore the morphological diversity at z ≥ 3. Our proposed data-driven representation scheme of galaxy morphologies, calibrated on mock images from the TNG50 simulation, is shown to be robust to noise and to correlate well with the physical properties of the simulated galaxies, including their 3D structure. We apply the method simultaneously to F200W and F356W galaxy images of a mass-complete sample (M*/M⊙ &gt; 109) at 3 ≤ z ≤ 6 from the first JWST/NIRCam CEERS data release. We find that the simulated and observed galaxies do not exactly populate the same manifold in the representation space from contrastive learning. We also find that half the galaxies classified as disks—either convolutional neural network-based or visually—populate a similar region of the representation space as TNG50 galaxies with low stellar specific angular momentum and nonoblate structure. Although our data-driven study does not allow us to firmly conclude on the true nature of these galaxies, it suggests that the disk fraction at z ≥ 3 remains uncertain and possibly overestimated by traditional supervised classifications. Deeper imaging and spectroscopic follow-ups as well as comparisons with other simulations will help to unambiguously determine the true nature of these galaxies, and establish more robust constraints on the emergence of disks at very high redshift.

在哈勃边缘场进行的最新紫外线亮度函数（UVLF）分析通过对前景透镜星团后面的数据加以研究，帮助确立了z∼5-9 UVLF的微弱端估计，比在场内还要暗5等星。这些测量结果提供了有关低亮度星系在宇宙再电离中的作用的宝贵信息，有助于校准JWST观测的预期。我们将半经验模型拟合到来自哈勃的透镜和先前UVLF数据，并对再电离期间的平均恒星形成效率（SFE）进行约束，透镜UVLF测量探测到的暗物质尺度达到M∼2×10^9M⊙。隐含的SFE随暗物质质量的趋势与先前在M≳10^10M⊙的推断外推一致，尽管联合数据更倾向于较浅的SFE。然而，这种偏好部分受透镜测量的系统不确定性影响。在z∼6附近，我们发现SFE在∼10^11和10^12M⊙之间达到约20％的峰值。我们的最佳拟合模型与Planck2020确定的电子散射光学厚度值一致，并且与大多数当前的再电离历史测量结果一致，前提是离子化光子的逃逸分数fesc∼10％-20％。联合UVLF在z∼8附近占再电离光子预算的近80％。最后，我们表明，对于Z≳11的最新JWST UVLF估计需要与哈勃数据所暗示的红移演化有着显著偏离。 <br /><br />总结: UVLF分析帮助确立了z∼5-9 UVLF的微弱端估计，对于再电离和JWST观测有重要影响。测量结果约束了恒星形成效率及其与暗物质质量的关系，并表明在z∼6附近SFE达到峰值。最佳拟合模型与Planck2020确定的电子散射光学厚度值一致，并且联合UVLF占了再电离光子预算的近80％。最新JWST UVLF估计与哈勃数据有着显著偏离。 <div>
A recent ultraviolet luminosity function (UVLF) analysis in the Hubble Frontier Fields, behind foreground lensing clusters, has helped solidify estimates of the faint-end of the z ∼ 5–9 UVLF at up to 5 mag fainter than in the field. These measurements provide valuable information regarding the role of low-luminosity galaxies in reionizing the universe and can help in calibrating expectations for JWST observations. We fit a semiempirical model to the lensed and previous UVLF data from Hubble. This fit constrains the average star formation efficiency (SFE) during reionization, with the lensed UVLF measurements probing halo mass scales as small as M ∼ 2 × 109M⊙. The implied trend of SFE with halo mass is broadly consistent with an extrapolation from previous inferences at M ≳ 1010M⊙, although the joint data prefer a shallower SFE. This preference, however, is partly subject to systematic uncertainties in the lensed measurements. Near z ∼ 6, we find that the SFE peaks at ∼20% between ∼1011 and 1012M⊙. Our best-fit model is consistent with the Planck 2020 determinations of the electron scattering optical depth, and most current reionization history measurements, provided the escape fraction of ionizing photons is fesc ∼ 10%–20%. The joint UVLF accounts for nearly 80% of the ionizing photon budget at z ∼ 8. Finally, we show that recent JWST UVLF estimates at z ≳ 11 require strong departures from the redshift evolution suggested by the Hubble data.

We  present the demography of the dynamics and gas mass fraction of 33 extremely metal-poor galaxies (EMPGs) with metallicities of 0.015–0.195 Z⊙ and low stellar masses of 104–108M⊙ in the local universe. We conduct deep optical integral field spectroscopy (IFS) for the low-mass EMPGs with the medium-high resolution (R = 7500) grism of the 8 m Subaru FOCAS IFU instrument by the EMPRESS 3D survey, and investigate the Hα emission of the EMPGs. Exploiting the resolution high enough for the low-mass galaxies, we derive gas dynamics with the Hα lines by the fitting of three-dimensional disk models. We obtain an average maximum rotation velocity (vrot) of 15 ± 3 km s−1 and an average intrinsic velocity dispersion (σ0) of 27 ± 10 km s−1 for 15 spatially resolved EMPGs out of 33 EMPGs, and find that all 15 EMPGs have vrot/σ0 &lt; 1 suggesting dispersion-dominated systems. There is a clear decreasing trend of vrot/σ0 with the decreasing stellar mass and metallicity. We derive the gas mass fraction (fgas) for all 33 EMPGs, and find no clear dependence on stellar mass and metallicity. These vrot/σ0 and fgas trends should be compared with young high-z galaxies observed by the forthcoming JWST IFS programs to understand the physical origins of the EMPGs in the local universe.

总结:<br /><br />本研究利用上海天马射电望远镜在8600 MHz观测到了9颗毫秒脉冲星(MSPs)，并成功获取了它们的综合脉冲轮廓。通过对2250 MHz观测数据进行更新，本研究扩大了已发表综合轮廓的MSPs数量，包括了之前没有相关结果的七颗MSPs。通过对新的流量密度和脉冲宽度测量结果与先前的低频结果进行比较，研究了MSPs在更广泛的频率范围内的综合轮廓演变和光谱特性。最后，本研究发现其中四颗MSPs的光谱不符合单一幂律，而是用断裂幂律来拟合。此外，研究发现PSR J1713+0747星的综合轮廓出现了显著变化，且频率增加时这种变化更为突出。相比星际介质的影响，作者更倾向于将这一事件解释为磁层发生的变化。同时，研究发现其综合轮廓在事件发生后可能直到多个日期才恢复到先前的状态。 <div>
We report detection results of nine millisecond pulsars (MSPs) at 8600 MHz using simultaneous 2250 and 8600 MHz observations conducted with the Shanghai Tian Ma Radio Telescope. Mainly benefiting from updated ephemerids with 2250 MHz observations, integrated profiles of all nine MSPs at 8600 MHz are successfully obtained by coherently adding multi-epoch (3–83 epochs) observation data spanning from 19–1210 days, which significantly increases the number of MSPs with published profiles (from 4 to 11) above 8000 MHz, as seven of our target MPSs had no related results previously. Combining our new flux density and pulse width measurements with previous low-frequency results, we study their integrated profile evolution and spectral behaviors in a wider frequency range. We find their component separations and pulse widths remain almost constant, which is consistent with previous findings. While dramatic evolution of integrated profiles exists at low frequencies, we observe a potential end of the related evolution around 5 GHz in eight MSPs. The spectra of four MSPs are found to deviate from a single power law, and we fit them with a broken power law. The change in the profile of PSR J1713+0747, which started around MJD 59320−59321, seems to be more prominent as the observation frequency increases. Compared with the effects of the interstellar medium, we prefer to explain this event as some changes in the magnetosphere. We also find its integrated profile possibly had not recovered to the pre-event state until MJD 59842–59857.

Some supernovae (SNe) are powered by the collision of the SN ejecta with dense circumstellar matter (CSM). Their emission spectra show characteristic line shapes of combined broad emission and narrow P Cygni lines, which should closely relate to the CSM structure and the mass-loss mechanism that creates the dense CSM. We quantitatively investigate the relationship between the line shape and the CSM structure by Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations, considering two representative cases of dense CSM formed by steady and eruptive mass loss. Comparing the Hα emission between the two cases, we find that a narrow P Cygni line appears in the eruptive case but does not appear in the steady case due to the difference in the velocity gradient in the dense CSM. We also reproduce the blueshifted photon excess observed in some Type IIn SNe, which is formed by photon transport across the shock wave, and find the relationship between the velocity of the shocked matter and the amount of blueshift of the photon excess. We conclude that the presence or absence of narrow P Cygni lines can distinguish the mass-loss mechanism and suggest high-resolution spectroscopic observations with λ/Δλ ≳ 104 after the light-curve peak for applying this diagnostic method.

<div> 孤立卫星星系，TNG50-1 模拟，lopsided形态，径向对齐，长轴比率

在这项工作中，我们对TNG50-1模拟生成的1780个孤立卫星星系进行了lopsided形态的统计分析，考虑了来自暗物质晕中心的潮汐场效应。孤立卫星星系指的是在其维里半径内质量超过1%的星系，且周围没有邻近子结构。我们研究了卫星星系的主轴与其暗物质晕中心径向方向之间的径向对齐（RA），分别在0-2、2-5和5-10 Rh（Rh为星体的半质量半径）的径向范围内进行研究。根据我们的结果，在内部和中间区域，径向对齐几乎无法检测到，但在外部区域明显存在。我们还计算了主轴的远端与近端半轴比率a-/a+，它衡量了面向暗物质晕中心（远端）和背向暗物质晕中心（近端）的半轴比率。在所有卫星星系的径向区间内，远端较长半轴的卫星数量几乎等于近端较长半轴的卫星数量。因此，暗物质晕中心的潮汐场在形成lopsided卫星星系中起到了较小的作用。我们进一步研究了长半长轴径向对齐（LRA），即卫星星系的长半长轴与其暗物质晕中心径向方向的对齐情况。在ΛCDM牛顿动力学框架内，我们的样本中没有发现明确的LRA证据。最后，我们简要讨论了TNG50-1模拟中星系不对称的可能起源。

Galaxies are observed to be lopsided, meaning that they are more massive and more extended along one side than the opposite side. In this work, we provide a statistical analysis of the lopsided morphology of 1780 isolated satellite galaxies generated by the TNG50-1 simulation, incorporating the effect of tidal fields from halo centers. The isolated satellites are galaxies without nearby substructures whose mass is over 1% of the satellites within their virial radii. We study the radial alignment (RA) between the major axes of satellites and the radial direction of their halo centers in radial ranges of 0–2, 2–5, and 5–10 Rh, with Rh being the stellar half-mass radius. According to our results, the RA is virtually undetectable in inner and intermediate regions, yet it is significantly evident in outer regions. We also calculate the far-to-near-side semiaxial ratios of the major axes, denoted by a−/a+, which measure the semiaxial ratios of the major axes in the hemispheres between those facing away from (far side) and facing toward (nearside) halo centers. In all the radial bins of the satellites, the numbers of satellites with longer semiaxes on the far side are found to be almost equal to those with longer semiaxes on the near side. Therefore, the tidal fields from halo centers play a minor role in the generation of lopsided satellites. The long semimajor-axes radial alignment (LRA), i.e., an alignment between the long semimajor axes of satellite galaxies and the radial directions to their halo centers, is further studied. No clear evidence of LRA is found in our sample within the framework of ΛCDM Newtonian dynamics. Finally, we briefly discuss the possible origins of the asymmetry of galaxies in TNG50-1.

The physical origin of fast radio bursts (FRBs) is still unclear. However, young magnetars associated with short-duration gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) have been thought to be possible central engines for some FRBs. In this paper, we perform a systematic search for SGRBs that are associated with FRBs in a sample including 623 FRBs (601 one-off bursts and 22 repeaters) and 168 SGRBs with precise localizations. We find that FRB 190309A is spatially associated with GRB 060502B, with a chance probability of 0.05 when temporal and redshift information is taken into account. Considering the high chance probability (the statistical significance is &lt;3σ), we examine other observational properties such as the host galaxy, the dispersion measure, and the energy budget of the central engine to check the possibility of their association. Although the available observational information is insufficient to determine whether they are physically associated, it does not rule out such a possibility. As the only pair of FRB and GRB that are spatially associated, it remains an interesting case worthy of further attention.

<br /><br />总结: 本研究通过观测FRB 20201124A和其宿主星系，发现宿主星系中存在大量星体形成，比光学观测推测的星体形成高出2.5-6倍，显示星体形成受尘埃影响。同时，射电观测显示FRB位置延伸有射电发射。研究提出FRB可能源自星体形成区内的磁星，或者从宿主星系中央栏向外迁移而来。此外，对于FRB位置上的持续射电发射放射，对其亮度进行了限制，这一限制与磁星星云和超星云模型基本一致。 <div>
We present high-resolution 1.5–6 GHz Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) optical and infrared observations of the extremely active repeating fast radio burst (FRB) FRB 20201124A and its barred spiral host galaxy. We constrain the location and morphology of star formation in the host and search for a persistent radio source (PRS) coincident with FRB 20201124A. We resolve the morphology of the radio emission across all frequency bands and measure a star formation rate (SFR) ≈ 8.9 M⊙ yr−1, approximately ≈2.5–6 times larger than optically inferred SFRs, demonstrating dust-obscured star formation throughout the host. Compared to a sample of all known FRB hosts with radio emission, the host of FRB 20201124A has the most significantly obscured star formation. While HST observations show the FRB to be offset from the bar or spiral arms, the radio emission extends to the FRB location. We propose that the FRB progenitor could have formed in situ (e.g., a magnetar born from a massive star explosion). It is still plausible, although less likely, that the progenitor of FRB 20201124A migrated from the central bar of the host. We further place a limit on the luminosity of a putative PRS at the FRB position of L6.0GHz ≲ 1.8 ×1027 erg s−1 Hz−1, among the deepest PRS luminosity limits to date. However, this limit is still broadly consistent with both magnetar nebulae and hypernebulae models assuming a constant energy injection rate of the magnetar and an age of ≳105 yr in each model, respectively.

<title>Star Formation Efficiency in Nearby Galaxies Revealed with a New CO-to-H2 Conversion Factor Prescription</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Determining how the galactic environment, especially the high gas densities and complex dynamics in bar-fed galaxy centers, alters the star formation efficiency (SFE) of molecular gas is critical to understanding galaxy evolution. However, these same physical or dynamical effects also alter the emissivity properties of CO, leading to variations in the CO-to-H2 conversion factor (αCO) that impact the assessment of the gas column densities and thus of the SFE. To address such issues, we investigate the dependence of αCO on the local CO velocity dispersion at 150 pc scales using a new set of dust-based αCO measurements and propose a new αCO prescription that accounts for CO emissivity variations across galaxies. Based on this prescription, we estimate the SFE in a sample of 65 galaxies from the PHANGS–Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array survey. We find increasing SFE toward high-surface-density regions like galaxy centers, while using a constant or metallicity-based αCO results in a more homogeneous SFE throughout the centers and disks. Our prescription further reveals a mean molecular gas depletion time of 700 Myr in the centers of barred galaxies, which is overall three to four times shorter than in nonbarred galaxy centers or the disks. Across the galaxy disks, the depletion time is consistently around 2–3 Gyr, regardless of the choice of αCO prescription. All together, our results suggest that the high level of star formation activity in barred centers is not simply due to an increased amount of molecular gas, but also to an enhanced SFE compared to nonbarred centers or disk regions.

<title>Comparing Plasma Anisotropy Associated with Solar Wind Discontinuities and Alfvénic Fluctuations</title>

Solar wind magnetic field fluctuations exhibit a complex multiscale nature, often encompassing ion-scale discontinuities and MHD-scale Alfvénic fluctuations. Both of these types of structures are thought to play a critical role in plasma heating and turbulence dissipation. Here we comparatively analyze the plasma pressure anisotropies within discontinuities and adjacent Alfvénic fluctuations, leveraging unique solar wind observations from orbit conjunctions between the ARTEMIS and WIND missions, along the same flow streamline, though about 150 Earth radii apart. Based on 11 cases of such observations, we compare direct measurements of plasma anisotropy from particle instruments with its estimates from anisotropic MHD theory using the ratios of correlated ion velocity and Alfvén speed variations Δvi/ΔvA. We find that (1) sporadically observed discontinuities associated with bifurcated reconnection current sheets harbor significant parallel electron anisotropies of &gt;0.2; (2) direct electron measurements in all events reveal a median anisotropy of ∼0.07 for Alfvénic fluctuations and ∼0.17 for discontinuities; (3) anisotropic MHD predicts even more disparate total anisotropies within Alfvénic fluctuations and discontinuities, with a median value of ∼0.15 for the former and ∼0.57 for the latter; (4) the differences between theory-predicted and directly measured anisotropies imply that the ion contribution to anisotropy is significant and likely dominant within both types of structures, an assertion which we partly verify using simultaneous ion measurements from WIND. Our observations confirm that such discontinuities play a uniquely important role in producing solar wind plasma heating and anisotropy.

HM Sge是一个尘埃丰富的共生Mira系统，研究表明，这个系统在1975年的新星状爆发之后经历了迅速的演化，表现出一些有趣的特征。首次利用新的EXES高光谱分辨率红外光谱技术探测到了共生系统中的rovibrational水发射。该特征显示出一定的速度但没有明显的高速流出现。中红外光度测量和光谱学显示，氧丰富的巨星支系尘埃和尘埃产量在过去39年中几乎没有变化。在光学/紫外线范围内，检测到了三个主要的[N II]星云特征，其中两个特征显示出一定的运动，相对于之前观测到的平均流出速度为38和78 km/s；一些之前检测到的[N II]特征已不再可见。新的紫外线光谱表明，该星云环境在1975年的爆发后继续稳定放松。然而，数据表明热组分的温度从1989年的200,000K增加到目前大于250,000K。我们的新和存档观测表明，系统在爆发后经历的演化是迅速的，几年后几乎没有重大变化。 
<br /><br />总结: HM Sge是一个尘埃丰富的共生Mira系统，经过1975年的新星状爆发后，观测到了rovibrational水发射以及氧丰富的巨星支系尘埃和尘埃产量几乎没有变化。光学/紫外线范围内的[N II]星云特征显示一些运动，而紫外线光谱表明星云环境在1975年的爆发后继续稳定放松，但热组分的温度却有所增加。 <div>
We have targeted the dusty symbiotic Mira system HM Sge with four instruments from the IR to the UV. We have used these observations along with archival observations to study how the system has been evolving after its 1975 nova-like outburst. We have detected rovibrational water emission in a symbiotic system for the first time using new EXES high-spectral-resolution infrared spectroscopy. The features, detected in emission, have velocities consistent with the systemic velocity but do not show any clear evidence of high-velocity outflows. Mid-infrared photometry and grism spectroscopy show that the oxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch dust and dust output have shown little to no change over the past 39 years. In the optical/UV, we detect three main [N ii] nebular features that were detected 22 years ago. Two of these features show a small amount of movement, corresponding to average outflows speeds of 38 and 78 km s−1 since they were previously observed; some previously detected [N ii] features are no longer visible. New UV spectroscopy has shown that the nebular environment continues to steadily relax after the system’s 1975 outburst. The data suggest, however, that the temperature of the hot component has increased from 200,000 K in 1989 to greater than 250,000 K now. Our new and archival observations suggest that the evolution of the system after its outburst is swift with little to no major changes after a period of a couple of years.

HST-dark galaxies是指在深度光学-近红外成像中不可见，但在较长波长下被探测到的星系，最近的观测研究表明它们可能构成了一个数量可观的缺失星系群体，并且在z≳4时可能主导宇宙的星系形成率密度。这篇文章进行了首次基于模拟的研究，利用Feedback in Realistic Environments项目中高分辨率星系的模拟，通过辐射传递进行了多波段成像。研究发现，HST-dark galaxies通常位于高红移（z=4-7），有较高的尘埃衰减水平（AV=2-4），并展现出紧凑的近期星系形成。此外，研究还指出了方向性的重要性，对于大部分模拟的星系快照来说，存在一定视线并不符合选择标准。这一结果对于那些不能解析星尘几何结构的观测和模型（例如半解析模型或粗略解析的流体动力学模拟）之间的比较具有重要意义。最重要的是，研究证明HST-dark sources并不是意外或奇特的星系群体，而是在某些视线下观察到的高红移、高度尘埃衰减的星系的子集。 <br /><br />总结: HST-dark galaxies是在光学-近红外成像中不可见但在较长波长下被探测到的星系群体，主要研究了这些星系的模拟和特征，并发现了它们的环境位置、尘埃衰减和星系形成特征，同时也指出了观测和模型比较中方向性的重要性。 <div>
Galaxies that are invisible in deep optical–near-infrared imaging but detected at longer wavelengths have been the focus of several recent observational studies, with speculation that they could constitute a substantial missing population and even dominate the cosmic star formation rate density at z ≳ 4. The depths now achievable with JWST at the longest wavelengths probed by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), coupled with the transformative resolution at longer wavelengths, are already enabling detailed, spatially resolved characterization of sources that were invisible to HST, often known as “HST-dark” galaxies. However, until now, there has been little theoretical work to compare against. We present the first simulation-based study of this population, using highly resolved galaxies from the Feedback in Realistic Environments project, with multiwavelength images along several lines of sight forward-modeled using radiative transfer. We naturally recover a population of modeled sources that meet commonly used selection criteria (HAB &gt; 27 mag and HAB − F444W &gt; 2.3). These simulated HST-dark galaxies lie at high redshifts (z = 4–7), have high levels of dust attenuation (AV = 2–4), and display compact recent star formation (R1/2,4.4 μm ≲ 1 kpc). Orientation is very important: for all but one of the 17 simulated galaxy snapshots with HST-dark sight lines, there exist other sight lines that do not meet the criteria. This result has important implications for comparisons between observations and models that do not resolve the detailed star-dust geometry, such as semianalytic models or coarsely resolved hydrodynamical simulations. Critically, we demonstrate that HST-dark sources are not an unexpected or exotic population, but a subset of high-redshift, highly dust-attenuated sources viewed along certain lines of sight.

本研究利用ROSAT 1RXS和2RXS数据集以及Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 17等伴随多波段调查数据，拓展了以往对空白区域X射线源候选XINSs的搜索，最终找到了两个已知的XINSs，同时识别出46个新的候选区域。文章描述了选择方法并提供了新候选XINSs样本的详细信息。还讨论了通过获得更精确的X射线源位置、优质X射线光谱或更深入的光学成像来验证或推翻这些X射线源是否为孤立中子星的未来可能。 <div>
The current sample of 12 radio-quiet isolated neutron stars that emit strongly in X-rays (XINSs) is both small and heterogeneous, limiting its usefulness for understanding the physics of neutron star atmospheres and cooling rates and for constraining the equation of state of neutron degenerate matter. Utilizing the ROSAT 1RXS and 2RXS data sets, in conjunction with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 17 and other companion multiwavelength surveys, we have extended previous searches for blank-field X-ray source candidate XINSs, ultimately recovering two known XINSs while identifying 46 new, unstudied candidate fields devoid of likely multiwavelength counterparts. In this publication, we describe our selection approach and provide detailed information regarding our sample of new candidate XINSs. Future opportunities to verify or to refute these X-ray sources as isolated neutron stars by obtaining more accurate X-ray source positions, quality X-ray spectra, or deeper optical imaging are also discussed.

Compositional convection is atmospheric mixing driven by density variations caused by compositional gradients. Previous studies have suggested that compositional gradients of atmospheric trace species within planetary atmospheres can impact convection and the final atmospheric temperature profile. In this work, we employ 3D convection-resolving simulations using Cloud Model 1 (CM1) to gain a fundamental understanding of how compositional variation influences convection and the final atmospheric state of exoplanet atmospheres. We perform 3D initial value problem simulations of noncondensing compositional convection for Earth-air, H2, and CO2 atmospheres. Conventionally, atmospheric convection is assumed to mix the atmosphere to a final, marginally stable state defined by a unique temperature profile. However, when there is compositional variation within an atmosphere, a continuous family of stable end states is possible, differing in the final state composition profile. Our CM1 simulations are used to determine which of the family of possible compositional end states is selected. Leveraging the results from our CM1 simulations, we develop a dry convective adjustment scheme for use in general circulation models (GCMs). This scheme relies on an energy analysis to determine the final adjusted atmospheric state. Our convection scheme produces results that agree with our CM1 simulations and can easily be implemented in GCMs to improve modeling of compositional convection in exoplanet atmospheres.

Low-frequency gravitational-wave experiments such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna and pulsar timing arrays are expected to detect individual massive black hole (MBH) binaries and mergers. However, secure methods of identifying the exact host galaxy of each MBH merger among the large number of galaxies in the gravitational-wave localization region are currently lacking. We investigate the distinct morphological signatures of MBH merger host galaxies, using the Romulus25 cosmological simulation. We produce mock telescope images of 201 simulated galaxies in Romulus25 hosting recent MBH mergers through stellar population synthesis and dust radiative transfer. Based on comparisons to mass- and redshift-matched control samples, we show that combining multiple morphological statistics via a linear discriminant analysis enables identification of the host galaxies of MBH mergers, with accuracies that increase with chirp mass and mass ratio. For mergers with high chirp masses (≳108.2M⊙) and high mass ratios (≳0.5), the accuracy of this approach reaches ≳80%, and does not decline for at least ∼1 Gyr after numerical merger. We argue that these trends arise because the most distinctive morphological characteristics of MBH merger and binary host galaxies are prominent classical bulges, rather than relatively short-lived morphological disturbances from their preceding galaxy mergers. Since these bulges are formed though major mergers of massive galaxies, they lead to (and become permanent signposts for) MBH binaries and mergers that have high chirp masses and mass ratios. Our results suggest that galaxy morphology can aid in identifying the host galaxies of future MBH binaries and mergers.

We present a semi-analytic model for the growth, drift, desorption, and fragmentation of millimeter- to meter-sized particles in protoplanetary disks. Fragmentation occurs where particle collision velocities exceed critical fragmentation velocities. Using this criterion, we produce fragmentation regions in disk orbital radius–particle size phase space for particles with a range of material properties, structures, and compositions (including SiO2, Mg2SiO4, H2O, CO2, and CO). For reasonable disk conditions, compact aggregate H2O, CO2, and CO ice particles do not reach destructive relative velocities and are thus not likely to undergo collisional fragmentation. Uncoated silicate particles are more susceptible to collisional destruction and are expected to fragment in the inner disk, consistent with previous work. We then calculate the growth, drift, and sublimation of small particles, initially located in the outer disk. We find that ice-coated particles can avoid fragmentation as they grow and drift inward under a substantial range of disk conditions, as long as the particles are aggregates composed of 0.1 μm-sized monomers. Such particles may undergo runaway growth in disk regions abundant in H2O or CO2 ice, depending on the assumed disk temperature structure. These results indicate that icy collisional growth to planetesimally relevant sizes may happen efficiently throughout a disk’s lifetime, and is particularly robust at early times when the disk’s dust-to-gas ratio is comparable to that of the interstellar medium.

<div> 关键词: Type Ia supernova remnants, Tycho’s SNR, Chandra data, hydrodynamic simulations, mass-loss rate
总结:
超新星遗迹Tycho的SNR被认为是一个典型的对象，具有光谱、形态和环境特性的重要性。最近的Chandra数据重新分析显示，其前向激波自2007年以来经历了显著的减速，这表明最近的激波与密集介质的相互作用，导致分子云内部的空腔环境。本研究利用最新的多时期 proper motion 测量，进行了水动力学模拟，以表征Tycho的空腔壁环境。模拟中探索了环境的一系列参数，以与每个方位区域的观测数据相匹配。结果显示，ρ(r)∝r−2的风洞模型与最新数据相符，而常数密度的均匀介质模型则不佳。此外，最佳拟合模型支持具有方位角变化的各向异性风，整体结果表明质量损失速率异常高，不符合传统的单重变星爆炸方案。 <div>
Among Type Ia supernova remnants (SNRs), Tycho’s SNR has been considered as a typical object from the viewpoints of its spectroscopic, morphological, and environmental properties. A recent reanalysis of Chandra data showed that its forward shock is experiencing a substantial deceleration since around 2007, which suggests recent shock interactions with a dense medium as a consequence of a cavity-wall environment inside a molecular cloud. Such a nonuniform environment can be linked back to the nature and activities of its progenitor. In this study, we perform hydrodynamic simulations to characterize Tycho’s cavity-wall environment using the latest multiepoch proper motion measurements of the forward shock. A range of parameters for the environment is explored in the hydrodynamic models to fit with the observational data for each azimuthal region. Our results show that a wind-like cavity with ρ(r) ∝ r−2 reconciles with the latest data better than a uniform medium with a constant density. In addition, our best-fit model favors an anisotropic wind with an azimuthally varying wind parameter. The overall result indicates a mass-loss rate which is unusually high for the conventional single-degenerate explosion scenario.

We performed synthetic observations of the Ulrich, Cassen, and Moosman (UCM) model to understand the relation between the physical structures of the infalling envelope around a protostar and their observational features in molecular lines, adopting L1527 as an example. We also compared the physical structure and synthetic position–velocity (P–V) diagrams of the UCM model and a simple ballistic (SB) model. There are multiple ways to compare synthetic data with observational data. We first calculated the correlation coefficient. The UCM model and the SB model show similarly good correlation with the observational data. While the correlation reflects the overall similarity between the cube datasets, we can alternatively compare specific local features, such as the centrifugal barrier in the SB model or the centrifugal radius in the UCM model. We evaluated systematic uncertainties in these methods. In the case of L1527, the stellar mass values estimated using these methods are all lower than the value derived from previous Keplerian analysis of the disk. This may indicate that the gas infall motion in the envelope is retarded by, e.g., magnetic fields. We also showed analytically that, in the UCM model, the spin-up feature of the P–V diagram is due to the infall velocity rather than the rotation. The line-of-sight velocity V is thus ∝x−0.5, where x is the offset. If the infall is retarded, rotational velocity should dominate so that V is proportional to x−1, as is often observed in the protostellar envelope.

总结: 
本文研究了利用机器学习进行大气检索的新方法，通过使用基于正规流的神经网络以及新开发的可微分前向模型Diff-τ来进行贝叶斯推断。研究表明，该框架不需要大量预先计算的训练集，能够在仅有一次观测的情况下进行训练。与基于抽样的检索相比，它能够产生与之相当的高保真后验分布，并且在收敛到相同结果时需要的前向模型调用次数少至75%。此外，该方法还允许进行正式的贝叶斯模型选择。研究者还讨论了Diff-τ在计算效率上的优势，并提供了在可微分语言中开发辐射传输模型的经验。这一框架为利用神经网络进行大气检索的最新发展做出了重要贡献，它的灵活性以及在大规模和复杂数据集中减少前向模型调用次数的潜力，使其成为检索工具箱的重要补充。 <br /><br /> <div>
Current endeavours in exoplanet characterization rely on atmospheric retrieval to quantify crucial physical properties of remote exoplanets from observations. However, the scalability and efficiency of said technique are under strain with increasing spectroscopic resolution and forward model complexity. The situation has become more acute with the recent launch of the James Webb Space Telescope and other upcoming missions. Recent advances in machine learning provide optimization-based variational inference as an alternative approach to perform approximate Bayesian posterior inference. In this investigation we developed a normalizing-flow-based neural network, combined with our newly developed differentiable forward model, Diff-τ, to perform Bayesian inference in the context of atmospheric retrievals. Using examples from real and simulated spectroscopic data, we demonstrate the advantages of our proposed framework: (1) training our neural network does not require a large precomputed training set and can be trained with only a single observation; (2) it produces high-fidelity posterior distributions in excellent agreement with sampling-based retrievals; (3) it requires up to 75% fewer forward model calls to converge to the same result; and (4) this approach allows formal Bayesian model selection. We discuss the computational efficiencies of Diff-τ in relation to TauREx3's nominal forward model and provide a “lessons learned” account of developing radiative transfer models in differentiable languages. Our proposed framework contributes toward the latest development of neural network–powered atmospheric retrieval. Its flexibility and significant reduction in forward model calls required for convergence holds the potential to be an important addition to the retrieval tool box for large and complex data sets along with sampling-based approaches.

<div> Spherical RHT algorithm, H i-based polarization templates, filament morphology, magnetic field structure, B-mode correlation <br />
<br />总结:
作者们使用了一种新的 Rolling Hough Transform (RHT) 算法来实现对球面上的纤维结构进行高效的量化。研究发现，对于模拟磁场结构最具信息量的 H i 结构是最细的解析纤维。他们还发现，一些星际形态可以产生奇异性违反的信号，即非零的 TB 和 EB。最后，他们证明了来自星际尘埃纤维的B模式主要受到纤维之间拓扑结构和相对极化强度的影响，而E模式主要受到单个纤维的形状的影响。 <div>
Filamentary structures in neutral hydrogen (H i) emission are well aligned with the interstellar magnetic field, so H i emission morphology can be used to construct templates that strongly correlate with measurements of polarized thermal dust emission. We explore how the quantification of filament morphology affects this correlation. We introduce a new implementation of the Rolling Hough Transform (RHT) using spherical harmonic convolutions, which enables efficient quantification of filamentary structure on the sphere. We use this Spherical RHT algorithm along with a Hessian-based method to construct H i-based polarization templates. We discuss improvements to each algorithm relative to similar implementations in the literature and compare their outputs. By exploring the parameter space of filament morphologies with the Spherical RHT, we find that the most informative H i structures for modeling the magnetic field structure are the thinnest resolved filaments. For this reason, we find a ∼10% enhancement in the B-mode correlation with polarized dust emission with higher-resolution H i observations. We demonstrate that certain interstellar morphologies can produce parity-violating signatures, i.e., nonzero TB and EB, even under the assumption that filaments are locally aligned with the magnetic field. Finally, we demonstrate that B modes from interstellar dust filaments are mostly affected by the topology of the filaments with respect to one another and their relative polarized intensities, whereas E modes are mostly sensitive to the shapes of individual filaments.

总结: 
该论文利用Atacama大型毫米/亚毫米阵列对M型恒星CIDA 9A周围的大型不对称粉尘环进行了双波长观测。通过对观测得到的可见度进行参数化建模分析，发现了1.3毫米和3.1毫米数据中的粉尘不对称性。在两个波长的观测中报告了粉尘发射峰值的轴向偏移，这与由涡旋引起的粉尘陷阱一致，可能是由内嵌原行星或其他流体动力不稳定性（如死区）形成的。需要进行深入的高空间分辨率的粉尘和分子气体观测，以限制形成CIDA 9A周围原行星盘中观测到的毫米级空洞和粉尘不对称性的机制。 <div>
While the most exciting explanation of the observed dust asymmetries in protoplanetary disks is the presence of protoplanets, other mechanisms can also form the dust features. This paper presents dual-wavelength Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of a large asymmetric dusty ring around the M-type star CIDA 9A. We detect a dust asymmetry in both 1.3 and 3.1 mm data. To characterize the asymmetric structure, a parametric model is used to fit the observed visibilities. We report a tentative azimuthal shift of the dust emission peaks between the observations at the two wavelengths. This shift is consistent with a dust trap caused by a vortex, which may be formed by an embedded protoplanet or other hydrodynamical instabilities, such as a dead zone. Deep high-spatial-resolution observations of dust and molecular gas are needed to constrain the mechanisms that formed the observed millimeter cavity and dust asymmetry in the protoplanetary disk around CIDA 9A.

<title>LATIS: Constraints on the Galaxy–Halo Connection at z ∼ 2.5 from Galaxy–Galaxy and Galaxy–Lyα Clustering</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The connection between galaxies and dark matter halos is often quantified using the stellar mass–halo mass (SMHM) relation. Optical and near-infrared imaging surveys have led to a broadly consistent picture of the evolving SMHM relation based on measurements of galaxy abundances and angular correlation functions. Spectroscopic surveys at z ≳ 2 can also constrain the SMHM relation via the galaxy autocorrelation function and through the cross-correlation between galaxies and Lyα absorption measured in transverse sight lines; however, such studies are very few and have produced some unexpected or inconclusive results. We use ∼3000 spectra of z ∼ 2.5 galaxies from the Lyα Tomography IMACS Survey (LATIS) to measure the galaxy–galaxy and galaxy–Lyα correlation functions in four bins of stellar mass spanning 109.2 ≲ M*/M⊙ ≲ 1010.5. Parallel analyses of the MultiDark N-body and ASTRID hydrodynamic cosmological simulations allow us to model the correlation functions, estimate covariance matrices, and infer halo masses. We find that results of the two methods are mutually consistent and broadly accord with standard SMHM relations. This consistency demonstrates that we are able to measure and model Lyα transmission fluctuations δF in LATIS accurately. We also show that the galaxy–Lyα cross-correlation, a free by-product of optical spectroscopic galaxy surveys at these redshifts, can constrain halo masses with similar precision to galaxy–galaxy clustering.

<title>Chandra X-Ray Observatory Observations of 13 Fermi LAT Sources</title>

In the latest data release from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (the 4th Fermi LAT 14 yr Catalog, or 4FGL), more than 50% of the Galactic sources are yet to be identified. We observed 13 unidentified Fermi LAT sources with the Chandra X-Ray Observatory to explore their nature. We report the results of the classification of X-ray sources in the fields of these γ-ray sources and discuss the implications for their nature. We use multiwavelength (MW) data for a machine-learning classification, accompanied by a more detailed spectral/variability analysis for brighter sources. Eight 4FGL sources have γ-ray pulsars within their position error ellipses. We consider three of these pulsars (PSR J1906+0722, PSR J1105–6037, and PSR J1358–6025) to be detected in X-rays, while PSR J1203–6242 shows a hint of X-ray emission. Within the positional uncertainties of three of the 4FGL sources, we detect X-ray sources that may be yet unknown pulsars, depending on the MW association. In addition to point sources, we discovered two extended sources, one of which is likely to be a bow-shock pulsar-wind nebula associated with PSR J1358–6025. Finally, we classify other X-ray sources detected in these observations and report the most interesting classifications.

<title>The Scaling of Vortical Electron Acceleration in Thin-current Magnetic Reconnection and Its Implications in Solar Flares</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
To investigate how magnetic reconnection (MR) accelerates electrons to a power-law energy spectrum in solar flares, we explore the scaling of a kinetic model proposed by Che &amp; Zank (CZ) and compare it to observations. Focusing on thin current sheet MR particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, we analyze the impact of domain size on the evolution of the electron Kelvin–Helmholtz instability (EKHI). We find that the duration of the growth stage of the EKHI ({t}_{G}\sim {{\rm{\Omega }}}_{e}^{-1}) is short and remains nearly unchanged because the electron gyrofrequency Ωe is independent of domain size. The quasi-steady stage of the EKHI (tMR) dominates the electron acceleration process and scales linearly with the size of the simulations as L/vA0, where vA0 is the Alfvén speed. We use the analytical results obtained by CZ to calculate the continuous temporal evolution of the electron energy spectra from PIC simulations and linearly scale them to solar flare observational scales. For the first time, an electron acceleration model predicts the sharp two-stage transition observed in typical soft–hard–harder electron energy spectra, implying that the electron acceleration model must be efficient with an acceleration timescale that is a small fraction of the duration of solar flares. Our results suggest that we can use PIC MR simulations to investigate the observational electron energy spectral evolution of solar flares if the ratio tMR/tG is sufficiently small, i.e., ≲10%.

<title>Evidence of Third Dredge-up in Post-AGB Stars in Galactic Globular Clusters</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
To better understand the mixing and mass loss experienced by low-mass stars as they ascend the asymptotic giant branch (AGB), I have gathered from the literature the abundances of CNO and s-process elements in post-AGB stars in Galactic globular clusters. These species are mixed to the surface during third dredge-up (3DU) events, so their abundance should increase as the star ascends the AGB. Of the 17 stars in this sample, CNO abundances are available for 11. Of these, four are enhanced in CNO relative to the red giant branch stars from which they descended, which I take as evidence of 3DU on the AGB. The enhancement is mainly in the form of carbon. Of the six stars for which only heavy-element abundances are available, one shows s-process enhancements that previous authors have interpreted as evidence of 3DU. Combining these 17 stars with other recent samples reveals that most globular-cluster post-AGB stars have luminosities \mathrm{log}(L/{L}_{\odot })\sim 3.25. They are the progeny of blue horizontal-branch (HB) stars in clusters with intermediate metallicity ([Fe/H] ∼ −1.5). A second group consists of sub-luminous stars associated with high-metallicity clusters ([Fe/H] ∼ −1.0) with red HBs. They may be burning helium, rather than hydrogen. A third group of hot, super-luminous stars is evolving quickly across the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram. Some of them may be merger remnants.

<title>Multiwavelength Campaign Observations of a Young Solar-type Star, EK Draconis. I. Discovery of Prominence Eruptions Associated with Superflares</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Young solar-type stars frequently produce superflares, serving as a unique window into the young Sun-Earth environments. Large solar flares are closely linked to coronal mass ejections (CMEs) associated with filament/prominence eruptions, but observational evidence for stellar superflares remains scarce. Here, we present a 12-day, multiwavelength campaign observation of young solar-type star EK Draconis (G1.5V, 50–120 Myr age) utilizing the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, the Neutron star Interior Composition ExploreR, and the Seimei telescope. The star has previously exhibited blueshifted Hα absorptions as evidence for a filament eruption associated with a superflare. Our simultaneous optical and X-ray observations identified three superflares of 1.5 × 1033–1.2 × 1034 erg. We report the first discovery of two prominence eruptions on a solar-type star, observed as blueshifted Hα emissions at speeds of 690 and 430 km s−1 and masses of 1.1 × 1019 and 3.2 × 1017 g, respectively. The faster, massive event shows a candidate of post-flare X-ray dimming with the amplitude of up to ∼10%. Several observational aspects consistently point to the occurrence of a fast CME associated with this event. The comparative analysis of the estimated length scales of flare loops, prominences, possible dimming region, and starspots provides the overall picture of the eruptive phenomena. Furthermore, the energy partition of the observed superflares in the optical and X-ray bands is consistent with flares from the Sun, M-dwarfs, and close binaries, yielding the unified empirical relations. These discoveries provide profound implications of the impact of these eruptive events on early Venus, Earth, and Mars and young exoplanets.

<title>Potential Melting of Extrasolar Planets by Tidal Dissipation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Tidal heating on Io due to its finite eccentricity was predicted to drive surface volcanic activity, which was subsequently confirmed by the Voyager spacecraft. Although the volcanic activity in Io is more complex, in theory volcanism can be driven by runaway melting in which the tidal heating increases as the mantle thickness decreases. We show that this runaway melting mechanism is generic for a composite planetary body with liquid core and solid mantle, provided that (i) the mantle rigidity, μ, is comparable to the central pressure, i.e., μ/(ρgRP) ≳ 0.1 for a body with density ρ, surface gravitational acceleration g, and radius RP; (ii) the surface is not molten; (iii) tides deposit sufficient energy; and (iv) the planet has nonzero eccentricity. We calculate the approximate liquid core radius as a function of μ/(ρgRP), and find that more than 90% of the core will melt due to this runaway for μ/(ρgRP) ≳ 1. From all currently confirmed exoplanets, we find that the terrestrial planets in the L 98-59 system are the most promising candidates for sustaining active volcanism. However, uncertainties regarding the quality factors and the details of tidal heating and cooling mechanisms prohibit definitive claims of volcanism on any of these planets. We generate synthetic transmission spectra of these planets assuming Venus-like atmospheric compositions with an additional 5%, 50%, and 98% SO2 component, which is a tracer of volcanic activity. We find a ≳3σ preference for a model with SO2 with 5–10 transits with JWST for L 98-59bcd.

<title>A Numerical Study of the Effects of a Corotating Interaction Region on Cosmic-Ray Transport. II. Features of Cosmic-Ray Composition and Rigidity</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad0cb6</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad0cb6</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We continue the numerical modeling of a corotating interaction region (CIR) and the effects it has on solar-rotational recurrent variations of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs). A magnetohydrodynamic model is adapted to simulate the background solar wind plasma with a CIR structure in the inner heliosphere, which is incorporated into a comprehensive Parker-type transport model. The focus is on the simulation of the effects of a CIR on GCR protons and the two helium isotopes as a function of heliolongitude. This is to establish whether the difference in composition affects how they are modulated by the CIR in terms of their distribution in longitude. It is demonstrated that particle diffusion and drift influence the effects of the CIR with increasing rigidity from 100 MV up to 15 GV. It is found that protons and helium isotopes are modulated differently with longitude by the CIR and that particle drift influences the modulation effects in longitude. These differences dissipate with increasing rigidity. The final results are focused on the simulated amplitude of these GCR flux variations as a function of rigidity. The amplitude displays a power-law behavior above ∼1 GV with an index similar to the power index of the rigidity dependence of the assumed diffusion coefficients. The simulations further show that below this rigidity, the amplitude at first flattens off, displaying a plateau-like profile, but it then increases systematically with decreasing rigidity below ∼0.3 GV. Again, a power-law behavior is displayed, but it is completely different from that above 1 GV.

<title>How Many Supermassive Black Hole Binaries Are Detectable through Tracking Relative Motions by (Sub)millimeter Very Long Baseline Interferometry?</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad0da1</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad0da1</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The (sub)millimeter wavelengths (86–690 GHz) very long baseline interferometry will provide ∼5–40 μas angular resolution, ∼10 mJy baseline sensitivity, and ∼1 μas yr−1 proper-motion precision, which can directly detect supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) systems by imaging the two visible sources and tracking their relative motions. Such a way exhibits an advantage compared to indirect detect methods of observing periodic signals in motion and light curves, which are difficult to confirm from competing models. Moreover, tracking relative motion at (sub)millimeter wavelengths is more reliable, as there is a negligible offset between the emission region and the black hole center. In this way, it is unnecessary to correct the black hole location by a prior of jet morphology as it would be required at longer wavelengths. We extend the formalism developed in D’Orazio &amp; Loeb (2018) to link the observations with the orbital evolution of SMBHBs from the ≲10 kpc dynamical friction stages to the ≲0.01 pc gravitational radiation stages, and estimate the detectable numbers of SMBHBs. By assuming 5% of active galactic nuclei holding SMBHBs, we find that the number of detectable SMBHBs with redshift z ≤ 0.5 and mass M ≤ 1011M⊙ is about 20. Such a detection relies heavily on proper-motion precision and sensitivity. Furthermore, we propose that the simultaneous multifrequency technique plays a key role in meeting the observational requirements.

<title>JWST Confirms the Nature of CID-42</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The galaxy CID-42 (CXOC J100043.1+020637.2) at z = 0.359 has been proposed to contain a promising candidate for a gravitational-wave recoiling supermassive black hole (SMBH), a slingshot SMBH from a triple-SMBH interaction, or a kiloparsec-scale dual active galactic nucleus (AGN). These claims were primarily based on a pair of bright cores separated by ∼0.″5 resolved in optical Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging. Existing HST, Chandra, and ground-based imaging and spectroscopy are unable to confirm either scenario. With improved spatial resolution, depth, and IR wavelength coverage, NIRCam multiband imaging from the COSMOS-Web JWST treasury program well resolved the two cores in CID-42, revealing a significant stellar bulge for both cores (with stellar masses of ∼1010M⊙ for both). JWST imaging further revealed that only the SE core contains an unobscured AGN point source, based on both image decomposition and spectral energy distribution fitting. There is no evidence for AGN activity in the NW core based on the current data. These new observations unambiguously rule out the gravitational-wave-recoiling and slingshot-SMBH scenarios and establish CID-42 as a low-redshift merging pair of galaxies, with likely only one active AGN in the system. These results demonstrate the unparalleled capabilities of JWST (even with imaging alone) in studying the galactic-scale environment of merging galaxies and SMBHs.

<title>Volume Density Structure of the Central Molecular Zone NGC 253 through ALCHEMI Excitation Analysis</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a spatially resolved excitation analysis for the central molecular zone (CMZ) of the starburst galaxy NGC 253 using the data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Comprehensive High-resolution Extragalactic Molecular Inventory, whereby we explore parameters distinguishing NGC 253 from the quiescent Milky Way’s Galactic center (GC). Non-LTE analyses employing a hierarchical Bayesian framework are applied to Band 3–7 transitions from nine molecular species to delineate the position–position–velocity distributions of column density ({N}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}), volume density ({n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}), and temperature (Tkin) at 27 pc resolution. Two distinct components are detected: a low-density component with ({n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}},{T}_{\mathrm{kin}})\sim ({10}^{3.3}\ {\mathrm{cm}}^{-3},85\ {\rm{K}}) and a high-density component with ({n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}},{T}_{\mathrm{kin}})\,\sim ({10}^{4.4}\ {\mathrm{cm}}^{-3},110\ {\rm{K}}), separated at {n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}\sim {10}^{3.8}\ {\mathrm{cm}}^{-3}. NGC 253 has ∼10 times the high-density gas mass and ∼3 times the dense-gas mass fraction of the GC. These properties are consistent with their HCN/CO ratio but cannot alone explain the factor of ∼30 difference in their star formation efficiencies (SFEs), contradicting the dense-gas mass to star formation rate scaling law. The {n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}} histogram toward NGC 253 exhibits a shallow declining slope up to {n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}\sim {10}^{6}\ {\mathrm{cm}}^{-3}, while that of the GC steeply drops in {n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}\gtrsim {10}^{4.5}\ {\mathrm{cm}}^{-3} and vanishes at 105 cm−3. Their dense-gas mass fraction ratio becomes consistent with their SFEs when the threshold {n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}} for the dense gas is taken at ∼104.2−4.6 cm−3. The rich abundance of gas above this density range in the NGC 253 CMZ, or its scarcity in the GC, is likely to be the critical difference characterizing the contrasting star formation in the centers of the two galaxies.

<title>Constraints on Coasting Cosmological Models from Gravitational-wave Standard Sirens</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the first test of coasting cosmological models with gravitational-wave (GW) standard sirens observed in the first three observing runs of the LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA detector network. We apply the statistical galaxy catalog method adapted to coasting cosmologies and infer constraints on the H0 Hubble constant for the three fixed values of the curvature parameter k=\left\{-1,0,+1\right\} in {H}_{0}^{2}{c}^{-2} units. The maximum posteriors and 68.3% highest density intervals we obtained from a combined analysis of 46 dark siren detections and a single bright siren detection are {H}_{0}=\left\{{68.1}_{-5.6}^{+8.5},{67.5}_{-5.2}^{+8.3},{67.1}_{-5.8}^{+6.6}\right\}\,\mathrm{km}\ {{\rm{s}}}^{-1}\ {\mathrm{Mpc}}^{-1}, respectively. All our constraints on H0 are consistent within 1σ with the H0 measured with the differential age method, which provides a constraint on H0 in coasting cosmologies independently from k. Our results constrain all cosmological models with a(t) ∝ t linear expansion in the luminosity distance and redshift range of the 47 LIGO–Virgo detections, i.e., dL ≲ 5Gpc and z ≲ 0.8, which practically include all (both strictly linear and quasi-linear) models in the coasting model family. As we have found, the coasting models and the Lambda cold dark matter (or ΛCDM) model fit equally well to the applied set of GW detections.

<title>The JWST Resolved Stellar Populations Early Release Science Program. IV. The Star Formation History of the Local Group Galaxy WLM</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the first star formation history (SFH) and age–metallicity relation (AMR) derived from resolved stellar populations imaged with the JWST NIRCam instrument. The target is the Local Group star-forming galaxy WLM at 970 kpc. The depth of the color–magnitude diagram (CMD) reaches below the oldest main sequence turnoff with a signal-to-noise ratio = 10 at MF090W = + 4.6 mag. This is the deepest CMD for any galaxy that is not a satellite of the Milky Way. We use Hubble Space Telescope (HST) optical imaging that overlaps with the NIRCam observations to directly evaluate the SFHs derived based on data from the two great observatories. The JWST and HST-based SFHs are in excellent agreement. We use the metallicity distribution function measured from stellar spectra to confirm the trends in the AMRs based on the JWST data. Together, these results confirm the efficacy of recovering an SFH and AMR with the NIRCam F090W−F150W filter combination, and validate the sensitivity and accuracy of stellar evolution libraries in the near-infrared relative to the optical for SFH recovery work. From the JWST data, WLM shows an early onset to star formation, followed by an extended pause post-reionization before star formation reignites, which is qualitatively similar to what has been observed in the isolated galaxies Leo A and Aquarius. Quantitatively, 15% of the stellar mass formed in the first Gyr, while only 10% formed over the next ∼5 Gyr. The stellar mass then rapidly doubled in ∼2.5 Gyr, followed by constant star formation over the last ∼5 Gyr.

<title>Efficiency of Turbulent Reacceleration by Solenoidal Turbulence and Its Application to the Origin of Radio Megahalos in Cluster Outskirts</title>

Recent radio observations with the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) discovered diffuse emission extending beyond the scale of classical radio halos. The presence of such megahalos indicates that the amplification of the magnetic field and acceleration of relativistic particles are working in the cluster outskirts, presumably due to the combination of shocks and turbulence that dissipate energy in these regions. Cosmological magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of galaxy clusters suggest that solenoidal turbulence has a significant energy budget in the outskirts of galaxy clusters. In this paper, we explore the possibility that this turbulence contributes to the emission observed in megahalos through second-order Fermi acceleration of relativistic particles and magnetic field amplification by the dynamo. We focus on the case of A2255 and find that this scenario can explain the basic properties of the diffuse emission component that is observed under assumptions that are used in previous literature. More specifically, we conduct a numerical follow-up, solving the Fokker–Planck equation by using a snapshot of an MHD simulation and deducing the synchrotron brightness integrated along the lines of sight. We find that a volume-filling emission, ranging between 30% and almost 100% of the projected area, depending on our assumptions on the particle diffusion and transport, can be detected at LOFAR sensitivities. Assuming a magnetic field B ∼ 0.2  μG, as derived from a dynamo model applied to the emitting region, we find that the observed brightness can be matched when ∼1% of the solenoidal turbulent energy flux is channeled into particle acceleration.

总结:<br /><br />这项研究首次对银河螺旋臂中的磁场结构进行了层析成像，利用光学恒星偏振测量探测了射手座螺旋臂，结合Gaia任务提供的恒星距离数据，成功分离并分析了沿视线方向上五个不同云团的磁场贡献。观测到的云团包括一个前景云（d < 200 pc）和四个射手座臂上的云团。这些云团的柱密度范围从0.5到2.8×1021 cm−2不等，与每个云团相关的磁场显示出在小于10 pc的区域内平滑的空间分布，并显示出不同的取向。测量的位置角从银河北向东测量，依次是135°、46°、58°、150°和40°，这些位置角与银河平面平行方向有明显偏差。 <div>
The Galactic global magnetic field is thought to play a vital role in shaping Galactic structures such as spiral arms and giant molecular clouds. However, our knowledge of magnetic field structures in the Galactic plane at different distances is limited, as measurements used to map the magnetic field are the integrated effect along the line of sight. In this study, we present the first ever tomographic imaging of magnetic field structures in a Galactic spiral arm. Using optical stellar polarimetry over a 17^{\prime} \times 10^{\prime} field of view, we probe the Sagittarius spiral arm. Combining these data with stellar distances from the Gaia mission, we can isolate the contributions of five individual clouds along the line of sight by analyzing the polarimetry data as a function of distance. The observed clouds include a foreground cloud (d &lt; 200 pc) and four clouds in the Sagittarius arm at 1.23, 1.47, 1.63, and 2.23 kpc. The column densities of these clouds range from 0.5 to 2.8 × 1021 cm−2. The magnetic fields associated with each cloud show smooth spatial distributions within their observed regions on scales smaller than 10 pc and display distinct orientations. The position angles projected on the plane of the sky, measured from the Galactic north to the east, for the clouds in increasing order of distance are 135°, 46°, 58°, 150°, and 40°, with uncertainties of a few degrees. Notably, these position angles deviate significantly from the direction parallel to the Galactic plane.

<div> gravitationally lensed DSFGs, high-resolution, star formation, extreme starbursts, PASSAGES collaboration<br />总结:
PASSAGES合作团队最近定义了30个通过引力透镜效应被观测到的尘埃星系形成星系(DSFGs)。这些罕见的亚毫米波选取的对象使得我们能够以高分辨率观测宇宙中午时最极端的星系中的星形成地点。利用lenstool分析了这些DSFGs中的15个物体，其跨越了z = 1.1–3.3的范围，使用了0.″6分辨率1.1mm阿塔卡马大毫米/亚毫米阵列(Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array)和0.″4 5cm望远镜(Jansky Very Large Array)连续成像的补充信息，以及与1.6μm哈勃和用Gemini-S进行的光学成像。物体放大倍数范围从μ = 2到28(平均μ = 7)，对应的红外光度范围为LIR = 0.2–5.9 × 10^13L⊙ (平均1.4 × 10^13L⊙)以及推断的星形成速率为170–6300 M⊙ yr−1 (平均1500 M⊙ yr−1)。这些结果表明PASSAGES物体包含了一些已知最极端的星爆，甚至与未经透镜的物体的亮度相媲美，还受到引力透镜效应的放大。远红外连续区域的固有大小较大(Re = 1.7–4.3 kpc; 平均3.0 kpc)，但与z > 1 DSFGs的LIR–Re比例关系一致，这表明了普遍的星形成空间分布。而研究也发现这些物体可能不是最大化的星爆，至少在全局的、整合的星系尺度上，它们的辐射压力限制安全地低于艾丁顿限制。 <div>
The PASSAGES (Planck All-Sky Survey to Analyze Gravitationally-lensed Extreme Starbursts) collaboration has recently defined a sample of 30 gravitationally lensed dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). These rare, submillimeter-selected objects enable high-resolution views of the most extreme sites of star formation in galaxies at cosmic noon. Here, we present the first major compilation of strong lensing analyses using lenstool for PASSAGES, including 15 objects spanning z = 1.1–3.3, using complementary information from 0.″6-resolution 1.1 mm Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and 0.″4 5 cm Jansky Very Large Array continuum imaging, in tandem with 1.6 μm Hubble and optical imaging with Gemini-S. Magnifications range from μ = 2 to 28 (median μ = 7), yielding intrinsic infrared luminosities of LIR = 0.2–5.9 × 1013L⊙ (median 1.4 × 1013L⊙) and inferred star formation rates of 170–6300 M⊙ yr−1 (median 1500 M⊙ yr−1). These results suggest that the PASSAGES objects comprise some of the most extreme known starbursts, rivaling the luminosities of even the brightest unlensed objects, further amplified by lensing. The intrinsic sizes of far-infrared continuum regions are large (Re = 1.7–4.3 kpc; median 3.0 kpc) but consistent with LIR–Re scaling relations for z &gt; 1 DSFGs, suggesting a widespread spatial distribution of star formation. With modestly high angular resolution, we explore if these objects might be maximal starbursts. Instead of approaching Eddington-limited surface densities, above which radiation pressure will disrupt further star formation, they are safely sub-Eddington—at least on global, galaxy-integrated scales.

<div> 磁通量绳索，帕克太阳探测器，磁场模型，等离子体β值，再连接<br />
总结:<br />
本研究报告了帕克太阳探测器（PSP）在三次接触时在窄的Carrington经度范围内观察到的小尺度磁通量绳索（SMFRs）的情况。研究发现在1.°4经度范围内连续观察到了一系列的SMFRs，这些SMFRs在径向距离上持续了约8.4个太阳半径单位（R☉）。这些SMFRs明显区别于周围环境，其等离子体β值显著降低，磁场和等离子体流动波动显著减少。此外，在Encounters 1和5中也发现了类似的SMFRs。研究推测这些SMFRs可能是在太阳附近的极窄角区域内通过连续再连接而重复生成的。 <div>
In this study, we report on small-scale magnetic flux ropes (SMFRs) observed as a compact series in a narrow Carrington longitudinal range during three Parker Solar Probe (PSP) encounters. First, during ∼1.5 days of PSP's inbound part of Encounter 4, we identified a series of 11 SMFRs within 1.°4 in longitude over the radial distance of ∼8.4 R☉ (from ∼44 to 35 R☉). The identified SMFRs lasted from ∼0.5 to 1.8 hr, and adjacent events were separated mostly by a few hours and up to ∼6.5 hr at the longest, but some events were very closely spaced with intervals of a few ∼tens of minutes or less apart. Most of the identified SMFRs are successfully fitted to the force-free model. The SMFRs are clearly distinguished from the surroundings by a notable reduction in plasma β, which itself was comparably low (less than unity) in the background plasma. Furthermore, the magnetic field and plasma flow within the SMFRs fluctuated significantly less than the more turbulent surroundings. The fluctuations in the surrounding medium exhibited occasional Br polarity reversal (possibly switchbacks) and were Alfvénic to a large extent with far weaker compressional components. The majority of these key features with some differences have also been found in the series of SMFRs and their surroundings identified within 1.°3 or less in longitude during Encounters 1 and 5. We speculate that these SMFRs were repetitively generated by successive reconnection within a very narrow angular zone located close to the Sun but not necessarily at the same radial position.

这篇文章使用500和700 au分辨率的观测数据，对Sagittarius B2（Sgr B2）北部（N）和主要（M）的原恒星核进行了观测。他们发现这些原恒星核中有约三分之一会分裂成平均两个物体。观测显示大多数源都部分受到光学厚的影响，它们与0/I级原恒星对象最一致，比太阳附近观测到的物体更温暖。此外，根据源计数推算了星体质量和星体形成速率。Sgr B2 N的星体质量为2800 M⊙，星体形成速率为0.0038 M⊙ yr−1；Sgr B2 M的星体质量为6900 M⊙，星体形成速率为0.0093 M⊙ yr−1。
<br /><br />总结: Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array的高分辨率观测显示Sgr B2北部和主要的原恒星核会发生分裂，大多数源都部分受到光学厚的影响，符合0/I级原恒星对象的特征，而且更温暖。根据源计数推算了星体质量和星体形成速率，Sgr B2的星体质量为2800 M⊙，Sgr B2 M的星体质量为6900 M⊙。 <div>
We present 500 and 700 au resolution 1 and 3 mm Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations, respectively, of protostellar cores in protoclusters Sagittarius B2 (Sgr B2) North (N) and Main (M), parts of the most actively star-forming cloud in our Galaxy. Previous lower-resolution (5000 au) 3 mm observations of this region detected ∼150 sources inferred to be young stellar objects (YSOs) with M &gt; 8 M⊙. With a 10-fold increase in resolution, we detect 371 sources at 3 mm and 218 sources in the smaller field of view at 1 mm. The sources seen at low resolution are observed to fragment into an average of two objects. About one-third of the observed sources fragment. Most of the sources we report are marginally resolved and are at least partially optically thick. We determine that the observed sources are most consistent with Stage 0/I YSOs, i.e., rotationally supported disks with an active protostar and an envelope, that are warmer than those observed in the solar neighborhood. We report source-counting-based inferred stellar mass and the star formation rate of the cloud: 2800 M⊙ and 0.0038 M⊙ yr−1 for Sgr B2 N and 6900 M⊙ and 0.0093 M⊙ yr−1 for Sgr B2 M, respectively.

Primordial black holes (PBHs) are known as one of the potential candidates for dark matter. They are expected to have formed due to the direct gravitational collapse of density fluctuations in the early Universe. In this regard, examining the merger rate of PBHs within modified theories of gravity can offer a deeper insight into their abundance. In this work, we delve into the calculation of the merger rate of PBHs within the theoretical framework of f(R) gravity. Our analysis reveals an enhancement in the merger rate of PBHs compared to that obtained from general relativity. Additionally, modulating the field strength fR0 induces shifts in the PBH merger rate, presenting a potential observational signature of modified gravity. We also explore the upper bounds on the abundance of PBHs obtained from f(R) gravity models by comparing the results with gravitational-wave and observational data. The results indicate that in certain regions not excluded by benchmarking data, the parameter space for these upper bounds may be considered reliable.

总结:
本文研究了在多个尺度上对星系磁场动力学的建模，发现单独建模小尺度磁流体动力学（SSD）或大尺度磁流体动力学（LSD）都无法完全描述银河磁场的动态和拓扑结构。研究表明，SSD对LSD的存在并不敏感，并且在大尺度剪切流存在时更强。此外，我们还发现，通过在OB联合中集中超新星爆发可以增加SSD和LSD的生长速率。最后，我们的研究表明，对于LSD的建模在银河系中的温暖气体中心平面生长，并且通过增加分辨率，我们逐渐接近物理解。 <br /><br /> <div>
Magnetic fields are now widely recognized as critical at many scales to galactic dynamics and structure, including multiphase pressure balance, dust processing, and star formation. Using imposed magnetic fields cannot reliably model the interstellar medium's (ISM) dynamical structure nor phase interactions. Dynamos must be modeled. ISM models exist of turbulent magnetic fields using small-scale dynamo (SSD). Others model the large-scale dynamo (LSD) organizing magnetic fields at the scale of the disk or spiral arms. Separately, neither can fully describe the galactic magnetic field dynamics nor topology. We model the LSD and SSD together at a sufficient resolution to use the low explicit Lagrangian resistivity required. The galactic SSD saturates within 20 Myr. We show that the SSD is quite insensitive to the presence of an LSD and is even stronger in the presence of a large-scale shear flow. The LSD grows more slowly in the presence of SSD, saturating after 5 Gyr versus 1–2 Gyr in studies where the SSD is weak or absent. The LSD primarily grows in warm gas in the galactic midplane. Saturation of the LSD occurs due to α-quenching near the midplane as the growing mean-field produces a magnetic α that opposes the kinetic α. The magnetic energy in our models of the LSD shows a slightly sublinear response to increasing resolution, indicating that we are converging toward the physical solution at 1 pc resolution. Clustering supernovae in OB associations increases the growth rates for both the SSD and the LSD, compared to a horizontally uniform supernova distribution.

The variability of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is ubiquitous, but has not yet been understood. Measuring the optical variation properties of AGNs, such as the variation timescale and amplitude, and then correlating them with their fundamental physical parameters has long served as a critical way of exploring the origin of AGN variability and the associated physics of the accretion process in AGNs. Obtaining accurate variation properties of AGNs is thus essential. It has been found that the damped random walk process can describe the AGN optical variation well, but there is a controversy over how long a minimal monitoring baseline is required to obtain unbiased variation properties. In this work, we settle the controversy by exhaustively scrutinizing the complex combination of assumed priors, adopted best-fit values, ensemble averaging methods, and fitting methods. The new proposal is then an optimized solution where unbiased variation properties of an AGN sample possessing the same variation timescale can be obtained with a minimal baseline of about 10 times their variation timescale. Finally, the new optimized solution is used to demonstrate the positive role of the time-domain surveys to be conducted by the Wide Field Survey Telescope in improving constraints on AGN variation properties.

总结:
本文研究了类地无生命行星大气中CO2、CO和CH4的相对丰度对行星气候和生物地球化学的基本控制。研究结果表明，大气中CO2水平的升高会触发CO气体的光化学失稳，导致CO逃逸。同时，更高的火山岩浆喷发通量也会引发CO逃逸。我们的系统研究揭示了类似地球的无生命行星的缺氧大气可以根据CH4/CO2与CO/CO2的相对比值被归类。研究结果表明，这种缺口结构是围绕类太阳恒星（F型、G型和K型）运转的类地无生命行星大气的普遍特征。 <div>
Carbon is an essential element for life on Earth, and the relative abundances of major carbon species (CO2, CO, and CH4) in the atmosphere exert fundamental controls on planetary climate and biogeochemistry. Here we employed a theoretical model of atmospheric chemistry to investigate diversity in the atmospheric abundances of CO2, CO, and CH4 on Earth-like lifeless planets orbiting Sun-like (F-, G-, and K-type) stars. We focused on the conditions for the formation of a CO-rich atmosphere, which would be favorable for the origin of life. Results demonstrated that elevated atmospheric CO2 levels trigger photochemical instability of the CO budget in the atmosphere (i.e., CO runaway) owing to enhanced CO2 photolysis relative to H2O photolysis. Higher volcanic outgassing fluxes of reduced C (CO and CH4) also tend to initiate CO runaway. Our systematic examinations revealed that anoxic atmospheres of Earth-like lifeless planets could be classified in the phase space of CH4/CO2 versus CO/CO2, where a distinct gap in atmospheric carbon chemistry is expected to be observed. Our findings indicate that the gap structure is a general feature of Earth-like lifeless planets with reducing atmospheres orbiting Sun-like (F-, G-, and K-type) stars.

The transport of energetic charged particles through magnetized plasmas is ubiquitous in interplanetary space and astrophysics, and the important physical quantities are the parallel and perpendicular diffusion coefficients of energetic charged particles. In this paper, the influence of solar wind on particle transport is investigated. Using the focusing equation, we obtain parallel and perpendicular diffusion coefficients, accounting for the solar wind effect. For different conditions, the relative importance of the solar wind effect to diffusion is investigated. It is shown that, when energetic charged particles are close to the Sun, for parallel diffusion, the solar wind effect needs to be taken into account. These results are important for studying energetic charged particle transport processes in the vicinity of the Sun.

The electromagnetic emission from the nonrelativistic ejecta launched in neutron star mergers (either dynamically or through a disk wind) has the potential to probe both the total mass and composition of this ejecta. These observations are crucial in understanding the role of these mergers in the production of r-process elements in the Universe. However, many properties of the ejecta can alter the light curves and we must both identify which properties play a role in shaping this emission and understand the effects these properties have on the emission before we can use observations to place strong constraints on the amount of r-process elements produced in the merger. This paper focuses on understanding the effect of the velocity distribution (amount of mass moving at different velocities) for lanthanide-rich ejecta on the light curves and spectra. The simulations use distributions guided by recent calculations of disk outflows and compare the velocity-distribution effects to those of ejecta mass, velocity, and composition. Our comparisons show that uncertainties in the velocity distribution can lead to a factor of 2–4 uncertainties in the inferred ejecta mass based on peak infrared luminosities. We also show that early-time UV or optical observations may be able to constrain the velocity distribution, reducing the uncertainty in the ejecta mass.

<div> CHIME, fast radio bursts, repeating behavior, Monte Carlo simulations, completeness of CHIME/FRB observations
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章介绍了加拿大氢强度映射实验(CHIME)干涉仪近年来发现的大量快速无线电暴( FRB) ，包括一大部分表现出重复行为的FRB。文章使用蒙特卡洛模拟对重复FRB进行了模拟，并通过不同的宇宙分布构建了FRB样本模型。研究还推断了CHIME/FRB观测的完整性，并预测了未来设施对FRB重复爆发的发现。根据模拟结果，作者预测当前的CHIME/FRB观测会有大约170个重复爆发来源，同时也展示了未来设施在大约3年时间内发现的重复爆发数量可能会达到饱和。 <div>
In recent years, the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) interferometer has revealed a large number of fast radio bursts (FRBs), including a sizable population that demonstrates repeating behavior. This transit facility, employing a real-time FRB search pipeline, continually scans the sky with declinations between −10° and 90° for events with fluences ⪆0.4 Jy ms. We simulate a population of repeating FRBs by performing Monte Carlo simulations of underlying source populations processed through a mock CHIME/FRB observing pipeline. Assuming intrinsic repeater rates follow a Poisson distribution, we test assumptions about the burst populations of the repeater sample, and construct models of the FRB sample assuming various cosmological distributions. We infer the completeness of CHIME/FRB observations as a function of observing cadence and redshifts out to 0.5. We find that, if all simulated bursts have a fixed Poisson probability of repetition over their integrated time of observation, repeating burst detections across comoving volume should continue to grow near linearly on the order of decades. We predict that around 170 of the current CHIME/FRB one-off sources will ultimately repeat. We also make projections for FRB repeaters by future facilities and demonstrate that the number of repeaters they find could saturate on a ∼3 yr timescale.

<div> 关键词: 磁场配置, 太阳耀斑, 磁力线, 太阳动力学, 模拟

总结:
这篇文章研究了2012年3月10日观察到的一次复合太阳耀斑的磁场配置。研究者构建了一系列磁场模型，利用磁力线插入方法，实现了双层磁流结构的三维日冕磁场模型。他们发现，在初始磁力摩擦松弛过程中，共享相同路径但高度不同的双层磁流很快出现部分合并。但是，路径之间少于30%的重叠可以构建稳定的双层结构。通过对已验证的非线性力自由场双层配置中磁通量的变化，成功复现了双层结构的三种喷发情况。这表明磁力摩擦模拟可以捕捉到喷发开始时的大尺度磁场结构。 <div>
We present a magnetic configuration of a compound solar eruption observed on 2012 March 10, from NOAA AR 11429 near the disk center, which displayed a soft X-ray sigmoid before the eruption. We constructed a series of magnetic field models, including double-decker flux rope configurations, using the flux rope insertion method. This produces three-dimensional coronal magnetic field models constrained by the photospheric magnetogram and observed EUV coronal structures. We used different combinations of flux rope paths. We found that two flux ropes sharing the same path at different heights quickly experience a partial merging in the initial iteration of the magnetofrictional relaxation process. Different paths with less than 30% overlap allowed us to construct stable double-decker structures. The high spatial and temporal resolution of the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly facilitated the selection of a best-fit model that matches the observations best. Moreover, by varying fluxes in this validated nonlinear force-free field double-decker configuration, we successfully reproduce all three scenarios of eruptions of double-decker configurations: (i) eruption due to the instability of higher flux rope; (ii) eruption due to rising lower flux rope and merging with higher flux rope; and (iii) eruption due to the instability of both flux ropes. This demonstrates that magnetofrictional simulation can capture the large-scale magnetic structure of eruptions for a realistic field configuration at eruption onset.

<div> 关键词: R Aqr, 光谱演化, 空间演化, X射线, 联星系统
总结:
R Aqr是一个由红巨星和白矮星组成的联星系统，经过Chandra的观测发现其X射线辐射经历了显著变化。软X射线的发射量在感知到的射流辐射后有所上升，随后回落至之前的平静状态。硬X射线的辐射量在2017至2021年间保持不变，但在2022年后迅速下降。这可能是由于介质反射特性的改变、在近心点通道期间喷发物质的遮挡或白矮星周围吸积盘内部区域的部分/完全破坏。此外，还检测到了扩展辐射，可能与事先喷发的射流中的热斑有关，并且可以观察到其远离系统的中心区域。<br /><br /> <div>
We report on the X-ray spectral and spatial evolution of the symbiotic star R Aqr. Through a multiepoch observational campaign performed with Chandra between 2017 and 2022, we study the X-ray emission of this binary system, composed of an evolved red giant star and a white dwarf (WD). This analysis is particularly timely as the WD approached the periastron in late 2018/early 2019; thus, mass transfer, jet emission, and outburst phenomena are to be expected. Through detailed spectral analysis, we detect a significant rise in the soft X-ray (0.5–2 keV) emission of R Aqr, likely linked to jet emission, followed by a decay toward the previous quiescent state. The hard X-ray emission (5–8 keV) is not immediately affected by the periastron passage; the hard component, after maintaining the same flux level between 2017 and 2021, rapidly decays after 2022. Possible explanations for this are a change in the reflection properties of the medium surrounding the binary, obscuration of the central region by material ejected during the periastron passage, or even the partial/complete destruction of the inner regions of the accretion disk surrounding the WD. In addition to this activity in the central region, extended emission is also detected, likely linked to a hot spot in a pre-outburst-emitted jet, which can be observed moving away from the system’s central region.

这篇文章提出了一种新的方法来测量银河系的垂直势能。他们利用相空间蜗牛与z/Vz轴的交点，通过线性插值方法直接得出垂直势能的约束。他们的方法是独立于模型的，因为对蜗牛形状或垂直势能没有假设。研究表明，在银河系中，相空间蜗牛按照指导中心半径进行分组更为显著，但跟踪的垂直势能比相同银心半径分组的要浅。他们还应用了经验方法来校正这种差异。通过Gaia DR3数据，他们测量了几个Rg分组内的蜗牛交点，并应用插值法在几个垂直高度上推断势能值。研究结果显示，蜗牛交点处的势能以及接下来的质量建模与文献中的银河系势能模型是一致的。另外，他们的方法还可以在未来的研究中应用于更大的径向范围，提供对银河系势能的独立和更强的约束。<br /><br />总结: 本文提出了一种通过相空间蜗牛来测量银河系垂直势能的新方法，该方法独立于模型，能够有效约束银河系的势能，为我们更好地理解银河系的动力学提供了新途径。 <div>
The vertical phase-space spiral (snail) is a direct sign of disequilibrium of the Milky Way’s disk. Nevertheless, the wrapping of the phase snail contains information on the vertical potential. We propose a novel method to measure the vertical potential utilizing the intersections between the snail and z/Vz axes, for which we know the maximum vertical heights (Zmax) or velocities ({V}_{z,\max }). Using a refined linear interpolation method, we directly obtain ({Z}_{\max },\tfrac{1}{2}{V}_{z,\max }^{2}) for these snail intersections to constrain the vertical potential profile empirically. Our method is model-independent, since no assumptions about the snail shape or the vertical potential have been made. Although the snail binned by the guiding center radius (Rg) is more prominent, it traces a vertical potential shallower than that of the snail binned by the same galactocentric radius (R). We apply an empirical method to correct this difference. We measure the snail intersections in several Rg bins within 7.5 &lt; Rg &lt; 11.0 kpc for Gaia DR3 and apply the interpolation method to deduce the potential values at several vertical heights. The potential at the snail intersections, as well as the following mass modeling, is consistent with the popular Milky Way potentials in the literature. For the Rg-binned phase snail in the solar neighborhood, the mass modeling indicates a local dark matter density of ρdm = 0.0150 ± 0.0031 M⊙ pc−3, consistent with previous works. Our method could be applied to larger radial ranges in future works to provide independent and stronger constraints on the Milky Way’s potential.

<div> 关键词: 新方法, 星系原型团, 结构形成理论, 质量标准, 模拟校准
<br />
总结: 
本研究提出了一种新的方法，旨在利用结构形成理论直接应用于观测中，以找到星系原型团。该研究采用了传统的定义，即星系原型团是一个在其时代具有 virial 质量 Mvir < Mcl，且在演化至 z = 0 时将超过该限制的星系团。研究利用了在 z = 0 时预测的完全坍缩的临界过密度来找到将在 z = 0 坍缩的区域的半径和总质量。研究利用了宇宙学流体模拟 Horizon Run 5 (HR5) 来校准此方法，并展示了其性能。研究发现，根据球状坍缩模型确定的星系原型团区域内的质量与在 z = 0 发现的星系团内的最终质量之间存在着紧密的相关性。同时，研究也证实了红移空间畸变对星系原型团识别方案的性能影响不大。 <div>
We propose a new method for finding galaxy protoclusters that is motivated by structure formation theory and also directly applicable to observations. We adopt the conventional definition that a protocluster is a galaxy group whose virial mass Mvir &lt; Mcl at its epoch, where Mcl = 1014M⊙, but would exceed that limit when it evolves to z = 0. We use the critical overdensity for complete collapse at z = 0 predicted by the spherical top-hat collapse model to find the radius and total mass of the regions that would collapse at z = 0. If the mass of a region centered at a massive galaxy exceeds Mcl, the galaxy is at the center of a protocluster. We define the outer boundary of a protocluster as the zero-velocity surface at the turnaround radius so that the member galaxies are those sharing the same protocluster environment and showing some conformity in physical properties. We use the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation Horizon Run 5 (HR5) to calibrate this prescription and demonstrate its performance. We find that the protocluster identification method suggested in this study is quite successful. Its application to the high-redshift HR5 galaxies shows a tight correlation between the mass within the protocluster regions identified according to the spherical collapse model and the final mass to be found within the clusters at z = 0, meaning that the regions can be regarded as the bona fide protoclusters with high reliability. We also confirm that the redshift-space distortion does not significantly affect the performance of the protocluster identification scheme.

<div> 关键词: two-stream method, radiative transfer equation, spherical harmonics method, PICASO, thermal emission spectroscopy 

总结:<br />
本文介绍了用于解决散射和吸收媒介中辐射传递方程的快速、可靠且准确的近似方法。作者扩展了球谐方法的推导，用于研究热发射光谱学。通过比较不同模型产生的光谱，证明了SH4方法相对于Toon89方法在准确度上有显著提高。他们还探讨了计算时间和模型准确度之间的权衡，发现SH4方法在准确性方面有显著改进，而数值开销基本没有牺牲。 <div>
Approximate methods for radiative transfer equations that are fast, reliable, and accurate are essential for the understanding of atmospheres of exoplanets and brown dwarfs. The simplest and most popular choice is the “two-stream method,” which is often used to produce simple yet effective models for radiative transfer in scattering and absorbing media. Toon et al. (hereafter, Toon89) outlined a two-stream method for computing reflected light and thermal spectra that was later implemented in the open-source radiative transfer model PICASO. In Part I of this series, we developed an analytical spherical harmonics method for solving the radiative transfer equation for reflected solar radiation that was implemented in PICASO to increase the accuracy of the code by offering a higher-order approximation. This work is an extension of this spherical harmonics derivation, to study thermal emission spectroscopy. We highlight the model differences in the approach for thermal emission and benchmark the four-term method (SH4) against Toon89 and a high-stream discrete-ordinates method, CDISORT. By comparing the spectra produced by each model, we demonstrate that the SH4 method provides a significant increase in accuracy, compared to Toon89, which can be attributed to the increased order of approximation and to the choice of phase function. We also explore the trade-off between computational time and model accuracy. We find that our four-term method is twice as slow as our two-term method, but is up to five times more accurate, when compared with CDISORT. Therefore, SH4 provides excellent improvement in model accuracy with minimal sacrifice in numerical expense.

<div> 关键词: Voyager 1, Voyager 2, magnetic field, heliopause, interstellar medium  
总结:<br />本文重新审视了太空探测器Voyager 1和2在太阳圈层附近和极其局部的星际介质中的数据，旨在更好地理解在通过边界时观察到的磁场旋转的缺乏。然后提出可能的假设，即Voyagers穿越了一个与太阳风层表面沿边界重连接的厚厚的边界层。Voyager 1可能尚未完全穿越这一边界层，而Voyager 2可能已经穿越了这一边界层进入了从未与太阳连接的磁场和等离子体区域，即非常局部的星际介质。<br /> <div>
Voyager 1 and 2 data from the vicinity of the heliopause and very local interstellar medium are reexamined to better understand the confounding lack of rotation in the magnetic field (B-field) across the heliopause observed by both Voyagers, despite their very large spatial separations (&gt;100 au). Using three estimates for the orientation of the B-field in the pristine interstellar medium and four models of the heliosphere, we calculate draped interstellar B-field orientations along the model heliopauses and compare those estimates to the Voyager observations. At both Voyagers, expected draped B-fields are inconsistent with the observed B-field orientations after the boundary crossings. Furthermore, we show how the longer-term trends of the observed B-fields at both Voyagers after the crossings actually rotated away from both the expected draped B-field and the pristine interstellar B-field directions. We develop evidence, including an illustrative and analogous set of observations from Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft along Earth’s magnetopause, in support of a hypothesis that both Voyagers transited a thick boundary layer of reconnected magnetic flux along the heliopause surface. We estimate that Voyager 1 has not yet fully transited this boundary layer, the radial thickness of which at the Voyager 1 crossing location may be &gt;18 au and likely much thicker. Meanwhile, at Voyager 2's crossing location, the boundary layer is likely much thinner, and for Voyager 2, we present evidence that Voyager 2 might already have transited the boundary layer and entered a region of fields and plasma that were never connected to the Sun—the very local interstellar medium.

总结: 
本文利用Daniel K. Inouye太阳望远镜的公开数据，追踪了来自太阳光球到日冕的磁连接。研究了色球磁场与明亮的色球、过渡区和日冕等离子体之间的关系。通过Visible Spectro-Polarimeter仪器获取了磁场测量数据，对未来光环区的等离子体加热状况进行了研究，并发现了一些不同寻常的现象。研究发现，未来光环区中只有一小部分充满了加热等离子体，并没有发现色球磁场特性与加热等离子体之间的相关性。这表明，加热过程受到我们观测不到的控制。总体而言，这些数据表明“日冕是一个自我调节的强迫系统”，而加热取决于日冕的状态，而不仅仅是边界条件。与可识别的双极磁场相关的加热模型在这些具有单极色球磁场的区域中被证伪。 <br /><br /> <div>
We use the first publicly available data from the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope to track magnetic connections from the solar photosphere into the corona. We scrutinize relationships between chromospheric magnetism and bright chromospheric, transition region, and coronal plasmas. In 2022 June, the Visible Spectro-Polarimeter (ViSP) instrument targeted unipolar network within a decaying active region. ViSP acquired rastered scans with longitudinal Zeeman sensitivities of 0.25 Mx cm−2 (Fe i, 630.2 nm) and 0.5 Mx cm−2 (Ca ii, 854.2 nm). ViSP was operated in a “low” resolution mode (0.″214 slit width, spectral resolution { \mathcal R }\approx {\rm{70,000}}) to produce polarization maps over a common area of 105″ × 50″. Data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory and Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph are combined to ask: Why is only a fraction of emerging flux filled with heated plasma? What is the elemental nature of the plasmas? No correlations were found between heated plasma and the properties of chromospheric magnetic fields derived from the weak field approximation, on scales below supergranules. Processes hidden from our observations control plasma heating. While improved magnetic measurements are needed, these data indicate that “the corona is a self-regulating forced system.” Heating depends on the state of the corona, not simply on boundary conditions. Heating models based upon identifiable bipolar fields, including cool loops, tectonics, and observable magnetic reconnection, are refuted for these regions with unipolar chromospheric magnetic fields.

总结:
本文介绍了使用Kalman检测器来改善快速射电暴（FRB）信号检测的灵敏度。Kalman检测器结合了光谱形状信息，基于最优匹配滤波器，并考虑一定的相关带宽，能够提供可比较且独立的FRB探测信息。通过对先前检测到的FRB进行分析，发现Kalman分数的灵敏度提高了20%左右，甚至最高可提高200%。此外，作者还将Kalman检测器应用于FRB 20201124A的数据，并成功检测到之前被忽略的两次重复爆发。最后，作者建议在实时调查中采用从初始流量集成的低显著性软触发的实际实现方法。Kalman检测器有可能显著提高FRB的探测能力，并为了解这些神秘的天体现象的光谱特性提供新的见解。 <div>
Detecting fast radio bursts (FRBs) with frequency-dependent intensity remains a challenge, as existing search algorithms do not account for the spectral shape, potentially leading to nondetections. We propose a novel detection statistic, which we call the Kalman detector, that improves the sensitivity of FRB signal detection by incorporating spectral shape information. The detection statistic is based on an optimal matched filter, marginalizing over all possible intensity functions, weighted by a random walk probability distribution, considering some decorrelation bandwidth. Our analysis of previously detected FRBs demonstrates that the Kalman score provides a comparable yet independent source of information for bursts with significant spectral structure, and the sensitivity improvement is of the order 0%–200% with a median improvement of 20%. We also applied the Kalman detector to existing data from FRB 20201124A and detected two new repeat bursts that were previously missed. Furthermore, we suggest a practical implementation for real-time surveys by employing a low significance soft-trigger from initial flux integration-based detection algorithms. The Kalman detector has the potential to significantly enhance FRB detection capabilities and enable new insights into the spectral properties of these enigmatic astrophysical phenomena.

在这篇研究中，我们对孤立的大质量原恒星G28.20-0.05进行了天体化学诊断研究。我们分析了来自Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array的1.3毫米观测数据，分辨率为0.″2（约1000天文单位）。我们检测到了丰富的物种排放，包括含氧（例如H2CO、CH3OH、CH3OCH3）、含硫（SO2、H2S）和含氮（例如HNCO、NH2CHO、C2H3CN、C2H5CN）的分子。我们讨论了它们的空间分布、物理条件、不同物种之间的相关性以及可能的化学起源。在靠近原恒星的中心区域，我们确定了三个热分子核（HMCs）。HMC1是一个类似环状结构的毫米连续体的一部分，投影到原恒星最近，温度最高约为300K，并且显示出最丰富的谱线。HMC2位于环的另一侧，温度约为250K，并且具有中等的化学复杂性。HMC3则更远一些，投影到大约3000天文单位处，温度较低（约70K），谱线最不丰富。这三个HMC的质量面密度（约10 g cm-2）、数密度（nH约109 cm-3）和质量均为几个太阳质量。核心和3000天文单位范围内的气体总质量约为25太阳质量，与中心原恒星的质量相当。根据激发能量的峰值线强度的空间分布，我们推断HMCs受到原恒星的外部加热。我们估算了检测到的物种的柱密度和丰度，并讨论了对热核天体化学的影响。

We study the astrochemical diagnostics of the isolated massive protostar G28.20-0.05. We analyze data from Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array 1.3 mm observations with a resolution of 0.″2 (∼1000 au). We detect emission from a wealth of species, including oxygen-bearing (e.g., H2CO, CH3OH, CH3OCH3), sulfur-bearing (SO2, H2S), and nitrogen-bearing (e.g., HNCO, NH2CHO, C2H3CN, C2H5CN) molecules. We discuss their spatial distributions, physical conditions, correlation between different species, and possible chemical origins. In the central region near the protostar, we identify three hot molecular cores (HMCs). HMC1 is part of a millimeter continuum ring-like structure, is closest in projection to the protostar, has the highest temperature of ∼300 K, and shows the most line-rich spectra. HMC2 is on the other side of the ring, has a temperature of ∼250 K, and is of intermediate chemical complexity. HMC3 is further away, ∼3000 au in projection, cooler (∼70 K), and is the least line-rich. The three HMCs have similar mass surface densities (∼10 g cm−2), number densities (nH ∼ 109 cm−3), and masses of a few solar masses. The total gas mass in the cores and in the region out to 3000 au is ∼25 M⊙, which is comparable to that of the central protostar. Based on spatial distributions of peak line intensities as a function of excitation energy, we infer that the HMCs are externally heated by the protostar. We estimate column densities and abundances of the detected species and discuss the implications for hot core astrochemistry.

Quasar-driven galactic outflows are a major driver of the evolution of massive galaxies. We report observations of a powerful galactic-scale outflow in a z = 3 extremely red and intrinsically luminous (Lbol ≃ 5 × 1047erg s−1) quasar SDSSJ1652 + 1728 with the Near-infrared Spectrograph on board JWST. We analyze the kinematics of rest-frame optical emission lines and identify the quasar-driven outflow extending out to ∼10 kpc from the quasar with a velocity offset of (vr = ± 500 km s−1) and high velocity dispersion (FWHM = 700–2400 km s−1). Due to JWST’s unprecedented surface brightness sensitivity in the near-infrared, we unambiguously show that the powerful high velocity outflow in an extremely red quasar encompasses a large swath of the host galaxy’s interstellar medium. Using the kinematics and dynamics of optical emission lines, we estimate the mass outflow rate—in the warm ionized phase alone—to be at least 2300 ± 1400 M⊙ yr−1. We measure a momentum flux ratio between the outflow and the quasar accretion disk of ∼1 on a kpc scale, indicating that the outflow was likely driven in a relatively high (&gt;1023cm−2) column density environment through radiation pressure on dust grains. We find a coupling efficiency between the bolometric luminosity of the quasar and the outflow of 0.1%, matching the theoretical prediction of the minimum coupling efficiency necessary for negative quasar feedback. The outflow has sufficient energetics to drive the observed turbulence seen in shocked regions of the quasar host galaxy, which are likely directly responsible for prolonging the time that it takes for gas to cool efficiently.

<div> RS Ophiuchi, recurrent nova, eruption, X-ray spectrum, NICER
总结:
RS Ophiuchi是一颗周期性新星，2021年8月8日经历了最新的喷发，同时产生了可检测到的GeV和TeV辐射。通过对其X射线频谱进行广泛监测，使用了Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer Mission（NICER）来模拟X射线光谱，并探测了整个2021年喷发期间的冲击条件。在前5天内，温度显示出了峰值约为24keV的非平衡等离子体。吸收率的变化显示出喷发期间冲击区域的几何演变，最初是与一些密集的赤道壳相互作用，后来与极区的较少密集的物质相互作用。这些发现表明喷发物质与初始时一些密集的赤道壳相互作用，并且在喷发后期与极区的较少密集的物质发生相互作用。 <div>
The recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi (RS Oph) underwent its most recent eruption on 2021 August 8 and became the first nova to produce both detectable GeV and TeV emission. We used extensive X-ray monitoring with the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer Mission (NICER) to model the X-ray spectrum and probe the shock conditions throughout the 2021 eruption. The rapidly evolving NICER spectra consisted of both line and continuum emission that could not be accounted for using a single-temperature collisional equilibrium plasma model with an absorber that fully covered the source. We successfully modeled the NICER spectrum as a nonequilibrium ionization collisional plasma with partial covering absorption. The temperature of the nonequilibrium plasma shows a peak on day 5 with a kT of approximately 24 keV. The increase in temperature during the first five days could have been due to increasing contribution to the X-ray emission from material behind fast polar shocks or a decrease is the amount of energy being drained from the shocks into particle acceleration during that period. The absorption showed a change from fully covering the source to having a covering fraction of roughly 0.4, suggesting a geometrical evolution of the shock region within the complex global distribution of the circumstellar material. These findings show evidence of the ejecta interacting with some dense equatorial shell initially, and with less dense material in the bipolar regions at later times during the eruption.

<title>Neutrinos and Gamma Rays from Galaxy Clusters Constrained by the Upper Limits of IceCube</title>

Clusters of galaxies possess the capability to accelerate cosmic rays (CRs) to very high energy up to ∼1018 eV due to their large size and magnetic field strength, which favor CR confinement for cosmological times. During their confinement, they can produce neutrinos and γ-rays out of interactions with the background gas and photon fields. In recent work, Hussain et al. have conducted three-dimensional cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulations of the turbulent intracluster medium combined with multidimensional Monte Carlo simulations of CR propagation for redshifts ranging from z ∼ 5 to z = 0 to study the multimessenger emission from these sources. They found that when CRs with a spectral index in the range 1.5–2.5 and cutoff energy {E}_{\max }={10}^{16}\mbox{--}{10}^{17} eV are injected into the system, they make significant contributions to the diffuse background emission of both neutrinos and γ-rays. In this work, we have revisited this model and undertaken further constraints on the parametric space. This was achieved by incorporating the recently established upper limits on neutrino emission from galaxy clusters, as obtained by the IceCube experiment. We find that for CRs injected with spectral indices in the range 2.0–2.5, cutoff energy {E}_{\max }={10}^{16}\mbox{--}{10}^{17} eV, and power corresponding to (0.1–1)% of the cluster luminosity, our neutrino flux aligns with the upper limits estimated by IceCube. Additionally, the resulting contribution from clusters to the diffuse γ-ray background remains significant with values of the order of ∼10−5 MeV cm−2 s−1 sr−1 at energies above 500 GeV.

<title>WASP-69b’s Escaping Envelope Is Confined to a Tail Extending at Least 7 Rp</title>

Studying the escaping atmospheres of highly irradiated exoplanets is critical for understanding the physical mechanisms that shape the demographics of close-in planets. A number of planetary outflows have been observed as excess H/He absorption during/after transit. Such an outflow has been observed for WASP-69b by multiple groups that disagree on the geometry and velocity structure of the outflow. Here, we report the detection of this planet’s outflow using Keck/NIRSPEC for the first time. We observed the outflow 1.28 hr after egress until the target set, demonstrating the outflow extends at least 5.8 × 105 km or 7.5 Rp This detection is significantly longer than previous observations, which report an outflow extending ∼2.2 planet radii just 1 yr prior. The outflow is blueshifted by −23 km s−1 in the planetary rest frame. We estimate a current mass-loss rate of 1 M⊕ Gyr−1. Our observations are most consistent with an outflow that is strongly sculpted by ram pressure from the stellar wind. However, potential variability in the outflow could be due to time-varying interactions with the stellar wind or differences in instrumental precision.

<div> 关键词: LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA, O4, kilonova, DECam, gravitational-wave

总结: <br /><br />这篇文章讨论了在未来的LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA观测运行O4中最佳地识别所有通过引力波发射探测到的kilonovae的问题。他们提出了DECam在O4期间的优化观测策略，并基于引力波事件和宽先验kilonova模拟进行了研究。他们优化了策略以确认kilonova，同时最大程度地减少望远镜时间。通过优化策略，他们发现DECam对于银河系引力波探测极限（190Mpc）处的电磁对应物的发现概率约为80％，相比之前的策略提高了约30％。对于更遥远的事件（约330Mpc），发现概率达到约60％，增加了约2倍。对于更亮的kilonova模型，他们发现在330Mpc的范围内可以达到约90％的发现概率，而且还可以减少大约20％的望远镜观测时间。 <div>
We address the problem of optimally identifying all kilonovae detected via gravitational-wave emission in the upcoming LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA observing run, O4, which is expected to be sensitive to a factor of ∼7 more binary neutron star (BNS) alerts than previously. Electromagnetic follow-up of all but the brightest of these new events will require &gt;1 m telescopes, for which limited time is available. We present an optimized observing strategy for the DECam during O4. We base our study on simulations of gravitational-wave events expected for O4 and wide-prior kilonova simulations. We derive the detectabilities of events for realistic observing conditions. We optimize our strategy for confirming a kilonova while minimizing telescope time. For a wide range of kilonova parameters, corresponding to a fainter kilonova compared to GW170817/AT 2017gfo, we find that, with this optimal strategy, the discovery probability for electromagnetic counterparts with the DECam is ∼80% at the nominal BNS gravitational-wave detection limit for O4 (190 Mpc), which corresponds to an ∼30% improvement compared to the strategy adopted during the previous observing run. For more distant events (∼330 Mpc), we reach an ∼60% probability of detection, a factor of ∼2 increase. For a brighter kilonova model dominated by the blue component that reproduces the observations of GW170817/AT 2017gfo, we find that we can reach ∼90% probability of detection out to 330 Mpc, representing an increase of ∼20%, while also reducing the total telescope time required to follow up events by ∼20%.

Time-dependent photoionization modeling of warm absorber (WA) outflows in active galactic nuclei can play an important role in understanding the interaction between WAs and the central black hole. The WA may be out of the equilibrium state because of the variable nature of the central continuum. In this paper, with the help of time dependent photoionization modeling, we study how the WA gas properties change with time and how it reacts to changing radiation fields. Incorporating a flaring incident light curve, we investigate the behavior of WAs using a photoionization code that simultaneously and consistently solves the time-dependent equations of level population, heating and cooling, and radiative transfer. We simulate the physical processes in the gas clouds, such as ionization, recombination, heating, cooling, and the transfer of ionizing radiation through the cloud and present high-resolution time-resolved absorption spectra. We demonstrate that time-dependent radiative transfer is important and the calculations that omit this effect quantitatively and systematically underestimate the absorption. Time-dependent photoionization models provide crucial insights into the characteristics of WAs and can be used to constrain their density and spatial distribution.

We report spectroscopic observations of vB 120 (HD 30712), a 5.7 yr astrometric–spectroscopic binary system in the Hyades cluster. We combine our radial velocities with others from the literature, and with existing speckle interferometry measurements, to derive an improved 3D orbit for the system. We infer component masses of M1 = 1.065 ± 0.018 M☉ and M2 = 1.008 ± 0.016 M☉, and an orbital parallax of 21.86 ± 0.15 mas, which we show to be more accurate than the parallax from Gaia DR3. This is the ninth binary or multiple system in the Hyades with dynamical mass determinations, and one of the examples with the highest precision. An analysis of its spectral energy distribution yields the absolute radii of the stars, R1 = 0.968 ± 0.012 R☉ and R2 = 0.878 ± 0.013 R☉, and effective temperatures of 5656 ± 56 K and 5489 ± 60 K for the primary and secondary, respectively. A comparison of these properties with the predictions of current stellar evolution models for the known age and metallicity of the cluster shows only minor differences.

<div> Gaia Data Release 3, binary stars, Newtonian dynamics, kinematic acceleration ratio, gravitational anomaly<br />
总结:<br />
本研究基于Gaia Data Release 3的数据，发现了一些关于双星系统的引力异常现象。在对天体测量和径向速度进行了严格要求的情况下，研究发现了纯粹的双星系统，符合牛顿力学，但在较大距离下却显示出与牛顿预期有明显偏差的运动。这一发现在数据分析中得到了验证，并得出了相应的运动加速度比率，证实了在低加速度下存在引力异常现象。 <div>
It is found that Gaia Data Release 3 binary stars selected with stringent requirements on astrometric measurements and radial velocities naturally satisfy Newtonian dynamics without hidden close companions when the projected separation s ≲ 2 kau, showing that pure binaries can be selected. It is then found that pure binaries selected with the same criteria show a systematic deviation from the Newtonian expectation when s ≳ 2 kau. When both proper motions and parallaxes are required to have precision better than 0.005 and radial velocities better than 0.2, I obtain 2463 statistically pure binaries within a “clean” G-band absolute magnitude range. From this sample, I obtain an observed-to-Newtonian predicted kinematic acceleration ratio of {\gamma }_{g}={g}_{\mathrm{obs}}/{g}_{\mathrm{pred}}={1.49}_{-0.19}^{+0.21} for acceleration ≲10−10 m s−2, in excellent agreement with 1.49 ± 0.07 for a much larger general sample with the amount of hidden close companions self-calibrated. I also investigate the radial profile of stacked sky-projected relative velocities without a deprojection to the 3D space. The observed profile matches the Newtonian predicted profile for s ≲ 2 kau without any free parameters, but shows a clear deviation at a larger separation with a significance of ≈5.0σ. The projected velocity boost factor for s ≳ 5 kau is measured to be {\gamma }_{{v}_{p}}=1.20\pm 0.06 (stat) ±0.05 (sys) matching \sqrt{{\gamma }_{g}}. Finally, for a small sample of 40 binaries with exceptionally precise radial velocities (fractional errors &lt;0.005), the directly measured relative velocities in the 3D space also show a boost at larger separations. These results robustly confirm the recently reported gravitational anomaly at low acceleration for a general sample.

<title>Influence of Jets on [O iii] Extensions in Green Pea/Bean Galaxies</title>

<div> 关键词: Green Peas, Green Beans, [O iii] emission, jets, EELRs

研究调查了具有强烈[O iii]λ5007发射的星系（即绿豆和绿豌豆）受喷流影响的情况。研究样本包括12个附近源（z∼0.04–0.1，其中六个有喷流，六个没有喷流），具有高的[O iii]发光度（L∼1040 erg s−1），这些样本来自于斯隆数字化天空调查和二十厘米射电天空调查观测的射电选择星系样本。我们在每个星系上进行了大双望远镜-多对象双光谱仪的长条谱学观测，沿着两个位置角度进行观测：一个与喷流方向对齐，另一个垂直于喷流方向。通过沿着这些切口追踪[O iii]发射，我们旨在评估狭线区域的延伸并检查喷流的影响。令人惊讶的是，我们的分析显示[O iii]发射的延伸没有首选方向，这表明喷流对延伸的发射线区域（EELRs）影响有限。这也暗示了可能会漏掉与喷流对齐的圆锥形EELRs的检测，这归因于我们的切口方向。此外，我们比较了跟踪星形区域的[O ii]发射与[O iii]的延伸。我们观察到了显著的差异，[O ii]沿着星系平面展示了更大的延伸，这表明[O ii]发射与恒星过程的关联更加强烈。

<br /><br />总结:
1. 研究对象为具有高 [O iii] 发射的星系，分为有喷流和无喷流两组。
2. 使用长条谱学观测评估了狭线区域的延伸，并检查了喷流的影响。
3. 结果显示喷流对延伸的发射线区域影响有限，没有首选方向。
4. 比较了 [O ii] 和 [O iii] 发射的延伸，发现 [O ii] 更与恒星过程关联。
5. 研究结果暗示可能漏掉与喷流对齐的圆锥形 EELRs 的检测。 <div>
We present a study investigating the influence of jets on galaxies exhibiting strong [O iii]λ5007 emission, known as Green Peas and Green Beans. Our sample comprised 12 nearby sources (z ∼ 0.04–0.1, six with jets and six without jets) with high [O iii] luminosity (L ∼ 1040 erg s−1), selected from a radio-selected galaxy sample observed with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and Radio Sky at Twenty-centimeters survey. We perform Large Binocular Telescope–Multi-Object Double Spectrograph long-slit spectroscopy at two position angles for each galaxy: one aligned with the jet direction and another perpendicular to it. By tracing the [O iii] emission along these slits, we aimed to assess the extension of the narrow line region and examine the impact of jets. Surprisingly, our analysis revealed no preferred direction for the extension of the [O iii] emission, indicating that jets have a limited influence on the extended emission line regions (EELRs). This also suggests the possibility of missed detection of conical-shaped EELRs aligned with the jets, attributable to our slit orientations. Furthermore, we compared the extension of [O ii] emission, which traces star-forming regions, with that of [O iii]. We observed a significant difference, with [O ii] exhibiting a considerably greater extension along the galactic plane. This suggests a stronger association of [O ii] emission with stellar processes.

总结: <br /><br />此研究对太阳大气层中的横波进行了观测和模拟研究，发现高频率的横波振荡与长时间尺度的颗粒运动有着明显的区别，并提出了它们是通过纵波的模式转换而产生的。研究通过二维磁流体对流模拟，并在底部边界引入了类似p模式的激励源，发现了纵波向横波的能量转移效应，使得横波振荡的振幅和能量通量都得到了显著增加。这些发现为解释日冕的加热过程提供了重要线索。 <div>
Lateral motions of spicules serve as vital indicators of transverse waves in the solar atmosphere, and their study is crucial for understanding the wave-heating process of the corona. Recent observations have focused on high-frequency transverse waves (periods &lt; 100 s), which have the potential to transport sufficient energy for coronal heating. These high-frequency spicule oscillations are distinct from granular motions, which have much longer timescales of 5–10 minutes. Instead, it is proposed that they are generated through the mode conversion from high-frequency longitudinal waves that arise from a shock-steepening process. Therefore, these oscillations may not solely be produced by the horizontal buffeting motions of granulation but also by the leakage of p-mode oscillations. To investigate the contribution of p-modes, our study employs a two-dimensional magneto-convection simulation spanning from the upper convection zone to the corona. During the course of the simulation, we introduce a p-mode-like driver at the bottom boundary. We reveal a notable increase in the mean velocity amplitude of the transverse oscillations in spicules, ranging from 10%–30%, and attribute this to the energy transfer from longitudinal to transverse waves. This effect results in an enhancement of the estimated energy flux by 30%–80%.

卡西尼轨道飞行器紫外成像光谱仪（UVIS）从1999年到2017年获得了行星间的氢 Lyα 观测数据，其中2004年到2017年的观测数据是在土星轨道上获得的。飞船在土星轨道阶段从太阳圈层中的主要下风和侧风移动到上风位置。研究人员使用现有的热氢密度模型和最近用于研究太阳和日球观测器太阳风各向异性实验数据以及2003年到2004年间选定的卡西尼UVIS观测数据的太阳光照模型进行了所有观测数据分析。他们发现数据和模型之间存在一般的一致性，但有证据表明UVIS Lyα的灵敏度在2002年6月经历一次明显的下降，以及整体上近似线性下降。此前由普赛尔等人进行的工作使用UVIS实验室灵敏度校准拟合了2003年至2004年的UVIS Lyα数据，得出外太阳圈（但在外太阳圈边界进行了过滤）中的氢密度为0.085cm-3的估计值。然而，包括此处发现的灵敏度下降导致修订后的氢密度估计值为nH = 0.14 ± 0.03 cm−3。这一密度估计值与最近根据对新视野号飞船拾取氢离子观测的模型得出的终止冲击附近的中性氢密度估计值为0.127 ± 0.015 cm−3一致。 <br /><br />总结: 卡西尼轨道飞行器通过紫外成像光谱仪对行星间的氢进行观测，发现了UVIS Lyα灵敏度的下降，重新估计了外太阳圈的氢密度，与最近的模型观测结果一致。 <div>
The Cassini Orbiter Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) obtained interplanetary hydrogen Lyα observations from 1999 to 2017, with mid-2004 to 2017 observations obtained from Saturn orbit. During its Saturn orbital phase, the spacecraft moved from mostly downwind and sidewind in the heliosphere to upwind. We analyze the full set of observations with our existing hot hydrogen density model with a solar illumination model most recently used to study Solar and Heliospheric Observatory Solar Wind Anisotropy Experiment data and selected Cassini UVIS observations from 2003 to 2004. We find general agreement between data and model, but with evidence for a decline in UVIS Lyα sensitivity, with a significant decline in 2002 June during a starburn event and an overall roughly linear decline in sensitivity. While earlier work by Pryor et al. fit the UVIS Lyα data from 2003 to 2004 with a hydrogen density in the outer heliosphere (but after filtration at outer heliospheric boundaries) of 0.085  cm−3 using the UVIS laboratory sensitivity calibration, including the sensitivity decline found here leads to a revised hydrogen density estimate of nH = 0.14 ± 0.03 cm−3. This density estimate is consistent with a recent neutral hydrogen density estimate near the termination shock of 0.127 ± 0.015  cm−3 based on models of observations of pick-up hydrogen ions from the New Horizons spacecraft.

本研究通过对PNS质量回落至中子星的恒星上的物质吸积，利用完整的玻尔兹曼中微子输运进行中微子辐射-流体动力学模拟，调查了由物质吸积导致的延迟中微子辐射。我们追踪了PNS的吸积流动的时间演化，直到系统达到准稳态。吸积流动中通常形成一个驻波震荡，而震荡半径因物质吸积率和PNS质量而异。在PNS附近（∼10 公里）出现温度急剧增加，表征了中微子的辐射。随着物质吸积率和PNS质量的增加，中微子的发光度和平均能量也会增加。发射的中微子的平均能量在10 ≲ ϵ ≲ 20 MeV范围内，高于PNS冷却模型估计的值（≲10 MeV）。假设恒星型核心崩溃距离为10千秒差距，我们量化了Super-Kamiokande（超级神农）和深地下中微子实验（DUNE）的中微子事件率。估计的检测率远高于背景噪声，并且其能量依赖特征与PNS冷却模型的预期有质的不同。另一个显著特征是中微子辐射对味道的依赖性强，表现出中微子振荡模型的相关性。我们在考虑绝热米克耶夫-斯米尔诺夫-沃尔芬斯坦模型的情况下对其进行估算，结果显示在Super-K和DUNE中，正常和反转质量序列分别提供了大量的中微子探测。因此，Super-K和DUNE同时观测回落中微子将对中微子质量排列提供强有力的约束。 <div>
We investigate the late-time neutrino emission powered by fallback mass accretion onto a protoneutron star (PNS), using neutrino radiation-hydrodynamic simulations with full Boltzmann neutrino transport. We follow the time evolution of the accretion flow onto the PNS until the system reaches a quasi-steady state. A standing shock wave is commonly formed in the accretion flow, whereas the shock radius varies depending on the mass accretion rate and the PNS mass. A sharp increase in temperature emerges in the vicinity of the PNS (∼10 km), which characterizes neutrino emission. Both the neutrino luminosity and the average energy become higher with increasing mass accretion rate and PNS mass. The mean energy of the emitted neutrinos is in the range of 10 ≲ ϵ ≲ 20 MeV, which is higher than that estimated from PNS cooling models (≲10 MeV). Assuming a distance to core-collapse supernova of 10 kpc, we quantify neutrino event rates for Super-Kamiokande (Super-K) and Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE). The estimated detection rates are well above the background, and their energy-dependent features are qualitatively different from those expected from PNS cooling models. Another notable feature is that the neutrino emission is strongly flavor dependent, exhibiting that the neutrino event rate hinges on the neutrino oscillation model. We estimate them in the case with the adiabatic Mikheev–Smirnov–Wolfenstein model, and show that the normal and inverted mass hierarchy offer a large number of neutrino detections in Super-K and DUNE, respectively. Hence the simultaneous observation with Super-K and DUNE of fallback neutrinos will provide a strong constraint on the neutrino mass hierarchy.

<div> sunspot umbrae, wave patterns, observational properties, oscillation period, wave propagation
<br /><br />总结:
本文通过对太阳黑子中的螺旋波型的观测数据统计，得出了一些物理信息。研究发现螺旋波型的形成是由轴对称和非轴对称的黑子振动模式叠加而成。统计结果显示，从2013年到2018年，共检测到了241个螺旋波型，其中大部分只有一个螺旋臂。这些波型的振动周期和寿命与传统的黑子振动相当，没有明显的区别。另外，研究还发现螺旋波型的性质与太阳半球、纬度和黑子大小无关。通过对螺旋波型的视向速度和波传播模型的分析，得出螺旋波型可能在距离太阳光球表面2至11 Mm的地方产生，平均值约为6 Mm。 <div>
Spiral-shaped wave patterns (SWPs) observed in sunspot umbrae represent the superposition of axisymmetric patterns and nonaxisymmetric patterns of umbral oscillations. These patterns give us physical information about the source of oscillations below the surface. Here we present the statistics of their observational properties determined from the 304 Å line-intensity data obtained with the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory. From the 2013 to 2018 data set, we examined each of the 496 sunspots near the disk center for 2 hr. As a result, we identified 241 SWPs from 140 sunspots, which corresponds to the detection rate of 0.24 per hour in each sunspot. Most of the SWPs had one spiral arm, 48 SWPs had two arms, and only one had three. The oscillation period was estimated at 151 ± 27 s and the lifetime, at 770 ± 250 s, being comparable to those of conventional umbral oscillations. The rotation period of the SWPs was estimated at 190 ± 69 s for the one-armed SWPs and 299 ± 115 s for the two-armed SWPs. We found that the properties of the SWPs have no dependence on hemisphere, latitude, and sunspot size. From the apparent radial speeds of the SWPs and a simple model of wave propagation, we infer that the SWPs may be generated between 2 and 11 Mm below the photosphere with a mean value of about 6 Mm.

<div> 关键词: Solar Dynamics Observatory, coronal jets, erupting minifilaments, active region, magnetic flux<br />
总结: <br />本文研究了来自太阳活动区和日冕孔区的等离子体射流的特征。研究发现，活动区中的射流源通常被吸收的色球物质所遮挡，而日冕孔区的射流则明显起源于喷发的小丝状物。文章通过观测和磁数据分析得出这一结论，并指出在活动区中，喷发的小丝状物可能会在射流显示出来之前失去小丝状物的特征。研究强调了日冕孔区和活动区射流特征的差异，为太阳活动的物理过程提供了重要参考。 <br /> <div>
Solar quiet- and coronal-hole region coronal jets frequently clearly originate from erupting minifilaments, but active-region jets often lack an obvious erupting-minifilament source. We observe a coronal-jet-productive active region (AR), AR 12824, over 2021 May 22 0–8 UT, primarily using Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) Atmospheric Imaging Array (AIA) EUV images and SDO/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager magnetograms. Jets were concentrated in two locations in the AR: on the south side and on the northwest side of the AR’s lone large sunspot. The south-location jets are oriented so that we have a clear view of the jets’ origin low in the atmosphere: their source is clearly minifilaments erupting from locations showing magnetic flux changes/cancelations. After erupting a projected distance ≲5″ away from their origin site, the minifilaments erupt outward onto far-reaching field as part of the jet’s spire, quickly losing their minifilament character. In contrast, the northwest-location jets show no clear erupting minifilament, but the source site of those jets are obscured along our line of sight by absorbing chromospheric material. EUV and magnetic data indicate that the likely source sites were ≳15″ from where the we first see the jet spire; thus, an erupting minifilament would likely lose its minifilament character before we first see the spire. We conclude that such AR jets could work like non-AR jets, but the erupting-minifilament jet source is often hidden by obscuring material. Another factor is that magnetic eruptions making some AR jets carry only a harder-to-detect comparatively thin (∼1″–2″) minifilament “strand.”

<br /><br />总结: GECKO项目旨在快速识别引力波事件的电磁波对应体——巨新星(KN)，并成功使用该策略在O3期间对GW190425进行了观测并发现了十个瞬变现象，但没有找到巨新星。GECKO观测展示了在定位区域约为数百平方度的情况下，可能能够发现距离<200 Mpc的GW170817-like KN。 <div>
One of the keys to the success of multimessenger astronomy is the rapid identification of the electromagnetic wave counterpart, kilonova (KN), of the gravitational-wave (GW) event. Despite its importance, it is hard to find a KN associated with a GW event, due to a poorly constrained GW localization map and numerous signals that could be confused as a KN. Here, we present the Gravitational-wave Electromagnetic wave Counterpart Korean Observatory (GECKO) project, the GECKO observation of GW190425, and prospects of GECKO in the fourth observing run (O4) of the GW detectors. We outline our follow-up observation strategies during O3. In particular, we describe our galaxy-targeted observation criteria that prioritize based on galaxy properties. Armed with this strategy, we performed an optical and/or near-infrared follow-up observation of GW190425, the first binary neutron star merger event during the O3 run. Despite a vast localization area of 7460 deg2, we observed 621 host galaxy candidates, corresponding to 29.5% of the scores we assigned, with most of them observed within the first 3 days of the GW event. Ten transients were discovered during this search, including a new transient with a host galaxy. No plausible KN was found, but we were still able to constrain the properties of potential KNe using upper limits. The GECKO observation demonstrates that GECKO can possibly uncover a GW170817-like KN at a distance &lt;200 Mpc if the localization area is of the order of hundreds of square degrees, providing a bright prospect for the identification of GW electromagnetic wave counterparts during the O4 run.

本研究报告了在早期宇宙时期（5.6 <7.0）对131个低亮度类星体的黑洞质量和厄ddington比率进行估计的分布情况。该研究基于Subaru Telescope安装的Hyper Suprime-Cam的调查数据，构建了一个低亮度类星体样本，其M1450∼-21等IL 。这些类星体的发现光谱仅限于约1200-1400埃的固有波长范围，不包含可用作黑洞质量估计器的发射线。为了解决这个问题，我们利用斯隆数字化巡天中的低z对应光谱，这些光谱在重叠波长范围内与高z光谱匹配。然后，我们将对应的C iv发射线宽度与SHELLQs数据的连续光度结合起来估算黑洞质量。结果显示，黑洞质量分布范围约为107-10M⊙，大多数类星体的黑洞质量约为108M⊙，具有次Eddington流。本研究不仅为我们提供了有关再电离时期正常类星体的新见解，还为准确估算没有近红外光谱高z类星体的黑洞质量提供了新的有效方法。<br /><br />总结: 本研究基于SHELLQs项目的数据，针对低亮度类星体进行了黑洞质量和厄ddington比率的估计。利用光谱匹配和连续光度估算相结合的方法，得出了黑洞质量分布范围和大多数类星体的特征。研究结果不仅为我们提供了有关再电离时期正常类星体的新见解，还提出了一个新的有效方法来估算高z类星体的黑洞质量。 <div>
We report the distribution of black hole (BH) masses and Eddingont ratios estimated for a sample of 131 low luminosity quasars in the early cosmic epoch (5.6 &lt; z &lt; 7.0). Our work is based on the Subaru High-z Exploration of Low-Luminosity Quasars (SHELLQs) project, which has constructed a low luminosity quasar sample down to M1450 ∼ − 21 mag, exploiting the survey data of Hyper Suprime-Cam installed on Subaru Telescope. The discovery spectra of these quasars are limited to the rest-frame wavelengths of ∼1200–1400 Å, which contain no emission lines that can be used as BH mass estimators. In order to overcome this problem, we made use of low-z counterpart spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, which are spectrally matched to the high-z spectra in overlapping wavelengths. We then combined the C iv emission line widths of the counterparts with the continuum luminosity from the SHELLQs data to estimate BH masses. The resulting BH mass distribution has a range of ∼107–10M⊙, with most of the quasars having BH masses ∼108M⊙ with sub-Eddington accretion. The present study provides not only a new insight into normal quasars in the reionization epoch, but also a new promising way to estimate BH masses of high-z quasars without near-infrared spectroscopy.

<br /><br />总结:
本研究利用二维全粒子动力学电磁粒子模拟，针对在典型日冕条件下弱磁化等离子体中的高次谐波发射过程进行了研究。研究发现，较大的束流速度有利于产生更高次谐波的辐射，并且随着谐波序数的增加，辐射强度递减。此外，H3辐射主要通过H2辐射与朗道波的合并生成，而H4辐射主要来源于H3辐射与正向/反向传播的朗道波的合并。这些发现有助于揭示高次谐波辐射的产生机制。 <div>
Electromagnetic radiation at higher harmonics of the plasma frequency (ω ∼ nωpe, n &gt; 2) has been occasionally observed in type II and type III solar radio bursts, yet the underlying mechanism remains undetermined. Here we present two-dimensional fully kinetic electromagnetic particle-in-cell simulations with high spectral resolution to investigate the beam-driven plasma emission process in weakly magnetized plasmas of typical coronal conditions. We focused on the generation mechanisms of high-harmonic emission. We found that a larger beam velocity (ud) favors the generation of the higher-harmonic emission. The emissions grow later for higher harmonics and decrease in intensity by ∼2 orders of magnitude for each jump of the harmonic number. The second and third harmonic (H2 and H3) emissions get closer in intensity with larger ud. We also show that (1) the H3 emission is mainly generated via the coalescence of the H2 emission with the Langmuir waves, i.e., H2 + L → H3, wherein the coalescence with the forward-propagating beam-Langmuir wave leads to the forward-propagating H3, and coalescence with the backward-propagating Langmuir wave leads to the backward-propagating H3; and (2) the H4 emission mainly arises from the coalescence of the H3 emission with the forward- (backward-)propagating Langmuir wave, in terms of H3 + L → H4.

We report on integral field unit (IFU) measurements of the host of the radio source 4C+37.11. This massive elliptical contains the only resolved double compact nucleus at parsec-scale separation, likely a bound supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB). i-band photometry and GMOS-N IFU spectroscopy show that the galaxy has a large rb = 1.″5 core and that the stellar velocity dispersion increases inside of a radius of influence rSOI ≈ 1.″3. Jeans Anisotropic Modeling analysis of the core infers a total SMBHB mass of {2.8}_{-0.8}^{+0.8}\times {10}^{10}{M}_{\odot }, making this one of the most massive black hole systems known. Our data indicate that there has been significant scouring of the central kiloparsec of the host galaxy.

总结: 
该研究在SDSS Data Release 12中针对活动星系核（AGN）的Type-1和Type-2进行了电子密度（ne）的比较。研究发现Type-1 AGN的NLRs中的ne要高于Type-2 AGN，并提出了AGN活动时间长、导致更多电子注入NLRs的可能解释，以及Type-2 AGN中更强烈的星形成贡献导致ne较低的可能解释。这些结果对广泛认可的AGN统一模型提出了有趣的挑战。<br /><br /> <div>
In the manuscript, we check properties of electron densities ne traced by flux ratio Rsii of [S ii]λ6716 Å to [S ii]λ6731 Å in narrow emission line regions (NLRs) between Type-1 active galactic nucleus (AGN) and Type-2 AGN in SDSS Data Release 12 (DR12). Under the framework of unified model considering kiloparsec-scale structures, similar ne in NLRs should be expected between Type-1 AGN and Type-2 AGN. Based on reliable measurements of the [S ii] doublet with measured parameters at least 5 times larger than corresponding uncertainties, there are 6039 Type-1 AGN and 8725 Type-2 AGN (excluding the Type-2 LINERs and the composite galaxies) collected from SDSS DR12. Then, lower Rsii (higher ne) in NLRs can be well confirmed in Type-1 AGN than in Type-2 AGN, with the confidence level higher than 5σ, even after considering the necessary effects including effects of electron temperatures traced by [O iii]λ4364,4959,5007 Å on estimating ne in NLRs. Two probable methods are proposed to explain the higher ne in NLRs in Type-1 AGN. First, the higher ne in NLRs of Type-1 AGN could indicate longer time durations of AGN activities in Type-1 AGN than in Type-2 AGN, if AGN activities triggering galactic-scale outflows leading to more electrons injecting into NLRs were accepted to explain the higher ne in NLRs of Type-2 AGN than H ii galaxies. Second, the lower ne in NLRs of Type-2 AGN could be explained by stronger star-forming contributions in Type-2 AGN, considering lower ne in H ii regions. The results provide interesting challenges to the commonly and widely accepted unified model of AGN.

The chromatic contamination that arises from photospheric heterogeneities, e.g., spots and faculae on the host star presents a significant noise source for exoplanet transmission spectra. If this contamination is not corrected for, it can introduce substantial bias in our analysis of the planetary atmosphere. We utilize two stellar models of differing complexity, StARPA (Stellar Activity Removal for Planetary Atmospheres) and ASteRA (Active Stellar Retrieval Algorithm), to explore the biases introduced by stellar contamination in retrieval under differing degrees of stellar activity. We use the retrieval framework TauREx3 and a grid of 27 synthetic, spot-contaminated transmission spectra to investigate potential biases and to determine how complex our stellar models must be in order to accurately extract the planetary parameters from transmission spectra. The input observation is generated using the more complex model (StARPA), in which the spot latitude is an additional, fixable parameter. This observation is then fed into a combined stellar-planetary retrieval, which contains a simplified stellar model (ASteRA). Our results confirm that the inclusion of stellar activity parameters in retrieval minimizes bias under all activity regimes considered. ASteRA performs very well under low-to-moderate activity conditions, retrieving the planetary parameters with a high degree of accuracy. For the most active cases, characterized by larger, higher-temperature contrast spots, some minor residual bias remains due to ASteRA neglecting the interplay between the spot and the limb-darkening effect. As a result of this, we find larger errors in retrieved planetary parameters for central spots (0°) and those found close to the limb (60°) than those at intermediate latitudes (30°).

事件视界望远镜合作团队首次发布了对M87*和Sgr A*超大质量黑洞的单位视界图像，并提供了其周围物理条件的初步信息。他们使用三维广义相对论磁流体力学模拟与观测进行比较，初步约束了这些黑洞时空的特性。然而，由于观测辐射在改变等离子体和时空特性时产生的退化，准确区分吸积流的性质和时空特性仍具有挑战性。下一代事件视界望远镜观测预计将通过探索盘-喷流动力学的复杂相互作用来消除一些这些退化。GRMHD模拟和广义相对论辐射传输的计算结果显示，喷流的径向和方位动态与黑洞自旋密切相关。基于ngEHT对M87*的分辨率和图像重建能力，我们能够评估这种相关性的检测性和相关的不确定性。总的来说，我们的结果有助于评估未来事件视界望远镜观测来约束黑洞自旋的前景。 <br /><br />总结: 超大质量黑洞M87*和Sgr A*的首张单位视界图像的发布和通过GRMHD模拟研究黑洞自旋的相关性，有望为未来事件视界望远镜观测提供了约束黑洞自旋的前景。 <div>
The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) Collaboration has recently published the first horizon-scale images of the supermassive black holes M87* and Sgr A* and provided some first information on the physical conditions in their vicinity. The comparison between the observations and the three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations has enabled the EHT to set initial constraints on the properties of these black hole spacetimes. However, accurately distinguishing the properties of the accretion flow from those of the spacetime, most notably, the black hole mass and spin, remains challenging because of the degeneracies the emitted radiation suffers when varying the properties of the plasma and those of the spacetime. The next-generation EHT (ngEHT) observations are expected to remove some of these degeneracies by exploring the complex interplay between the disk–jet dynamics, which represents one of the most promising tools for extracting information on the black hole spin. By using GRMHD simulations of magnetically arrested disks and general relativistic radiative transfer (GRRT) calculations of the emitted radiation, we have studied the properties of the jet and the accretion disk dynamics on spatial scales that are comparable with the horizon. In this way, we are able to highlight that the radial and azimuthal dynamics of the jet are well correlated with the black hole spin. Based on the resolution and image reconstruction capabilities of the ngEHT observations of M87*, we can assess the detectability and associated uncertainty of this correlation. Overall, our results serve to assess the prospects for constraining the black hole spin with future EHT observations.

总结:
本研究分析了64个benchmark late-M和L矮星的金属丰度和J-K颜色之间的关系，发现它们显示出正相关性。对比实验结果和Drift-Phoenix模型预测的关系，发现金属丰度越高的天体在光度上表现更红。作者推测这是因为更高的金属丰度导致了这些大气层中更多的凝结物形成，使得这些超冷矮星在光度上显得更红。 <div>
We examine the relationship between metallicity and J − K color for 64 benchmark late-M and L dwarfs, all of which are wide companions to higher-mass stars, and six of which are new discoveries. We assess the correlation between the Δ(J − K) color anomaly (the difference in an object’s J − K color from the median color for field objects of the same spectral type) and the metallicity of the host star to investigate how metallicity affects ultracool photospheres. Using Spearman’s rank correlation test and Student’s t-test, the late-M dwarf (L dwarf) sample’s Δ(J − K) and metallicity show a positive correlation at the 95% (90%) confidence level. A linear fit to color anomaly as a function of metallicity finds a slope of 0.17 ± 0.07 for the late-M dwarfs and a slope of {0.20}_{-0.08}^{+0.07} for the L dwarfs. We also computed the Δ(J − K) versus metallicity relationship predicted by multi-metallicity model spectra generated using Drift-Phoenix. The modeled late-M dwarfs show a slope of 0.202 ± 0.03, which is close to our observational results, but the modeled L dwarfs show a slope of 0.493 ± 0.02, steeper than our observational results. Both our empirical results and the models indicate that more metal-rich objects should appear redder photometrically. We speculate that higher metallicity drives more condensate formation in these atmospheres, thus making these ultracool dwarfs appear redder.

We analyze 347 galaxies at redshift 4 &lt; z &lt; 9.5 using JWST observations from the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) program by simultaneously fitting a two-dimensional parametric model to the seven-filter Near Infrared Camera images to measure the overall structural parameters and quantify the global properties of the galaxies in the rest-frame optical band. Particular attention is devoted to deriving robust uncertainties that include, among other factors, the influence of cosmological surface brightness dimming and resolution effects. Using the global Sérsic index (n &lt; 1.5) and observed axial ratio (q &lt; 0.6) as a guide, we place a conservative lower limit of ∼45% on the incidence of galactic disks. Galaxies follow a relation between the rest-frame optical luminosity and effective radius in the redshift range 4 &lt; z &lt; 9.5, as well as separately over the intervals 4 &lt; z &lt; 5 and 5 ≤ z &lt; 9.5, with a very similar slope but a marginally lower zero-point in the higher-redshift bin (Re = 0.69 ± 0.05 kpc) compared to the lower-redshift bin (Re = 0.91 ± 0.04 kpc). Within the limitations of the current sample size, we find no significant redshift evolution of n or Re at these early epochs.

<div> SNe Ia, quasars, time-delay distances, strong lensing, model-independent method
<br /><br />总结:
本研究利用强引力透镜效应的时间延迟距离来锚定宇宙距离，结合类星体作为辅助探测器，使用模型无关的方法确定哈勃常数H0。通过模拟数据集和高斯过程回归，我们展示了利用高红移的类星体可以扩展SNe Ia的红移范围，提高强透镜时间延迟距离测量的精确度。在时间延迟距离不确定性为距离数值的5%时，我们将H0的估计精度从2.1%提高到1.3%。 <div>
Absolute distances from strong lensing can anchor Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) at cosmological distances giving a model-independent inference of the Hubble constant (H0). Future observations could provide strong lensing time-delay distances with source redshifts up to z  ≃  4, which are much higher than the maximum redshift of SNe Ia observed so far. In order to make full use of time-delay distances measured at higher redshifts, we use quasars as a complementary cosmic probe to measure cosmological distances at redshifts beyond those of SNe Ia and provide a model-independent method to determine H0. In this work, we demonstrate a model-independent, joint constraint of SNe Ia, quasars, and time-delay distances from strong lensed quasars. We first generate mock data sets of SNe Ia, quasar, and time-delay distances based on a fiducial cosmological model. Then, we calibrate the quasar parameters model independently using Gaussian process (GP) regression with mock SNe Ia data. Finally, we determine the value of H0 model-independently using GP regression from mock quasars and time-delay distances from strong lensing systems. As a comparison, we also show the H0 results obtained from mock SNe Ia in combination with time-delay lensing systems whose redshifts overlap with SNe Ia. Our results show that quasars at higher redshifts show great potential to extend the redshift coverage of SNe Ia and thus enable the full use of strong lens time-delay distance measurements from ongoing cosmic surveys and improve the accuracy of the estimation of H0 from 2.1% to 1.3% when the uncertainties of the time-delay distances are 5% of the distance values.

Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the solar corona are often started from a potential field initial condition, which may be far from the true state of the coronal magnetic field. To test the sensitivity of the simulations to the initial condition, an electric-field-driven MHD code was initiated from three different initial conditions: the commonly used potential field, a nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) extrapolation, which is believed to be a better representation of the true coronal magnetic field, and a purely vertical field. After relaxation, the magnetic field in the MHD simulations was compared. It was found that there is a tendency for all of the initial conditions to converge to a similar connectivity, particularly in areas of strong fields that are not close to the boundary, suggesting that the final state of the simulation is not particularly sensitive to the initial condition. The relaxed solution more closely resembles the NLFFF initial condition than the other initial conditions, but still exhibits substantial differences from it.

Interplanetary Type III bursts, generated by relativistic electron beams at solar flare reconnection sites, are explored through an investigation of 152 instances observed by the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory mission. This study reveals that the absolute values of the wavevector deviations from the Sun–spacecraft line are statistically 3.72 and 2.10 larger than predicted by the density model, assuming fundamental and harmonic emission, respectively. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we examine the impact of scattering by density inhomogeneities on the apparent locations of radio emissions in the interplanetary medium. The findings indicate that relative density fluctuations of 0.40 can account for the observed angular shift, a conclusion supported by the multiple flux-tube solar wind model, which confirms the presence of such magnitude of relative perpendicular density fluctuations in the solar wind. We propose a wavevector correction that incorporates this effect to enhance the triangulation of interplanetary Type III bursts, demonstrating that radio triangulation, with this correction, can reliably track electron beams in the interplanetary medium.

Recent advances in photon detectors have provided exceptional sensitivities to dark matter with high angular resolution. Motivated by this, we present a detailed study of photon flux from dark matter decay in dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) by focusing on the detectors with arcsecond-level field of view and/or angular resolution. We propose to use differential D-factors since such detectors are sensitive to their dark matter distributions. We carefully estimate the differential D-factors of 35 dSphs. By using the differential D-factors, it turns out that the resulting signal flux can have a more than { \mathcal O }(1–10) enhancement compared to conventional estimations. Based on this analysis, we find that the Infrared Camera and Spectrograph (IRCS) installed on the 8.2 m Subaru Telescope can be an excellent dark matter detector for the mass in the eV range, particularly axion-like particles (ALPs). Observing the Draco or Ursa Major II dSphs with the IRCS for { \mathcal O }(1) night will enable us to place the most stringent bound for the ALP dark matter in the mass range of 1 eV ≲ ma ≲ 2 eV.

We present the results from a pair of high-resolution, long-timescale (∼105GM/c3), global, three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical accretion disk simulations with differing initial magnetic plasma β in order to study the effects of the initial toroidal field strength on the production of a large-scale poloidal field. We initialize our disks in approximate equilibrium with purely toroidal magnetic fields of strength β0 = 5 and 200. We also perform a limited resolution study. We find that simulations of differing field strengths diverge early in their evolution and remain distinct over the time studied, indicating that the initial magnetic conditions leave a persistent imprint in our simulations. Neither simulation enters the magnetically arrested disk regime. Both simulations are able to produce poloidal fields from initially toroidal fields, with the β0 = 5 simulation evolving clear signs of a large-scale poloidal field. We make a cautionary note that computational artifacts in the form of large-scale vortices may be introduced in the combination of initially weak field and disk-internal mesh refinement boundaries, as evidenced by the production of an m = 1 mode overdensity in the weak field simulation. Our results demonstrate that the initial toroidal field strength plays a vital role in the simulated disk evolution for the models studied.

总结:<br /><br />
这项研究使用ACT和WISE的观测数据进行了交叉相关分析，发现了在WISE×ACT TT交叉功率谱中30σ显著性的空间各向同性信号，被解释为ACT频率下的宇宙红外背景与WISE中的多环芳烃（PAH）发射的相关性。在银河系内，观测到星际尘埃光谱在范围103 < ℓ < 104内通常可以用幂律描述，但在一些地区表现出幂律指数的可变性和非幂律行为。研究还发现在35个不同的∼100平方度天空区域中，WISE总强度和ACT E模极化之间存在正相关关系，表明银河密度结构与局部磁场的对齐性在这些区域保持到亚秒尺度。TE谱在所有107个区域中的分布偏向于正值，而TB谱没有这种偏向。这项工作是迄今为止对银河尘埃TE光谱的高ℓ测量，表明与高分辨率中红外观测尘埃辐射的交叉相关是约束毫米波长度下尘埃发射空间统计的有效工具。 <div>
We present a cross-correlation analysis between 1^{\prime} resolution total intensity and polarization observations from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) at 150 and 220 GHz and 15″ mid-infrared photometry from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) over 107 12.°5 × 12.°5 patches of sky. We detect a spatially isotropic signal in the WISE×ACT TT cross-power spectrum at 30σ significance that we interpret as the correlation between the cosmic infrared background at ACT frequencies and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission from galaxies in WISE, i.e., the cosmic PAH background. Within the Milky Way, the Galactic dust TT spectra are generally well described by power laws in ℓ over the range 103  &lt;  ℓ  &lt;  104, but there is evidence both for variability in the power-law index and for non-power-law behavior in some regions. We measure a positive correlation between WISE total intensity and ACT E-mode polarization at 1000  &lt;  ℓ  ≲  6000 at &gt;3σ in each of 35 distinct ∼100 deg2 regions of the sky, suggesting that alignment between Galactic density structures and the local magnetic field persists to subparsec physical scales in these regions. The distribution of TE amplitudes in this ℓ range across all 107 regions is biased to positive values, while there is no evidence for such a bias in the TB spectra. This work constitutes the highest-ℓ measurements of the Galactic dust TE spectrum to date and indicates that cross-correlation with high-resolution mid-infrared measurements of dust emission is a promising tool for constraining the spatial statistics of dust emission at millimeter wavelengths.

总结: <br /><br />这项研究观察了NOAA活跃区13023中两个相邻的太阳黑子、它们之间的间隙以及大量从间隙和太阳黑子外沿传播出的磁特征。研究发现，磁场倾斜角度不同的磁特征(MMFs)可以分为垂直型和水平型，其磁通量生成速率平均比太阳黑子的磁通量丢失速率高出5.6倍。特别是垂直型磁特征的磁通量大约是两个太阳黑子总丢失磁通量的1.4倍。这些观察结果表明，具有垂直磁场的磁特征与太阳黑子的解体密切相关，并且间隙中的磁特征的磁通量约为总磁通量的三分之一，大部分的垂直型磁特征可能直接源自太阳黑子的本质。 <div>
The relationship between the decay of sunspots and moving magnetic features (MMFs) plays an important role in understanding the evolution of active regions. We present observations of two adjacent sunspots, the gap between them, and a lot of MMFs propagating from the gap and the sunspots' outer edges in NOAA Active Region 13023. The MMFs are divided into two types based on their magnetic field inclination angle: vertical (0° &lt; γ &lt; 45°) and horizontal (45° ≤ γ &lt; 90°) MMFs (V-MMFs and H-MMFs, respectively). The main results are as follows: (1) the mean magnetic flux decay rates of the two sunspots are −1.7 × 1020 and −1.4 × 1020 Mx day−1; (2) the magnetic flux generation rate of all MMFs is calculated to be −1.9 × 1021 Mx day−1, which is on average 5.6 times higher than the total magnetic flux loss rate of the sunspots; (3) the magnetic flux of V-MMFs (including a pore separated from the sunspots) is 1.4 times larger than the total lost magnetic flux of the two sunspots, and in a later stage when the pore has passed through the reference ellipse, the magnetic flux generation rate of the V-MMFs is almost the same as the magnetic flux loss rate of the sunspots; and (4) within the gap, the magnetic flux of V-MMFs is one-third of the total magnetic flux. Few V-MMFs stream out from the sunspots at the nongap region. All observations suggest that MMFs with vertical magnetic fields are closely related to the disintegration of the sunspot, and most of the MMFs from the gap may originate directly from the sunspot umbra.

We present the first results from a high-resolution simulation with a focus on galactic wind driving for an isolated galaxy with a halo mass of ∼1011M⊙ (similar to the Large Magellanic Cloud) and a total gas mass of ∼6 × 108M⊙, resulting in ∼108 gas cells at ∼4 M⊙ mass resolution. We adopt a resolved stellar feedback model with nonequilibrium cooling and heating, including photoelectric heating and photoionizing radiation, as well as supernovae, coupled to the second-order meshless finite-mass method for hydrodynamics. These features make this the largest resolved interstellar medium (ISM) galaxy model run to date. We find mean star formation rates around 0.05 M⊙ yr−1 and evaluate typical time-averaged loading factors for mass (ηM ∼ 1.0, in good agreement with recent observations) and energy (ηE ∼ 0.01). The bulk of the mass of the wind is transported by the warm (T &lt; 5 × 105 K) phase, while there is a similar amount of energy transported in the warm and the hot phases (T &gt; 5 × 105 K). We find an average opening angle of 30° for the wind, decreasing with higher altitude above the midplane. The wind mass loading is decreasing (flat) for the warm (hot) phase as a function of the star formation surface rate density ΣSFR, while the energy loading shows inverted trends with ΣSFR, decreasing for the warm wind and increasing for the hot wind, although with very shallow slopes. These scalings are in good agreement with previous simulations of resolved wind driving in the multiphase ISM.

总结: 
通过使用最小二乘法，从光度、光谱和星震观测中推断了60颗δ Scuti星的模型相关质量、金属丰度和年龄。发现大多数这些星的质量约为1.6太阳质量，金属丰度低于Z = 0.010。观察到了这些星年龄的双峰分布，大多数样本年龄小于30百万年，而其余的被推断为年龄较大，即数亿年。这项工作强调了大频率间隔（Δν）在δ Scuti星研究中的重要性。设计了三种机器学习模型，有望以更低的计算成本和更快的速度推断这些参数。这些模型还揭示了约束偶极模式可以显著改善年龄估计的重要性，径向模式简洁地包含了关于光度和温度的信息。使用机器学习模型，还对在估计质量、金属丰度和年龄时的星体可观测量的重要性进行了定性洞察。有效温度Teff大大影响了所有结构参数的推断，而星震偏移参数ϵ在年龄推断中起着重要作用。 <div>
Asteroseismology is a powerful tool to probe stellar structure. Spaceborne instruments like CoRoT, Kepler, and TESS have observed the oscillations of numerous stars, among which δ Scutis are particularly interesting, owing to their fast rotation and complex pulsation mechanisms. In this work, we inferred model-dependent masses, metallicities, and ages of 60 δ Scuti stars from photometric, spectroscopic, and asteroseismic observations using least-squares minimization. These statistics have the potential to explain why only a tiny fraction of δ Scuti stars pulsate in a very clean manner. We find most of these stars with masses around 1.6 M⊙ and metallicities below Z = 0.010. We observed a bimodality in age for these stars, with more than half the sample younger than 30 Myr, while the remaining ones were inferred to be older, i.e., hundreds of Myrs. This work emphasizes the importance of the large-frequency separation (Δν) in studies of δ Scutis. We also designed three machine-learning (ML) models that hold the potential for inferring these parameters at lower computational cost and much more rapidly. These models further revealed that constraining dipole modes can help in significantly improving age estimation and that radial modes succinctly encode information regarding luminosity and temperature. Using the ML models, we also gained qualitative insight into the importance of stellar observables in estimating mass, metallicity, and age. The effective temperature Teff strongly affects the inference of all structure parameters, and the asteroseismic offset parameter ϵ plays an essential role in the inference of age.

We investigate the seasonal variations of ion precipitation, utilizing observations from the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution mission spanning from 2014 January 4 to 2023 February 14. Our analysis reveals that a diminishing pattern characterizes the transition from Mars season Ls 0°–180° to Mars season Ls 180°–360°, manifesting as a reduction in precipitating ion fluxes. Additionally, we discern a significant influence of the crustal magnetic field on the seasonal variations in precipitating ion fluxes. Intriguingly, within regions where the crustal magnetic field exhibits a strong quasi-horizontal orientation, opposite seasonal trends become evident. The underlying physical mechanism driving these seasonal variations in ion precipitation is probably attributed to the mass loading effect that may decelerate the solar wind and influence the magnetic pileup. A detailed investigation is further demanded in the future.

该研究利用Hinode/X射线望远镜观测到的日冕图像，研究了FOV受限情况下排除的辐照率的比例。结果表明，在2022年7月观察到的活跃日冕中，在1.1R⊙内获得的辐照率相比于1.2R⊙和1.7R⊙内获得的辐照率排除了约3.5%和7%。相反，在2009年8月观察到的最小日冕中，排除的比例分别增加到约7%和13%。此外，研究确认了排除比例在太阳活动最低期间最高，并且发现排除比例在太阳活动周期上升阶段略微大于下降阶段。 
<br /><br />总结: 该研究利用Hinode/X射线望远镜观测到的日冕图像，研究了FOV受限情况下排除的辐照率的比例，并发现在太阳活动最低期间和太阳活动周期上升阶段，排除的比例最高。 <div>
Soft X-ray images of the Sun obtained with multiple broadband filters provide a simple and useful method to calculate averaged coronal temperature and emission measure, from which we can further calculate solar X-ray irradiance in physical units, e.g., watts per square meter. However, X-ray telescopes are often designed for pursuing high spatial resolution, and thus the field of view (FOV) of full-Sun images is often limited over the limb, extending to only ∼1.3 R⊙. This indicates that the irradiance obtained from the limited FOV may underestimate the true full-Sun irradiance by failing to count the contribution from outside the FOV. This work uses Hinode/X-Ray Telescope (XRT) coronal images observed up to 1.7 R⊙ to investigate the fraction of irradiance excluded from the FOVs limited in size. The analysis indicates that the irradiance obtained within 1.1 R⊙, which is used for XRT irradiance study, excludes ∼3.5%/∼7% of irradiance relative to the value within 1.2/1.7 R⊙, respectively, for the active corona observed in 2022 July. In contrast, the excluded fraction increases to ∼7%/∼13%, respectively, for the minimum corona observed in 2009 August. To further investigate the dependence of exclusion fraction on the Sun’s activity level, we process mission long Yohkoh/Soft X-ray Telescope full-Sun images to compare the irradiance within 1.1 and 0.9 R⊙ with that obtained from the maximum FOV of 1.2 R⊙. We confirm that the exclusion fraction is the largest in the period around solar minimum. We also find that the average value of exclusion fraction is slightly but measurably larger in the rising phase than the declining phase of the solar cycle.

<div> CH3O, CH2OH radicals, complex organic molecules, interstellar dust, water ice surface
总结:
CH3O和CH2OH自由基是星际尘埃中复杂有机分子(COMs)的重要前体，它们可以产生多种类型的COMs。为了更好地理解不同类型COMs的化学演变，确定CH3O和CH2OH的丰度比至关重要。最近的研究表明，在冰尘表面，CH3OH和OH的反应在形成CH3O和CH2OH自由基中起着重要作用。然而，目前还没有提出这些自由基丰度的定量细节。本文实验确定了在10K下CH3OH + OH反应在水冰表面的分支比(CH3O/CH2OH)为4.3 ± 0.6。此外，反应中产生的CH3O自由基即使在10K的低温下也会参与随后的扩散反应。这一事实对于在冷分子云中COMs形成模型提供了关键信息。 <div>
The CH3O and CH2OH radicals can be important precursors of complex organic molecules (COMs) in interstellar dust. The COMs presumably originating from these radicals were abundantly found in various astronomical objects. Because each radical leads to different types of COMs, determining the abundance ratio of CH3O to CH2OH is crucial for a better understanding of the chemical evolution into various COMs. Recent work suggested that the reaction between CH3OH and OH on ice dust plays an important role in forming CH3O and CH2OH radicals. However, quantitative details on the abundance of these radicals have not been presented to date. Herein, we experimentally determined the branching ratio (CH3O/CH2OH) resulting from the CH3OH + OH reaction on the water ice surface at 10 K to be 4.3 ± 0.6. Furthermore, the CH3O product in the reaction would participate in subsequent diffusive reactions even at a temperature as low as 10 K. This fact should provide critical information for COMs formation models in cold molecular clouds.

CJ的形成会限制鹅卵石流入和核心迁移，观测结果显示外部的CJ与内部超级地球的存在相关。研究发现，当行星表受到拖曳辅助的轨道衰减速度快于共振扫描速度时，位于略微偏心的CJ内部的行星体系会逐渐产生高度集中的大小分离行星体环，这有助于减少碰撞的破坏性。整体而言，研究突出了盘的重力在行星体轨道重分布中的重要作用，描述了CJ可能增强内部行星系统形成的新途径。 
<br /><br />总结: <br />该研究探讨了冷木星形成对行星体轨道和系统形成的影响，发现CJ内部行星体系统的形成可能是由于盘中行星体的轨道重分布，这为了解内部行星系统形成机制提供了新的视角。 <div>
The formation of a cold Jupiter (CJ) is expected to quench the influx of pebbles and the migration of cores interior to its orbit, thus limiting the efficiency of rocky planet formation either by pebble accretion and/or orbital migration. Observations, however, show that the presence of outer CJs (&gt;1 au and ≳0.3MJup) correlates with the presence of inner super-Earths (at &lt;1 au). This observation may simply be a result of an enhanced initial reservoir of solids in the nebula required to form a CJ or a yet-to-be-determined mechanism assisted by the presence of the CJ. In this work, we focus on the latter alternative and study the orbital transport of planetesimals interior to a slightly eccentric (∼0.05) CJ subject to the gravity and drag from a viscously evolving gaseous disk. We find that a secular resonance sweeping inward through the disk gradually transports rings of planetesimals when their drag-assisted orbital decay is faster than the speed of the resonance scanning. This snowplow-like process leads to large concentration (boosted by a factor of ∼10–100) of size-segregated planetesimal rings with aligned apsidal lines, making their expected collisions less destructive, due to their reduced velocity dispersion. This process is efficient for a wide range of α-disk models (and thus disk lifetimes) and Jovian masses, peaking for values ∼1–5MJup, which are typical of observed CJs in radial velocity surveys. Overall, our work highlights the major role that the disk's gravity may have on the orbital redistribution of planetesimals, depicting a novel avenue by which CJs may enhance the formation of inner planetary systems, including super-Earths and perhaps even warm and hot Jupiters.

总结:<br />
这篇文章介绍了关于异常型Ia超新星SN 2022pul的星际物质(CSM)相互作用和光谱特征的观测。在光学和中红外波段，SN 2022pul的光变曲线early rise表现出两个不同的部分，与CSM相互作用相关。在光学方面，SN 2022pul类似于SN 2012dn，而在星云相中，SN 2022pul展现出了03fg-like subclass的多样性。最后，使用JWST的数据，得到了首个03fg-like超新星的光学到中红外星云光谱。研究结果表明，SN 2022pul是由一个白矮星在C/O-rich CSM中发生融合而产生。 <div>
Nebular-phase observations of peculiar Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) provide important constraints on progenitor scenarios and explosion dynamics for both these rare SNe and the more common, cosmologically useful SNe Ia. We present observations from an extensive ground- and space-based follow-up campaign to characterize SN 2022pul, a super-Chandrasekhar mass SN Ia (alternatively “03fg-like” SN), from before peak brightness to well into the nebular phase across optical to mid-infrared (MIR) wavelengths. The early rise of the light curve is atypical, exhibiting two distinct components, consistent with SN Ia ejecta interacting with dense carbon–oxygen (C/O)-rich circumstellar material (CSM). In the optical, SN 2022pul is most similar to SN 2012dn, having a low estimated peak luminosity (MB = −18.9 mag) and high photospheric velocity relative to other 03fg-like SNe. In the nebular phase, SN 2022pul adds to the increasing diversity of the 03fg-like subclass. From 168 to 336 days after peak B-band brightness, SN 2022pul exhibits asymmetric and narrow emission from [O i] λλ6300, 6364 (FWHM ≈ 2000 km s−1), strong, broad emission from [Ca ii] λλ7291, 7323 (FWHM ≈ 7300 km s−1), and a rapid Fe iii to Fe ii ionization change. Finally, we present the first ever optical-to-MIR nebular spectrum of an 03fg-like SN Ia using data from JWST. In the MIR, strong lines of neon and argon, weak emission from stable nickel, and strong thermal dust emission (with T ≈ 500 K), combined with prominent [O i] in the optical, suggest that SN 2022pul was produced by a white dwarf merger within C/O-rich CSM.

总结:<br />
这篇论文提出了一个框架，用于对星体年龄进行概率预测，并使用SHapley Additive exPlanations来量化恒星演化和银河化学演化对这些预测的贡献。他们将这种可解释的预测框架应用于既包含各种演化阶段的模拟银河样本，又包含APOGEE模拟样本的红巨星。他们发现在前一种情况下，恒星演化是年龄估计的主要驱动因素，而在后一种情况下，由于演化信息受限，模型通过化学演化模型来估算年龄。他们还指出，由于使用了非内在的银河化学信息，估算出的趋势，如年龄-金属丰度关系，可能会偏离真实情况。 <div>
Stellar ages are key for determining the formation history of the Milky Way, but are difficult to measure precisely. Furthermore, methods that use chemical abundances to infer ages may entangle the intrinsic evolution of stars with the chemodynamical evolution of the Galaxy. In this paper, we present a framework for making probabilistic predictions of stellar ages, and then quantify the contribution of both stellar evolution and Galactic chemical evolution to those predictions using SHapley Additive exPlanations. We apply this interpretable prediction framework to both a simulated Milky Way sample containing stars in a variety of evolutionary stages and an APOGEE-mocked sample of red clump stars. We find that in the former case, stellar evolution is the dominant driver for age estimates, while in the latter case, the more restricted evolutionary information causes the model to proxy ages through the chemical evolution model. We show that as a result of the use of nonintrinsic Galactic chemical information, trends estimated with the predicted ages, such as the age–metallicity relation, can deviate from the truth.

<div> SDO, HMI, solar flares, proton beam heating, sunquakes
<br /><br />总结:
本文研究了太阳耀斑的一种可能机制，即通过非热的幂律分布的质子束加热大气层，产生的质子束加热模型可以解释HMI仪器的连续可观测性的增强，并在一定程度上解释了引起太阳地震的过程。研究发现能量较高的质子束（大于500keV）在HMI仪器的连续可观测性中表现更为显著，而能量较低的质子束（小于100keV）在引起太阳地震的过程中表现更为强烈，这为太阳耀斑的热加热机制提供了新的理论解释。 <div>
Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) observations reveal a class of solar flares with substantial energy and momentum impacts in the photosphere, concurrent with white-light emission and helioseismic responses, known as sunquakes. Previous radiative hydrodynamic modeling has demonstrated the challenges of explaining sunquakes in the framework of the standard flare model of “electron beam” heating. One of the possibilities to explain the sunquakes and other signatures of the photospheric impact is to consider additional heating mechanisms involved in solar flares, for example via flare-accelerated protons. In this work, we analyze a set of single-loop Fokker–Planck and radiative hydrodynamics RADYN+FP simulations where the atmosphere is heated by nonthermal power-law-distributed proton beams which can penetrate deeper than the electron beams into the low atmospheric layers. Using the output of the RADYN models, we calculate synthetic Fe i 6173 Å line Stokes profiles and from those the line-of-sight observables of the SDO/HMI instrument, as well as the 3D helioseismic response, and compare them with the corresponding observational characteristics. These initial results show that the models with proton beam heating can produce the enhancement of the HMI continuum observable and explain qualitatively the generation of sunquakes. The continuum observable enhancement is evident in all models but is more prominent in ones with Ec ≥ 500 keV. In contrast, the models with Ec ≤ 100 keV provide a stronger sunquake-like helioseismic impact according to the 3D acoustic modeling, suggesting that low-energy (deka- and hecto-keV) protons have an important role in the generation of sunquakes.

总结: 中国空间站POLAR-2实验的LPD有效载荷是低能X射线偏振检测器，用于观测2-10keV能量范围内的伽马射线暴快速辐射的偏振情况。该设备具有90°的广角视场，在预设计中采用了基于气体像素探测器的X射线光电偏振计组成的阵列。通过GEANT4 C++软件包进行了详细模拟，发现LPD的主要背景成分包括宇宙X射线背景和明亮的X射线源。在施加带电粒子背景排除算法后，LPD的平均背景计数率约为0.55 counts cm–2 s–1，并随着探测器的轨道和指向方向而变化。此外，还进行了关于不同视场和探测器指向的宇宙X射线背景和X射线明亮源的综合模拟和比较分析。 <div>
The Low-Energy X-ray Polarization Detector (LPD) is one of the payloads in the POLAR-2 experiment, designed as an external payload for the China Space Station deployment in early 2026. LPD is specifically designed to observe the polarization of gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt emission in the energy range of 2–10 keV, with a wide field of view (FoV) of 90° in preliminary design. This observation is achieved using an array of X-ray photoelectric polarimeters based on gas pixel detectors. Due to the wide FoV configuration, the in-orbit background count rate in the soft X-ray range is high, while GRBs themselves also exhibit high flux in this energy band. In order to assess the contribution of various background components to the total count rate, we conducted detailed simulations using the GEANT4 C++ package. Our simulations encompassed the main interactions within the instrument materials and provided insights into various background components within the wide-FoV scheme. The simulation results reveal that among the background components, the primary contributors are the cosmic X-ray background (CXB) and bright X-ray sources. The total background count rate of LPD, after applying the charged particle background rejection algorithm, is approximately 0.55 counts cm–2 s–1 on average, and it varies with the detector’s orbit and pointing direction. Furthermore, we performed comprehensive simulations and comparative analyses of the CXB and X-ray bright sources under different FoVs and detector pointings. These analyses provide valuable insights into the background characteristics for soft X-ray polarimeter with wide FoV.

<title>Post-merger Gravitational-wave Signal from Neutron-star Binaries: A New Look at an Old Problem</title>

<div> gravitational-wave signal, neutron stars, equation of state, Weyl scalar, quasi-universal relation
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了双中子星合并所产生的引力波信号的频谱特性，以及这些特性所包含的关于系统和物质方程状态的信息。通过使用Weyl标量ψ4的特性，他们提出了一个新的瞬时频率{f}_{0}^{{\psi }_{4}}，并建立了与该频率相关的“准通用”关系。他们还推导了合并频率{f}_{\mathrm{mer}}^{h}的新“准通用”关系，并发现在足够长的时间尺度内，ℓ = 2, m = 1引力波模式的幅度可能与传统的ℓ = 2, m = 2模式相当，这些发现对引力波研究具有重要意义。 <div>
The spectral properties of the post-merger gravitational-wave signal from a binary of neutron stars encodes a variety of information about the features of the system and of the equation of state describing matter around and above nuclear saturation density. Characterizing the properties of such a signal is an “old” problem, which first emerged when a number of frequencies were shown to be related to the properties of the binary through “quasi-universal” relations. Here we take a new look at this old problem by computing the properties of the signal in terms of the Weyl scalar ψ4. In this way, and using a database of more than 100 simulations, we provide the first evidence for a new instantaneous frequency, {f}_{0}^{{\psi }_{4}}, associated with the instant of quasi-time-symmetry in the dynamics, and which also follows a quasi-universal relation. We also derive a new quasi-universal relation for the merger frequency {f}_{\mathrm{mer}}^{h}, which provides a description of the data that is 4 times more accurate than previous expressions while requiring fewer fitting coefficients. Finally, consistent with the findings of numerous studies before ours, and using an enlarged ensemble of binary systems, we point out that the ℓ = 2, m = 1 gravitational-wave mode could become comparable with the traditional ℓ = 2, m = 2 mode on sufficiently long timescales, with strain amplitudes in a ratio ∣h21∣/∣h22∣ ∼ 0.1–1 under generic orientations of the binary, which could be measured by present detectors for signals with a large signal-to-noise ratio or by third-generation detectors for generic signals should no collapse occur.

总结: 本研究通过现代仪器持续追踪太阳到地球的太阳耀斑活动和地基宇宙射线探测器，揭示了两次太阳耀斑事件对地球的所有活动链。首次太阳耀斑产生了CME抛射和CME驱动冲击波与地球相交，导致了宇宙射线减少事件。而第二次太阳耀斑的冲击波速度比第一次快得多，尽管第一次事件更好地与地球磁连接，并且耀斑相似，但第二次事件导致了宇宙射线增强事件。结果表明，宇宙射线增强事件的产生可以主要由足够快的CME驱动冲击波主导。 <div>
Two major solar eruptions on AR 12673 produced a Forbush decrease (FD) event (reduction of cosmic rays) on 2017 September 8 and ground-level enhancement (GLE; enhancement of cosmic rays) on 2017 September 10. The occurrence of two contrasting cosmic-ray events within 2 days that are associated with two similar X-class solar flares (X9.3 and X8.2) and share the same active region on the Sun provides us a rare opportunity to understand the dominant factors in determining the properties of transient cosmic-ray events. Using a suite of modern-day instruments continuously tracking solar eruptions from the Sun to the Earth with ground-based cosmic-ray detectors, we reveal the complete cause–effect chain of activities for these two events. We conclude that the different consequences on the ground arise from two effects of the eruptions near the Sun: (1) the geometric effect of CMEs and (2) the intensity effect of CME-driven shocks. The first eruption, which originated at the heliographic longitude of W34° on 2017 September 6, had its CME ejecta and CME-driven shock intercept the Earth, leading to the FD event. The second eruption, which occurred on September 10 at W88°, only had its far flank reach the Earth. The peak shock speed of 3344 km s−1 of the second eruption, much faster than the 2175 km s−1 of the first eruption, is the dominant factor producing the GLE event, even though the first eruption is better connected magnetically to the Earth and has a similar flare. The results indicate that the production of GLE particles can be dominated by fast-enough CME-driven shocks.

<br /><br />总结: 本研究使用TYPHOON长狭缝吸收线光谱技术对NGC 1365的恒星爆发带螺旋星系进行了分析。通过人口综合技术，确定了年龄和金属丰度的空间分布，以及年轻和老年恒星群体的星形成率、泛红、消光和消光与泛红比RV。研究发现恒星盘呈现明显的内外成长特征，年轻恒星群体的亮度分数呈向外增加的趋势，平均年龄减少，质量增长历史在最外层盘完成。年轻恒星群体的金属丰度在较大的星系中心距上呈下降梯度，而老年群体的金属含量则保持稳定。在星系中心区域，年轻群体的金属丰度急剧下降，低于老年群体的水平，这归因于金属贫穷气体的涌入，以及由活跃星系核和超新星反馈引起的星形成中断，并在数十亿年后以早期恒星的恒星风排出的气体再次开始。我们还提供了对后者的支持的简单模型计算。 <div>
We analyze TYPHOON long-slit-absorption line spectra of the starburst barred spiral galaxy NGC 1365 obtained with the Progressive Integral Step Method covering an area of 15 kpc2. Applying a population synthesis technique, we determine the spatial distribution of ages and metallicities of the young and old stellar populations together with star formation rates, reddening, extinction, and the ratio RV of extinction to reddening. We detect a clear indication of inside-out growth of the stellar disk beyond 3 kpc characterized by an outward increasing luminosity fraction of the young stellar population, a decreasing average age, and a history of mass growth, which was finished 2 Gyr later in the outermost disk. The metallicity of the young stellar population is clearly super solar but decreases toward larger galactocentric radii with a gradient of −0.02 dex kpc−1. On the other hand, the metal content of the old population does not show a gradient and stays constant at a level roughly 0.4 dex lower than that of the young population. In the center of NGC 1365, we find a confined region where the metallicity of the young population drops dramatically and becomes lower than that of the old population. We attribute this to the infall of metal-poor gas, and additionally, to interrupted chemical evolution where star formation is stopped by active galactic nuclei and supernova feedback and then after several gigayears resumes with gas ejected by stellar winds from earlier generations of stars. We provide a simple model calculation as support for the latter.

<div> 关键词: 黑洞自旋, 磁化阻滞盘, 磁流体动力学模拟, 星系演化, 引力波 <br />
总结: <br />
本研究关注辐射效率低且几何厚的磁化阻滞盘（MAD），发现MAD可以迅速将黑洞的自旋降低到极低水平。与标准薄亮盘相比，MAD使黑洞的自旋迅速降至0 < aeq ≲ 0.1。这意味着受MAD供应的高超艾登顿速率下快速吸积的黑洞往往会将大部分旋转能量损失到磁化相对论流出。研究还构建了一个半解析的黑洞自旋演化模型，考虑了盘和电磁喷流对黑洞产生的扭矩，并发现aeq的低值既是因为喷流减慢了黑洞自旋，也是因为盘失去了大部分角动量到流出。研究结果对活跃星系和其他系统的黑洞自旋演化以及引力波的演化有重要影响。 <div>
Black hole (BH) spin can play an important role in galaxy evolution by controlling the amount of energy and momentum ejected from near the BH into the surroundings. We focus on radiatively inefficient and geometrically thick magnetically arrested disks (MADs) that can launch strong BH-powered jets. With an appropriately chosen adiabatic index, these systems can describe either the low-luminosity or highly super-Eddington BH accretion regimes. Using a suite of 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we find that for any initial spin, an MAD rapidly spins down the BH to the equilibrium spin of 0 &lt; aeq ≲ 0.1, very low compared to aeq = 1 for the standard thin luminous (Novikov–Thorne) disks. This implies that rapidly accreting (super-Eddington) BHs fed by MADs tend to lose most of their rotational energy to magnetized relativistic outflows. In an MAD, a BH only needs to accrete 20% of its own mass to spin down from a = 1–0.2. We construct a semi-analytic model of BH spin evolution in MADs by taking into account the torques on the BH due to both the hydrodynamic disk and electromagnetic jet components, and find that the low value of aeq is due to both the jets slowing down the BH rotation and the disk losing a large fraction of its angular momentum to outflows. Our results have crucial implications for how BH spins evolve in active galaxies and other systems such as collapsars, where the BH spin-down timescale can be short enough to significantly affect the evolution of gamma-ray emitting BH-powered jets.

在这篇文章中，研究了非均匀气体分布、星系旋转和引力等主要因素对几乎正面朝向的螺旋星系中超泡观测外观的影响。将3D数值模拟的结果与晚期螺旋星系NGC 628中最大的东南超泡的观测气体柱密度分布进行了比较。利用哈勃太空望远镜图像中解析的恒星群来获得其能量，并证明数值模拟的结果与观测到的气体表面密度分布是一致的。还表明观测到的气体柱密度分布可以约束气体盘的尺度高度和中平面气体密度，如果能够从观测中获得能量输入率。这意味着观测到星际气体分布中的大孔洞及其恒星群具有潜在的力量，可以解决几乎正面朝向星系中的中平面气体密度-气体盘尺度高度退化问题。还简要讨论了超泡在推动星系中次生星形成中的可能作用。<br /><br />总结: 本文研究了超泡对星系观测外观的影响，通过数值模拟结果与观测数据的比较得出结论，指出了观测中可以约束气体盘参数的可能性，并讨论了超泡对星系次生星形成的潜在作用。 <div>
Here we explore the impact of all major factors, such as the nonhomogeneous gas distribution, galactic rotation, and gravity, on the observational appearance of superbubbles in nearly face-on spiral galaxies. The results of our 3D numerical simulations are compared to the observed gas column density distribution in the largest southeast superbubble in the late-type spiral galaxy NGC 628. We make use of the star formation history inside the bubble derived from the resolved stellar population seen in Hubble Space Telescope images to obtain its energy and demonstrate that the results of numerical simulations are in good agreement with the observed gas surface density distribution. We also show that the observed gas column density distribution constrains the gaseous disk scale height and the midplane gas density if the energy input rate can be obtained from observations. This implies that observations of large holes in the interstellar gas distribution and their stellar populations have the potential power to solve the midplane gas density–gaseous disk scale height degeneracy problem in nearly face-on galaxies. The possible role of superbubbles in driving the secondary star formation in galaxies is also briefly discussed.

总结:
FAST在中间银河纬度进行了一次初步调查，发现了四颗脉冲星，其中两颗是毫秒脉冲星，另外两颗是“轻度再循环”的脉冲星。这次调查覆盖了4.7平方度的区域，但仍然发现了四颗再循环的脉冲星，显示了未来在中间银河纬度进行调查的巨大潜力。通过人口模拟发现，FAST和Parkes新的相位阵列前沿调查，聚焦于中间银河纬度，有能力发现数百颗新的毫秒脉冲星。<br /><br /> <div>
We present the discovery and timing results of four pulsars discovered in a pilot survey at intermediate Galactic latitudes with the Five-hundred Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST). Among these pulsars, two belong to the category of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) with spin periods of less than 20 ms. The other two fall under the classification of “mildly recycled” pulsars, with massive white dwarfs as companions. Remarkably, this small survey, covering an area of 4.7 deg2, led to the discovery of four recycled pulsars. Such success underscores the immense potential of future surveys at intermediate Galactic latitudes. In order to assess the potential yield of MSPs, we conducted population simulations and found that both FAST and Parkes new phased array feed surveys, focusing on intermediate Galactic latitudes, have the capacity to uncover several hundred new MSPs.

<div> pulsar, X-ray emission, wind nebula, multizone emission scenario, TeV results
总结:<br /><br /> 这篇文章报告了使用Chandra、XMM-Newton、NICER、Swift和NuSTAR测量的PSR J1849−0001脉冲星及其风星云（PWN）的X射线发射特性。我们发现脉冲星的X射线光谱呈现显着的曲率，在约60 keV处达到峰值。通过比较脉冲平均和脉冲内的光谱，我们发现脉冲星的脉冲外发射显示出与脉冲内发射非常相似的光谱形状。利用NuSTAR的脉冲外数据，我们成功测量了PWN的>10 keV光谱和辐射亮度的径向分布，并将这些X射线测量结果与已发表的TeV结果相结合。最后，采用多区域发射场景对广泛的数据进行建模，结果表明PWN内的磁场相对较低（≈7 μG），并且在该PWN内的电子被加速到能量≳400 TeV。负责TeV发射的电子可能会传播到距离脉冲星约30 pc的地方，在大约10 kyr内形成X射线PWN之外的TeV发射云。 <div>
We report on the X-ray emission properties of the pulsar PSR J1849−0001 and its wind nebula (PWN), as measured by Chandra, XMM-Newton, NICER, Swift, and NuSTAR. In the X-ray data, we detected the 38 ms pulsations of the pulsar up to ∼60 keV with high significance. Additionally, we found that the pulsar's on-pulse spectral energy distribution displays significant curvature, peaking at ≈60 keV. Comparing the phase-averaged and on-pulse spectra of the pulsar, we found that the pulsar's off-pulse emission exhibits a spectral shape that is very similar to its on-pulse emission. This characterization of the off-pulse emission enabled us to measure the &gt;10 keV spectrum of the faint and extended PWN using NuSTAR's off-pulse data. We measured both the X-ray spectrum and the radial profiles of the PWN’s brightness and photon index, and we combined these X-ray measurements with published TeV results. We then employed a multizone emission scenario to model the broadband data. The results of the modeling suggest that the magnetic field within the PWN is relatively low (≈7 μG) and that electrons are accelerated to energies ≳400 TeV within this PWN. The electrons responsible for the TeV emission outside the X-ray PWN may propagate to ∼30 pc from the pulsar in ∼10 kyr.

<div> 关键词: gamma-ray bursts, spectral hardness, peak energy, X-ray afterglows, magnetar origin
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了 gamma-ray bursts 的谱硬度特征，使用了峰能量和硬度比两种参数进行分类和分析。研究发现，X 射线的硬度比值普遍低于γ射线。此外，作者还确认了几乎所有观测到的γ射线暴的光谱均可用破裂幂律函数描述，并验证了具有内部X射线高原的暴的磁星起源。另外，作者还指出类型IV暴的光谱受物质喷流几何形状的影响，与其他类型的暴有显著差异。对中性氢吸收对硬度比估计的影响可以忽略不计，尽管它可能会略微降低γ/X射线的亮度。 <div>
Spectral hardness of gamma-ray bursts can be characterized by either hardness ratio or peak energy, and the inconsistency of these parameters can reflect spectral diversity and complexity. We have chosen 310 Swift bursts with well-measured X-ray afterglows to analyze the distributions of their peak energies and hardness ratios before and after absorption of neutral hydrogen. We categorize them into four types according to X-ray temporal patterns and calculate the hardness ratios of both γ-rays and X-rays. It is found that the hardness ratios of X-rays are systematically smaller than those of γ-rays. We also find that both γ-ray hardness ratios and peak energies of bursts of types I, II, and III are identically distributed and are significantly lower than the corresponding measurements of type IV bursts in statistics, which hints that the evolving spectra of type IV bursts are most probably affected by the geometry of outflows. This proves that the influence of neutral hydrogen absorption on the estimation of hardness ratio is negligible even though it can reduce the brightness of γ/X-rays somewhat. Furthermore, we verify that almost all the observed spectra of gamma-ray bursts can be described by a broken power-law function and confirm a magnetar origin for the bursts with internal X-ray plateaus.

<br />
通过APEX对G34进行观测，发现了大尺度的、与细丝对齐的速度梯度，驱动了气体向G34中部岭的密集块体内的细丝状气体流入。这些流入是由重力控制的。同时，通过其他线的观测，还确认了MM2、MM4和MM5三个岭的气体内存在块体尺度的气体流入。这些岭的气体流入速率可能取决于大尺度细丝状气体的流入，因为这两个尺度上的流入速率是可比的。总结:
<br />
HMSF是一个多尺度的动态过程，由大尺度的细丝状气体流入驱动，而细丝内部的气体流入现象也得到了确认。整个过程可能受到重力和来自多种来源的湍流的影响。 <div>
There is growing evidence that high-mass star formation (HMSF) is a multiscale, dynamical process in molecular clouds, where filaments transport gas material between larger and smaller scales. We analyze here multiscale gas dynamics in an HMSF filamentary cloud, G034.43+00.24 (G34), using APEX observations of the C18O (2−1), HCO+/H13CO+ (3−2), and HCN/H13CN (3−2) lines. We find large-scale, filament-aligned velocity gradients from C18O emission, which drive filamentary gas inflows onto dense clumps in the middle ridge of G34. The nature of these inflows is gravity driven. We also find clump-scale gas infall in the middle ridge of the MM2, MM4, and MM5 clumps from other lines. Their gas infall rates could depend on large-scale filamentary gas inflows since the infall/inflow rates on these two scales are comparable. We confirm that the multiscale, dynamical HMSF scenario is at work in G34. It could be driven by gravity up to the filament scale, beyond which turbulence originating from several sources, including gravity, could be in effect in G34.

<div> 黑洞，中子星，超Eddington质量转移，高能中微子，超新鲜<br />
总结:
这篇文章讨论了由进化后主序星到黑洞或中子星伴星的超Eddington质量转移所引起的超星云膨胀，以及产生高能中微子的可能机制。研究指出，一些快速无线电暴（FRB）可能由这种短暂的喷射式超Eddington质量转移引擎驱动。根据模型计算，这些超新鲜可能产生的中微子排放量可以解释IceCube观测到的高能中微子弥散背景流的约25％，并且其时间平均中微子谱也与观测到的中微子谱相吻合。此外，这些超新鲜产生的中微子排放可能可延伸至>100 PeV，可以被未来的超高能中微子观测站所探测到。另外，超新鲜内的光学厚度会阻碍GeV–PeV能区的伽马射线逃逸，使得这些中微子源辐射的伽马射线相对较弱，与Fermi对各向同性伽马射线背景的观测结果相符。 <div>
Hypernebulae are inflated by accretion-powered winds accompanying hyper-Eddington mass transfer from an evolved post-main-sequence star onto a black hole or neutron star companion. The ions accelerated at the termination shock—where the collimated fast disk winds and/or jet collide with the slower, wide-angled wind-fed shell—can generate high-energy neutrinos via hadronic proton–proton reactions, and photohadronic (pγ) interactions with the disk thermal and Comptonized nonthermal background photons. It has been suggested that some fast radio bursts (FRBs) may be powered by such short-lived jetted hyper-accreting engines. Although neutrino emission associated with the millisecond duration bursts themselves is challenging to detect, the persistent radio counterparts of some FRB sources—if associated with hypernebulae—could contribute to the high-energy neutrino diffuse background flux. If the hypernebula birth rate follows that of stellar-merger transients and common envelope events, we find that their volume-integrated neutrino emission—depending on the population-averaged mass-transfer rates—could explain up to ∼25% of the high-energy diffuse neutrino flux observed by the IceCube Observatory and the Baikal Gigaton Volume Detector Telescope. The time-averaged neutrino spectrum from hypernebula—depending on the population parameters—can also reproduce the observed diffuse neutrino spectrum. The neutrino emission could in some cases furthermore extend to &gt;100 PeV, detectable by future ultra-high-energy neutrino observatories. The large optical depth through the nebula to Breit–Wheeler (γγ) interaction attenuates the escape of GeV–PeV gamma rays coproduced with the neutrinos, rendering these gamma-ray-faint neutrino sources, consistent with the Fermi observations of the isotropic gamma-ray background.

<div> 关键词: G106.3+2.7, 脉冲星风星云, gamma射线, 磁场, 多波段研究<br />
总结: <br />
G106.3+2.7被认为是一个复合超新星遗迹，具有类似回旋镖形状的脉冲星风星云和无线电波段的两个不同区域（“头”和“尾”）。最近在尾部发现了超高能量的γ射线发射，这表明G106.3+2.7是PeVatron候选星. 通过使用存档的无线电和Chandra数据，以及2020年的新NuSTAR X射线观测结果，我们对脉冲星J2229+6114周围100″范围内的Boomerang PWN进行了全面的多波段研究。 NuSTAR观测结果显示了脉冲星PSR J2229+6114的51.67毫秒自转周期和PWN辐射的能量谱，该辐射呈幂律模型，Γ值为1.52±0.06，直到20keV。与Kothes等人以前的无线电研究不同，根据（1）过去20年来X射线流量的稳定性，（2）脉冲星风星云的能量依赖性X射线尺寸和（3）多波段光谱能谱数据，我们更倾向于较低的PWN磁场（B∼3μG）和较大的距离（d∼8kpc）。我们的光谱能谱模型表明，脉冲星风星云目前正在被超新星逆冲击压缩，大约在1000年前被压缩。在这种情况下，头部区域应该是由早期被脉冲星注入的GeV-TeV电子形成，这些电子正在向低密度环境传播。 <div>
G106.3+2.7, commonly considered to be a composite supernova remnant (SNR), is characterized by a boomerang-shaped pulsar wind nebula (PWN) and two distinct (“head” and “tail”) regions in the radio band. A discovery of very-high-energy gamma-ray emission (Eγ &gt; 100 GeV) followed by the recent detection of ultrahigh-energy gamma-ray emission (Eγ &gt; 100 TeV) from the tail region suggests that G106.3+2.7 is a PeVatron candidate. We present a comprehensive multiwavelength study of the Boomerang PWN (100″ around PSR J2229+6114) using archival radio and Chandra data obtained two decades ago, a new NuSTAR X-ray observation from 2020, and upper limits on gamma-ray fluxes obtained by Fermi-LAT and VERITAS observatories. The NuSTAR observation allowed us to detect a 51.67 ms spin period from the pulsar PSR J2229+6114 and the PWN emission characterized by a power-law model with Γ = 1.52 ± 0.06 up to 20 keV. Contrary to the previous radio study by Kothes et al., we prefer a much lower PWN B-field (B ∼ 3 μG) and larger distance (d ∼ 8 kpc) based on (1) the nonvarying X-ray flux over the last two decades, (2) the energy-dependent X-ray size of the PWN resulting from synchrotron burn-off, and (3) the multiwavelength spectral energy distribution (SED) data. Our SED model suggests that the PWN is currently re-expanding after being compressed by the SNR reverse shock ∼1000 yr ago. In this case, the head region should be formed by GeV–TeV electrons injected earlier by the pulsar propagating into the low-density environment.

We present the stellar mass–stellar metallicity relation for 3491 star-forming galaxies at 2 ≲ z ≲ 3 using rest-frame far-ultraviolet spectra from the Lyα Tomography IMACS Survey (LATIS). We fit stellar population synthesis models from the Binary Population And Spectral Synthesis code (v2.2.1) to medium-resolution (R ∼ 1000) and high signal-to-noise (&gt;30 per 100 km s−1 over the wavelength range 1221–1800 Å) composite spectra of galaxies in bins of stellar mass to determine their stellar metallicity, primarily tracing Fe/H. We find a strong correlation between stellar mass and stellar metallicity, with stellar metallicity monotonically increasing with stellar mass at low masses and flattening at high masses (M* ≳ 1010.3M⊙). Additionally, we compare our stellar metallicity measurements with the gas-phase oxygen abundance of galaxies at similar redshift and estimate the average [α/Fe] ∼ 0.6. Such high α-enhancement indicates that high-redshift galaxies have not yet undergone significant iron enrichment through Type Ia supernovae. Moreover, we utilize an analytic chemical evolution model to constrain the mass loading parameter of galactic winds as a function of stellar mass. We find that as the stellar mass increases, the mass loading parameter decreases. The parameter then flattens or reaches a turning point at around M* ∼ 1010.5M⊙. Our findings may signal the onset of black-hole-driven outflows at z ∼ 2.5 for galaxies with M* ≳ 1010.5 M⊙.

<div> Hubble Space Telescope, ground-based surveys, progenitor detection, Legacy Survey of Space and Time, supernova

总结:<br />
本文探讨了使用地面广域调查数据来增加核心坍缩超新星（SN）前体星探测率的可能性。研究发现，通过结合前SN和晚期图像来搜索前体星的消失可以提高检测率。通过对ZTF数据进行搜索验证了这一概念。然后，通过模拟近距离SN的种群估算了Vera C. Rubin望远镜的LSST的前体探测率。研究还指出，亮宿主星系的背景会降低LSST灵敏度，预计在10年的调查中将检测到大约50个红超巨前体星和数个黄色和蓝色超巨前体星。此外，预计还将检测数百个前SN暴发。 <div>
The direct detection of core-collapse supernova (SN) progenitor stars is a powerful way of probing the last stages of stellar evolution. However, detections in archival Hubble Space Telescope images are limited to about one detection per year. Here, we explore whether we can increase the detection rate by using data from ground-based wide-field surveys. Due to crowding and atmospheric blurring, progenitor stars can typically not be identified in preexplosion images alone. Instead, we combine many pre-SN and late-time images to search for the disappearance of the progenitor star. As a proof of concept, we implement our search of ZTF data. For a few hundred images, we achieve limiting magnitudes of ∼23 mag in the g and r bands. However, no progenitor stars or long-lived outbursts are detected for 29 SNe within z ≤ 0.01, and the ZTF limits are typically several magnitudes less constraining than detected progenitors in the literature. Next, we estimate progenitor detection rates for the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) with the Vera C. Rubin telescope by simulating a population of nearby SNe. The background from bright host galaxies reduces the nominal LSST sensitivity by, on average, 0.4 mag. Over the 10 yr survey, we expect the detection of ∼50 red supergiant progenitors and several yellow and blue supergiants. The progenitors of Type Ib and Ic SNe will be detectable if they are brighter than −4.7 or −4.0 mag in the LSST i band, respectively. In addition, we expect the detection of hundreds of pre-SN outbursts depending on their brightness and duration.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了DECaLS剪切目录中的不同参数与斯隆数字化天文巡天中心星系的哈洛质量（Mh）之间的关系。结果表明，这些参数与Mh存在强烈的正相关关系，其中包括星际质量（M*）、星等离散度（σ*）、丰度匹配哈洛质量（MAM）和卫星速度离散度（σs）。Mh-M*和Mh-σ*的关系与星系团的丰度密切相关，而Mh-MAM和Mh-σs的关系则独立于此。研究还表明，σs是其中最佳的代理参数。此外，通过组合M*、σ*和MAM构建新的代理参数，可以最小化对丰度密度和星际发射率的依赖。最后，研究还探讨了Mh-超大质量黑洞（SMBH）质量的关系，并发现了SMBH快速线性生长阶段的迹象。同时发现Mh、M*和σ*之间的关联随着M*的变化而变化，表明不同的过程推动了星系和SMBH在不同阶段的生长。 <div>
Based on the DECaLS shear catalog, we study the scaling relations between halo mass (Mh) and various proxies for Sloan Digital Sky Survey central galaxies, including stellar mass (M*), stellar velocity dispersion (σ*), abundance-matching halo mass (MAM), and satellite velocity dispersion (σs), and their dependencies on galaxy and group properties. In general, these proxies all have strong positive correlations with Mh, consistent with previous studies. We find that the Mh–M* and Mh–σ* relations depend strongly on group richness (Nsat), while the Mh–MAM and Mh–σs relations are independent of it. Moreover, the dependence on the star formation rate (SFR) is rather weak in the Mh–σ* and Mh–σs relations, but very prominent in the other two. σs is thus the best proxy among them, and its scaling relation is in good agreement with hydrodynamical simulations. However, estimating σs accurately for individual groups/clusters is challenging because of interlopers and the requirement for sufficient satellites. We construct new proxies by combining M*, σ*, and MAM, and find that the proxy with 30% contribution from MAM and 70% from σ* can minimize the dependence on Nsat and the SFR. We obtain the Mh–supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass relation via the SMBH scaling relation and find indications for rapid and linear growth phases for the SMBH. We also find that correlations among Mh, M*, and σ* change with M*, indicating that different processes drive the growth of galaxies and SMBHs at different stages.

总结:
核心坍缩超新星（CCSNe）的一些案例显示在爆炸几年内的双峰射电光度曲线。研究人员提出了一种新的机制来解释这种现象，即在同步辐射光谱能量分布的进化模型中引入快速和慢速冷却阶段，从而在观测频率下系统变得对同步辐射自吸收。当快速冷却转变为慢速冷却阶段时，射电光度曲线就会呈现双峰特征。研究人员还提出SN 2007bg作为这种双峰射电超新星的特例，并建议该模型可能成为评估超新星中电子加速特性的潜在手段。  <br /><br /> <div>
It is recognized that some core-collapse supernovae (SNe) show a double-peaked radio light curve within a few years since the explosion. A shell of circumstellar medium (CSM) detached from the SN progenitor has been considered to play a viable role in characterizing such a rebrightening of radio emission. Here, we propose another mechanism that can give rise to the double-peaked radio light curve in core-collapse SNe. The key ingredient in the present work is to expand the model for the evolution of the synchrotron spectral energy distribution (SED) to a generic form, including fast and slow cooling regimes, as guided by the widely accepted modeling scheme of gamma-ray burst afterglows. We show that even without introducing an additional CSM shell, the radio light curve would show a double-peaked morphology when the system becomes optically thin to synchrotron self-absorption at the observational frequency during the fast cooling regime. We can observe this double-peaked feature if the transition from the fast cooling to slow cooling regime occurs during the typical observational timescale of SNe. This situation is realized when the minimum Lorentz factor of injected electrons is initially large enough for the nonthermal electrons’ SED to be discrete from the thermal distribution. We propose SN 2007bg as a special case of double-peaked radio SNe that can be possibly explained by the presented scenario. Our model can serve as a potential diagnostic for electron acceleration properties in SNe.

TDEs在后星暴星系中过度表示；重新审视TDE率；包括AGN盘的演变；TDE率在AGN转为非活跃阶段时显著增强；解释TDE在后星暴星系中过度表示的原因。
<br /><br />总结:
TDEs在后星爆星系中过度表示，通过重新审视TDE率并考虑AGN盘的演变，发现TDE率在AGN转为非活跃阶段时会显著增强约2个数量级，这提供了对于TDE在后星爆星系中过度表示的解释。 <div>
Tidal disruption events (TDEs) provide a valuable probe for studying the dynamics of stars in the nuclear environments of galaxies. Recent observations show that TDEs are strongly overrepresented in post-starburst or “green valley” galaxies, although the underlying physical mechanism remains unclear. Considering the possible interaction between stars and active galactic nucleus (AGN) disks, the TDE rates can be greatly changed compared to those in quiescent galactic nuclei. In this work, we revisit TDE rates by incorporating an evolving AGN disk within the framework of “loss cone” theory. We numerically evolve the Fokker–Planck equations by considering star–disk interactions, in situ star formation in the unstable region of the outer AGN disk, and evolution of the accretion process of supermassive black holes. We find that the TDE rates are enhanced by about 2 orders of magnitude shortly after the AGN transitions into an inactive stage. During this phase, the accumulated stars rapidly scatter into the loss cone due to the disappearance of the inner standard thin disk. Our results provide an explanation for the overrepresentation of TDEs in post-starburst galaxies.

Recent observations of Her X-1 with NuSTAR (as well as with INTEGRAL, Swift, and Astrosat) have provided evidence that the nearly 20 yr-long decay of the cyclotron line energy since ∼1994 has ended and that a stable value has replaced the decay. Using the observations of the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (Insight-HXMT) performed between 2017 July and 2020 February, we analyze the spectra of Her X-1 in its main-on state, focusing on tracing the evolution of cyclotron line energy. While our analysis of eight main-on observations with Insight-HXMT (two in coordination with NuSTAR) shows significant differences with the results of NuSTAR, two earlier findings are confirmed: the positive correlation between the cyclotron line energy and the X-ray flux (source luminosity) and the constancy of the flux-normalized cyclotron line energy during 2017–2020—albeit with significant uncertainty about the absolute value.

<div> T Tauri stars, disk evolution, planet formation, accretion, stellar mass
<br /><br />总结:
这项研究研究了T Tauri恒星的盘演化时间尺度及其与吸积的关系。通过对数据的分析，发现了1077颗盘载T Tauri恒星候选者，其中有783颗新分类为传统T Tauri恒星或弱线T Tauri恒星。研究发现，M<0.35M☉的TTS在大约0.1百万年内就失去了它们的盘，而M>0.35M☉的TTS几乎所有盘都能存活超过0.1百万年，大部分能存活1百万年甚至20百万年。此外，发现了随着年龄增长，全盘TTSs与吸积TTSs的比例都呈现下降趋势，确认了全盘TTSs和吸积对非全盘TTSs的演化速度更快。最后，研究还发现较低质量恒星的吸积比率普遍低于较高质量恒星，确认了吸积与恒星质量的依赖关系。 <div>
The full disk, full of gas and dust, determines the upper limit of planet masses, and its lifetime is critical for planet formation, especially for giant planets. In this work, we studied the evolutionary timescales of the full disks of T Tauri stars (TTSs) and their relations to accretion. Combined with Gaia EDR3, Two Micron All Sky Survey, and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer data, 1077 disk-bearing TTS candidates were found in LAMOST DR8, and stellar parameters were obtained. Among them, 783 are newly classified by spectra as classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs; 169) or weak-lined T Tauri stars (WTTSs). Based on EW and FWHM of Hα, 157 TTSs in accretion were identified, with ∼82% also having full disks. For TTSs with M &lt; 0.35M☉, about 80% seem to already lose their full disks at ∼0.1 Myr, which may explain their lower mass, while the remaining 20% with full disks evolve at similar rates of non-full disks within 5 Myr, allowing enough time and material to form giant planets. The fraction of accreting TTSs to disk-bearing TTSs is stable at ∼10% and can last ∼5–10 Myr, suggesting that full disks and accretion evolve with similar rates as non-full disks. For TTSs with M &gt; 0.35 M☉, almost all full disks can survive more than 0.1 Myr, most for 1 Myr and some even for 20 Myr. For TTSs with M &gt; 0.35 M☉, almost all full disks can survive more than 0.1 Myr, most for 1 Myr, and some even for 20 Myr, which implies planets are more likely to be formed in their disks than those of M &lt; 0.35 M☉, and thus M dwarfs with M &gt; 0.35 M☉ can have more planets. The fraction of full-disk TTSs to disk-bearing TTSs decreases with age following the relation f ∝ t−0.35, and similar relations existed in the fraction of accreting TTSs and the fraction of full-disk CTTSs, suggesting faster full disks and accretion evolution than non-full disks. For full-disk stars, the ratio of accretion of lower-mass stars is systematically lower than that of higher-mass stars, confirming the dependence of accretion on stellar mass, which may be reflective of an observational bias in the detection of accretion levels, with the lower-mass stars crossing below the detection threshold earlier than higher-mass stars.

Supermassive primordial stars with masses exceeding ∼105M⊙ that form in atomically cooled halos are the leading candidates for the origin of high-redshift quasars at z &gt; 6. Recent numerical simulations, however, find that multiple accretion disks can form within a halo, each of which can potentially host a supermassive star. We investigate the formation and evolution of secondary supermassive stars in atomically cooled halos, including strong variations in their accretion histories driven by gravitational interactions between their disks and those surrounding the primary supermassive stars in each halo. We find that all secondary disks produce long-lived supermassive stars under sustained rapid accretion. We also find, however, that the majority of secondary supermassive stars do undergo at least one protracted quiescent accretion phase, during which time they thermally relax and may become powerful sources of ionizing feedback. In many halos, the two satellite disks collide, suggesting that the two stars can come into close proximity. This may induce additional mass exchange between them, leading to a great diversity of possible outcomes. These range from coevolution as main-sequence stars to main sequence—black hole pairs and black hole—black hole mergers. We discuss the likely outcome for these binary interactions based on the evolutionary state of both supermassive stars at the end of our simulations, as well as prospects for their future detection by current and next-generation facilities.

Measuring the coverage of dark spots on cool stars is important to understanding how stellar magnetic activity scales with the rotation rate and convection zone depth. In this respect, it is crucial to infer surface magnetic patterns on G and K stars, to reveal solar-like stellar dynamos in action. Molecular bands serve as invaluable indicators of cool spots on the surfaces of stars, as they play a crucial role in enabling accurate assessments of the extent of spot coverage across the stellar surface. Therefore, more reliable surface images can be obtained considering the inversion of atomic lines with molecular bands. In this context, we simultaneously carry out Doppler imaging (DI) using atomic lines as well as titanium oxide band profiles of PW And (K2 V) and also investigate chromospheric activity indicators for the first time in the literature, using high-resolution spectra. The surface spot distribution obtained from the inversion process represents both atomic line and TiO-band profiles quite accurately. The chromospheric emission is also correlated with photospheric spot coverage, except during a possible flare event during the observations. We detect frequent flare activity, using TESS photometry. We also introduce a new open-source, Python-based DI code SpotDIPy that allows performing surface reconstructions of single stars using the maximum entropy method. We test the code by comparing surface reconstruction simulations with the extensively used DoTS code. We show that the surface brightness distribution maps reconstructed via both codes using the same simulated data are consistent with each other.

总结:
该研究探讨了高斯过程（GPs）作为一种机器学习算法在重建哈勃参数H(z)方面的前景，考虑了即将到来的引力波观测任务eLISA和Einstein Telescope。研究假设了各种宇宙学背景模型，并利用实际生成的目录，非参数地利用GPs重建了Hubble参数。研究重点讨论了早期和晚期先验对H(z)重建的影响，进而对哈勃常数（H0）的影响。分析表明，GPs在特定任务的观测窗口内对宇宙膨胀历史的重建是相当稳健的。该研究进一步证实，eLISA和ET都能够提供对H(z)和H0的约束，这些约束与当前数据集的推断相竞争。特别地，研究发现，eLISA大约持续10年，观测到大约80个明亮的引力波事件时，将能够像大约持续3年的ET运行观测大约1000个明亮的引力波事件一样准确地约束H0。预计，在更长的eLISA任务持续时间（例如大约15年，有大约120个事件）内，精确度会有进一步提高。最后，针对每个模型，讨论了这些未来的引力波观测任务在解决哈勃张力中可能发挥的作用。 <br /><br /> <div>
We study the prospects of Gaussian processes (GPs), a machine-learning (ML) algorithm, as a tool to reconstruct the Hubble parameter H(z) with two upcoming gravitational-wave (GW) missions, namely, the evolved Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (eLISA) and the Einstein Telescope (ET). Assuming various background cosmological models, the Hubble parameter has been reconstructed in a nonparametric manner with the help of a GP using realistically generated catalogs for each mission. The effects of early-time and late-time priors on the reconstruction of H(z), and hence on the Hubble constant (H0), have also been focused on separately. Our analysis reveals that a GP is quite robust in reconstructing the expansion history of the Universe within the observational window of the specific missions under consideration. We further confirm that both eLISA and ET would be able to provide constraints on H(z) and H0, which would be competitive to those inferred from current data sets. In particular, we observe that an eLISA run of a ∼10 yr duration with ∼80 detected bright siren events would be able to constrain H0 as precisely as a ∼3 yr ET run assuming ∼1000 bright siren event detections. Further improvement in precision is expected for longer eLISA mission durations such as a ∼15 yr time frame having ∼120 events. Lastly, we discuss the possible role of these future GW missions in addressing the Hubble tension, for each model, on a case-by-case basis.

The vast majority of stars in the nearby stellar neighborhood are M dwarfs. Their low masses and luminosities result in slow rates of nuclear evolution and minimal changes to the stars’ observable properties, even along astronomical timescales. However, they possess relatively powerful magnetic dynamos and resulting X-ray to UV (X–UV) activity, compared to their bolometric luminosities. This magnetic activity does undergo an observable decline over time, potentially making it a key age determinant for M dwarfs. Observing this activity is important for studying the outer atmospheres of these stars, but also for comparing the behaviors of different spectral type subsets of M dwarfs; e.g., those with partially versus fully convective interiors. Beyond stellar astrophysics, understanding the X–UV activity of M dwarfs over time is a key component when studying the atmospheres and habitability of any hosted exoplanets. Earth-sized exoplanets, in particular, are more commonly found orbiting M dwarfs than any other stellar type, and thermal escape (driven by the M dwarf X–UV activity) is believed to be the dominant atmospheric loss mechanism for these planets. Utilizing recently calibrated M dwarf age–rotation relationships, also constructed as part of the Living with a Red Dwarf program, we have analyzed the evolution of M dwarf activity over time, in terms of coronal (X-ray), chromospheric (Lyα, and Ca ii), and overall X–UV (5–1700 Å) emissions. The activity–age relationships presented here will be useful for studying exoplanet habitability and atmospheric loss, and also for studying the different dynamo and outer atmospheric heating mechanisms at work in M dwarfs.

Previous numerical simulations of double-peaked Type IIb supernova (SN IIb) light curves have demonstrated that the radius and mass of the hydrogen-rich envelope of the progenitor star can significantly influence the brightness and timescale of the early-time light curve around the first peak. In this study, we investigate how Thomson scattering and chemical mixing in the SN ejecta affect the optical light curves during the early stages of the SNe IIb using radiation hydrodynamics simulations. By comparing the results from two different numerical codes (i.e., STELLA and SNEC), we find that the optical brightness of the first peak can be reduced by more than a factor of 3 as a result of the effect of Thomson scattering that causes the thermalization depth to be located below the Rosseland mean photosphere, compared to the corresponding case where this effect is ignored. We also observe a short-lived plateau-like feature lasting for a few days in the early-time optical light curves of our models, in contrast to typical observed SNe IIb that show a quasi-linear decrease in optical magnitudes after the first peak. A significant degree of chemical mixing between the hydrogen-rich envelope and the helium core in SN ejecta is required to reconcile this discrepancy between the model prediction and observation. Meanwhile, to properly reproduce the first peak, a significant mixing of 56Ni into the hydrogen-rich outermost layers should be restricted. Our findings indicate that inferring the SN IIb progenitor structure from a simplified approach that ignores these two factors may introduce substantial uncertainty.

Starting from the fully compressible fluid equations in a plane-parallel atmosphere, we demonstrate that linear internal gravity waves are naturally pseudo-incompressible in the limit that the wave frequency ω is much less than that of surface gravity waves, i.e., \omega \ll \sqrt{{{gk}}_{h}}, where g is the gravitational acceleration and kh is the horizontal wavenumber. We accomplish this by performing a formal expansion of the wave functions and the local dispersion relation in terms of a dimensionless frequency \varepsilon =\omega /\sqrt{{{gk}}_{h}}. Further, we show that, in this same low-frequency limit, several forms of the anelastic approximation, including the Lantz–Braginsky–Roberts formulation, poorly reproduce the correct behavior of internal gravity waves. The pseudo-incompressible approximation is achieved by assuming that Eulerian fluctuations of the pressure are small in the continuity equation—whereas, in the anelastic approximation, Eulerian density fluctuations are ignored. In an adiabatic stratification, such as occurs in a convection zone, the two approximations become identical. However, in a stable stratification, the differences between the two approximations are stark and only the pseudo-incompressible approximation remains valid.

总结：<br /><br />这篇论文利用JWST/NIRSpec采集的光谱数据独立确认了16个红移为z=8.61-11.40的星系，并且发现了一个z=4.91的明亮干扰物。结合文献中的其他9个星系，共确认了25个星系，使用这些数据得出了紫外光度函数的确定性和下限，显示出对z∼12有轻微的红移演化。同时也得出了宇宙星系形成率密度的下限，证实了z∼12存在高星系形成率密度，支持了之前的光度研究结果。此外，作者还提出了一些观测策略，以有效地排除未来JWST项目中的低红移干扰因素。 <div>
We present pure spectroscopic constraints on the UV luminosity functions and cosmic star formation rate (SFR) densities from 25 galaxies at zspec = 8.61–13.20. By reducing the JWST/NIRSpec spectra taken in multiple programs of Early Release Observation, Early Release Science, General Observer, and Director’s Discretionary Time observations with our analysis technique, we independently confirm 16 galaxies at zspec = 8.61–11.40, including new redshift determinations, and a bright interloper at zspec = 4.91 that was claimed as a photometric candidate at z ∼ 16. In conjunction with nine galaxies at redshifts up to zspec = 13.20 in the literature, we make a sample of 25 spectroscopically confirmed galaxies in total and carefully derive the best estimates and lower limits of the UV luminosity functions. These UV luminosity function constraints are consistent with the previous photometric estimates within the uncertainties and indicate mild redshift evolution toward z ∼ 12, showing tensions with some theoretical models of rapid evolution. With these spectroscopic constraints, we obtain firm lower limits of the cosmic SFR densities and spectroscopically confirm a high SFR density at z ∼ 12 beyond the constant star formation efficiency models, which supports earlier claims from the photometric studies. While there are no spectroscopically confirmed galaxies with very large stellar masses violating the ΛCDM model due to the removal of the bright interloper, we confirm star-forming galaxies at zspec = 11–13 with stellar masses much higher than model predictions. Our results indicate possibilities of high star formation efficiency (&gt;5%), a hidden active galactic nucleus, a top-heavy initial mass function (possibly with Population III), and large scatter/variance. Having these successful and unsuccessful spectroscopy results, we suggest observational strategies for efficiently removing low-redshift interlopers for future JWST programs.

Binary black hole (BBH) systems detected via gravitational-wave emission are a recently opened astrophysical frontier with many unknowns and uncertainties. Accurate reconstruction of the binary distribution with as few assumptions as possible is desirable for inference of formation channels and environments. Most population analyses have, though, assumed a power law in binary mass ratio q, and/or assumed a universal q distribution regardless of primary mass. Methods based on kernel density estimation allow us to dispense with such assumptions and directly estimate the joint binary mass distribution. We deploy a self-consistent iterative method to estimate this full BBH mass distribution, finding local maxima in primary mass consistent with previous investigations and a secondary mass distribution with a partly independent structure, inconsistent both with a power law and with a constant function of q. We find a weaker preference for near-equal-mass binaries than in most previous investigations; instead, the secondary mass has its own “spectral lines” at slightly lower values than the primary, and we observe an anticorrelation between primary and secondary masses around the ∼10 M⊙ peak.
