<div> ULIRGs, SED modeling, CIGALE, starburst galaxies, radio spectra
<br>总结:
本研究利用CIGALE和UltraNest对14个本地超亮红外星系（ULIRG）的光谱能量分布进行了建模分析，同时讨论了25个星暴星系的全球天体物理性质。研究发现，总和非热的1.4和4.8 GHz射电辐射可以很好地估计最近的SFR，而4.8 GHz的热射电辐射是最近星形成的更好的迹象。此外，热射电辐射的4.8 GHz比1.4 GHz对最近的星形成更敏感。文章还指出，建模的非热射电谱指数与红移、恒星质量、SFR、特定SFR和尘埃质量之间没有明显相关性。 <div>
We present detailed spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling of 14 local ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) with outstanding photometric data from the literature covering the ultraviolet–infrared (FIR) and radio bands (∼50 MHz to ∼30 GHz). We employ the CIGALE SED fitting code to model the ultraviolet–FIR–radio SED. For the radio-only SED modeling, we use the UltraNest package, leveraging its nested sampling algorithm. Combining the results from our previous study on 11 luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs), we discuss the global astrophysical properties of a sample of 25 starburst galaxies (z < 0.5). Their radio spectra are frequently characterized by bends and turnovers, with no indication of ULIRGs exhibiting more complicated SEDs than LIRGs despite showing more signs of interactions. Including radio measurements in the CIGALE modeling constrained the dust luminosity and star formation rate (SFR) estimates by more than 1 order of magnitude better than previously reported for starburst galaxies. We show that total and nonthermal radio luminosity at 1.4 and 4.8 GHz frequencies can be good estimators of recent SFRs for all LIRGs and those ULIRGS with an insignificant influence of active galactic nuclei. A weaker but still significant correlation is observed between radio SFRs at 1.4 GHz and old (averaged over 100 Myr) SFRs based on SED modeling, indicative of multiple episodes of starburst activity during their lifetime. The thermal radio luminosity at 4.8 GHz is a better tracer of recent star formation than the thermal luminosity at 1.4 GHz. Statistically, our modeled nonthermal radio spectral indices do not significantly correlate with redshift, stellar mass, SFR, specific SFR, and dust mass.

<div> 高角分辨率成像，ALMA，原行星盘，M型星，Taurus<br> 
总结:<br>
研究利用ALMA对Taurus中6颗M型星的盘进行了高分辨率观测，发现了盘的普遍性和多样性。所有六个盘中均探测到尘埃连续辐射，五个盘中探测到12CO，两个盘中探测到13CO。气尘盘尺寸比率范围从1.6到5.1不等。四个盘显示环和空洞，两个盘表面光滑。我们进行了辐射传递拟合，发现微米尺寸尘埃颗粒的空洞可能比毫米尺寸尘埃颗粒的空洞更小。目前，Taurus中的M型星盘显示出比早期星更高的空洞检测频率，尽管我们需要一个更完整的样本来评估子结构与恒星质量的依赖关系。 <div>
High angular resolution imaging by Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) has revealed the near universality and diversity of substructures in protoplanetary disks. However, disks around M-type pre-main-sequence stars are still poorly sampled, despite the prevalence of M dwarfs in the Galaxy. Here we present high-resolution (∼50 mas, 8 au) ALMA Band 6 observations of six disks around mid-M stars in Taurus. We detect dust continuum emission in all six disks, 12CO in five disks, and 13CO line in two disks. The size ratios between gas and dust disks range from 1.6 to 5.1. The ratio of about 5 for 2M0436 and 2M0450 indicates efficient dust radial drift. Four disks show rings and cavities, and two disks are smooth. The cavity sizes occupy a wide range: 60 au for 2M0412, and ∼10 au for 2M0434, 2M0436, and 2M0508. Detailed visibility modeling indicates that small cavities of 1.7 and 5.7 au may hide in the two smooth disks 2M0450 and CIDA 12. We perform radiative transfer fitting of the infrared spectral energy distributions to constrain the cavity sizes, finding that micron-sized dust grains may have smaller cavities than millimeter grains. Planet–disk interactions are the preferred explanation to produce the large 60 au cavity, while other physics could be responsible for the three ∼10 au cavities under current observations and theories. Currently, disks around mid- to late M stars in Taurus show a higher detection frequency of cavities than earlier-type stars, although a more complete sample is needed to evaluate any dependence of substructure on stellar mass.

总结:<br>
这篇论文对巴纳德星进行了详细的光谱分析，比较了加拿大-法国-夏威夷望远镜/SPIRou拍摄的高质量近红外光谱和PHOENIX-ACES恒星大气模型。作者发现观测光谱中有成千上万条模型中未识别的光谱线，同时也有大量观测数据中未出现在模型中的光谱线。文章讨论了连续体不匹配、未解决的污染和光谱线偏离预期波长的问题，并提出了新的方法用于确定恒星的有效温度和金属丰度。最终得出了巴纳德星的有效温度和15种元素的丰度，强调了需要改进当前的大气模型以充分利用近红外光谱进行化学光谱分析。 <div>
Determination of fundamental parameters of stars impacts all fields of astrophysics, from galaxy evolution to constraining the internal structure of exoplanets. This paper presents a detailed spectroscopic analysis of Barnard’s star (otherwise known as Gl 699) that compares an exceptionally high-quality (an average signal-to-noise ratio of ∼1000 in the entire domain), high-resolution near-infrared (NIR) spectrum taken with Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope/SPIRou to PHOENIX-ACES stellar atmosphere models. The observed spectrum shows thousands of lines not identified in the models with a similarly large number of lines present in the model but not in the observed data. We also identify several other caveats, such as continuum mismatch, unresolved contamination, and spectral lines significantly shifted from their expected wavelengths; all of these can be a source of bias for the determination of abundance. Out of >104 observed lines in the NIR that could be used for chemical spectroscopy, we identify a short list of a few hundred lines that are reliable. We present a novel method for determining the effective temperature (Teff) and overall metallicity of slowly rotating M dwarfs that uses several groups of lines as opposed to bulk spectral fitting methods. With this method, we infer Teff = 3231 ± 21 K for Barnard's star, consistent with the value of 3238 ± 11 K inferred from the interferometric method. We also provide measurements of the abundance of 15 different elements for Barnard's star, including the abundances of four elements (K, O, Y, Th) never reported before for this star. This work emphasizes the need to improve current atmosphere models to fully exploit the NIR domain for chemical spectroscopy analysis.

<div> 光学观测，M31N 2008-12a，喷发，超软X射线，Hα发射线<br>
2017–2022年间，我们对M31N 2008-12a经常性新星的喷发进行了光学、紫外和软X射线观测。我们在峰值附近的V和R波段光变曲线中发现了一个尖峰特征，可能与喷流有关。根据Hα发射线的形态动力学建模，我们推断新星喷发物质具有延展的双极喷流结构。光谱建模表明，每次喷发的喷射物质质量为10^-7–10^-8M⊙，并且含有增强的氦丰度。超软X射线源阶段显示出显著的变化，与紫外辐射呈反相关，表明二者可能有共同的起源。这种变化可能是由于吸积盘的重新形成。根据喷发间的复发周期，我们推断吸积速率稳步减少。将吸积速率与不同模型进行比较后，得出M31N 2008-12a的CO白矮星质量大于1.36M⊙，并随时间增长，使其成为Ia型超新星前体的单重变星场景的强有力候选者。<br><br>总结:本研究对M31N 2008-12a的喷发进行了多波段观测，并发现了喷流相关的特征。根据Hα发射线的形态动力学建模，推断出了新星喷发物质的双极喷流结构。光谱建模显示出喷发物质的质量和氦丰度的增强。此外，超软X射线源阶段表现出显著的变化，并与紫外辐射呈现反相关关系，推测这种变化可能是由于吸积盘的重新形成。研究还推断出吸积速率稳步减少，并得出M31N 2008-12a的CO白矮星质量大于1.36M⊙，这使其成为Ia型超新星前体的单重变星场景的强有力候选者。 <div>
We report the optical, UV, and soft X-ray observations of the 2017–2022 eruptions of the recurrent nova M31N 2008-12a. We find a cusp feature in the - and -band light curves close to the peak, which could be related to jets. The geometry of the nova ejecta based on morpho-kinematic modeling of the Hα emission line indicates an extended jet-like bipolar structure. Spectral modeling indicates an ejecta mass of 10−7–10−8M⊙ during each eruption and an enhanced helium abundance. The supersoft source phase shows significant variability, which is anticorrelated to the UV emission, indicating a common origin. The variability could be due to the reformation of the accretion disk. We infer a steady decrease in the accretion rate over the years based on the intereruption recurrence period. A comparison of the accretion rate with different models on the plane yields the mass of a CO white dwarf, powering the H-shell flashes every ∼1 yr, to be >1.36 M⊙ and growing with time, making M31N 2008-12a a strong candidate for the single degenerate scenario of the Type Ia supernovae progenitor.

总结:<br>
这篇文章介绍了磁场在星系中的重要性以及现有观测方法。通过对模拟星系进行合成观测，发现射电辐射和远红外偏振辐射可用来测量星系中磁场的性质，区分不同的介质相，并且发现射电辐射和远红外辐射对磁场的探测尺度不同。这些发现为未来的多波段极化观测提供了启示，有助于推动我们对星系外磁场的认识。 <div>
The structure of magnetic fields in galaxies remains poorly constrained, despite the importance of magnetism in the evolution of galaxies. Radio synchrotron and far-infrared (FIR) polarization and polarimetric observations are the best methods to measure galactic scale properties of magnetic fields in galaxies beyond the Milky Way. We use synthetic polarimetric observations of a simulated galaxy to identify and quantify the regions, scales, and interstellar medium (ISM) phases probed at FIR and radio wavelengths. Our studied suite of magnetohydrodynamical cosmological zoom-in simulations features high-resolutions (10 pc full-cell size) and multiple magnetization models. Our synthetic observations have a striking resemblance to those of observed galaxies. We find that the total and polarized radio emission extends to approximately double the altitude above the galactic disk (half-intensity disk thickness of hI radio ∼ hPI radio = 0.23 ± 0.03 kpc) relative to the total FIR and polarized emission that are concentrated in the disk midplane (hI FIR ∼ hPI FIR = 0.11 ± 0.01 kpc). Radio emission traces magnetic fields at scales of ≳300 pc, whereas FIR emission probes magnetic fields at the smallest scales of our simulations. These scales are comparable to our spatial resolution and well below the spatial resolution (<300 pc) of existing FIR polarimetric measurements. Finally, we confirm that synchrotron emission traces a combination of the warm neutral and cold neutral gas phases, whereas FIR emission follows the densest gas in the cold neutral phase in the simulation. These results are independent of the ISM magnetic field strength. The complementarity we measure between radio and FIR wavelengths motivates future multiwavelength polarimetric observations to advance our knowledge of extragalactic magnetism.

<div> 电子、太阳风、离散散射、Fokker–Planck方程、磁场聚焦
总结:
本研究探讨了离散散射机制对太阳风中超热电子群的影响，使用Fokker–Planck方程模拟了电子偏转角分布的径向演化过程，并与Solar Orbiter和Parker Solar Probe任务获取的数据进行了比较。研究发现，在模型中通过调整湍流平均自由程，可以与观测数据得到显著一致的稳态解。得到的平均自由程约为天文单位数量级，且在100 eV–1 keV能量范围内显示出较弱的依赖性。这与库仑碰撞估计值明显不同，但与低刚度太阳高能粒子事件观测的平均自由程相吻合。研究结果表明在整个日球层距离范围内都存在电子的湍流散射，由此得出了一些重要结论，包括在距离太阳较远的地方存在低库仑数区域，这为在所有距离上存在各向同性的“光晕”成分提供了自然解释——电子在这个遥远的区域内成为各向同性后再进入日球层内部。 <div>
This study explores the impact of a turbulent scattering mechanism, akin to those influencing solar and galactic cosmic rays propagating in the interplanetary medium, on the population of suprathermal electrons in the solar wind. We employ a Fokker–Planck equation to model the radial evolution of electron pitch angle distributions under the action of magnetic focusing, which moves the electrons away from isotropy, and of a diffusion process that tends to bring them back to it. We compare the steady-state solutions of this Fokker–Planck equation with data obtained from the Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe missions and find a remarkable agreement, varying the turbulent mean free path as the sole free parameter in our model. The obtained mean free paths are of the order of the astronomical unit, and display weak dependence on electron energy within the 100 eV–1 keV range. This value is notably lower than Coulomb collision estimates but aligns well with observed mean free paths of low-rigidity solar energetic particle events. The strong agreement between our model and observations leads us to conclude that the hypothesis of turbulent scattering at work on electrons at all heliospheric distances is justified. We discuss several implications, notably the existence of a low Knudsen number region at large distances from the Sun, which offers a natural explanation for the presence of an isotropic “halo” component at all distances from the Sun—electrons being isotropized in this distant region before traveling back into the inner part of the interplanetary medium.

<div> 关键词: CME, 太阳爆发, 磁流体力学, 等离子体, 太阳风
总结: <br /><br />这篇文章讨论了日冕物质抛射（CME）的早期演化及其启动机制。研究人员通过热磁流体力学模拟发现，CME的启动包含多个物理机制，并且这些机制密切相互联系。首先是由双曲线磁通管重联所引发并推动的缓慢上升。随后，缓慢上升由于双曲线磁通管重联和环不稳定性的早期发展共同推动而持续进行。最后，快速磁重联的开始和环不稳定性的发展引起了CME的即时加速。这些结果揭示了CME启动是一个复杂的过程，牵涉到多种物理机制，因此无法仅通过单一的启动机制加以解决。 <div>
Understanding the early evolution of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), in particular their initiation, is the key to forecasting solar eruptions and induced disastrous space weather. Although many initiation mechanisms have been proposed, a full understanding of CME initiation, which is identified as a slow rise of CME progenitors in kinematics before impulsive acceleration, remains elusive. Here, with a state-of-the-art thermal magnetohydrodynamics simulation, we determine a complete CME initiation route in which multiple mainstream mechanisms occur in sequence yet are tightly coupled. The slow rise is first triggered and driven by the developing hyperbolic flux tube (HFT) reconnection. Subsequently, the slow rise continues as driven by the coupling of the HFT reconnection and the early development of torus instability. The end of the slow rise, i.e., the onset of the impulsive acceleration, is induced by the start of the fast magnetic reconnection coupled with the torus instability. These results unveil that CME initiation is a complicated process involving multiple physical mechanisms, thus being hardly resolved by a single initiation mechanism.

在最近的观测中发现，即使是温度较低、中性大气的质量极低的恒星和棕矮星也能够维持强大的磁场。这些磁场的强度可达千高斯，这是基于强烈的、高循环偏振的太赫兹无线电发射推断出来的，这是电子回旋加倍不稳定性的后果。这些观测暗示存在与强电流系统相关的高能非热电子群，就像太阳系中受磁场影响的行星的极光区域一样。这些强烈的极光电子降积将导致电子与H2气体碰撞，从而产生离子。受此启发，我们瞄准了一组已知表现出极光特征的超冷矮星，使用Maunakea的Keck望远镜搜索K波段发射特征。从我们的九个目标中，我们在低到中分辨率光谱（R约3600）中没有发现明显的发射特征。我们还对棕矮星大气中极光电子束的影响进行了建模，确定了产生的在何深度沉积能量并驱动粒子碰撞电离。我们发现，典型能量≳2-10千电子伏特的电子束可以解释观测中的未检测到的情况，因为它们会深入大气中，任何产生的离子在通过其红外跃迁辐射能量之前都会被化学破坏。强电子束进一步解释了UV极光探测的缺失，并暗示大部分或几乎所有降积极光能量最终必须以热辐射形式从棕矮星深处大气中释放。<br /><br />总结: 最近的观测表明，即使是质量极低的恒星和棕矮星也能维持强磁场。这些磁场可能与极端非热电子群和极光相关。然而，在对一组超冷矮星进行的观测中，并没有发现相关的发射特征。模拟结果显示，电子束在大气中深处沉积能量，并进行粒子碰撞电离。未检测到的发射特征有可能是由于电子束产生的离子在通过红外跃迁辐射能量之前就被化学破坏了。强电子束进一步解释了UV极光探测的缺失，并暗示大部分或几乎所有极光能量最终以热辐射形式从大气中释放。 <div>
Recent observations have demonstrated that very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs are capable of sustaining strong magnetic fields despite their cool and neutral atmospheres. These kilogauss field strengths are inferred based on strong, highly circularly polarized gigahertz radio emission, a consequence of the electron cyclotron maser instability. Crucially, these observations imply the existence of energetic nonthermal electron populations, associated with strong current systems, as are found in the auroral regions of the magnetized planets of the solar system. Intense auroral electron precipitation will lead to electron collisions with the H2 gas that should generate the ion . With this motivation, we targeted a sample of ultracool dwarfs, known to exhibit signatures associated with aurorae, in search of the K-band emission features of using the Keck telescopes on Maunakea. From our sample of nine objects, we found no clear indication of emission features in our low-to-medium-resolution spectra (R ∼ 3600). We also modeled the impact of an auroral electron beam on a brown dwarf atmosphere, determining the depth at which energetic beams deposit their energy and drive particle impact ionization. We find that the nondetections can be explained by electron beams of typical energies ≳2–10 keV, which penetrate deeply enough that any produced is chemically destroyed before radiating energy through its infrared transitions. Strong electron beams could further explain the lack of UV auroral detections and suggest that most or nearly all of the precipitating auroral energy must ultimately emerge as thermal emissions deep in brown dwarf atmospheres.

总结:<br /><br />这项研究报告了对著名Seyfert-2型活动星系核（AGN）NGC 4388中窄Fe Kα线和反射谱的研究。利用两次NICER监测活动中的X射线光谱总和，分隔了数年，显示了直接连续谱和反射发射的显著变化，但遮挡气体的变化很小。对NICER观测得到的光谱的拟合发现，幂律光子指数Γ与直接流量之间存在强烈的正相关性，这在未遮挡的AGN中通常观察到。对直接和反射光谱之间的反响时滞的搜索显示，主要受窄Fe Kα发射线主导，测量出约为几天的时间尺度，或约为pc的特征半径。观察到了这种暂定滞后的一个循环，但这是由于直接连续谱的突然下降而导致的，随后窄Fe Kα线的显着消失。对NGC 4388的高分辨率Chandra光谱的物理拟合测量出一个线产生半径，与暂定滞后基本一致。线型特征还倾向于一个Compton厚反射体，表明其起源可能是在盘中和/或风中的厚团块内。我们讨论了分析的优缺点以及在未来观测中测试结果的方法，并指出X射线反响滞后可能用于约束不可见光学宽线区的被遮挡Seyferts中的黑洞质量。 <div>
We report on a study of the narrow Fe Kα line and reflection spectrum in the well-known Seyfert-2 active galactic nucleus (AGN), NGC 4388. X-ray spectra summed from two extensive NICER monitoring campaigns, separated by years, show strong evidence of variation in the direct continuum and reflected emission, but only small variations in the obscuring gas. Fits to the spectra from individual NICER observations find a strong, positive correlation between the power-law photon index, Γ, and direct flux that is commonly observed in unobscured AGN. A search for a reverberation lag between the direct and reflected spectra—dominated by the narrow Fe Kα emission line—measures a timescale of days, or a characteristic radius of pc . Only one cycle of this tentative lag is observed, but it is driven by a particularly sharp drop in the direct continuum that leads to the subsequent disappearance of the otherwise prominent Fe Kα line. Physically motivated fits to high-resolution Chandra spectra of NGC 4388 measure a line production radius of , formally consistent with the tentative lag. The line profile also prefers a Compton-thick reflector, indicating an origin in the disk and/or thick clumps within a wind. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of our analysis and methods for testing our results in future observations, and we note the potential for X-ray reverberation lags to constrain black hole masses in obscured Seyferts wherein the optical broad line region is not visible.

Recent measurements of carbon isotope ratios in both protoplanetary disks and exoplanet atmospheres have suggested a possible transfer of significant carbon isotope fractionation from disks to planets. For a clearer understanding of the isotopic link between disks and planets, it is important to measure the carbon isotope ratios in various species. In this paper, we present a detection of the 13CN N = 2 − 1 hyperfine lines in the TW Hya disk with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. This is the first spatially resolved detection of 13CN in disks, which enables us to measure the spatially resolved 12CN/13CN ratio for the first time. We conducted nonlocal thermal equilibrium modeling of the 13CN lines in conjunction with previously observed 12CN lines to derive the kinetic temperature, H2 volume density, and column densities of 12CN and 13CN. The H2 volume density is found to range between (4 − 10) × 107 cm−3, suggesting that CN molecules mainly reside in the disk's upper layer. The 12CN/13CN ratio is measured to be at 30 < r < 80 au from the central star, which is similar to the 12C/13C ratio in the interstellar medium. However, this value differs from the previously reported values found for other carbon-bearing molecules (CO and HCN) in the TW Hya disk. This could be self-consistently explained by different emission layer heights for different molecules combined with preferential sequestration of 12C into the solid phase toward the disk midplane. This study reveals the complexity of the carbon isotope fractionation operating in disks.

<div> 星体形成、分子云、ATLASGAL调查、紧凑配置、亚毫米阵列
总结:
星体形成区域的质量组装来源于分子云中的分层结构和不同尺度上的碎裂。本文使用亚毫米阵列的紧凑配置对ATLASGAL调查中选择的一系列不同演化状态的大质量团块的碎裂进行了研究。观测结果显示，在2″尺度或0.015-0.09 pc的物理尺度上，约60%的源显示出有限或无碎裂。还发现了几个例子，证明了亚毫米阵列检测到的核心与团块的潜在位置明显偏离，这表明初始碎裂并不会形成大量的朗格曼质量碎片。我们发现，团块中紧凑结构所占的质量分数随着源的演化而增加。还发现碎片的最大质量与母团块的辐射光度存在显著相关。这些发现表明，大质量星体形成通过团块供给的核心吸积进行，初始碎裂取决于团块的密度结构和/或磁场。 <div>
The mass assembly in star-forming regions arises from the hierarchical structure in molecular clouds in tandem with fragmentation at different scales. In this paper, we present a study of the fragmentation of massive clumps covering a range of evolutionary states, selected from the ATLASGAL survey, using the compact configuration of the Submillimeter Array. The observations reveal a wide diversity in the fragmentation properties with about 60% of the sources showing limited to no fragmentation at the 2″ scale, or a physical scale of 0.015–0.09 pc. We also find several examples where the cores detected with the Submillimeter Array are significantly offset from the clump potential, suggesting that initial fragmentation does not result in the formation of a large number of Jeans mass fragments. The fraction of the clump mass that is in compact structures is seen to increase with source evolution. We also see a significant correlation between the maximum mass of a fragment and the bolometric luminosity of the parent clump. These suggest that massive star formation proceeds through clump fed core accretion, with the initial fragmentation being dependent on the density structure of the clumps and/or magnetic fields.

<div> 关键词: 变异机制, ON 231, 光度曲线, 偏振度, X射线

总结: 
这项研究提出了一个解释ON 231不同变异现象的场景，其中喷流发射由闪耀和较不可变的组件组成，并且变异主要由激波引起，而非多普勒效应。他们对多波段光度曲线进行了相关性分析，并发现光学波段的ON 231出现了较明亮时较硬的趋势，偏振度和流量之间也有类似的关系。同时他们发现X射线发射由两个对数-抛物线函数描述的两个成分组成，可以量化地重现观察到的趋势转变。在伽玛射线波段，他们发现了对应的趋势，并认为这可以通过存在非常高能的伽马射线背景组件来解释。这项研究阐明了中间谱凝聚BL Lac天体的变异机制。 <div>
The variation mechanism of blazars is a long-standing unresolved problem. In this work, we present a scenario to explain diverse variation phenomena for ON 231, where the jet emissions are composed of the flaring and the less variable components (most probably from the post-flaring blobs), and the variation is dominated by shock-in-jet instead of the Doppler effect. We perform correlation analysis for the multiwavelength light curves and find no significant correlations. For the optical band, ON 231 exhibits a harder when brighter (HWB) trend, and the trend seems to shift at different periods. Correspondingly, the correlation between the degree of polarization and flux exhibits a V-shaped behavior, and a similar translation relation during different periods is also found. These phenomena could be understood via the superposition of the flaring component and slowly varying background component. We also find that the slopes of the HWB trend become smaller at higher flux levels, which indicates the energy-dependent acceleration processes of the radiative particles. For the X-ray band, we discover a trend transition from HWB to softer when brighter (SWB) to HWB. We consider that the X-ray emission is composed of both the synchrotron tail and the synchrotron self-Compton components, which could be described by two log-parabolic functions. By varying the peak frequency, we reproduce the observed trend transition in a quantitative manner. For the γ-ray band, we find the SWB trend, which could be explained naturally if a very-high-energy γ-ray background component exists. Our study elucidates the variation mechanism of intermediate synchrotron-peaked BL Lac objects.

该研究利用LAMOST DR9目录和GALEX UV档案数据研究了M型恒星的色球和紫外活动。色球和紫外活动指数显示了饱和和非饱和状态以及已知的活动-自转关系，与先前研究一致。FUV和NUV活动指数呈单峰分布，而Hα和Ca ii H&amp;K指数显示出明显的双峰分布。不同亚型的平滑分布表明早型（部分对流）到晚型（完全对流）M星的自转依赖型磁场。我们发现一群紫外活动高于饱和状态（log）但色球活动低的恒星，其原因尚不清楚。通过计算每颗恒星的持续宜居带和紫外宜居带，发现总样本中约70%的恒星和100光年内的40%的恒星位于这两个宜居带的重叠区，表明许多M型恒星具有潜在的宜居条件。最后，我们考察了利用中国空间站望远镜进行M型恒星的紫外活动研究的可能性。

M-type stars are crucial for stellar activity studies because they cover two types of magnetic dynamos and are particularly intriguing for habitability studies due to their abundance and long lifespans during the main-sequence stage. In this paper, we used the LAMOST DR9 catalog and the GALEX UV archive data to investigate the chromospheric and UV activities of M-type stars. All the chromospheric and UV activity indices clearly show that the saturated and unsaturated regimes, and the well-known activity–rotation relation, are consistent with previous studies. Both the FUV and NUV activity indices exhibit a single-peaked distribution, while the Hα and Ca ii H&amp;K indices show a distinct double-peaked distribution. The gap between these peaks suggests a rapid transition from a saturated population to an unsaturated one. The smoothly varying distributions of different subtypes suggest a rotation-dependent dynamo for both early-type (partly convective) to late-type (fully convective) M stars. We identified a group of stars with high UV activity above the saturation regime (log ) but low chromospheric activity, and the underlying reason is unknown. By calculating the continuously habitable zone and the UV habitable zone for each star, we found that about 70% stars in the total sample and 40% stars within 100 pc are located in the overlapping region of these two habitable zones, indicating that a number of M stars are potentially habitable. Finally, we examined the possibility of UV activity studies of M stars using the China Space Station Telescope.

<div> 关键词: 磁流体力学、Kink波、Kelvin-Helmholtz不稳定性、太阳环冠、数值模拟
总结: 
磁流体力学kink波是由于对结构化介质的扰动而自然形成的，例如，日冕环的横向震荡。研究结果表明，KHI诱导的湍流动力学包括两个阶段：首先是经典的KHI湍流层生长，然后根据经典衰减模型得出了对振动和湍流加热的准确预测；其次，主导湍流运动正在衰减，发现经典的能量衰减模型能够准确预测加热的过程。我们的研究表明，我们可以建立湍流演化的简单模型，但所产生的衰减轮廓与通常用于对抗理论和观测的线性理论不同。 <div>
Magnetohydrodynamic kink waves naturally form as a consequence of perturbations to a structured medium, for example, transverse oscillations of coronal loops. Linear theory has provided many insights into the evolution of linear oscillations, and results from these models are often applied to infer information about the solar corona from observed wave periods and damping times. However, simulations show that nonlinear kink waves can host the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability (KHI), which subsequently creates turbulence in the loop, dynamics that are beyond linear models. In this paper we investigate the evolution of KHI-induced turbulence on the surface of a flux tube where a nonlinear fundamental kink mode has been excited. We control our numerical experiment so that we induce the KHI without exciting resonant absorption. We find two stages in the KHI turbulence dynamics. In the first stage, we show that the classic model of a KHI turbulent layer growing at ∝t is applicable. We adapt this model to make accurate predictions of the damping of the oscillation and turbulent heating as a consequence of the KHI dynamics. In the second stage, the now dominant turbulent motions are undergoing decay. We find that the classic model of energy decay proportional to t−2 approximately holds and provides an accurate prediction of the heating in this phase. Our results show that we can develop simple models for the turbulent evolution of a nonlinear kink wave, but the damping profiles produced are distinct from those of linear theory that are commonly used to confront theory and observations.

<div> 星形反馈；巨大分子云；大麦哲伦星云；Atacama Large Millimeter／submillimeter Array；谱聚类

总结：<br />
本研究通过对大麦哲伦星云内九个巨大分子云的12CO和13CO Atacama大型毫米／亚毫米阵列地图进行研究，发现了星形反馈对这些云的重力状态产生了影响。我们使用了分子发射分割谱聚类算法来识别离散的亚结构，“团块”，并补充了近期星形成的三个迹象。研究结果表明，这些云中存在增加的湍流现象，而湍流宽度与团块表面密度和星形活动迹象均存在相关性，暗示星体能量注入在团块的动力状态中起着重要作用。12CO团块通常比13CO团块更少地被引力束缚，随着星形活动迹象的增加，动能与引力势能比例也可能会上升。进一步的多线分析可能更好地约束这些计算中的假设。 <div>
To investigate the effects of stellar feedback on the gravitational state of giant molecular clouds (GMCs), we study 12CO and 13CO Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array maps of nine GMCs distributed throughout the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), the nearest star-forming galaxy to our own. We perform noise and resolution matching on the sample, working at a common resolution of 3.″5 (0.85 pc at the LMC distance of 50 kpc), and we use the Spectral Clustering for Molecular Emission Segmentation clustering algorithm to identify discrete substructure, or “clumps.” We supplement these data with three tracers of recent star formation: 8 μm surface brightness, continuum-subtracted Hα flux, and interstellar radiation field energy density inferred from dust emission. The 12CO clumps identified cover a range of 3.6 dex in luminosity-based mass and 2.4 dex in average 8 μm surface brightness, representative of the wide range of conditions of the interstellar medium in the LMC. Our observations suggest evidence for increased turbulence in these clouds. While the turbulent linewidths are correlated with clump surface density, in agreement with previous observations, we find even better correlation with the three star formation activity tracers considered, suggesting stellar energy injection plays a significant role in the dynamical state of the clumps. The excess linewidths we measure do not appear to result from opacity broadening. 12CO clumps are found to be typically less gravitationally bound than 13CO clumps, with some evidence of the kinetic-to-gravitational potential energy ratio increasing with star formation tracers. Further multiline analysis may better constrain the assumptions made in these calculations.

<title>Exploring the Coronal Magnetic Field with Galactic Cosmic Rays: The Sun Shadow Observed by HAWC</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) are charged particles that reach the heliosphere almost isotropically in a wide energy range. In the inner heliosphere, the GCR flux is modulated by solar activity so that only energetic GCRs reach the lower layers of the solar atmosphere. In this work, we propose that high-energy GCRs can be used to explore the solar magnetic fields at low coronal altitudes. We used GCR data collected by the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov observatory to construct maps of GCR flux coming from the Sun’s sky direction and studied the observed GCR deficit, known as Sun shadow (SS), over a 6 yr period (2016–2021) with a time cadence of 27.3 days. We confirm that the SS is correlated with sunspot number, but we focus on the relationship between the photospheric solar magnetic field measured at different heliolatitudes and the relative GCR deficit at different energies. We found a linear relationship between the relative deficit of GCRs represented by the depth of the SS and the solar magnetic field. This relationship is evident in the observed energy range of 2.5–226 TeV, but is strongest in the range of 12.4 33.4 TeV, which implies that this is the best energy range to study the evolution of magnetic fields in the low solar atmosphere.

<title>Probing the Stellar Populations and Star Formation History of Early-type Galaxies at 0 < z < 1.1 in the Rest-frame Ultraviolet</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We measure the evolution of the rest-frame near-ultraviolet (NUV)−V colors for early-type galaxies in clusters at 0 < z < 1.1 using data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program, CFHT Large Area U-band Deep Survey, and local Sloan Digital Sky Survey clusters observed with Galaxy Evolution Explorer. Our results show that there is an excess in the ultraviolet spectrum in most quiescent galaxies (compared to the expectations from models fitting their optical/infrared colors and spectra) below z ∼ 0.6, beyond which the excess UV emission fades rapidly. This evolution of the UV color is only consistent with the presence of a highly evolved, hot horizontal branch subpopulation in these galaxies (among the majority of cool and optically bright stars), comprising on average 10% of the total stellar mass and forming at z > 3. The blue UV colors of early-type galaxies at low–intermediate redshifts are likely driven by this subpopulation being enriched in helium up to ∼44%. At z > 0.8 (when the extra UV component has not yet appeared) the data allow us to constrain the star formation histories of galaxies by fitting models to the evolution of their UV colors: we find that the epoch at which the stellar populations formed lies in the range 3 < zform < 10 (corresponding to 0.5–2.2 Gyr after the Big Bang) with a star formation e-folding timescale of τ = 0.35–0.7 Gyr, suggesting that these galaxies formed the majority of stars at very high redshift, with a brief yet intense burst of star formation activity. The star formation history and chemical evolution of early-type galaxies resemble those of globular clusters, albeit on much larger scales.

Galaxy cluster mergers that exhibit clear dissociation between their dark matter, intracluster gas, and stellar components are great laboratories for probing dark matter properties. Mergers that are binary and in the plane of the sky have the additional advantage of being simpler to model, allowing for a better understanding of the merger dynamics. We report the discovery of a galaxy cluster merger with all these characteristics and present a multiwavelength analysis of the system, which was found via a search in the redMaPPer optical cluster catalog. We perform a galaxy redshift survey to confirm the two subclusters are at the same redshift (0.541, with 368 ± 519 km s−1 line-of-sight velocity difference between them). The X-ray morphology shows two surface brightness peaks between the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs). We construct weak-lensing mass maps that reveal a mass peak associated with each subcluster. Fitting Navarro–Frenk–White profiles to the lensing data, we find masses of M200c = 36 ± 11 × 1013 and 38 ± 11 × 1013M⊙h−1 for the southern and northern subclusters, respectively. From the mass maps, we infer that the two mass peaks are separated by kpc along the merger axis, whereas the two BCGs are separated by 697 kpc. We also present deep GMRT 650 MHz data to search for a radio relic or halo and find none. Using the observed merger parameters, we find analog systems in cosmological n-body simulations and infer that this system is observed between 96 and 236 Myr after pericenter, with the merger axis within 28° of the plane of the sky.

<title>Unusually Low-frequency Whistler-mode Waves and Their Association with High-energy Protons Observed Upstream of Martian Bow Shock</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Whistler-mode waves upstream of planetary bow shock are often referred to as “1-Hz waves” due to the center of their observed frequency range being at ∼1 Hz. A series of whistler-mode waves were observed upstream of the Martian bow shock by MAVEN on 2015 August 14, with unusually low frequencies centered at ∼0.4 Hz. These waves were accompanied (though not synchronized) by the significant flux enhancement of high-energy protons up to ∼10 keV. By analyzing the wave dispersion property and the wave–particle interaction condition, we find that the observed whistler-mode waves have the potential of resonating with protons of ∼1 keV with large pitch angles up to nearly perpendicular to the background magnetic field, thereby providing a feasible means of accounting for proton acceleration. Our results indicate the possible origin of energized protons in the Martian environment through the interaction with whistler-mode waves, and their potential relationship with the unique upstream conditions.

<title>A Consistent Explanation for the Unusual Initial Mass Function and Star Formation Rate in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ)</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad33c0</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad33c0</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We examine various physical processes that may explain the shallow high-mass slope of the initial mass function (IMF), as well as the low star formation rate (SFR) in star-forming molecular clouds (MCs) in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ). We show that the strong tidal field and shear experienced by the CMZ have opposite effects on the collapse of density fluctuations and cannot explain these properties. Similarly, we show that the intense magnetic field in the CMZ provides a negligible pressure support and, for the high densities at play, should not modify the probability density function of the turbulent gas flow, thus affecting negligibly the IMF. However, we show that, in contrast to the MCs in the Galactic disk, the ones in the CMZ experience only one single episode of turbulence cascade. Indeed, their rather short lifetime, due to their high mean densities, is similar to one typical turbulence crossing time. Consequently, according to the Hennebelle–Chabrier theory of star formation, within this “single turbulence cascade episode,” the cloud experiences one single field of turbulence-induced density fluctuations, leading eventually to gravitationally unstable cores. As shown in Hennebelle & Chabrier (2013), this yields a shallower IMF than usual and leads to the correct observed slope for the CMZ star-forming clouds. Similarly, this single large-scale turbulence event within the cloud lifetime yields a 5–6 times lower SFR than under usual conditions, in agreement with the observed values. Therefore, we suggest that this “single turbulence cascade” scenario can explain both the shallow IMF and low SFR of clouds in the CMZ.

<title>Magnetic Flux Plays an Important Role during a Black Hole X-Ray Binary Outburst in Radiative Two-temperature General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic Simulations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Black hole (Bh) X-ray binaries cycle through different spectral states of accretion over the course of months to years. Although persistent changes in the Bh mass accretion rate are generally recognized as the most important component of state transitions, it is becoming increasingly evident that magnetic fields play a similarly important role. In this article, we present the first radiative two-temperature general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations in which an accretion disk transitions from a quiescent state at an accretion rate of to a hard-intermediate state at an accretion rate of . This huge parameter space in mass accretion rate is bridged by artificially rescaling the gas density scale of the simulations. We present two jetted BH models with varying degrees of magnetic flux saturation. We demonstrate that in “standard and normal evolution” models, which are unsaturated with magnetic flux, the hot torus collapses into a thin and cold accretion disk when . On the other hand, in “magnetically arrested disk” models, which are fully saturated with vertical magnetic flux, the plasma remains mostly hot with substructures that condense into cold clumps of gas when . This suggests that the spectral signatures observed during state transitions are closely tied to the level of magnetic flux saturation.

<title>Phase and Morphology of Water-ice Grains Formed in a Cryogenic Laboratory Plasma</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Grains of ice are formed spontaneously when water vapor is injected into a weakly ionized laboratory plasma in which the background gas has been cooled to cryogenic temperatures comparable to those of deep space. These ice grains are levitated indefinitely within the plasma so that their time evolution can be observed under free-floating conditions. Using microscope imaging, ice grains are shown to have a spindle-like fractal structure and grow over time. Both crystalline and amorphous phases of ice are observed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. A mix of crystalline and amorphous grains coexists under certain thermal conditions, and a linear mixing model is used on the ice absorption band surrounding 3.2 μm to examine the ice phase composition and its temporal stability. The extinction spectrum is also affected by inelastic scattering as grains grow, and characteristic grain radii are obtained from Mie scattering theory and compared to size measurements from direct imaging. Observations are used to compare possible ice nucleation mechanisms, and it is concluded that nucleation is likely catalyzed by ions, as ice does not nucleate in the absence of plasma and impurities are not detected. Ice grain properties and infrared extinction spectra show similarity to observations of some astrophysical ices observed in protoplanetary disks, implying that the fractal morphology of the ice and observed processes of homogeneous ice nucleation could occur as well in such astrophysical environments with weakly ionized conditions.

<title>The Relativistic Spin Precession in the Compact Double Neutron Star System PSR J1946+2052</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We observe systematic profile changes in the visible pulsar of the compact double neutron star system PSR J1946+2052 using observations with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The interpulse of PSR J1946+2052 changed from a single-peak to a double-peak shape from 2018–2021. We attribute this evolution as the result of the relativistic spin precession of the pulsar. With the high sensitivity of FAST, we also measure significant polarization for the first time, allowing us to model this with the precessional rotating vector model. Assuming, to the first order, a circular hollow-cone-like emission beam pattern and taking the validity of general relativity (GR), we derive the binary’s orbital inclination angle ( ) and pulsar’s spin geometry. The pulsar’s spin vector and the orbital angular momentum vector are found to be only slightly misaligned ( ). The quoted uncertainties do not reflect the systematic uncertainties introduced by our model assumptions. By simulating future observations of profile and polarization evolution, we estimate that we could constrain the precession rate within a 43% uncertainty in 9 yr. Hence, we suggest that the system’s profile evolution could be combined with precise pulsar timing to test GR in the future.

<div> 关键词: 太阳-作为-恒星，太阳耀斑， CHASE，Hα光谱，光谱特征
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了X1.0级太阳耀斑的太阳-作为-恒星的光谱特征。研究使用了中国Hα太阳探测器获取的高分辨率光谱数据，并采用基于离散傅立叶变换的噪声减少算法增强了空间积分Hα光谱的信噪比。研究发现，耀斑的平均Hα轮廓表现出线心的强发射和明显的线增宽，还呈现出明显的红偏斜，对应着约50 km/s的红移速度，随时间略有减小，与先前的结果一致。此外，研究还发现，空间积分区域的大小对耀斑太阳-作为-恒星Hα轮廓特征的影响。研究估计了检测到红偏斜的适用区域的上限。同时，研究还发现，如果进一步在时间域内对Hα光谱进行平均，那么光谱的等效宽度的强度会被显著低估。 <div>
Sun-as-a-star spectroscopic characteristics of solar flares can be used as a benchmark for the detection and analysis of stellar flares. Here, we study the Sun-as-a-star properties of an X1.0 solar flare, using high-resolution spectroscopic data obtained by the Chinese Hα Solar Explorer (CHASE). A noise reduction algorithm based on discrete Fourier transformation is first employed to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of the space-integral Hα spectrum, with a focus on its typical characteristics. For the flare of interest, we find that the average Hα profile displays a strong emission at the line center and an obvious line broadening. It also presents a clear red asymmetry, corresponding to a redshift velocity of around 50 km s−1 that slightly decreases with time, consistent with previous results. Furthermore, we study how the size of the space-integral region affects the characteristics of the flare's Sun-as-a-star Hα profile. It is found that although the redshift velocity calculated from the Hα profile remains unchanged, the detectability of the characteristics weakens as the space-integral region becomes larger. An upper limit on the size of the target region where the red asymmetry is detectable is estimated. It is also found that the intensity in Hα profiles, measured by the equivalent widths of the spectra, are significantly underestimated if the Hα spectra are further averaged in the time domain.

<div> 关键词: 太阳系，热木星，撞击，大气成分，化学变化<br />
总结: <br />
本研究调查了彗星撞击如何影响热木星的大气组成和化学性质。他们使用参数化的彗星撞击模型和大气模型，发现即使是小型撞击体也能导致大气化学成分的显著短期改变，包括水、CO和CO2丰度的大幅增加，以及可观察的碳氢化合物（如CH4）几乎完全消失。这些效应与大气C/O比和金属丰度的改变成比例。因此，彗星撞击可能显著改变热木星的大气组成，可能会打破大气C/O比与行星形成位置之间的联系。 <div>
Impacts from icy and rocky bodies have helped shape the composition of Solar System objects; for example, the Earth–Moon system, or the recent impact of comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 with Jupiter. It is likely that such impacts also shape the composition of exoplanetary systems. Here, we investigate how cometary impacts might affect the atmospheric composition/chemistry of hot Jupiters, which are prime targets for characterization. We introduce a parameterized cometary impact model that includes thermal ablation and pressure driven breakup, which we couple with the 1D “radiative-convective” atmospheric model ATMO, including disequilibrium chemistry. We use this model to investigate a wide range of impactor masses and compositions, including those based on observations of Solar System comets, and interstellar ices (with JWST). We find that even a small impactor (R = 2.5 km) can lead to significant short-term changes in the atmospheric chemistry, including a factor >10 enhancement in H2O, CO, and CO2 abundances, as well as atmospheric opacity more generally, and the near-complete removal of observable hydrocarbons, such as CH4, from the upper atmosphere. These effects scale with the change in atmospheric C/O ratio and metallicity. Potentially observable changes are possible for a body that has undergone significant/continuous bombardment, such that the global atmospheric chemistry has been impacted. Our works reveals that cometary impacts can significantly alter or pollute the atmospheric composition/chemistry of hot Jupiters. These changes have the potential to mute/break the proposed link between atmospheric C/O ratio and planet formation location relative to key snowlines in the natal protoplanetary disk.

We present deep XMM-Newton, Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, and upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope observations of Abell 746, a cluster that hosts a plethora of diffuse emission sources that provide evidence for the acceleration of relativistic particles. Our new XMM-Newton images reveal a complex morphology of the thermal gas with several substructures. We observe an asymmetric temperature distribution across the cluster: the southern regions exhibit higher temperatures, reaching ∼9 keV, while the northern regions have lower temperatures (≤4 keV), likely due to a complex merger. We find evidence of three surface brightness edges and one candidate edge, of which three are merger-driven shock fronts. Combining our new data with published LOw-Frequency ARray observations has unveiled the nature of diffuse sources in this system. The bright NW relic shows thin filaments and a high degree of polarization with aligned magnetic field vectors. We detect a density jump, aligned with the fainter relic to the north. To the south, we detect high-temperature regions, consistent with the shock-heated regions and a density jump coincident with the northern tip of the southern radio structure. Its integrated spectrum shows a high-frequency steepening. Lastly, we find that the cluster hosts large-scale radio halo emission. A comparison of the thermal and nonthermal emission reveals an anticorrelation between the bright radio and X-ray features at the center. Our findings suggest that Abell 746 is a complex system that involves multiple mergers.

<title>The Heavy Metal Survey: Star Formation Constraints and Dynamical Masses of 21 Massive Quiescent Galaxies at z = 1.3–2.3</title>

<div> 高红移星系、重金属调查、质量动力学、恒星形成、质量增长<br />总结:<br />这篇论文介绍了重金属调查项目，通过对21个质量巨大的静止星系进行深入观测，成功获取了它们的光谱红移和恒星速度分散度等信息。研究发现，大多数星系呈现出质量动力学质量与恒星质量之比和恒星速度分散度之间强烈的相关性，暗示着初始质量函数可能在宇宙早期就已经存在差异。对于遥远的静止星系的观测结果，也暗示了它们不会简单地在今天的巨型早期星系内部持续增长，其演化过程更为复杂。 <div>
In this paper, we present the Heavy Metal Survey, which obtained ultradeep medium-resolution spectra of 21 massive quiescent galaxies at 1.3 < z < 2.3 with Keck/LRIS and MOSFIRE. With integration times of up to 16 hr per band per galaxy, we observe numerous Balmer and metal absorption lines in atmospheric windows. We successfully derive spectroscopic redshifts for all 21 galaxies, and for 19 we also measure stellar velocity dispersions (σv), ages, and elemental abundances, as detailed in an accompanying paper. Except for one emission-line active galactic nucleus, all galaxies are confirmed as quiescent through their faint or absent Hα emission and evolved stellar spectra. For most galaxies exhibiting faint Hα, elevated [N ii]/Hα suggests a non-star-forming origin. We calculate dynamical masses (Mdyn) by combining σv with structural parameters obtained from the Hubble Space Telescope COSMOS(-DASH) survey and compare them with stellar masses (M*) derived using spectrophotometric modeling, considering various assumptions. For a fixed initial mass function (IMF), we observe a strong correlation between Mdyn/M* and σv. This correlation may suggest that a varying IMF, with high-σv galaxies being more bottom heavy, was already in place at z ∼ 2. When implementing the σv-dependent IMF found in the cores of nearby early-type galaxies and correcting for biases in our stellar mass and size measurements, we find a low scatter in Mdyn/M* of 0.14 dex. However, these assumptions result in unphysical stellar masses, which exceed the dynamical masses by 34%. This tension suggests that distant quiescent galaxies do not simply grow inside-out into today’s massive early-type galaxies and the evolution is more complicated.

<div> 关键词: galaxy samples, density field reconstruction, power spectrum, emulator, cosmological parameters<br />
总结:<br />文章研究了使用密度场重构来恢复宇宙中小尺度线性信息的方法，提出了一个准确的模拟器，用于模拟预重构、后重构和交叉功率谱，以提高宇宙学参数的约束。研究表明，联合分析前后重构的功率谱可以有效提取高阶统计信息。相比仅使用前重构的功率谱，使用联合功率谱可以显著改善对宇宙学参数和BAO/RSD参数的约束，突显了联合分析的高效性和实用性。 <div>
The small-scale linear information in galaxy samples typically lost during nonlinear growth can be restored to a certain level by the density field reconstruction, which has been demonstrated for improving the precision of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements. As proposed in the literature, a joint analysis of the power spectrum before and after the reconstruction enables an efficient extraction of information carried by high-order statistics. However, the statistics of the postreconstruction density field are difficult to model. In this work, we circumvent this issue by developing an accurate emulator for the prereconstructed, postreconstructed, and cross-power spectra ( , Ppost, Pcross) up to k = 0.5 h Mpc−1 based on the Dark QuestN-body simulations. The accuracy of the emulator is at the percent level; namely, the error of the emulated monopole and quadrupole of the power spectra is less than 1% and 10% of the ground truth, respectively. A fit to an example power spectrum using the emulator shows that the constraints on cosmological parameters get largely improved using +Ppost+Pcross with , compared to that derived from alone; namely, the constraints on (Ωm, H0, σ8) are tightened by ∼41%–55%, and the uncertainties of the derived BAO and RSD parameters (α⊥, α∣∣, fσ8) shrink by ∼28%–54%, respectively. This highlights the complementarity among , Ppost, and Pcross, which demonstrates the efficiency and practicability of a joint , Ppost, and Pcross analysis for cosmological implications.

<div> pulsar, emission geometry, jitter noise, plasma flow, MSPs
总结:<br /><br />该研究调查了17颗毫秒脉冲星(MSPs)的排放几何参数与抖动噪声之间的关系。通过假设抖动噪声仅由相位脉冲变化引起，前者可以被建模为等离子体流速的变化，导致相对于预测时间的脉冲到达时间的变化。在多种排放状态的脉冲星磁层模型中，等离子体流速与排放状态相关联，而排放状态的改变对应于等离子体流速的变化，引起脉冲到达时间的变化。我们计算出每颗MSP报道的抖动噪声对排放状态的最大改变。利用结果，我们发现MSPs具有相对较大的斜率角，这与观测结果一致，并且抖动噪声表现出对频率的依赖性。我们发现样本中的抖动噪声显示出指数衰减的特性，这个特性结合了斜率角和旋转周期，揭示了这三个参数之间的相关性。这表明抖动噪声的大小可能是特定于MSPs的。我们讨论了抖动噪声如何与MSP的演化有关。 <div>
The relationships between several parameters of an emission geometry and jitter noise in 17 millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are investigated. By assuming the jitter noise is due only to a pulse variation in phase, the former can be modeled as changes in the plasma flow rate leading to variation in the measured pulse arrival time relative to the predicted time. In the model for pulsar magnetospheres with multiple emission states, the plasma flow is associated with the emission states, and a change in the emission state corresponds to a change in the plasma flow causing variation in the pulse arrival time. These can be specified in an emission geometry defined by the obliquity and viewing angles, measured from the rotation axis to the magnetic axis and to the line of sight, respectively. We calculate the maximum change in the emission state based on the reported jitter noise for each of the MSPs. Using the results, we show that the MSPs possess relatively large obliquity angles, which is consistent with observation, and the jitter noise exhibits dependency on frequency. We find that the jitter noise in our sample displays an exponential decay as a function that combines the obliquity angle and the rotation period, revealing the correlation among the three parameters. This suggests that the magnitude of the jitter noise is likely specific to an MSP. We discuss how jitter noise may be related to the evolution of an MSP.

<div> starburst galaxy, supernova feedback, outflow, cooling, covering fraction

总结: 这篇文章研究了星暴星系中的超新星反馈对星系中气体流动的影响。作者在10kpc尺度上进行了高分辨率模拟，并发现星暴区域中的超新星驱动的气体流动更加热，速度更快，含有更多的冷相气体，而星系范围内的超新星驱动气体流动效果更好，可以更有效地清除盘面上的冷气体。这些研究结果有助于更好地理解星暴星系中的物理过程。 <div>
We present the fifth simulation in the Cholla Galactic OutfLow Simulation (CGOLS) project—a set of isolated starburst galaxy simulations modeled over large scales (10 kpc) at uniformly high resolution (Δx ≈ 5 pc). Supernova feedback in this simulation is implemented as a disk-wide distribution of clusters, and we assess the impact of this geometry on several features of the resulting outflow, including the radial profiles of various phases; mass, momentum, and energy outflow rates; covering fraction of cool gas; mock absorption-line spectra; and X-ray surface brightness. In general, we find that the outflow generated by this model is cooler, slower, and contains more mass in the cool phase than a more centrally concentrated outflow driven by a similar number of supernovae. In addition, the energy loading factors in the hot phase are an order of magnitude lower, indicating much larger losses due to radiative cooling in the outflow. However, coupling between the hot and cool phases is more efficient than in the nuclear burst case, with almost 50% of the total outflowing energy flux carried by the cool phase at a radial distance of 5 kpc. These physical differences have corresponding signatures in observable quantities: the covering fraction of cool gas is much larger, and there is greater evidence of absorption in low and intermediate ionization energy lines. Taken together, our simulations indicate that centrally concentrated starbursts are more effective at driving hot, low-density outflows that will expand far into the halo, while galaxy-wide bursts may be more effective at removing cool gas from the disk.

The Hercules ultrafaint dwarf galaxy (UFD) has long been hypothesized to be tidally disrupting, yet no conclusive evidence has been found for tidal disruption owing partly to difficulties in identifying Hercules member stars. In this work, we present a homogeneous reanalysis of new and existing observations of Hercules, including the detection of a new potential member star located ∼1° (∼1.7 kpc) west of the center of the system. In addition to measuring the line-of-sight velocity gradient, we compare predictions from dynamical models of stream formation to these observations. We report an updated velocity dispersion measurement based on 28 stars, km s−1, which is significantly lower than previous measurements. We find that the line-of-sight velocity gradient is km s−1 kpc along the major axis of Hercules, consistent with zero within 1σ. Our dynamical models of stream formation, on the other hand, can reproduce the morphology of the Hercules UFD, specifically the misalignment between the elongation and the orbital motion direction. Additionally, these dynamical models indicate that any radial velocity gradient from tidal disruption would be too small, km s−1 kpc, to be detectable with current sample sizes. Combined with our analysis of the tidal radius evolution of the system as a function of its orbital phase, we argue that it is likely that Hercules is indeed currently undergoing tidal disruption in its extended stellar halo with a line-of-sight velocity gradient too small to be detected with current observational data sets.

Investigating Protostellar Accretion is a Cycle 1 JWST program using the NIRSpec+MIRI integral field units to obtain 2.9–28 μm spectral cubes of five young protostars with luminosities of 0.2–10,000 L⊙ in their primary accretion phase. This paper introduces the NIRSpec 2.9–5.3 μm data of the inner 840–9000 au with spatial resolutions from 28 to 300 au. The spectra show rising continuum emission; deep ice absorption; emission from H2, H i, and [Fe ii]; and the CO fundamental series in emission and absorption. Maps of the continuum emission show scattered light cavities for all five protostars. In the cavities, collimated jets are detected in [Fe ii] for the four <320 L⊙ protostars, two of which are additionally traced in Brα. Knots of [Fe ii] emission are detected toward the most luminous protostar, and knots of [Fe ii] emission with dynamical times of <30 yr are found in the jets of the others. While only one jet is traced in H2, knots of H2 and CO are detected in the jets of four protostars. H2 is seen extending through the cavities, showing that they are filled by warm molecular gas. Bright H2 emission is seen along the walls of a single cavity, while in three cavities narrow shells of H2 emission are found, one of which has an [Fe ii] knot at its apex. These data show cavities containing collimated jets traced in atomic/ionic gas surrounded by warm molecular gas in a wide-angle wind and/or gas accelerated by bow shocks in the jets.

<div> 关键词: TeV gamma-ray afterglow, GRB 221009A, LHAASO Collaboration, activation time, jet component<br />
总结: 通过LHAASO合作组报道的GRB 221009A的早期TeV伽马射线余辉光变曲线，可以确定主喷流组件的激活时间，了解到其大约在GBM触发时间后约200秒时发生，并紧随GBM饱和时刻。研究结果表明，虽然LHAASO的数据不能排除均匀周围介质场景，但原始风场情形更为可取，并与恒星泡大小预期非常吻合。初期光变曲线增长主要受射流内部过程或伽马-伽马吸收影响，激活加速过程或减少内部伽马-伽马吸收可以自然地解释初始快速通量增加。随后的慢通量增长阶段可与产生区域中粒子积累过程相关联。此阶段的持续时间几乎可以独立于参数地确定喷流的初始洛伦兹因子Γ0≈600和磁场强度。这些数值似乎很好地匹配先前通过GRB辐射的谱建模揭示出的数值。<br /><br /> <div>
We explore the implications of the light curve of the early TeV gamma-ray afterglow of GRB 221009A reported by the LHAASO Collaboration. We show that the reported offset of the reference time, T*, allows the determination of the activation time of the main jet component, which occurs approximately 200 s after the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) trigger time and closely precedes the moment at which GBM was saturated. We find that while the LHAASO data do not exclude the homogeneous circumburst medium scenario, the progenitor wind scenario looks preferable, finding excellent agreement with the expected size of the stellar bubble. We conclude that the initial growth of the light curve is dominated by processes internal to the jet or by gamma-gamma attenuation on the photons emitted during the prompt phase. Namely, either the activation of the acceleration process or the decrease of internal gamma-gamma absorption can naturally explain the initial rapid flux increase. The subsequent slow flux growth phase observed up to T* + 18 s can be related to the process of particle accumulation in the production region. The duration of this phase allows an almost parameter-independent determination of the jet’s initial Lorentz factor, Γ0 ≈ 600, and magnetic field strength, . These values appear to match well those previously revealed through spectral modeling of the GRB emission.

A fraction of core-collapse supernovae (SNe) with signs of interaction with a dense circumstellar matter are preceded by bright precursor emission. While the precursors are likely caused by a mass ejection before core collapse, their mechanism to power energetic bursts—sometimes reaching 1048–1049 erg, which is larger than the binding energies of red supergiant envelopes—is still under debate. Remarkably, such a huge energy deposition should result in an almost complete envelope ejection and hence a strong sign of interaction, but the observed SNe with precursors show in fact typical properties among the interacting SNe. More generally, the observed luminosity of 1040−1042 erg s−1 is shown to be challenging for a single SN progenitor. To resolve these tensions, we propose a scenario where the progenitor is in a binary system with a compact object (CO) and an outburst from the star leads to a super-Eddington accretion onto the CO. We show that for sufficiently short separations outbursts with moderate initial kinetic energies of 1046–1047 erg can be energized by the accreting CO so that their radiative output can be consistent with the observed precursors. We discuss the implications of our model in relation to CO binaries detectable with Gaia and gravitational-wave detectors.

<title>Large Fluctuations within 1 au in Protoplanetary Disks</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad3731</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad3731</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Protoplanetary disks are often assumed to change slowly and smoothly during planet formation. Here, we investigate the time evolution of isolated disks subject to viscosity and a disk wind. The viscosity is assumed to increase rapidly at around 900 K due to thermal ionization of alkali metals, or thermionic and ion emission from dust, and the onset of magnetorotational instability (MRI). The disks generally undergo large, rapid fluctuations for a wide range of time-averaged mass accretion rates. Fluctuations involve coupled waves in temperature and surface density that move radially in either direction through the inner 1.5 au of the disk. Two types of waves are seen with radial speeds of roughly 50 and 1000 cm s−1, respectively. The pattern of waves repeats with a period of roughly 10,000 yr that depends weakly on the average mass accretion rate. Viscous transport due to MRI is confined to the inner disk. This region is resupplied by mass flux from the outer disk driven by the disk wind. Interior to 1 au, the temperature and surface density can vary by a factor of 2–10 on timescales of years to kiloyears. The stellar mass accretion rate varies by 3 orders of magnitude on a similar timescale. This behavior lasts for at least 1 Myr for initial disks comparable to the minimum-mass solar nebula.

Rossby波和其他惯性振荡在太阳对流层的观测燃起了人们对利用这些波来探测太阳内部的希望。研究人员通过在球形几何中建立的3D数值模拟模型，成功模拟了太阳的对流区和上部辐射内部，并观察到了多种惯性振荡，包括扇形和饼状赤道Rossby波、逆行混合惯性模式、顺行热Rossby波以及最近观测到的高频逆行（HFR）涡度模式，以及可能是这些HFR模式的纬向谐波。模拟结果表明，扇形和饼状Rossby波在辐射内部和对流层中是普遍存在的。研究人员认为，在模拟中，在辐射内部和对流区存在两种不同的Rossby波系列。最后，研究人员认为，出现在对流区的许多逆行惯性波，包括HFR模式，实际上都是相关的，是与顺行热Rossby波混合的纬向谐波。 <br /><br /> <div>
Recent observations of Rossby waves and other more exotic forms of inertial oscillations in the Sun’s convection zone have kindled the hope that such waves might be used as a seismic probe of the Sun's interior. Here, we present a 3D numerical simulation in spherical geometry that models the Sun’s convection zone and upper radiative interior. This model features a wide variety of inertial oscillations, including both sectoral and tesseral equatorial Rossby waves, retrograde mixed inertial modes, prograde thermal Rossby waves, the recently observed high-frequency retrograde (HFR) vorticity modes, and what may be latitudinal overtones of these HFR modes. With this model, we demonstrate that sectoral and tesseral Rossby waves are ubiquitous within the radiative interior as well as within the convection zone. We suggest that there are two different Rossby-wave families in this simulation that live in different wave cavities: one in the radiative interior and one in the convection zone. Finally, we suggest that many of the retrograde inertial waves that appear in the convection zone, including the HFR modes, are in fact all related, being latitudinal overtones that are mixed modes with the prograde thermal Rossby waves.

<div> 关键词: 二元脉冲星, CHIME, Shapiro时间延迟, 质量测量, 哈克洛夫斯基加速度
总结: <br /><br />这篇文章报告了利用CHIME对三个二元脉冲星的观测结果。研究人员首次在所有三个脉冲星二元系统中探测到了Shapiro时间延迟，并且利用2-4年的CHIME/脉冲定时数据测量了它们的质量。他们还通过观测轨道前进量，精确估计了PSR J1518+4904的伴星质量，以及PSR J2023+2853的伴星可能是高质量白矮星。研究人员还发现PSR J0218+4232的观测轨道周期有显著变化，由此推断了该系统的距离。这项工作展示了CHIME/脉冲系统通过高频率观测，可以在短时间内探测和精确测量二元脉冲星的广义相对论效应。 <div>
We performed near-daily observations of the binary pulsars PSR J0218+4232, PSR J1518+4904, and PSR J2023+2853 with the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME). For the first time, we detected the Shapiro time delay in all three pulsar binary systems, using only 2–4 yr of CHIME/Pulsar timing data. We measured the pulsar masses to be M⊙, M⊙, and M⊙, respectively. The companion mass to PSR J0218+4232 was found to be M⊙. We constrained the mass of the neutron star companion of PSR J1518+4904 to be M⊙, using the observed apsidal motion as a constraint on the mass estimation. The binary companion to PSR J2023+2853 was found to have a mass of M⊙; in the context of the near-circular orbit, this mass estimate suggests that the companion to PSR J2023+2853 is likely a high-mass white dwarf. By comparing the timing model obtained for PSR J0218+4232 with previous observations, we found a significant change in the observed orbital period of the system of ; we determined that this variation arises from “Shklovskii acceleration” due to the relative motion of the binary system, and used this measurement to estimate a distance of d = (6.7 ± 1.0) kpc to PSR J0218+4232. This work demonstrates the capability of high-cadence observations, enabled by the CHIME/Pulsar system, to detect and refine general-relativistic effects of binary pulsars over short observing timescales.

总结:
本文研究了本地集团中十个矮星系的星体形成历史(SFH)，使用了近红外颜色-颜色图和盖亚测距数据，去除了前景矮星，得到了包括红超巨星和半渐近巨星分支星的样本。通过颜色-星等图拟合方法，使用帕多瓦等时线生成模型来测量SFH，并确定了这十个矮星系的星体形成率、距离模数和金属丰度。结果表明，矮星不规则星系的星体形成率呈缓慢增长趋势，而矮椭圆星系的星体形成率从过去到现在呈缓慢下降趋势，同时表明NGC 6822的SFH显示出明显的增长特征，揭示了相互作用事件触发的星体形成活动。这些研究有助于我们更好地理解星系演化和恒星物理。 <div>
The star formation histories (SFHs) of galaxies provide valuable insights into galaxy evolution and stellar physics. Understanding the SFHs enables the study of chemical enrichment of galaxies, star formation triggered by interactions, and the behavior of various stellar populations. This work investigates the SFHs of ten dwarf galaxies in the Local Group (LG), which spans a wide range of types, masses, luminosities, and metallicities. The analysis is based on our new sample of the member stars in the LG after removing foreground dwarf stars by using information from the near-infrared color–color diagram and Gaia astrometry. The sample includes the most complete and pure red supergiants and asymptotic giant branch stars to gain valuable insights into the recent SFHs of the galaxies. A fitting method based on the color–magnitude diagram (CMD) is introduced to measure the SFH. The Padova isochrones are used to generate initial model CMDs, accounting for photometric errors and completeness through star-field simulations to match the completeness and error distributions of the observed CMDs. Subsequently, the SFHs, distance modulus, and metallicity of the ten dwarf galaxies are determined by fitting the CMDs. The results indicate that the star formation rates of dwarf irregulars show a gradual increase, while those of dwarf ellipticals exhibit a gradual decrease from the past to the present. Furthermore, this work shows that the star formation activity in dwarf ellipticals persisted up to 30 Myr ago. A significant increasing feature in the SFH of NGC 6822 reveals star formation activity triggered by an interaction event.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章讨论了恒星星冠物质抛射对外行星居住条件的影响，并提出了使用光谱线的不对称性来探测恒星CME的方法。通过构建CME的解析模型，作者推导了恒星爆发时的极紫外线线谱轮廓，进一步研究了探测器参数、曝光时间、CME传播方向和恒星活动水平对线谱轮廓的影响。研究结果表明，利用极紫外光谱仪可以在中等光谱分辨率和信噪比条件下探测恒星CME的信号，并推断其速度。这一研究为未来恒星CME探测仪器的设计和观测策略的发展提供了重要参考。 <div>
Stellar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from host stars are an important factor that affects the habitability of exoplanets. Although their solar counterparts have been well observed for decades, it is still very difficult to find solid evidence of stellar CMEs. Using the spectral line profile asymmetry caused by the Doppler shift of erupting plasma, several stellar CME candidates have been identified from spectral lines formed at chromospheric or transition region temperatures of the stars. However, a successful detection of stellar CME signals based on the profile asymmetries of coronal lines is still lacking. It is unclear whether we can detect such signals. Here we construct an analytical model for CMEs on solar-type stars and derive an expression of stellar extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) line profiles during CME eruptions. For different instrumental parameters, exposure times, CME propagation directions, and stellar activity levels, we synthesized the corresponding line profiles of Fe ixλ171.07 and Fe xvλ284.16. Further investigations provide constraints on the instrumental requirements for successful detection and characterization of stellar CMEs. Our results show that it is possible to detect stellar CME signals and infer their velocities based on spectral profile asymmetries using an EUV spectrometer with a moderate spectral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. Our work provides important references for the design of future EUV spectrometers for stellar CME detection and the development of observation strategies.

Galactic and extragalactic objects in the Universe are sources of high-energy neutrinos that may contribute to the astrophysical neutrino signal seen by IceCube. Recently, a study done using cascade-like events seen by IceCube reported neutrino emission from the Galactic plane with >4σ significance. In this work, we put a lower limit on the number of Galactic sources required to explain this emission. To achieve this, we use a simulation package created to simulate point sources in the Galaxy along with the neutrino and gamma-ray flux emissions originating from them. Along with using past IceCube discovery potential curves, we also account for Eddington bias effects due to Poisson fluctuations in the number of detected neutrino events. We present a toy Monte Carlo simulation to show that there must be at least eight sources, each with luminosity less than 1.6 × 1035 erg s−1, responsible for the Galactic neutrino emission. Our results constrain the number of individual point-like emission regions, which apply both to discrete astrophysical sources and to individual points of diffuse emission.

这篇文章研究了太阳耀斑和日冕物质抛射（CME）在传播过程中的非径向运动以及它们与太阳活动周期的关系。研究使用了来自数据中心的256个事件，并分析了它们在天空平面上纬度的比较。研究确认了CME在太阳源区向赤道方向的偏移，在太阳第25个太阳活动周期的上升阶段尤为明显。同时，研究还发现了CME的线速度与PE-CME纬度偏移之间的关系，主要在200和800km/s之间。另外，研究比较了第24个太阳活动周期的上升和衰退阶段的非径向偏移情况，发现在衰退阶段更多的事件偏向极地方向，这一变化归因于在衰退阶段存在大量低纬度的日冕空洞以及邻近活跃区的影响。
<br /><br />总结: <div>
During their propagation, coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and prominences sometimes display a nonradial motion. During the years after the solar minimum, the CME central position angle tended to be offset closer to the equator compared to that of the associated prominence eruptions (PE). No such effect was observed during solar maximum. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the latitudinal offsets of CMEs with respect to their source regions. We study 256 events from SC 24 and SC 25, listed in the Coordinate Data Analysis Workshop Data Center. We analyzed the CMES radial offset from the associated PEs by comparing their latitudes in the plane of the sky. This work is an extension of the previous work by Gopalswamy et al., but with an independent data set. We have confirmed the systematic equatorward offset of CME from the solar source region for the rising phase of Solar Cycle 25. Our analysis of the relation between CME linear speed and PE-CME latitudinal offset indicated that the velocities of the deflected CMEs are mainly in the range of 200 and 800 km s−1. In this study, we compared the nonradial offsets for the rising and decay phases of SC 24 and our analysis has shown that during the decay phase more events deflected toward the pole can be observed. The observed variation is attributed to the presence of a substantial number of low-latitude coronal holes during the decay phase and to the influence from nearby active regions.

The astrophysical origin of stellar-mass black hole (BH) mergers discovered through gravitational waves (GWs) is widely debated. Mergers in the disks of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) represent promising environments for at least a fraction of these events, with possible observational clues in the GW data. An additional clue to unveil AGN merger environments is provided by possible electromagnetic emission from postmerger accreting BHs. Associated with BH mergers in AGN disks, emission from shocks emerging around jets launched by accreting merger remnants is expected. Here we compute the properties of the emission produced during breakout and the subsequent adiabatic expansion phase of the shocks, and we then apply this model to optical flares suggested to be possibly associated with GW events. We find that the majority of the reported flares can be explained by breakout and shock cooling emission. If the optical flares are produced by shock cooling emission, they would display moderate color evolution, possibly color variations among different events, and a positive correlation between delay time and flare duration and would be preceded by breakout emission in X-rays. If the breakout emission dominates the observed lightcurve, we predict the color to be distributed in a narrow range in the optical band and the delay time from GW to electromagnetic emission to be longer than ∼2 days. Hence, further explorations of delay time distributions, flare color evolution, and associated X-ray emission will be useful to test the proposed emission model for the observed flares.

太阳表面的磁拓扑对太阳耀斑和日冕物质抛射的能量积累和释放起着关键作用。磁场的拓扑结构决定了电流片是否形成以及磁重连发生的位置。研究发现，具有嵌套双极点和两个零点的磁拓扑可以解释更复杂的动力学现象，如失败的喷发和日冕物质抛射与射流的相互作用。通过分析2013年7月13日在NOAA 11791活动区的事件，研究发现内部活跃区发生了喷发并伴随着耀斑，随后磁场发生重连。研究结果显示，内部零点和外部零点的重连差异自然地解释了观察到的弱射流和喷发的停滞现象。这些结果对于失败的太阳喷发有着一般性的启示。<br /><br /> <div>
The magnetic topology of erupting regions on the Sun is a key factor in the energy buildup and release, and the subsequent evolution of flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The presence/absence of null points and separatrices dictates whether and where current sheets form and magnetic reconnection occurs. Numerical simulations show that energy buildup and release via reconnection in the simplest configuration with a null, the embedded bipole, is a universal mechanism for solar eruptions. Here we demonstrate that a magnetic topology with nested bipoles and two nulls can account for more complex dynamics, such as failed eruptions and CME–jet interactions. We investigate the stalled eruption of a nested configuration on 2013 July 13 in NOAA Active Region 11791, in which a small bipole is embedded within a large transequatorial pseudo-streamer containing a null. In the studied event, the inner active region erupted, ejecting a small flux rope behind a shock accompanied by a flare; the flux rope then reconnected with pseudo-streamer flux and, rather than escaping intact, mainly distorted the pseudo-streamer null into a current sheet. EUV and coronagraph images revealed a weak shock and a faint collimated outflow from the pseudo-streamer. We analyzed Solar Dynamics Observatory and Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory observations and compared the inferred magnetic evolution and dynamics with three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics simulations of a simplified representation of this nested fan-spine system. The results suggest that the difference between breakout reconnection at the inner null and at the outer null naturally accounts for the observed weak jet and stalled ejection. We discuss the general implications of our results for failed eruptions.

We study stars in the J-regions of the asymptotic giant branch (JAGB) of near-infrared color–magnitude diagrams in the maser host NGC 4258 and four hosts of six Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia): NGC 1448, NGC 1559, NGC 5584, and NGC 5643. These clumps of stars are readily apparent near 1.0 < F150W − F277W < 1.5 and mF150W = 22–25 mag with James Webb Space Telescope NIRCam photometry. Various methods have been proposed to assign an apparent reference magnitude to this recently proposed standard candle, including the mode, median, sigma-clipped mean, or a modeled luminosity function parameter. We test the consistency of these by measuring intrahost variations, finding differences of up to ∼0.2 mag that significantly exceed statistical uncertainties. Brightness differences appear intrinsic, and are further amplified by the nonuniform shape of the JAGB luminosity function, also apparent in the LMC and SMC. We follow a “many methods” approach to measure consistently JAGB magnitudes and distance moduli to the SN Ia host sample calibrated by NGC 4258. We find broad agreement with distance moduli measured from Cepheids, tip of the red giant branch, and Miras. However, the SN host mean distance modulus estimated via the JAGB method necessary to estimate H0 differs by ∼0.19 mag among the above definitions, the result of different levels of luminosity function asymmetry. The methods yield a full range of 71−78 km s−1 Mpc−1, i.e., a fiducial result of H0 = 74.7 ± 2.1(stat) ± 2.3(sys, ±3.1 if combined in quadrature) km s−1 Mpc−1, with systematic errors limited by the differences in methods. Future work may seek to standardize and refine this promising tool further, making it more competitive with established distance indicators.

The Omh2(zi, zj) two-point diagnostics was proposed as a litmus test of the ΛCDM model, and measurements of the cosmic expansion rate H(z) have been extensively used to perform this test. The results obtained so far suggested a tension between observations and predictions of the ΛCDM model. However, the data set of H(z) direct measurements from cosmic chronometers and baryon acoustic oscillations was quite limited. This motivated us to study the performance of this test on a larger sample obtained in an alternative way. In this paper, we propose that gravitational-wave (GW) standard sirens could provide large samples of H(z) measurements in the redshift range of 0 < z < 5, based on the measurements of the dipole anisotropy of luminosity distance arising from the matter inhomogeneities of the large-scale structure and the local motion of the observer. We discuss the effectiveness of our method in the context of the space-borne DECi-herz Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory, based on a comprehensive H(z) simulated data set from binary neutron star merger systems. Our results indicate that in the GW domain, the Omh2(zi, zj) two-point diagnostics could effectively distinguish whether ΛCDM is the best description of our Universe. We also discuss the potential of our methodology in determining possible evidence for dark energy evolution, focusing on its performance on the constant and redshift-dependent dark energy equation of state.

To study the role of environment in galaxy evolution, we reconstruct the underlying density field of galaxies based on COSMOS2020 (The Farmer catalog) and provide the density catalog for a magnitude-limited (Ks < 24.5) sample of ∼210,000 galaxies at 0.4 < z < 5 within the COSMOS field. The environmental densities are calculated using a weighted kernel density estimation approach with the choice of a von Mises–Fisher kernel, an analog of the Gaussian kernel for periodic data. Additionally, we make corrections for the edge effect and masked regions in the field. We utilize physical properties extracted by LePhare to investigate the connection between star formation activity and the environmental density of galaxies in six mass-complete subsamples at different cosmic epochs within 0.4 < z < 4. Our findings confirm a strong anticorrelation between star formation rate (SFR)/specific SFR (sSFR) and environmental density out to z ∼ 1.1. At 1.1 < z < 2, there is no significant correlation between SFR/sSFR and density. At 2 < z < 4, we observe a reversal of the SFR/sSFR–density relation such that both SFR and sSFR increase by a factor of ∼10 with increasing density contrast, δ, from −0.4 to 5. This observed reversal at higher redshifts supports the scenario where an increased availability of gas supply, along with tidal interactions and a generally higher star formation efficiency in dense environments, could potentially enhance star formation activity in galaxies located in rich environments at z > 2.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The duration of orbital decay induced by gravitational waves (GWs) is often the bottleneck of the evolutionary phases going from star formation to a merger. We show here that kicks imparted to the newly born compact object during the second collapse generically result in a GW merger time distribution behaving like at short durations, leading to ultrafast mergers. Namely, a nonnegligible fraction of neutron star binaries, formed in this way, will merge on a timescale as short as 10 Myr, and a small fraction will merge even on a timescale less than 10 kyr. The results can be applied to different types of compact binaries. We discuss here the implications for binary neutron star mergers. These include unique short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), eccentric and misaligned mergers, r-process enrichment in the very early Universe and in highly star-forming regions, and possible radio precursors. Interestingly, we conclude that among the few hundred short GRBs detected so far, a few must have formed via this ultrafast channel.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The effect of the heliospheric current sheet (HCS) on the propagation of solar energetic particles (SEPs) remains poorly known. In this study we address this question by surveying energetic (∼2.0–9.6 MeV nucleon–1) helium data acquired by the energetic particle acceleration, composition, and transport (EPACT) sensor on board the Wind spacecraft. A superposed epoch analysis of 319 HCS crossings made by Wind reveals a sharp drop in the SEP fluxes at the HCS for the low-energy channels and little change across the HCS for the high-energy channels. To help understand the statistical result, we studied a total of 15 SEP flux dropout (a decrease of ∼50% or more) events that coincided with the crossing of the HCS. One of the common features of these SEP events is that they were initiated in the western hemisphere but far away from the longitude of HCS crossings, suggesting that the source of SEPs was well connected initially but was cut off later after Wind moved to the opposite hemisphere (e.g., HCS crossing). Further analysis of the events suggests that the percentage of flux dropouts decreases with increasing energy. It is suggested that a strong scattering of MeV helium may have occurred as the particle gyroradius is comparable to the thickness of the current sheet. This study clearly provides solid evidence for the HCS as a barrier to suppressing SEP flux of MeV energies from the onset hemisphere to the other.

<title>Circumnuclear Multiphase Gas in the Circinus Galaxy. VI. Detectability of Molecular Inflow and Atomic Outflow</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Recent submillimeter observations have revealed signs of parsec-scale molecular inflow and atomic outflow in the nearest Seyfert 2 galaxy, the Circinus galaxy. To verify the gas kinematics suggested by these observations, we performed molecular and atomic line transfer calculations based on a physics-based 3D radiation-hydrodynamic model, which has been compared with multiwavelength observations in this paper series. The major-axis position–velocity diagram (PVD) of CO(3–2) reproduces the observed faint emission at the systemic velocity, and our calculations confirm that this component originates from failed winds falling back to the disk plane. The minor-axis PVD of [C i](3P1–3P0), when created using only the gas with positive radial velocities, presents a sign of blueshifted and redshifted offset peaks similar to those in the observation, suggesting that the observed peaks indeed originate from the outflow, but that the model may lack outflows as strong as those in the Circinus galaxy. Similar to the observed HCN(3–2), the similar dense-gas tracer HCO+(3–2) can exhibit nuclear spectra with inverse P-Cygni profiles with ∼0.5 pc beams, but the line shape is azimuthally dependent. The corresponding continuum absorbers are inflowing clumps at 5–10 pc from the center. To detect significant absorption with a high probability, the inclination must be fairly edge-on (≳85°), and the beam size must be small (≲1 pc). These results suggest that HCN or HCO+ and [C i] lines are effective for observing parsec-scale inflows and outflows, respectively.

The Hobby–Eberly Telescope (HET) VIRUS Parallel Survey (HETVIPS) is a blind spectroscopic program that sparsely covers approximately two-thirds of the celestial sphere and consists of roughly 252 million fiber spectra. The spectra were taken in parallel mode with the Visible Integral-field Replicable Unit Spectrograph (VIRUS) instrument when the HET was observing a primary target with other HET facility instruments. VIRUS can simultaneously obtain approximately 35,000 spectra covering 3470–5540 Å at a spectral resolution of ≈800. Although the vast majority of these spectra cover blank sky, we used the Pan-STARRS1 Data Release 2 Stacked Catalog to identify objects encompassed in the HETVIPS pointings and extract their spectra. This paper presents the first HETVIPS data release, containing 493,012 flux-calibrated spectra obtained through 2023 March 31, as well as a description of the data processing technique. Each of the object spectra were classified, resulting in a catalog of 74,196 galaxies, 4,087 quasars, 259,396 stars, and 154,543 unknown sources.

<div> relativistic jets, gamma-ray burst, special relativistic effects, pulse asymmetry, ballistic jet model
<br />
这篇文章提出了伽马射线暴脉冲产生的假设，即高度相对论性的射流横扫观察者的视线时会产生。作者假设轴对称的喷流配置，结合特殊相对论效应，产生了GRB脉冲的时间反转特性。快速喷流膨胀导致的曲率是观测到的脉冲不对称和硬到软演变的主要原因。喷流相对于视线的相对倾斜度解释了已知的GRB脉冲形态类型。作者探讨了两种情景：一种是刚性/半刚性喷流的横向移动，另一种是弹道喷流从一个横向移动的喷口喷出物质。基于其与标准发射机制的一致性，更倾向于弹道喷流模型。 
<br /><br />总结：本文提出伽马射线暴脉冲产生的假设，探讨了相对论性喷流和特殊相对论效应，以及GRB脉冲的形态类型和动力学演变。作者提出了两种情景，并更倾向于弹道喷流模型。 <div>
We propose that gamma-ray burst (GRB) pulses are produced when highly relativistic jets sweep across an observer’s line of sight. We hypothesize that axisymmetric jet profiles, coupled with special relativistic effects, produce the time-reversed properties of GRB pulses. Curvature resulting from rapid jet expansion is responsible for much of the observed pulse asymmetry and hard-to-soft evolution. The relative obliqueness with which the jet crosses the line of sight explains the known GRB pulse morphological types. We explore two scenarios: one in which a rigid/semirigid jet moves laterally and another in which a ballistic jet sprays material from a laterally moving nozzle. The ballistic jet model is favored based upon its consistency with standard emission mechanisms.

<div> Spitzer, IRAC, SMUVS, UltraVISTA, JWST
总结:
该研究对COSMOS领域的26个Spitzer/IRAC选择的源进行了表征，这些源在UltraVISTA DR5 H-和/或Ks波段图像中未被检测到，覆盖了94平方弧分钟。研究分析了JWST的深度多波段光度学数据，并通过SED拟合揭示了这些星系的性质。研究发现，大多数星系在JWST/NIRCam波段λ<2μm处被检测到，只有四个在更深的JWST图像中仍然是近红外波段的辐射漏出。结果表明，UltraVISTA的候选漏出源主要位于z>3，并且具有高尘埃消光，典型的颜色过剩E(B − V) = 0.5 ± 0.3和恒星质量。值得注意的是，约75%的源显示出观测光度和模拟连续SED之间的流量增强，可以归因于相应NIRCam波段的Hα发射。推导得到的(Hα+N [ii]+S [ii])静息等效宽度和Hα星形成速率(SFR)的数值分别为∼100-2200 Å和∼5-375 M⊙ yr−1。这些源在SFR-M*平面上的位置表明其中35%为星暴星系，40%为主序星系，其余25%位于星形成谷。样本中包括一个活跃星系核和六个亚毫米源，这是通过辅助X射线和亚毫米波段光度学数据揭示的。高尘埃消光结合Hα发射的流量增强解释了为什么这些源在Spitzer成像中相对较亮，却在ultradeep UltraVISTA近红外图像中无法识别。 <div>
We have characterized 26 Spitzer/IRAC-selected sources from the SMUVS program that are undetected in the UltraVISTA DR5 H- and/or Ks-band images, covering 94 arcmin2 of the COSMOS field, which have deep multiwavelength JWST photometry. We analyzed the JWST/NIRCam imaging from the PRIMER survey and ancillary HST data to reveal the properties of these galaxies from spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting. We find that the majority of these galaxies are detected by NIRCam at λ < 2 μm, with only four remaining as near-infrared dropouts in the deeper JWST images. Our results indicate that the UltraVISTA dropouts candidates are primarily located at z > 3 and are characterized by high dust extinctions, with a typical color excess E(B − V) = 0.5 ± 0.3 and stellar mass . Remarkably, ∼75% of these sources show a flux enhancement between the observed photometry and modeled continuum SED that can be attributed to Hα emission in the corresponding NIRCam bands. The derived (Hα+ N [ii] + S [ii]) rest-frame equivalent widths and Hα star formation rates (SFRs) span values ∼100–2200 Å and ∼5–375 M⊙ yr−1, respectively. The locations of these sources on the SFR–M* plane indicate that 35% of them are starbursts, 40% are main-sequence galaxies, and the remaining 25% are located in the star formation valley. Our sample includes one active galactic nucleus and six submillimeter sources, as revealed from ancillary X-ray and submillimeter photometry. The high dust extinctions combined with the flux boosting from Hα emission explain why these sources are relatively bright Spitzer galaxies and yet unidentified in the ultradeep UltraVISTA near-infrared images.

总结:<br /><br />本研究探讨了银河系中超金属贫的恒星大气中锶至银（Z = 38–47）的元素丰度，该丰度可能包含了早期核心坍缩超新星爆发中弱r过程和νp过程的特征。通过结合基于稳态模型的各种天体物理条件，涵盖了超新星喷发的丰富熵、膨胀时间尺度和电子丰度。根据不同条件的计算丰度与恒星观测进行比较，以限制超新星喷发的条件。研究发现，一些中微子驱动的喷发条件可以一致地重现我们样本的观测丰度。此外，通过成功的组合发现，富中子的轨迹更好地重现了银河（Z = 38–40）的观测丰度，而贫质子的轨迹更好地重现了（Z = 42–47）的观测丰度。 <div>
The elemental abundances between strontium and silver (Z = 38–47) observed in the atmospheres of very metal-poor stars in the Galaxy may contain the fingerprint of the weak r-process and νp-process occurring in early core-collapse supernovae explosions. In this work, we combine various astrophysical conditions based on a steady-state model to cover the richness of the supernova ejecta in terms of entropy, expansion timescale, and electron fraction. The calculated abundances based on different combinations of conditions are compared with stellar observations, with the aim of constraining supernova ejecta conditions. We find that some conditions of the neutrino-driven outflows consistently reproduce the observed abundances of our sample. In addition, from the successful combinations, the neutron-rich trajectories better reproduce the observed abundances of Sr–Zr (Z = 38–40), while the proton-rich ones, Mo–Pd (Z = 42–47).

<div> 钙铝富集包裹体（CAIs），太阳系，氧同位素，铝同位素，岩石圈<br />
总结：<br />
CAIs是太阳系形成时期最古老的固体物质，它们在不经变质的球粒陨石中具有与太阳类似的氧同位素组成和较高的初始26Al/27Al比值。球粒陨石中CAIs的氧同位素异质性可能记录了CAI形成区域的气体氧同位素组成波动，以及岩石母天体中CAI矿物与水溶液发生的氧同位素交换。达尔·阿尔·加尼083的CO3.1球粒陨石中的一个CAI包裹体显示了氧同位素的不均匀性，并且经过研究发现，CAI中的铝镁同位素系统没有受到干扰。这表明CAI形成区域的气体氧同位素组成在注入和/或混合26Al之前发生了波动。同时，CAI的初生矿物未受到影响，但grossite和melilite的氧同位素出现了16O耗尽的现象，这可能是与小行星内部的流体发生了氧同位素交换。 <div>
Calcium, aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) are the oldest solids dated that formed in the solar system. Most CAIs in unmetamorphosed chondritic meteorites (chondrites; petrologic type ≤3.0) have uniform solar-like 16O-rich compositions (Δ17O ∼ −24‰) and a high initial 26Al/27Al ratio [(26Al/27Al)0] of ∼(4–5) × 10−5, consistent with their origin in a gas of approximately solar composition during a brief (<0.3 Ma) epoch at the earliest stage of our solar system. The nature of O-isotope heterogeneity in CAIs (Δ17O range from ∼−24 up to ∼+5‰) from weakly metamorphosed chondrites (petrologic type >3.0) remains an open issue. This heterogeneity could have recorded fluctuations of O-isotope composition of nebular gas in the CAI-forming region and/or postcrystallization O-isotope exchange of CAI minerals with aqueous fluids on the chondrite parent asteroids. To obtain insights into possible processes resulting in this heterogeneity, we investigated the mineralogy, rare-earth element abundances, and O- and Mg-isotope compositions of a CAI from the CO3.1 chondrite Dar al Gani 083. This concentrically zoned inclusion has a Zn-hercynite core surrounded by layers of (from core to edge) grossite, spinel, melilite, and Al-diopside. The various phases have heterogeneous Δ17O (from core to edge): −2.2 ± 0.6‰, −0.9 ± 2.1‰, −13.7 ± 2.1‰, −2.6 ± 2.3‰, and −22.6 ± 2.1‰, respectively. Magnesium-isotope compositions of grossite, spinel, melilite, and Al-diopside define an undisturbed internal Al–Mg isochron with (26Al/27Al)0 of (2.60 ± 0.29) × 10−6. We conclude that the variations in Δ17O of spinel and diopside recorded fluctuations in O-isotope composition of nebular gas in the CAI-forming region prior to injection and/or homogenization of 26Al at the canonical level. The 16O depletion of grossite and melilite resulted from O-isotope exchange with asteroidal fluid, which did not disturb Al–Mg isotope systematics of the CAI primary minerals.

<div> Wolf–Rayet binary, Massive binary black holes, Chemically homogeneous evolution, MESA, Bayesian approach <br />
总结: 通过使用MESA模拟密集的大质量双星系统，并采用贝叶斯方法与观测数据进行比较，研究了HD 5980 A&amp;B的形成。发现初始周期约为3天，随着质量损失而扩大到现今的约20天轨道，星体初始质量很高，推测可能由于增加的质量流失而形成。进一步模拟了星体的进化，发现它们可能演化为质量约为19-37太阳质量的黑洞，虽然无法通过引力波融合，但通过可能的第三和第四伴星的影响，系统可能迅速成为引力波源。 <div>
Chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE) is a promising channel for forming massive binary black holes. The enigmatic, massive Wolf–Rayet binary HD 5980 A&amp;B has been proposed to have formed through this channel. We investigate this claim by comparing its observed parameters with CHE models. Using MESA, we simulate grids of close massive binaries, then use a Bayesian approach to compare them with the stars’ observed orbital period, masses, luminosities, and hydrogen surface abundances. The most probable models, given the observational data, have initial periods ∼3 days, widening to the present-day ∼20 days orbit as a result of mass loss—correspondingly, they have very high initial stellar masses (≳150 M⊙). We explore variations in stellar-wind mass loss and internal mixing efficiency, and find that models assuming enhanced mass loss are greatly favored to explain HD 5980, while enhanced mixing is only slightly favored over our fiducial assumptions. Our most probable models slightly underpredict the hydrogen surface abundances. Regardless of its prior history, this system is a likely binary black hole progenitor. We model its further evolution under our fiducial and enhanced wind assumptions, finding that both stars produce black holes with masses ∼19–37 M⊙. The projected final orbit is too wide to merge within a Hubble time through gravitational waves alone. However, the system is thought to be part of a 2+2 hierarchical multiple. We speculate that secular effects with the (possible) third and fourth companions may drive the system to promptly become a gravitational-wave source.

<div> 关键词: 活动星系核，光变曲线，DRW模型，CHAR模型，阻尼时间尺度

活动星系核（AGN）的UV/光学光变曲线通常用Damped Random Walk（DRW）模型来描述。然而，阻尼时间尺度，一个关键参数的物理解释仍不清楚。最近的观察表明，阻尼时间尺度对波长和吸积速率的依赖性较弱，与吸积盘理论明显不一致。在这项研究中，我们在Corona Heated Accretion disk Reprocessing（CHAR）模型的框架内研究了阻尼时间尺度，该模型描述了AGN的变化。我们发现CHAR模型可以重现Stone等人的190个源20年光变曲线的观测功率谱密度，还可以通过拟合模拟光变曲线来很好地恢复观测阻尼时间尺度及其对波长的微弱依赖性。我们进一步证明了这种微弱依赖性是由于光变曲线持续时间不足所造成的，这导致最佳拟合的阻尼时间尺度低于固有阻尼时间尺度。在排除了这种影响后，CHAR模型确实显示了阻尼时间尺度对辐射顶点亮度和固有波长的强烈依赖性。我们的结果凸显了AGN变化研究中对充分长的光变曲线需求，以及CHAR模型在这类研究中的重要应用。
<br /><br />总结: 本文研究了活动星系核光变曲线的特征，发现DRW模型对阻尼时间尺度的描述存在问题，提出了CHAR模型来描述AGN的变化过程。通过模拟光变曲线的拟合发现了DRW模型的局限性，并证明了CHAR模型对阻尼时间尺度的正确描述，强调了AGN变化研究中的重要性。 <div>
The UV/optical light curves of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are commonly described by the Damped Random Walk (DRW) model. However, the physical interpretation of the damping timescale, a key parameter in the DRW model, remains unclear. Particularly, recent observations indicate a weak dependence of the damping timescale upon both wavelength and accretion rate, clearly being inconsistent with the accretion-disk theory. In this study, we investigate the damping timescale in the framework of the Corona Heated Accretion disk Reprocessing (CHAR) model, a physical model that describes AGN variability. We find that while the CHAR model can reproduce the observed power spectral densities of the 20 yr light curves for 190 sources from Stone et al., the observed damping timescale, as well as its weak dependence on wavelength, can also be well recovered through fitting the mock light curves with DRW. We further demonstrate that such weak dependence is artificial due to the effect of inadequate durations of light curves, which leads to best-fitting damping timescales lower than the intrinsic ones. After eliminating this effect, the CHAR model indeed yields a strong dependence of the intrinsic damping timescale on the bolometric luminosity and rest-frame wavelength. Our results highlight the demand for sufficiently long light curves in AGN variability studies and important applications of the CHAR model in such studies.

The drag force experienced by astronomical objects moving through gaseous media (gas dynamical friction) plays a crucial role in their orbital evolution. Ostriker derived a formula for gas dynamical friction by linear analysis, and its validity has been confirmed through subsequent numerical simulations. However, the effect of gas accretion onto the objects on the dynamical friction is yet to be understood. In this study, we investigate the Mach number dependence of dynamical friction considering gas accretion through three-dimensional nested-grid simulations. We find that the net frictional force, determined by the sum of the gravitational force exerted by surrounding gas and momentum flux transferred by accreting gas, is independent of the resolution of simulations. Only the gas outside the Bondi–Hoyle–Lyttleton radius contributes to dynamical friction, because the gas inside this radius is eventually absorbed by the central object and returns the momentum obtained through the gravitational interaction with it. In the subsonic case, the front–back asymmetry induced by gas accretion leads to larger dynamical friction than predicted by the linear theory. Conversely, in the slightly supersonic case with a Mach number between 1 and 1.5, the nonlinear effect leads to a modification of the density distribution in a way that reduces the dynamical friction, compared with the linear theory. At a higher Mach number, the modification becomes insignificant and the dynamical friction can be estimated with the linear theory. We also provide a fitting formula for dynamical friction based on our simulations, which can be used in a variety of applications.

总结:
太阳上观察到了一个静态的色球丝状物质，在附近活跃区域发生了B9.7级耀斑后，开始出现运动。在此过程中，观察到了黑色和亮色的丝状物质开始出现旋转运动，最终整个丝状物质不仅升起，而且在爆发期间出现了双螺旋结构。通过磁场建模发现，磁重联导致了丝状物质的不稳定并爆发。这项研究显示出磁扭结在日冕物质爆发中的重要作用。 <div>
We investigate a quiescent filament that erupted on 2013 August 2; the eruption was observed in EUV and Hα by the Solar Dynamics Observatory and GONG. After a B9.7 flare in the nearby active region, the dark filament materials near its eastern footpoint start to move in the direction of eruption, and are followed by a counterclockwise rotation identified as the motion of a combination of dark and bright filament materials. Then the entire filament rises up and keeps rotating in a clockwise direction during the eruption. More interestingly, the filament exhibits an unusual two-helix structure near its western footpoint during the eruption, which indicates the existence of a highly twisted flux rope. This hypothesis is confirmed by magnetic field modeling using the flux rope insertion method. In the best-fit unstable model, the lower limits of the estimated maximum and average twist numbers of the erupting flux rope reach 7.5π and 4π, which suggests that kink instability plays an important role in the eruption. During these magnetically coupled sympathetic eruptions, the highly twisted filament under the western lobe of a pseudo-streamer-like structure becomes unstable and erupts due to the removal of confinement by magnetic reconnection at the overlying hyperbolic flux tube, which is initiated by the B9.7 flare in the nearby active region. The initial filament motion occurs at the more unstable eastern footpoint, where the surrounding fields are weaker and decrease with height more rapidly.

<div> AGNs, broadband photometric reverberation mapping, ZTF database, Hα time lags, black hole masses<br />
在这项研究中，我们扩大了样本到 Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) 数据库，选择了123个具有足够变化性和平滑光变曲线的1型活动星系核(AGNs)，对来自ZTF数据库的3537个z < 0.09的AGNs进行了观测。从中我们计算了23个具有先前光谱时滞映射(SRM)结果的Hα时滞，使用了ICCF-Cut，JAVELIN和χ^2等方法。我们得到的Hα时滞略大于Hβ时滞，这与先前的SRM结果和AGN宽线区域的理论模型一致。通过对比SRM和PRM时滞分布和减去的发射线光变曲线，我们发现，在选择具有两个标准的AGNs之后，结合ICCF-Cut，JAVELIN和χ^2方法提供了一种有效的方式来从宽带PRM中获得可靠的Hα时滞。这些技术可以被用来在未来的大型多时相光度天文勘测中估算大量AGNs的黑洞质量，比如空间遗产调查和近期即将进行的广域巡天望远镜调查。 <br /><br />总结: <br />扩大样本至ZTF数据库，筛选出123个AGNs进行研究；使用ICCF-Cut，JAVELIN和χ^2方法得到Hα时滞结果，与先前的SRM结果和AGN宽线区域的理论一致；这些技术对于估算大量AGNs的黑洞质量非常有效。 <div>
In our previous work on broadband photometric reverberation mapping (PRM), we proposed the interpolated cross-correlation function (ICCF)-Cut process to obtain the time lags of the Hα emission line from two broadband lightcurves via subtracting the continuum emission from the line band. Extending the work, we enlarge our sample to the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) database. We adopt two criteria to select 123 type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with sufficient variability and smooth light curves from 3537 AGNs at z < 0.09 with more than 100 epoch observations in the g and r bands from the ZTF database. We calculate the Hα time lags for 23 of them that have previous spectroscopic reverberation mapping (SRM) results using the ICCF-Cut, Just Another Vehicle for Estimating Lags In Nuclei (JAVELIN), and χ2 methods. Our obtained Hα time lags are slightly larger than the Hβ time lags, which is consistent with the previous SRM results and the theoretical model of the AGN broad-line region. The comparisons between the SRM and PRM lag distributions and between the subtracted emission line light curves indicate that after selecting AGNs with the two criteria, combining the ICCF-Cut, JAVELIN, and χ2 methods provides an efficient way to get the reliable Hα lags from the broadband PRM. Such techniques can be used to estimate the black hole masses of a large sample of AGNs in large multiepoch photometric sky surveys such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time and the survey from the Wide Field Survey Telescope in the near future.

总结:<br />
这项研究通过对白矮星和棕矮星的联星系统进行相分辨光谱测量，发现棕矮星的旋转会产生颜色依赖的辐射变化，而且其天体模型表明棕矮星的云层分布和温度反转可能与辐射效率有关。这些发现有助于增加对这类天体的了解。 <div>
Brown dwarfs (BDs) in ultra-short-period orbits around white dwarfs (WDs) offer a unique opportunity to study the properties of tidally locked, fast-rotating (1–3 hr), and highly irradiated atmospheres. Here we present phase-resolved spectrophotometry of the WD–BD binary SDSS 1557, which is the fifth WD–BD binary in our six-object sample. Using the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 Near-infrared G141 instrument, the 1.1–1.7 μm phase curves show rotational modulations with semiamplitudes of 10.5% ± 0.1%. We observe a wavelength-dependent amplitude, with longer wavelengths producing larger amplitudes, while no wavelength-dependent phase shifts were identified. The phase-resolved extracted BD spectra exhibit steep slopes and are nearly featureless. A simple radiative energy redistribution atmospheric model re-creates the hemisphere-integrated brightness temperatures at three distinct phases and finds evidence for weak redistribution efficiency. Our model also predicts a higher inclination than previously published. We find that SDSS 1557B, the second most irradiated BD in our sample, is likely dominated by clouds on the nightside, whereas the featureless dayside spectrum is likely dominated by H− opacity and a temperature inversion, much like the other highly irradiated BD EPIC 2122B.

总结: 
本文讨论了关于密集恒星物质的等压物态方程的不确定性，指出夸克物质可能是真实的零压地面状态。文章还讨论了夸克之间的吸引力作用和它们易于形成库珀对的性质，提出了夸克物质可能具有超导性，尤其是在中等高密度下会呈现两味夸克配对的特性。最近报道了几种自结合的夸克星候选者，包括超新星残骸HESS J1731-347中的超低质量中心紧凑天体。文章利用Nambu-Jona-Lasinio模型对两味夸克色超导（2SC）相的稳定性进行了研究，但并未找到存在2SC夸克星的物理允许参数空间。 <div>
Large uncertainties in the determinations of the equation of state of dense stellar matter allow for the intriguing possibility that the bulk quark matter in beta equilibrium might be the true ground state of the matter at zero pressure. Also, quarks will form Cooper pairs very readily since the dominant interaction between quarks is attractive in some channels. As a result, quark matter will generically exhibit color superconductivity, with the favored pairing pattern at intermediately high densities being two-flavor pairing. In the light of several possible candidates for such self-bound quark stars, including the very low-mass central compact object in supernova remnant HESS J1731-347 reported recently, we carry out a one-field theoretic model, the Nambu–Jona–Lasinio model, to investigate the stability of the beta-stable two-flavor color superconducting (2SC) phase of quark matter, but find no physically allowed parameter space for the existence of 2SC quark stars.

<title>The Opposite Behaviors of Proton and Electron Temperatures in Relation to Solar Wind Magnetic Energy: Parker Solar Probe Observations</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad3636</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Solar wind heating is an outstanding issue that has been discussed for decades. Research on the connection between solar wind particle temperatures and turbulence may provide insight into this issue. Based on Parker Solar Probe observations, this paper investigates the properties of solar wind proton and electron temperatures in relation to turbulent magnetic energy, via the calculation of correlation coefficients (CCs) between particle temperatures and magnetic energy. The calculations are regulated by the spatial scale, plasma beta (β), and the angle between the solar wind velocity and background magnetic field, where the plasma beta is the ratio of plasma thermal to magnetic pressure. Results show that the correlation between proton temperature and magnetic energy is positive and can be strong with a CC exceeding 0.8. The strong correlation preferentially occurs at ion scales, with the wind velocity and background magnetic field quasi-perpendicular and over a wide beta range (β < 3.0). On the other hand, the correlation between electron temperature and magnetic energy is commonly negative, often with an intermediate or negligible CC, accordingly. The CC with an amplitude up to 0.8 can arise at larger scales with the wind velocity and background magnetic field quasi-(anti)parallel and in the low-beta case (β < 0.6). The implication of these findings on the physics of turbulent heating in the solar wind is discussed.

<title>Ion Heating by a Fast Magnetosonic Turbulence in the Solar Corona</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad3727</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Observational data at heliocentric distances of tens of solar radii suggest that fast magnetosonic modes make up a considerable fraction of the solar wind fluctuations. Furthermore, this fraction appears to increase closer to the Sun. We carry out three-dimensional kinetic simulations with particle ions and fluid electrons to evaluate the proton and alpha-particle heating produced by the damping of the fast waves in the solar corona. Realistic parameters at 5 solar radii, including the fluctuation amplitude, are used. We show that, due to the cyclotron resonance, the alphas are heated preferentially perpendicularly to the magnetic field and much more strongly than the protons. The presence of the alpha particles alters the energy partition by reducing the heating of the protons. Nevertheless, the proton heating is sufficient to account for the solar wind acceleration.

JWST观测证明在低质量M矮星的球状星团(GCs)中，检测到多个恒星群是有效的。研究展示了使用JWST观测计划GO2560在47 Tucanae进行的观测所获得的第一批结果，这是首个完全致力于探索极低质量恒星多群现象的研究项目。通过彩色-等级图(CMD)发现超冷恒星存在亚结构，包括间隙和斜率变化。特别是，在F322W2亮度函数中观察到一道间隙和一个最小值，两者相差不到1等，讨论它可能与氢燃烧限制有关。我们检测到比这个最小值更暗的恒星，很可能是棕矮星。我们证实了多个群在不同质量恒星中的普遍性，从约0.1 M⊙到红巨星 (∼0.8 M⊙)。从CMD和两个与不同群相关的M矮星的光谱中推断的氧范围与巨星观察到的类似。我们没有发现不同群中的恒星在大约0.1 M⊙以上的质量范围内的比例有任何差异。这项工作证明了JWST在揭示M矮星中的多个群的能力，并展示了分析接近氢燃烧极限和棕矮星序列的球状星团中极低质量恒星的可能性。 <br /><br />总结: JWST观测揭示了在球状星团中多种恒星群的存在，特别是对极低质量M矮星进行了深入研究，发现了多个亚群，并且证实了这种现象在不同质量范围内的恒星中的普遍性。氧的范围与巨星相似，同时也观察到了氢燃烧限制之下的恒星和可能的棕矮星。 <div>
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have been demonstrated to be efficient in detecting multiple stellar populations in globular clusters (GCs) in the low-mass regime of M dwarfs. We present an overview, and first results, of different projects that can be explored by using the JWST observations gathered under program GO2560 for 47 Tucanae, the first program entirely devoted to the investigation of multiple populations in very-low-mass stars, which includes spectroscopic data for the faintest GC stars for which spectra are available. Our color–magnitude diagram (CMD) shows some substructures for ultracool stars, including gaps and breaks in slope. In particular, we observe both a gap and a minimum in the F322W2 luminosity function less than 1 mag apart, and discuss which it could be associated with the H-burning limit. We detect stars fainter than this minimum, very likely brown dwarfs. We corroborate the ubiquity of the multiple populations across different masses, from ∼0.1 M⊙ up to red giants (∼0.8 M⊙). The oxygen range inferred for the M dwarfs, both from the CMD and from the spectra of two M dwarfs associated with different populations, is similar to that observed for giants. We have not detected any difference between the fractions of stars in distinct populations across stellar masses ≳ 0.1 M⊙. This work demonstrates the JWST's capability in uncovering multiple populations within M dwarfs and illustrates the possibility to analyze very-low-mass stars in GCs approaching the H-burning limit and the brown-dwarf sequence.

总结:<br />
使用Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy上的upGREAT仪器，从Nessie星云中的一个明亮光解区域（PDR）拍摄了[C ii] 157.74微米和[O i] 63.18微米的线发射。与澳大利亚紧凑射电阵列数据的比较显示经典的PDR结构，从离子化气体到光解气体，再到分子气体的进展。气泡的PDR的[O i]线发射显示自吸收特征。在远红外明亮原恒星附近，[O i]和[C ii]都显示出在−18 km s−1的吸收特征，与无关的前景分子云速度相同。Meudon模型表明，被标准G0 = 1的星际辐射场外部照射的分子云表面可能产生这些过渡的吸收特征。位于Nessie丝状红外暗云被气泡冲击的明亮年轻恒星物体AGAL337.916-00.477与两个冲击示踪物质相关联，表明气泡与丝状物质相互作用引发了星的形成。 <div>
Using the upGREAT instrument on board the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy, we imaged [C ii] 157.74 and [O i] 63.18 μm line emission from a bright photodissociation region (PDR) associated with an ionized bubble located in the Nessie Nebula, a filamentary infrared dark cloud. A comparison with Australia Telescope Compact Array data reveals a classic photodissociation region (PDR) structure, with a uniform progression from ionized gas, to photodissociated gas, and to molecular gas from the bubble’s interior to its exterior. [O i] line emission from the bubble’s PDR reveals self-absorption features. Toward a far-IR bright protostar, both [O i] and [C ii] show an absorption feature at a velocity of −18 km s−1, the same velocity as an unrelated foreground molecular cloud. Since the gas density in typical molecular clouds is well below the [O i] and [C ii] critical densities, the excitation temperatures for both lines are low (∼20 K). The Meudon models demonstrate that the surface of a molecular cloud, externally illuminated by a standard G0 = 1 interstellar radiation field, can produce absorption features in both transitions. Thus, the commonly observed [O i] and [C ii] self-absorption and absorption features plausibly arise from the subthermally excited, externally illuminated photodissociated envelopes of molecular clouds. The luminous young stellar object AGAL337.916-00.477, located precisely where the expanding bubble strikes the Nessie filament, is associated with two shock tracers: NH3 (3,3) maser emission and SiO 2−1 emission, indicating an interaction between the bubble and the filament. The interaction of the expanding bubble with its parental dense filament has triggered star formation.

Magnetic fields are ubiquitous in the Universe and are thought to play an important role in various astrophysical processes. Polarization of thermal emission from dust grains aligned with the magnetic field is widely used to measure the 2D magnetic field projected onto the plane of the sky, but its component along the line of sight is not yet constrained. Here, we introduce a new method to infer 3D magnetic fields using thermal dust polarization and grain alignment physics. We first develop a physical model of thermal dust polarization using the modern grain alignment theory based on the magnetically enhanced radiative torque alignment theory. We then test this model with synthetic observations of magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a filamentary cloud with our updated POLARIS code. Combining the tested physical polarization model with synthetic polarization, we show that the B-field inclination angles can be accurately constrained by the polarization degree from synthetic observations. Compared to the true 3D magnetic fields, our method based on grain alignment physics is more accurate than the previous methods that assume uniform grain alignment. This new technique paves the way for tracing 3D B-fields using thermal dust polarization and grain alignment theory and for constraining dust properties and grain alignment physics.

总结: <br />
磁通量的涌现对太阳磁现象至关重要。使用深度学习技术改善了信噪比，使得我们可以逐案例进行研究。我们发现涌现引起的流动在不同情况下有所不同，且在宁静的对流背景中频繁发生。我们的分析表明，超粒子尺度的对流流动和磁浮力对磁通量的上升影响减弱。与数值证据一致，我们推测小尺度的表面湍流和/或深层对流过程在推动磁通量涌现方面发挥了巨大作用。 <div>
Magnetic flux emergence from the convection zone into the photosphere and beyond is a critical component of the behavior of large-scale solar magnetism. Flux rarely emerges amid field-free areas at the surface, but when it does, the interaction between the magnetism and plasma flows can be reliably explored. Prior ensemble studies have identified weak flows forming near emergence locations, but the low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) required averaging over the entire data set, erasing information about variation across the sample. Here, we apply deep learning to achieve an improved S/N, enabling a case-by-case study. We find that these associated flows are dissimilar across instances of emergence and also occur frequently in the quiet convective background. Our analysis suggests the diminished influence of supergranular-scale convective flows and magnetic buoyancy on flux rise. Consistent with numerical evidence, we speculate that small-scale surface turbulence and/or deep convective processes play an outsized role in driving flux emergence.

The relationship between CME properties in the corona and their interplanetary counterparts is not well understood. Until recently, a wide spatial gap existed between the two regions, which prevented us from disentangling the spatial and temporal evolution of CMEs. NASA’s Parker Solar Probe (PSP) has imaged multiple CMEs since its launch in 2018, but these events either intercepted the spacecraft far from the corona or completely missed it. Here we describe one of the first CMEs observed simultaneously by remote sensing and in situ instruments, and compare the corresponding measured properties, such as orientation, cross section diameter, density, and speed. The CME encounter occurred on 2022 June 2, while PSP was around 14 solar radii from the Sun center. We reconstruct the CME with forward modeling and determine its morphology and kinematics. The reconstruction suggests that PSP misses the CME apex but encounters its flank. The encounter time matches the period when the PSP in situ measurements indicate the passage of a CME. We also reconstruct the flux rope diameter and orientation using the in situ magnetic field measurements. The results are consistent with the CME reconstruction from imaging data. The close agreement between remote sensing and in situ analyses suggests that discrepancies found in past studies are more likely associated with the CME temporal evolution. We also find that the magnetic field of the CME flank extrapolated to 1 au is well below the average solar wind background and likely indistinguishable from it. This point could explain past events where the CMEs' interplanetary counterparts were not identified.

We present the second NuSTAR and XMM-Newton extragalactic survey of the JWST north ecliptic pole (NEP) time-domain field (TDF). The first NuSTAR NEP-TDF survey had 681 ks total exposure time executed in NuSTAR cycle 5 in 2019 and 2020. This second survey, acquired from 2020 to 2022 in cycle 6, adds 880 ks of NuSTAR exposure time. The overall NuSTAR NEP-TDF survey is the most sensitive NuSTAR extragalactic survey to date, and a total of 60 sources were detected above the 95% reliability threshold. We constrain the hard X-ray number counts, – , down to 1.7 × 10−14 erg cm−2 s−1 at 8–24 keV and detect an excess of hard X-ray sources at the faint end. About 47% of the NuSTAR-detected sources are heavily obscured (NH > 1023 cm−2), and % of the NuSTAR-detected sources are Compton-thick (NH > 1024 cm−2). These fractions are consistent with those measured in other NuSTAR surveys. Four sources presented >2σ variability in the 3 yr survey. In addition to NuSTAR, a total of 62 ks of XMM-Newton observations were taken during NuSTAR cycle 6. The XMM-Newton observations provide soft X-ray (0.5–10 keV) coverage in the same field and enable more robust identification of the visible and infrared counterparts of the NuSTAR-detected sources. A total of 286 soft X-ray sources were detected, out of which 214 XMM-Newton sources have secure counterparts from multiwavelength catalogs.

<div> Brown dwarf binaries, photometric monitoring, variability, period range, atmosphere simulation
<br /><br />
Luhman 16 AB是一个强烈变化的棕矮双星系统，通过长达1200小时的光度监测，发现其存在数小时至数百小时的±5%变化。研究表明，5小时（k=1波数）和2.5小时（k=2波数）的短周期旋转调制主导了10小时内的变化，而由k=1和k=2波组成的行星尺度波模型能够很好地拟合周期图和光变曲线。此外，通过简单的太阳系巨行星带状模型，提出了潮纹区带风速分布不同导致k=1和k=2波周期范围差异的假设。最后，发现Luhman 16 AB还表现出长周期±5%的变化，周期范围从15小时到100小时不等。这些结果与之前的3D大气模拟一致，表明纬度相关波和缓慢变化的大气特征可能存在于Luhman 16 AB大气中，并且对数百个自转周期的光变有重要贡献。 <div>
In this work, we present the longest photometric monitoring of up to 1200 hr of the strongly variable brown dwarf binaries Luhman 16 AB and provide evidence of ±5% variability on a timescale of several to hundreds of hours for this object. We show that short-period rotational modulation around 5 hr (k = 1 wavenumber) and 2.5 hr (k = 2 wavenumber) dominate the variability under 10 hr, where the planetary-scale wave model composed of k = 1 and k = 2 waves provides good fits to both the periodograms and light curve. In particular, models consisting of three to four sine waves could explain the variability of the light-curve durations up to 100 hr. We show that the relative range of the k = 2 periods is narrower compared to the k = 1 periods. Using simple models of zonal banding in solar system giants, we suggest that the difference in period range arises from the difference in wind-speed distribution at low and mid-to-high latitudes in the atmosphere. Last, we show that Luhman 16 AB also exhibits long-period ±5% variability, with periods ranging from 15 hr up to 100 hr over the longest monitoring of this object. Our results for the k = 1 and k = 2 waves and long-period evolution are consistent with previous 3D atmosphere simulations, demonstrating that both latitude-dependent waves and slow-varying atmospheric features are potentially present in Luhman 16 AB atmospheres and are a significant contribution to the light-curve modulation over hundreds of rotations.

<div> 关键词: Flare events, TESS data, polars, superflares, accretion behavior
总结: 本文通过对所有可用的2分钟Tess数据进行目测检查，共识别出185颗极小的恒星中的5颗出现了6次耀斑事件。所有耀斑的辐射能量均超过10^34爱尔格，其中值介于10^35爱尔格左右，因此属于超级耀斑。其中有两次耀斑之后出现了亮度增强，可能表明白矮星发生了由日冕物质抛射引起的吸积突发事件。对探测结果的完整性分析表明，极小恒星的耀斑活动与M型矮星非常相似，这表明白矮星的高磁场对极小恒星的磁活动影响不大。我们估计还有大约20-30颗极小恒星存在磁活跃的辅星，因此鼓励进一步开展对极小恒星耀斑的更深入搜索。 <br /><br /> <div>
Flare events are magnetic activities on the stellar surface, which can provide us with information about the accretion behavior and evolution of polars. In this paper, we search for flare events on polars from all the available 2 minute cadence TESS data through visual inspection, and identify six flare events on five flaring stars from 185 polars. All the flares have bolometric energies above 1034 erg, with a median of ∼1035 erg, so they are superflares. Among them, two flares are followed by a brightness enhancement, which may suggest an accretion burst on the white dwarf caused by a coronal mass ejection. A completeness analysis of the detections demonstrates that the flare activities on the low-mass red dwarfs of polars are very similar to those on M dwarfs, which indicates that the highly magnetic fields of the white dwarfs have no significant effect on the magnetic activities on polars. We estimate that another ∼20–30 polars include a magnetically active secondary star, and more intensive searching for flares on polars is encouraged in further work.

<br /><br />总结:
本研究利用CRPropa框架解决了3D宇宙射线输运方程，并测试了两种不同的源分布和五种不同的扩散张量各向异性，覆盖了有效地沿磁场线扩散到各向同性扩散的范围。研究发现，在测试的磁场配置中，扩散张量的各向异性接近各向同性情况，并偏好于中央分子区域内的三个点源。未来的任务将需要更详细的3D气体分布和磁场结构。 <div>
The very high energy (VHE) emission of the central molecular zone (CMZ) is rarely modeled in 3D. Most approaches describe the morphology in 1D or simplify the diffusion to the isotropic case. In this work, we show the impact of a realistic 3D magnetic field configuration and gas distribution on the VHE γ-ray distribution of the CMZ. We solve the 3D cosmic-ray transport equation with an anisotropic diffusion tensor using the approach of stochastic differential equations as implemented in the CRPropa framework. We test two different source distributions for five different anisotropies of the diffusion tensor, covering the range of effectively fieldline-parallel diffusion to isotropic diffusion. Within the tested magnetic field configuration, the anisotropy of the diffusion tensor is close to the isotropic case, and three point sources within the CMZ are favored. Future missions such as the upcoming CTA will reveal more small-scale structures that are not yet included in the model. Therefore, a more detailed 3D gas distribution and magnetic field structure will be needed.

[C ii] 157.74 μm是远红外波段中最明亮和研究最充分的发射线之一，产生于星系星际介质(ISM)中。研究发现，[C ii]与H2的转换率与金属丰度呈弱相关，大部分[C ii]来自具有约n∼ 10 cm−3的原子气体。此外，[C ii]的强度与恒星形成速率(SFR)呈正相关，这与观测结果一致。因此，在金属贫穷的环境中，[C ii]是一种良好的SFR追踪器。解析密集(ISM)的多孔结构至关重要，因为它主导了[C ii] 157.74 μm的辐射。与光学薄极限相比，我们发现[C ii]线只有在我们假定的气体表面密度下的超太阳金属丰度时才会变得边缘光学厚。 <br /><br />总结: [C ii] 157.74 μm是星系星际介质中很重要的发射线，其特性与金属丰度相关，可用作SFR追踪器，对解析ISM的结构十分重要。 <div>
The [C ii] 157.74 μm fine-structure transition is one of the brightest and most well-studied emission lines in the far-infrared, produced in the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies. We study its properties in subparsec-resolution hydrodynamical simulations for an ISM patch with gas surface density of Σg = 10 M⊙ pc−2, coupled with time-dependent chemistry, far-ultraviolet dust and gas shielding, star formation, photoionization and supernova feedback, and full line radiative transfer. We find a [C ii]-to-H2 conversion factor that scales weakly with metallicity , where is the normalized metallicity relative to solar. The majority of [C ii] originates from atomic gas with hydrogen number density n ∼ 10 cm−3. The [C ii] line intensity positively correlates with the star formation rate (SFR), with a normalization factor that scales linearly with metallicity. We find that this is broadly consistent with z ∼ 0 observations. As such, [C ii] is a good SFR tracer even in metal-poor environments where molecular lines might be undetectable. Resolving the clumpy structure of the dense (n = 10−103 cm−3) ISM is important, as it dominates [C ii] 157.74 μm emission. We compare our full radiative transfer computation with the optically thin limit and find that the [C ii] line becomes marginally optically thick only at supersolar metallicity for our assumed gas surface density.

Turbulence in highly magnetized plasma can be relativistic and induce an electric field comparable to the background magnetic field. Such a strong electric field can affect the emission process of nonthermal electrons. As the first step toward elucidating the emission process in relativistic turbulence, we study the radiation process of electrons in relativistic circularly polarized Alfvén waves. While the induced electric field boosts the average energy of low-energy electrons with a Larmor radius smaller than the wavelength, the emissivity for such electrons is suppressed because of the elongated gyromotion trajectory. The trajectory of high-energy electrons is shaken by the small-scale electric field, which enhances the emissivity. Since the effective Lorentz factor of E × B drift is in the circularly polarized Alfvén waves, the deviation from the standard synchrotron emission is not so prominent. However, a power-law energy injection in the waves can produce a concave photon spectrum, which is similar to the GeV extra component seen in GRB spectra. If the turbulence electric field is responsible for the GeV extra component in GRBs, the estimates of the typical electron energy and magnetic field should be largely altered.

<title>A Channel to Form Fast-spinning Black Hole–Neutron Star Binary Mergers as Multimessenger Sources. II. Accretion-induced Spin-up</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this work, we investigate an alternative channel for the formation of fast-spinning black hole–neutron star (BHNS) binaries, in which super-Eddington accretion is expected to occur in accreting BHs during the stable mass transfer phase within BH-stripped helium (BH–He-rich) star binary systems. We evolve intensive MESA grids of close-orbit BH–He-rich star systems to systematically explore the projected aligned spins of BHs in BHNS binaries, as well as the impact of different accretion limits on the tidal disruption probability and electromagnetic (EM) signature of BHNS mergers. Most of the BHs in BHNS mergers cannot be effectively spun up through accretion if the accretion rate is limited to , where is the standard Eddington accretion limit. In order to reach high spins (e.g., χBH ≳ 0.5), the BHs are required to be born less massive (e.g., ≲3.0 M⊙) in binary systems with initial periods of ≲0.2–0.3 days and accrete material at . However, even under this high accretion limit, ≳6 M⊙ BHs are typically challenging to significantly spin up and generate detectable associated EM signals. Our population simulations suggest that different accretion limits have a slight impact on the ratio of tidal disruption events. However, as the accretion limit increases, the EM counterparts from the cosmological BHNS population can become bright overall.

<title>The Sun Remains Relatively Refractory Depleted: Elemental Abundances for 17,412 Gaia RVS Solar Analogs and 50 Planet Hosts</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The element abundances of stars, particularly the refractory elements (e.g., Fe, Si, and Mg), play an important role in connecting stars to their planets. Most Sun-like stars do not have refractory abundance measurements since obtaining a large sample of high-resolution spectra is difficult with oversubscribed observing resources. In this work we infer abundances for C, N, O, Na, Mn, Cr, Si, Fe, Ni, Mg, V, Ca, Ti, Al, and Y for solar analogs with Gaia Radial Velocity Spectrometer (RVS) spectra (R = 11,200) using TheCannon, a data-driven method. We train a linear model on a reference set of 34 stars observed by Gaia RVS with precise abundances measured from previous high-resolution spectroscopic efforts (R > 30,000–110,000). We then apply this model to several thousand Gaia RVS solar analogs. This yields abundances with average upper limit precisions of 0.04–0.1 dex for 17,412 stars, 50 of which are identified planet (candidate) hosts. We subsequently test the relative refractory depletion of these stars with increasing element condensation temperature compared to the Sun. The Sun remains refractory depleted compared to other Sun-like stars regardless of our current knowledge of the planets they host. This is inconsistent with theories of various types of planets locking up or sequestering refractories. Furthermore, we find no significant abundance differences between identified close-in giant planet hosts, giant planet hosts, and terrestrial/small planet hosts with the rest of the sample within our precision limits. This work demonstrates the utility of data-driven learning for future exoplanet composition and demographics studies.

<title>Winds and Disk Turbulence Exert Equal Torques on Thick Magnetically Arrested Disks</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The conventional accretion disk lore is that magnetized turbulence is the principal angular momentum transport process that drives accretion. However, when dynamically important large-scale magnetic fields thread an accretion disk, they can produce mass and angular momentum outflows, known as winds, that also drive accretion. Yet, the relative importance of turbulent and wind-driven angular momentum transport is still poorly understood. To probe this question, we analyze a long-duration (1.2 × 105rg/c) simulation of a rapidly rotating (a = 0.9) black hole feeding from a thick (H/r ∼ 0.3), adiabatic, magnetically arrested disk (MAD), whose dynamically important magnetic field regulates mass inflow and drives both uncollimated and collimated outflows (i.e., winds and jets, respectively). By carefully disentangling the various angular momentum transport processes within the system, we demonstrate the novel result that disk winds and disk turbulence both extract roughly equal amounts of angular momentum from the disk. We find cumulative angular momentum and mass accretion outflow rates of and , respectively. This result suggests that understanding both turbulent and laminar stresses is key to understanding the evolution of systems where geometrically thick MADs can occur, such as the hard state of X-ray binaries, low-luminosity active galactic nuclei, some tidal disruption events, and possibly gamma-ray bursts.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a general procedure for deriving a line-profile model for massive-star X-ray spectra that captures the dynamics of the wind more directly. The basis of the model is the analytic solution to the problem of variable jets in Herbig–Haro objects given by Cantó et al. In deriving our model, we generalize this jet solution to include flows with a prescribed nonzero acceleration for the context of radiatively driven winds. We provide example line profiles generated from our model for the case of sinusoidal velocity and mass-ejection variations. The example profiles show the expected shape of massive-star X-ray emission lines, as well as interesting but complicated trends with the model parameters. This establishes the possibility that observed X-rays could be a result of temporal variations seeded at the wind base, rather than purely generated intrinsically within the wind volume, and can be described via a quantitative language that connects with the physical attributes of those variations, consistently with the downstream momentum-conserving nature of radiatively cooled shocked radial flows.

<title>The Effect of Spatially Varying Collision Frequency on the Development of the Rayleigh–Taylor Instability</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The Rayleigh–Taylor (RT) instability is ubiquitously observed, yet has traditionally been studied using ideal fluid models. Collisionality can vary strongly across the fluid interface, and previous work demonstrates the necessity of kinetic models to completely capture dynamics in certain collisional regimes. Where previous kinetic simulations used spatially and temporally constant collision frequency, this work presents five-dimensional (two spatial, three velocity dimensions) continuum-kinetic simulations of the RT instability using a more realistic spatially varying collision frequency. Three cases of collisional variation are explored for two Atwood numbers: low to intermediate, intermediate to high, and low to high. The low-to-intermediate case exhibits no RT instability growth, while the intermediate-to-high case is similar to a fluid-limit kinetic case with interface widening biased toward the lower-collisionality region. A novel contribution of this work is the low-to-high collisionality case that shows significantly altered instability growth through an upward movement of the interface and damped spike growth due to increased free-streaming particle diffusion in the lower region. Contributions to the energy flux from the non-Maxwellian portions of the distribution function are not accessible to fluid models and are greatest in magnitude in the spike and regions of low collisionality. Increasing the Atwood number results in greater RT instability growth and reduced upward interface movement. Deviation of the distribution function from Maxwellian is inversely proportional to collision frequency and concentrated around the fluid interface. The linear phase of RT instability growth is well described by theoretical linear growth rates accounting for viscosity and diffusion.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Ultraviolet (UV) processing in the interstellar medium (ISM) induces the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons. Aliphatics, including alkanes, are present in different interstellar environments, being prevalently formed in evolved stars; thus, the dehydrogenation by UV photoprocessing of alkanes plays an important role in the chemistry of the ISM, leading to the formation of unsaturated hydrocarbons and eventually to aromatics, the latter ubiquitously detected in the ISM. Here, through combined experimental results and ab initio calculations, we show that UV absorption (mainly at the Lyα emission line of hydrogen at 121.6 nm) promotes an alkane to an excited Rydberg state from where it evolves toward fragmentation, inducing the formation of olefinic C=C bonds, which are necessary precursors of aromatic hydrocarbons. We show that the photochemistry of aliphatics in the ISM does not primarily produce direct hydrogen elimination but preferential C–C photocleavage. Our results provide an efficient synthetic route for the formation of unsaturated aliphatics, including propene and dienes, and suggest that aromatics could be formed in dark clouds by a bottom-up mechanism involving molecular fragments produced by UV photoprocessing of aliphatics.

The magnetic activity level is negatively correlated with and stellar mass. Based on the magnetic dynamo model, the variations in the size and thickness of the surface convection zones can explain the observed relations. EBXs with main-sequence components have a similar RO– relationship to that of the binaries in the clusters as Praesepe and Hyade. We compared the X-ray radiation properties of EBXs with those of the X-ray-emitting contact binaries and found that EBXs have broader value ranges for and /Lbol).

Studies on the dynamics of solar filaments have significant implications for understanding their formation, evolution, and eruption, which are of great importance for space weather warning and forecasting. The Hα Imaging Spectrograph (HIS) on board the recently launched Chinese Hα Solar Explorer (CHASE) can provide full-disk solar Hα spectroscopic observations, which bring us an opportunity to systematically explore and analyze the plasma dynamics of filaments. The dramatically increased observation data require automated processing and analysis, which are impossible if dealt with manually. In this paper, we utilize the U-Net model to identify filaments and implement the Channel and Spatial Reliability Tracking algorithm for automated filament tracking. In addition, we use the cloud model to invert the line-of-sight velocity of filaments and employ the graph theory algorithm to extract the filament spine, which can advance our understanding of the dynamics of filaments. The favorable test performance confirms the validity of our method, which will be implemented in the following statistical analyses of filament features and dynamics of CHASE/HIS observations.

本研究分析了2009年3月23日05:50至06:30期间地球磁尾区域的等离子体流动涡度。通过对三颗近地卫星观测到的涡度不均匀分布情况进行分析，发现太阳风中的等离子体逐渐混入近地磁尾区。发现近地卫星观测到的流动涡度和磁偶极子的形成比中磁尾区的卫星观测早大约10分钟。进一步分析发现，涡度与磁场沿着的电流和能量传输之间存在关系，并且导致了电离层伪分裂极光。这表明流动涡度主要通过将质量和能量从太阳风传输到近磁尾区，然后向中磁尾区传播，并通过耗散其主要热能将其遇到的等离子体加热。这些结果揭示了在地磁活动较弱的情况下，在大空间尺度上等离子流涡度的质量混合、能量传输和耗散过程。 <div>
Plasma flow vorticity is ubiquitous in space and plays a key role in material mixing and energy transfer. The five THEMIS satellites orbiting in different regions of the terrestrial magnetotail provide an unprecedented opportunity to study the temporal–spatial evolution characteristics of a plasma flow vortex on large spatial scales. We present an analysis of the flow vorticity that occurred between 05:50 and 06:30 UT on 2009 March 23 during a quiet time of the terrestrial magnetotail. The uneven distributions of the density and temperature of the vortex observed by the three near-Earth satellites (THA, THD, and THE) indicate that the plasma in the solar wind gradually mixed into the near-Earth magnetotail through a series of nonequilibrium processes. Both the flow vortices and dipolarization observed by the three near-Earth satellites were about 10 minutes earlier than those observed by the two satellites (THB and THC) in the mid-magnetotail. Further analysis of the relationship between vorticity, field-aligned current, and energy transport reveals that the flow vortex interacted with the surrounding plasma during its tailward propagation. The field-aligned current related to the vorticity could only generate a pseudo-breakup of the aurora in the ionosphere. Thus, we speculate that this flow vortex mainly transports mass and energy from the solar wind to the near-magnetotail, propagates tailward to the mid-magnetotail, and heats the encountered plasma by dissipating its bulk flow and dominant thermal energy. These results shed light on the mass mixing, energy transport, and dissipation of the plasma flow vortex during quiet levels of geomagnetic activity on large spatial scales.

<div> 星际物质，ALMA，密度结构，SM1N，N6
<br />
这篇文章研究了位于Ophiuchus分子云中的密集星形成核SM1N和N6的密度和温度结构。他们利用辐射传输建模和模拟观测，分析了0.8、2和3毫米的多波段连续辐射。研究表明，SM1N最适合于具有高中心密度（n ∼ 10^8 cm−3）和内部过渡半径约为80-300天文单位的折断幂律或Plummer样式密度剖面。其自由落体时间仅为几×10^3年，排除了存在嵌入的第一静态核（FHSC）或原恒星的可能性。NH2D在SM1N内部可能受到了排除。非热速度分散从NH2D到N2H+和H2D+逐渐增加，可能追踪了在更高密度下的增加的（但仍处于亚音速）向心速度。在N6核区，他们确认了在0.8毫米连续辐射中发现的微弱嵌入式点源N6-mm。NH2D和N2D+避开了N6-mm，在100 au范围内，而H2D+在N6附近没有明显的检测。这些示踪剂的分布与年轻、温暖物体的加热一致。因此，N6-mm仍然是迄今为止发现的最佳FHSC候选体之一，尽管其观测（亚）毫米光度低于对FHSC的预测。 
<br /><br />总结: 本文通过ALMA对Ophiuchus分子云中的星形成核进行了研究。对SM1N进行了密度和温度结构的分析，结果表明它是一个动力学上不稳定的但仍然没有形成恒星的核。NH2D在高密度下可能受到排除。非热速度分散逐渐增加可能追踪了向心速度。对N6核区进行了确认，并发现N6-mm仍然是最佳的FHSC候选体之一。 <div>
We present new Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) continuum and NH2D, N2D+, and H2D+ line emission at matched, ∼100 au resolution toward the dense star-forming cores SM1N and N6 within the Ophiuchus molecular cloud. We determine the density and temperature structure of SM1N based on radiative transfer modeling and simulated observations of the multiwavelength continuum emission at 0.8, 2, and 3 mm. We show that SM1N is best fit by either a broken power-law or Plummer-like density profile with high central densities (n ∼ 108 cm−3), and an inner transition radius of only ∼80–300 au. The free-fall time of the inner region is only a few ×103 yr. The continuum modeling rules out the presence of an embedded first hydrostatic core (FHSC) or protostar. SM1N is therefore a dynamically unstable but still starless core. We find that NH2D is likely depleted at high densities within SM1N. The nonthermal velocity dispersions increase from NH2D to N2H+ and H2D+, possibly tracing increasing (but still subsonic) infall speeds at higher densities as predicted by some models of starless core contraction. Toward N6, we confirm the previous ALMA detection of a faint, embedded point source (N6-mm) in 0.8 mm continuum emission. NH2D and N2D+ avoid N6-mm within ∼100 au, while H2D+ is not strongly detected toward N6. The distribution of these tracers is consistent with heating by a young, warm object. N6-mm thus remains one of the best candidate FHSCs detected so far, although its observed (sub)millimeter luminosity remains below predictions for FHSCs.

<div> XMM-Newton, Fe L-shell, 铁氧化物, 漫射星际介质, 光谱研究

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章使用了XMM-Newton反射光栅光谱仪对Cygnus X-1和GX 339-4方向的X射线双星漫射星际介质中的Fe L壳层消光进行了高分辨率光谱研究。研究发现铁氧化物可能是携带铁的尘埃颗粒的候选物质，但需要更精确的能量标度来验证。该研究提出了对铁氧化物进行新的绝对光吸收测量的需求。 <div>
We present a high-resolution spectral study of Fe L-shell extinction by the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) in the direction of the X-ray binaries Cygnus X-1 and GX 339–4, using the XMM-Newton reflection grating spectrometer. The majority of interstellar Fe is suspected to condense into dust grains in the diffuse ISM, but the compounds formed from this process are unknown. Here, we use the laboratory cross sections from Kortright & Kim (2000) and Lee et al. (2005) to model the absorption and scattering profiles of metallic Fe, and the crystalline compounds fayalite (Fe2SiO4), ferrous sulfate (FeSO4), hematite (α-Fe2O3), and lepidocrocite (γ-FeOOH), which have oxidation states ranging from Fe0 to Fe3+. We find that the observed Fe L-shell features are systematically offset in energy from the laboratory measurements. An examination of over two dozen published measurements of Fe L-shell absorption finds a 1–2 eV scatter in energy positions of the L-shell features. Motivated by this, we fit for the best energy-scale shift simultaneously with the fine structure of the Fe L-shell extinction cross sections. Hematite and lepidocrocite provide the best fits (≈ + 1.1 eV shift), followed by fayalite (≈ + 1.8 eV shift). However, fayalite is disfavored, based on the implied abundances and knowledge of ISM silicates gained by infrared astronomical observations and meteoritic studies. We conclude that iron oxides in the Fe3+ oxidation state are good candidates for Fe-bearing dust. To verify this, new absolute photoabsorption measurements are needed on an energy scale accurate to better than 0.2 eV.

<div> 太阳，微波辐射，恒星活动，关系，环极化 <br />
总结: 该研究调查了太阳微波辐射与其他活动指数之间的关系，发现这些关系可以分为两组。其中，微波辐射与活跃区域强相关的太阳指数可以通过线性函数很好地拟合。另一组中，拟合函数则依赖于频率。同时还首次提出了圆偏振与太阳指数的关系。此外，研究还将太阳微波辐射的关系外推到更高值并与类太阳恒星进行对比，发现恒星ϵ Eri的微波辐射符合外推关系。然而，仅有一个恒星的微波辐射被确认为热辐射，未来需要用射电干涉仪观测更多类太阳恒星，以确认基于太阳数据的关系是否适用于恒星微波数据。 <br /> <div>
Thermal microwave emissions detected from stellar atmospheres contain information on stellar activity. However, even for the Sun, the relationship between multifrequency microwave data and other activity indices remains unclear. We investigated the relationships among the thermal microwave fluxes with 1, 2, 3.75, and 9.4 GHz, their circular polarizations, and several activity indices recorded during recent solar cycles and observed that these relationships can be categorized into two groups. In the first group, the relationship between the microwave fluxes and solar indices, which are strongly related to the active regions, can be well-fitted by using a linear function. In the second group, the fitting function is dependent on frequency. Specifically, the microwave fluxes at 1 and 2 GHz can be well-fitted to the total unsigned magnetic and extreme ultraviolet fluxes by employing a power-law function. The trend changes around 3.75 GHz, and the trend for the 9.4 GHz fluxes can be fitted by using a linear function. For the first time, we present the relationship between circular polarization and solar indices. Moreover, we extrapolated these relationships of the solar microwave fluxes to higher values and compared them with the solar-type stars. We found that ϵ Eri, whose microwave emission originates from thermal plasma, follows the extrapolated relationship. However, to date, only one star’s emission at 1–10 GHz has been confirmed as thermal emission. More solar-type stars should be observed with future radio interferometers to confirm that relationships based on solar data can be applied to stellar microwave data.

<div> 高红移星系，紫外光度函数，星团生成率密度，PEARLS调查，星系演化<br />
<br />
本研究分析了PEARLS调查中的“空白”区域以及CEERS、GLASS、NGDEEP调查/领域的早期发布科学数据以及JADES的第一个数据释放，结合了严格的质量剔除和EAZY光度红移，从而获得了高红移星系的可靠选择和表征。在180平方弧分钟的区域内，我们确定了1046个高于红移6.5的候选星系，并利用这一样本研究了7.5<13.5之间的四个红移区间内的紫外光度函数。在z=8和z=9处测得的星系数密度与哈勃太空望远镜(HST)的过去观测结果相匹配。本研究的z=10.5测量结果介于早期詹姆斯·韦伯太空望远镜(JWST)结果和过去HST结果之间，表明宇宙差异可能是先前高密度测量的原因。然而，在z=12.5处的紫外明亮星系的数密度与模拟的预测相比较高。在检查这一时期星系的星团生成率密度时，我们的观测结果仍然与恒定星团生成效率基本一致，略低于先前使用JWST的早期估计，并支持z≤8的星系引发复离子化。 <br /><br />总结: 本研究通过对远距星系的紫外光度函数和星团生成率密度的分析，结合PEARLS调查及其他调查数据，发现在高于红移6.5的星系中，星系密度在不同红移区间有所不同。此外，还发现了星系的星团生成率密度与模拟结果存在差异，并且支持星系驱动的再离子化在z≤8时期。 <div>
We present an analysis of the ultraviolet luminosity function (UV LF) and star formation rate density of distant galaxies (7.5 < z < 13.5) in the “blank” fields of the Prime Extragalactic Areas for Reionization and Lensing Science (PEARLS) survey combined with Early Release Science data from the CEERS, GLASS, and NGDEEP surveys/fields and the first data release of JADES. We use strict quality cuts on EAZY photometric redshifts to obtain a reliable selection and characterization of high-redshift (z > 6.5) galaxies from a consistently processed set of deep, near-infrared imaging. Within an area of 180 arcmin2, we identify 1046 candidate galaxies at redshifts z > 6.5 and we use this sample to study the UV LF in four redshift bins between 7.5 < z < 13.5. The measured number density of galaxies at z = 8 and z = 9 matches those of past observations undertaken by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Our z = 10.5 measurements lie between early James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) results and past HST results, indicating cosmic variance may be the cause of previous high density measurements. However, the number densities of UV-luminous galaxies at z = 12.5 are high compared to predictions from simulations. When examining the star formation rate density of galaxies at this period, our observations are still largely consistent with a constant star formation efficiency, are slightly lower than previous early estimations using JWST, and support galaxy driven reionization at z ≤ 8.

主要研究了中等质量恒星演化过程中的核部结构及其混合特性，利用声学振动学的方法进行观测和模拟。结果表明随着质量从1.0 M⊙到1.2 M⊙，有效超越参数 αov,eff 呈增加趋势，但随后趋于平缓。这些研究成果对主序星球核心边界的研究提供了重要的参考。总结: 该研究利用声学振动学方法研究了恒星的演化过程中核心结构及混合特性，得出了αov,eff与质量的变化趋势，为主序星球核心边界的研究提供了重要参考。 <div>
Some physical processes that occur during a star's main-sequence evolution also affect its post-main-sequence evolution. It is well known that stars with masses above approximately 1.1 M⊙ have well-mixed convective cores on the main sequence; however, the structure of the star in the neighborhood of the convective core regions is currently underconstrained. We use asteroseismology to study the properties of the stellar core, in particular convective boundary mixing through convective overshoot, in such intermediate-mass stars. These core regions are poorly constrained by the acoustic (p) mode oscillations observed for cool main-sequence stars. Consequently, we seek fossil signatures of main-sequence core properties during the subgiant and early first-ascent red giant phases of evolution. During these stages of stellar evolution, modes of mixed character that sample the deep interior can be observed. These modes sample the parts of the stars that are affected by the main-sequence structure of these regions. We model the global and near-core properties of 62 subgiant and early first-ascent red giant branch stars observed by the Kepler, K2, and TESS space missions. We find that the effective overshoot parameter, αov,eff, increases from M = 1.0 M⊙ to M = 1.2 M⊙ before flattening out, although we note that the relationship between αov,eff and mass will depend on the incorporated modeling choices of internal physics and nuclear reaction network. We also situate these results within existing studies of main-sequence convective core boundaries.

Pulsar timing arrays have found evidence for a low-frequency gravitational-wave background (GWB). Assuming that the GWB is produced by supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), the next gravitational-wave (GW) signals astronomers anticipate are continuous waves (CWs) from single SMBHBs and their associated GWB anisotropy. The prospects for detecting CWs and anisotropy are highly dependent on the astrophysics of SMBHB populations. Thus, information from single sources can break degeneracies in astrophysical models and place much more stringent constraints than the GWB alone. We simulate and evolve SMBHB populations, model their GWs, and calculate their anisotropy and detectability. We investigate how varying components of our semianalytic model, including the galaxy stellar mass function, the SMBH–host galaxy relation (MBH–Mbulge), and the binary evolution prescription, impact the expected detections. The CW occurrence rate is greatest for few total binaries, high SMBHB masses, large scatter in MBH–Mbulge, and long hardening times. The occurrence rate depends most on the binary evolution parameters, implying that CWs offer a novel avenue to probe binary evolution. The most detectable CW sources are in the lowest frequency bin for a 16.03 yr PTA, have masses from ∼109 to 1010 M⊙, and are ∼1 Gpc away. The level of anisotropy increases with frequency, with the angular power spectrum over multipole modes ℓ varying in low-frequency Cℓ>0/C0 from ∼5 × 10−3 to ∼2 × 10−1, depending on the model; typical values are near current upper limits. Observing this anisotropy would support SMBHB models for the GWB over cosmological models, which tend to be isotropic.

The deposition of energy and momentum by supernova explosions has been subject to numerous studies in the past few decades. However, while there has been some work that focused on the transition from the adiabatic to the radiative stage of a supernova remnant (SNR), the late radiative stage and merging with the interstellar medium (ISM) have received little attention. Here, we use three-dimensional, hydrodynamic simulations, focusing on the evolution of SNRs during the radiative phase, considering a wide range of physical explosion parameters ( and ). We find that the radiative phase can be subdivided in four stages: A pressure-driven snowplow phase, during which the hot overpressurized bubble gas is evacuated and pushed into the cold shell; a momentum-conserving snowplow phase that is accompanied by a broadening of the shell; an implosion phase where cold material from the back of the shell is flooding the central vacuum; and a final cloud phase, during which the imploding gas is settling as a central, compact overdensity. The launching timescale for the implosion ranges from a few 100 kyr to a few Myr, while the cloud formation timescale ranges from a few to about 10 Myr. The highly chemically enriched clouds can become massive (Mcl ∼ 103–104M⊙) and self-gravitating within a few Myr after their formation, providing an attractive, novel pathway for supernova-induced star and planet formation in the ISM.

该研究使用Fermi大面积望远镜的观测数据报告了对射电星系NGC 6251的延伸γ射线发射的检测。最大似然分析结果显示，在8.1σ的置信水平下，射电形态模板比点状源描述更好地适配了观测数据，而叶片的贡献占总γ射线流量的50%以上。此外，γ射线能谱显示了核区和叶片区形状上的显著差异，核区呈现出曲线对数抛物线形状，而叶片呈现出幂律形式。长期γ射线光变曲线显示，核区和西北叶片区均未出现显著的通量变化。核区和西北叶片区的宽频谱能量分布可以用单区域轻子模型解释。核区的γ射线是由于同步辐射-自康普顿过程，而西北叶片区的γ射线被解释为宇宙背景辐射的逆康普顿发射。

We report the detection of extended γ-ray emission from lobes in the radio galaxy NGC 6251 using observation data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope. The maximum likelihood analysis results show that a radio morphology template provides a better fit than a pointlike source description for the observational data at a confidence level of 8.1σ, and the contribution of lobes constitutes more than 50% of the total γ-ray flux. Furthermore, the γ-ray energy spectra show a significant disparity in shape between the core and lobe regions, with a curved log-parabola shape observed in the core region and a power-law form observed in the lobes. Neither the core region nor the northwest (NW) lobe displays significant flux variations in the long-term γ-ray light curves. The broadband spectral energy distributions of the core region and the NW lobe can be explained with a single-zone leptonic model. The γ-rays of the core region are due to the synchrotron-self-Compton process, while the γ-rays from the NW lobe are interpreted as inverse Compton emission of the cosmic microwave background.

Streamers bring gas from outer regions to protostellar systems and could change the chemical composition around protostars and protoplanetary disks. We have carried out mapping observations of carbon-chain species (HC3N, HC5N, CCH, and CCS) in the 3 mm and 7 mm bands toward the streamer flowing to the Class 0 young stellar object (YSO) Per-emb-2 with the Nobeyama 45 m radio telescope. A region with a diameter of ∼0.04 pc is located to the north at a distance of ∼20,500 au from the YSO. The streamer connects to this northern region, which is its origin. The reservoir has high density and low temperature ( cm−3, Tkin = 10 K), which are similar to those of early-stage starless cores. By comparison of the observed abundance ratios of CCS/HC3N to the chemical simulations, the reservoir and streamer are found to be chemically young. The total mass available for the streamer is derived to be 24–34 M⊙. It has been estimated that, if all of the gas in the reservoir were to accrete onto the Per-emb-2 protostellar system, the lifetime of the streamer would be (1.1–3.2) × 105 yr, suggesting that the mass accretion via the streamer would continue until the end of the Class I stage.

<title>Assessment of SDSS-derived Galaxy Morphologies Using HST Imaging</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) was foundational to the study of galaxy evolution, having revealed the bimodality of galaxies and the relationship between their structure and star-forming activity. However, ground-based optical surveys like SDSS are limited in resolution and depth, which may lead to biases or poor quality in the derived morphological properties, potentially impacting our understanding of how and why galaxies cease their star formation (quench). We use archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging of ∼2000 SDSS objects to assess the reliability of SDSS-derived morphologies, taking advantage of both SDSS statistical samples and HST’s superior resolution and sensitivity. Single Sérsic fitting and bulge-disk decomposition is performed on HST images for direct comparison with SDSS results. Of the three catalogs of SDSS-derived morphologies considered, none is significantly more accurate or precise than the others. For disk-dominated galaxies (n < 2.5), global Sérsic indices (n) from Meert et al. (hereafter, M15) are preferred. For bulge-dominated galaxies (n > 2.5), Simard et al. (hereafter, S11) and M15 overestimate n by ∼20%, and derived global n from Blanton et al. are preferred. We provide an empirical relation to correct S11 global Sérsic indices. Global Reff from S11 overestimates Reff for the largest galaxies by 0.1 dex. Despite these moderate biases, SDSS-derived single-component parameters are generally significantly more robust than SDSS-derived two-component parameters. The bulge Sérsic index (nbulge) cannot be reliably constrained from SDSS imaging at all, whereas the bulge-to-total (B/T) ratio can be inferred from SDSS (provided that nbulge = 4 is enforced) but has a large random error of ∼0.2.

<title>Formation of Polar Crown Filament Magnetic Fields by Supergranular Helicity Injection</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
To understand the magnetic fields of the polar crown filaments (PCFs) at high latitudes near polar regions of the Sun, we perform magnetofrictional numerical simulations on the long-term magnetic evolution of bipolar fields with roughly east–west polarity inversion lines (PILs) in a 3D spherical wedge domain near polar regions. The Coriolis-effect-induced vortical motions at the boundaries of several supergranular cells inject magnetic helicity from the photospheric boundary into the solar atmosphere. Supergranular-scale helicity injection, transfer, and condensation produce strongly sheared magnetic fields. Magnetic reconnections at footpoints of the sheared fields produce magnetic flux ropes (MFRs) with helicity signs consistent with the observed hemispheric helicity rule. The cross-sectional area of MFRs exhibits an uneven distribution, resembling a “foot-node-foot” periodic configuration. Experiments with different tilt directions of PILs indicate that the PCFs preferably form along PILs with the western end close to the polar region. The bending of PILs caused by supergranular flows, forming S-shape (Z-shape) PIL segments, promotes the formation of dextral (sinistral) MFRs. The realistic magnetic models we obtained can serve as starting points for the study of the plasma formation and eruption of PCFs.

Four years after the discovery of a unique DAQ white dwarf with a hydrogen-dominated and carbon-rich atmosphere, we report the discovery of four new DAQ white dwarfs, including two that were not recognized properly in the literature. We find all five DAQs in a relatively narrow mass and temperature range of M = 1.14–1.19 M⊙ and Teff = 13,000–17,000 K. In addition, at least two show photometric variations due to rapid rotation with ≈10 minute periods. All five are also kinematically old, but appear photometrically young, with estimated cooling ages of about 1 Gyr based on standard cooling tracks, and their masses are roughly twice the mass of the most common white dwarfs in the solar neighborhood. These characteristics are smoking gun signatures of white dwarf merger remnants. Comparing the DAQ sample with warm DQ white dwarfs, we demonstrate that there is a range of hydrogen abundances among the warm DQ population and that the distinction between DAQ and warm DQ white dwarfs is superficial. We discuss the potential evolutionary channels for the emergence of the DAQ subclass, suggesting that DAQ white dwarfs are trapped on the crystallization sequence and may remain there for a significant fraction of the Hubble time.

<title>Shell-type Tidal Features Are More Frequently Detected in Slowly Rotating Early-type Galaxies than Stream- and Tail-type Features</title>

To enhance our understanding of the impact of galaxy mergers on the kinematics of early-type galaxies (ETGs), we examine differences in specific stellar angular momentum within the half-light radius ( ) among ETGs with different types of tidal features and those without such features. This is accomplished by categorizing tidal features, which serve as direct evidence of recent mergers, into shells, streams, and tails, through deep images from the DESI Legacy Survey, and by using MaNGA data for the analysis of the kinematics of 1244 ETGs at z < 0.055. We find that ETGs with tidal features typically have reduced values that are lower by 0.12 dex than ETGs without tidal features. ETGs with shells contribute most to the reduction in . Consequently, nearly half of ETGs with shells are classified as slow rotators, a fraction that is more than twice as high as that of ETGs with tails or streams, and over three times higher than that of ETGs without tidal features. These trends generally remain valid even when ETGs are divided into several mass bins. Our findings support the idea that radial mergers, which are more effective at reducing than circular mergers, are more closely associated with the formation of shells rather than streams or tails. The detection of shells in slightly more massive ETGs compared to streams and tails may be attributed to the fact that massive satellite galaxies are more likely to be accreted through radial orbits, due to the nature of dynamical friction.

<title>Constraining Protoplanetary Disk Winds from Forbidden Line Profiles with Simulation-based Inference</title>

Protoplanetary disks (PPDs) are sites of vigorous hydrodynamic processes, such as accretion and outflows, and ultimately establish the conditions for the formation of planets. The properties of disk outflows are often inferred through the analysis of forbidden emission lines. These lines contain multiple overlapping components, tracing different emission regions with different processes that excite them: a high-velocity component (tracing a jet), a broad low-velocity component (LVC; tracing inner disk wind), and a narrow LVC (tracing the outer disk wind). They are also heavily contaminated by background spectral features. All of these challenges call into question the traditional approach of fitting Gaussian components to the line profiles and cloud the physical interpretation of those components. We introduce a novel statistical technique to analyze emission lines in PPDs. Simulation-based inference is a computationally efficient machine-learning technique that produces posterior distributions of the parameters (e.g., magnetic field, radiation sources, and geometry) of a representative wind model when given a spectrum without any prior assumption about line shapes (e.g., symmetry). In this pathfinder study, we demonstrate that this technique indeed accurately recovers the parameters from simulated spectra without noise and background. Future work will provide an analysis of the observed spectra.

<title>Merger-tree-based Galaxy Matching: A Comparative Study across Different Resolutions</title>

We introduce a novel halo/galaxy matching technique between two cosmological simulations with different resolutions, which utilizes the positions and masses of halos along their subhalo merger tree. With this tool, we conduct a study of resolution biases through the galaxy-by-galaxy inspection of a pair of simulations that have the same simulation configuration but different mass resolutions, utilizing a suite of IllustrisTNG simulations to assess the impact on galaxy properties. We find that, with the subgrid physics model calibrated for TNG100-1, subhalos in TNG100-1 (high resolution) have ≲0.5 dex higher stellar masses than their counterparts in the TNG100-2 (low resolution). It is also discovered that the subhalos with Mgas ∼ 108.5M⊙ in TNG100-1 have ∼0.5 dex higher gas mass than those in TNG100-2. The mass profiles of the subhalos reveal that the dark matter masses of subhalos in TNG100-2 converge well with those from TNG100-1, except within 4 kpc of the resolution limit. The differences in stellar mass and hot gas mass are most pronounced in the central region. We exploit machine learning to build a correction mapping for the physical quantities of subhalos from low- to high-resolution simulations (TNG300-1 and TNG100-1), which enables us to find an efficient way to compile a high-resolution galaxy catalog even from a low-resolution simulation. Our tools can easily be applied to other large cosmological simulations, testing and mitigating the resolution biases of their numerical codes and subgrid physics models.

<div> mirror instability, whistler waves, IC waves, high β, particle-in-cell simulations
<br /><br />总结:
这项研究通过完全动力学的粒子在电磁场中的模拟，研究了在介质内等离子体环境中镜不稳定性的非线性阶段以及随后的哨声和离子回旋波的激发。当镜模式达到非线性振幅时，哨声和离子回旋波同时出现，具有次优的振幅，在磁场强度低的区域沿B(t)近似平行传播。研究表明，激发的根源是被困在具有损失锥形分布的镜模式中的电子和离子的压力各向异性。我们还观察到，离子回旋波在非线性阶段中起着调节离子压力各向异性的重要作用。研究认为，即使在高β条件下，哨声和离子回旋波在镜不稳定性的后期阶段也是一个伴随特征，因此在ICM等天体环境中有望存在。我们还讨论了我们的研究结果对ICM中无碰撞加热和湍流耗散的意义。 <div>
Electron cyclotron waves (whistlers) are commonly observed in plasmas near Earth and the solar wind. In the presence of nonlinear mirror modes, bursts of whistlers, usually called lion roars, have been observed within low magnetic field regions associated with these modes. In the intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters, the excitation of the mirror instability is expected, but it is not yet clear whether electron and ion cyclotron (IC) waves can also be present under conditions where gas pressure dominates over magnetic pressure (high β). In this work, we perform fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations of a plasma subject to a continuous amplification of the mean magnetic field B(t) to study the nonlinear stages of the mirror instability and the ensuing excitation of whistler and IC waves under ICM conditions. Once mirror modes reach nonlinear amplitudes, both whistler and IC waves start to emerge simultaneously, with subdominant amplitudes, propagating in low-B regions, quasi-parallel to B(t). We show that the underlying source of excitation is the pressure anisotropy of electrons and ions trapped in mirror modes with loss-cone-type distributions. We also observe that IC waves play an essential role in regulating the ion pressure anisotropy at nonlinear stages. We argue that whistler and IC waves are a concomitant feature at late stages of the mirror instability even at high β, and therefore, expected to be present in astrophysical environments like the ICM. We discuss the implications of our results for collisionless heating and dissipation of turbulence in the ICM.

卫星围绕宿主星系共同运行并且其轨道极点在较长的宇宙时间间隔内保持不变，形成了动力学上持久的运动平面。这些运动平面在宇宙微观结构的动力学过程中起着重要作用，通过拉格朗日体的动力学变形分析得出它们的形成与局部宇宙网的动力学特性有关。在宇宙学模拟中发现，KPP卫星与拉格朗日体的主要方向存在显著一致性，相对压缩的局部质量流动在早期时非常强烈，直到宇宙约4亿年时的结构崩塌结束，而KPP卫星的轨道极点在此期间开始聚集。KPP可以作为ΛCDM预测的大尺度动力学作用于特定一组原始卫星而形成，这些动力学也塑造了局部宇宙网的环境。

Kinematically persistent planes (KPPs) of satellites are fixed sets of satellites co-orbiting around their host galaxy, whose orbital poles are conserved and clustered across long cosmic time intervals. They play the role of “skeletons,” ensuring the long-term durability of positional planes. We explore the physical processes behind their formation in terms of the dynamics of the local cosmic web (CW), characterized via the so-called Lagrangian volumes (LVs) built up around two zoom-in, cosmological hydro-simulations of Milky Way–mass disk galaxy + satellites systems, where three KPPs have been identified. By analyzing the LV deformations in terms of the reduced tensor of inertia (TOI), we find an outstanding alignment between the LV principal directions and the KPP satellites’ orbital poles. The most compressive local mass flows (along the eigenvector) are strong at early times, feeding the so-called -structure, while the smallest TOI axis rapidly decreases. The -structure collapse marks the end of this regime and is the timescale for the establishment of satellite orbital pole clustering when the Universe is ≲4 Gyr old. KPP protosatellites aligned with are those whose orbital poles are either aligned from early times or have been successfully bent at -structure collapse. KPP satellites associated with tend to have early trajectories already parallel to . We show that KPPs can arise as a result of the ΛCDM-predicted large-scale dynamics acting on particular sets of protosatellites, the same dynamics that shape the local CW environment.

<div> AGN, U/LIRGs, [O IV], [Ne V], Compton-thick
总结:<br /><br />本研究探讨了在超/亮红外星系中几乎完全被周围物质覆盖的“埋藏”活动星系核（AGN），这些星系显示出窄线区的弱电离线。通过使用[O iv] 25.89或[Ne v] 14.32微米线与12微米AGN光度比率的指标，我们在30个局部U/LIRGs的AGN中发现了17个[O iv]-弱（L[O IV]/L12,AGN ≤ -3.0）或[Ne v]-弱（L[Ne V]/L12,AGN ≤ -3.4）的埋藏AGN候选者。对于[O iv]-弱的AGN，我们使用X射线多云环模型估算它们的Compton厚（CT;NH ≥ 1024 cm-2）材料的遮盖分数，平均值与U/LIRGs中的[O iv]-弱AGNs的CT AGNs比例一致，并且远大于Swift/Burst Alert Telescope（BAT）AGNs（23%±6%）。[O iv]-弱AGNs的比例从早期并购（早期）到晚期并购（晚期）增加。晚期并购的[O iv]-或[Ne v]-弱AGNs显示出比Swift/BAT AGNs更大的NH和Eddington比率（λEdd），最大的NH在≳1025 cm-2，接近CT材料的有效Eddington限制。这些结果表明（1）在埋藏AGNs中，周围物质受到高λEdd AGNs对CT遮蔽物的辐射力的调节，以及（2）它们的密集物质具有大的（~0.5±0.1），这可能是埋藏AGNs独特结构的一个原因，它们的物质量可能通过并购诱发从宿主星系中补给而维持。 <div>
We study “buried” active galactic nuclei (AGNs) almost fully covered by circumnuclear material in ultra/luminous infrared galaxies (U/LIRGs), which show weak ionized lines from narrow-line regions. Employing an indicator of a [O iv] 25.89 or [Ne v] 14.32 μm line to 12 μm AGN luminosity ratio, we find 17 buried AGN candidates that are [O iv]-weak (L[O IV]/L12,AGN ≤ −3.0) or [Ne v]-weak (L[Ne V]/L12,AGN ≤ −3.4) among 30 AGNs in local U/LIRGs. For the [O iv]-weak AGNs, we estimate their covering fractions of Compton-thick (CT; NH ≥ 1024 cm−2) material with an X-ray clumpy torus model to be on average. This value is consistent with the fraction of CT AGNs ( ) among the [O iv]-weak AGNs in U/LIRGs and much larger than that in Swift/Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) AGNs (23% ± 6%). The fraction of [O iv]-weak AGNs increases from (early) to (late mergers). Similar results are obtained with the [Ne v] line. The [O iv]- or [Ne v]-weak AGNs in late mergers show larger NH and Eddington ratios (λEdd) than those of the Swift/BAT AGNs, and the largest NH is ≳1025 cm−2 at , close to the effective Eddington limit for CT material. These suggest that (1) the circumnuclear material in buried AGNs is regulated by the radiation force from high-λEdd AGNs on the CT obscurers, and (2) their dense material with large (∼0.5 ± 0.1) in U/LIRGs is a likely cause of a unique structure of buried AGNs, whose amount of material may be maintained through merger-induced supply from their host galaxies.

<div> AGN, dwarf galaxies, outflows, blueshifted absorption, feedback
总结:
该研究探讨了矮星系中的活动星系核（AGN）对流的发现，并使用紫外线吸收特征跟踪了三个矮星系中的出流。在两个对象中确认了出流，第三个对象中也可能探测到了出流。其中一个对象的出流被归因于照射电离，表明在矮星系尺度上有影响。与类似星形成速率的源中的星爆驱动出流相比，该出流速度更快，动能输出更高，可能提供负反馈。此外，在两个对象中检测到He iiλ1640发射线，表明可能有高度电离的AGN风。这些发现为矮星系中的AGN反馈提供了证据。 <div>
While stellar processes are believed to be the main source of feedback in dwarf galaxies, the accumulating discoveries of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in dwarf galaxies over recent years arouse the interest to also consider AGN feedback in them. Fast, AGN-driven outflows, a major mechanism of AGN feedback, have indeed been discovered in dwarf galaxies and may be powerful enough to provide feedback to their dwarf hosts. In this paper, we search for outflows traced by the blueshifted ultraviolet absorption features in three dwarf galaxies with AGN from the sample examined in our previous ground-based study. We confirm outflows traced by blueshifted absorption features in two objects and tentatively detect an outflow in the third object. In one object where the outflow is clearly detected in multiple species, photoionization modeling suggests that this outflow is located ∼0.5 kpc from the AGN, implying a galactic-scale impact. This outflow is much faster and possesses a higher kinetic energy outflow rate than starburst-driven outflows in sources with similar star formation rates, and is likely energetic enough to provide negative feedback to its host galaxy as predicted by simulations. Much broader (∼4000 km s−1) absorption features are also discovered in this object, which may have the same origin as that of broad absorption lines in quasars. Additionally, strong He iiλ1640 emission is detected in both objects where the transition falls in the wavelength coverage and is consistent with an AGN origin. In one of these two objects, a blueshifted He iiλ1640 emission line is clearly detected, likely tracing a highly ionized AGN wind.

<div> 太阳、开放磁通量、太阳黑子、日冕孔、太阳活动区
总结:
本研究通过对2014年9月至10月期间太阳活动的演变进行综合分析，发现在这一时期观测到了显著的开放磁通量增加现象。我们首先发现了开放磁通量增加与太阳磁场的强关联，其皮尔逊相关系数达到了0.94。此外，我们还发现开放磁通量与太阳日冕孔的关联较好，尽管日冕孔仅包含了太阳总开放磁通量的14%至32%。然而，我们注意到开放磁通量的演变与日冕孔面积的演变并无关联。开放磁通量的暂时增加与太阳南极残留磁场的消失有关，这是由于几个月前大量活跃区的磁通向南极流动导致的。此外，我们的分析还暗示了开放磁通量增加与太阳第24个太阳活动周期中最大的活跃区的同时出现可能存在关联。通过这项研究，我们对2014年9月至10月期间观测到的开放磁通量强烈增加现象提供了深入的洞察。 <div>
Coronal holes are recognized as the primary sources of heliospheric open magnetic flux (OMF). However, a noticeable gap exists between in situ measured OMF and that derived from remote-sensing observations of the Sun. In this study, we investigate the OMF evolution and its connection to solar structures throughout 2014, with special emphasis on the period from September to October, where a sudden and significant OMF increase was reported. By deriving the OMF evolution at 1 au, modeling it at the source surface, and analyzing solar photospheric data, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the observed phenomenon. First, we establish a strong correlation between the OMF increase and the solar magnetic field derived from a potential-field source-surface model (ccPearson = 0.94). Moreover, we find a good correlation between the OMF and the open flux derived from solar coronal holes (ccPearson = 0.88), although the coronal holes only contain 14%–32% of the Sun’s total open flux. However, we note that while the OMF evolution correlates with coronal hole open flux, there is no correlation with the coronal hole area evolution (ccPearson = 0.0). The temporal increase in OMF correlates with the vanishing remnant magnetic field at the southern pole, caused by poleward flux circulations from the decay of numerous active regions months earlier. Additionally, our analysis suggests a potential link between the OMF enhancement and the concurrent emergence of the largest active region in solar cycle 24. In conclusion, our study provides insights into the strong increase in OMF observed during 2014 September–October.

<div> HOCS+, G+0.693-0.027, molecular cloud, column density, cosmic-ray ionization rates

在对G+0.693-0.027分子云进行超深的分子线谱观测中，首次在空间中探测到O-质子化的羰基硫化物（HOCS+）。通过对我们观测到的所有Ka=0跃迁的数据分析，得出了HOCS+的柱密度，并推导出相对于H2的分数丰度。与之相反的S-质子化异构体HSCO+未被探测到，并且我们得出其相对于H2的丰度上限。我们还对OCS和HOCS+的比值进行了研究，并发现了高值的宇宙射线电离率对于再现观测到的HOCS+丰度是必需的。此外，我们比较了不同星际环境中的O/S比率，并发现G+0.693-0.027是O/S比率最低的源。最后，我们观察到HOCO+/HOCS+的比率与其他O/S分子对的比率相一致，表明在这个云中S没有因大尺度冲击而明显流失，这与其他源不同，那些源中S的含量仍被困留在冰冷的尘埃颗粒上。


<br /><br />总结: 
1. 首次在G+0.693-0.027分子云中探测到O-质子化的羰基硫化物（HOCS+）。
2. 比较了HOCS+和HSCO+的丰度，并观察到高值的宇宙射线电离率对于再现观测到的HOCS+丰度是必需的。

We present the first detection in space of O-protonated carbonyl sulfide (HOCS+), in the midst of an ultradeep molecular line survey toward the G+0.693-0.027 molecular cloud. From the observation of all Ka = 0 transitions ranging from Jlo = 2 to Jlo = 13 of HOCS+ covered by our survey, we derive a column density of N = (9 ± 2) × 1012 cm−2, translating into a fractional abundance relative to H2 of ∼7 × 10−11. Conversely, the S-protonated HSCO+ isomer remains undetected, and we derive an upper limit to its abundance with respect to H2 of ≤3 × 10−11, a factor of ≥2.3 less abundant than HOCS+. We obtain an HOCS+/OCS ratio of ∼2.5 × 10−3, in good agreement with the prediction of astrochemical models. These models show that one of the main chemical routes to the interstellar formation of HOCS+ is likely the protonation of OCS, which appears to be more efficient at the oxygen end. Also, we find that high values of cosmic-ray ionization rates (10−15–10−14 s−1) are needed to reproduce the observed abundance of HOCS+. In addition, we compare the O/S ratio across different interstellar environments. G+0.693-0.027 appears as the source with the lowest O/S ratio. We find an HOCO+/HOCS+ ratio of ∼31, in accordance with other O/S molecular pairs detected toward this region and also close to the O/S solar value (∼37). This fact indicates that S is not significantly depleted within this cloud due to the action of large-scale shocks, unlike in other sources where S-bearing species remain trapped on icy dust grains.

总结: 本研究考察了引力波源在mHz频段产生爆发的可能性，并发现在本地宇宙中，mHz爆发源的数量可能会很大。研究估计，银河系中可能有3-45对爆发式双黑洞，并且在LISA任务期间可能会检测到约102-104次爆发。此外，研究发现爆发源的数量强烈依赖于它们的形成历史。如果某些地区在最近几百万年内形成了紧凑天体双星，爆发源的比例会显著提高。因此，mHz引力波爆发的检测不仅有助于区分不同的形成途径，还能帮助我们了解银河系不同地区的恒星形成历史。<br /><br /> <div>
The dynamical formation channels of gravitational wave (GW) sources typically involve a stage when the compact object binary source interacts with the environment, which may excite its eccentricity, yielding efficient GW emission. For the wide eccentric compact object binaries, the GW emission happens mostly near the pericenter passage, creating a unique, burst-like signature in the waveform. This work examines the possibility of stellar-mass bursting sources in the mHz band for future LISA detections. Because of their long lifetime (∼107 yr) and promising detectability, the number of mHz bursting sources can be large in the local Universe. For example, based on our estimates, there will be ∼3–45 bursting binary black holes in the Milky Way, with ∼102–104 bursts detected during the LISA mission. Moreover, we find that the number of bursting sources strongly depends on their formation history. If certain regions undergo active formation of compact object binaries in the recent few million years, there will be a significantly higher bursting source fraction. Thus, the detection of mHz GW bursts not only serves as a clue for distinguishing different formation channels, but also helps us understand the star formation history in different regions of the Milky Way.

One intriguing approach for studying the dynamical evolution of galaxy clusters is to compare the spatial distributions among various components such as dark matter, member galaxies, gas, and intracluster light (ICL). Utilizing the recently introduced weighted overlap coefficient (WOC), we analyze the spatial distributions of components within 174 galaxy clusters (Mtot > 5 × 1013M⊙, z = 0.625) at varying dynamical states in the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation Horizon Run 5. We observe that the distributions of gas and the combination of ICL with the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) closely resembles the dark matter distribution, particularly in more relaxed clusters, characterized by the half-mass epoch. The similarity in spatial distribution between dark matter and BCG+ICL mimics the changes in the dynamical state of clusters during a major merger. Notably, at redshifts >1, BCG+ICL traced dark matter more accurately than the gas. Additionally, we examined the one-dimensional radial profiles of each component, which show that the BCG+ICL is a sensitive component revealing the dynamical state of clusters. We propose a new method that can approximately recover the dark matter profile by scaling the BCG+ICL radial profile. Furthermore, we find a recipe for tracing dark matter in unrelaxed clusters by including the most massive satellite galaxies together with the BCG+ICL distribution. Combining the BCG+ICL and the gas distribution enhances the dark matter tracing ability. Our results imply that the BCG+ICL distribution is an effective tracer for the dark matter distribution, and the similarity of the spatial distribution may be a useful probe of the dynamical state of a cluster.

<div> 加速过程，磁层高能电子，HILDCAA事件，太阳风，Van Allen Probe卫星

总结:
加速过程中，高能电子受HILDCAA事件影响，在L值为4.0-6.0的区域获得加速，这一过程发生在HILDCAA事件开始后2.9-3.4天，主要由磁层电磁合唱波与次暴注入的约100keV电子之间的波粒相互作用引起。随着HILDCAA和合唱波的持续时间越长，加速到更高能量的高能电子也越多，这种加速过程是一种自举机制。 <div>
Magnetospheric relativistic electrons are accelerated during substorms and strong convection events that occur during high-intensity long-duration continuous auroral electrojet activity (HILDCAA) events, associated with solar wind high-speed streams (coming from coronal holes). From an analysis of ∼2–20 MeV electrons at L ∼ 2–7 measured by the Van Allen Probe satellite, it is shown that ∼3.4–4.1 days long HILDCAA events are characterized by ∼7.2 MeV electron acceleration in the L ∼ 4.0–6.0 region, which occurs ∼2.9–3.4 days after the onset of HILDCAA. The dominant acceleration process is due to wave–particle interactions between magnetospheric electromagnetic chorus waves and substorm-injected ∼100 keV electrons. The longer the HILDCAA and chorus last, the higher the maximum energy of the accelerated relativistic electrons. The acceleration to higher and higher energies is due to a bootstrap mechanism.

文章报告了在PSR J0344−0901中探测到的两种现象。第一种现象表现为脉冲发射向较晚的纵向相位移动，然后逐渐返回到原来的位置，持续约216个脉冲周期，平均偏移量约为0.°7。在脉冲轮廓的尖峰处检测到偏振位置角（PPA）的变化，以及脉冲轮廓宽度的增加。第二种现象是亚脉冲的明显移动，导致在轮廓窗口内出现不同的亚脉冲轨迹模式。首次识别出四种发射模式，并确定其中三种的模式周期。未检测到脉冲消失。使用旋转向量模型对PPA的变化进行建模得到该脉冲星的倾斜角为75.°12 ± 3.°80，冲击参数为-3.°17 ± 5.°32。我们推测亚脉冲的移动可能与脉冲发射的移动有关。 <br /><br />总结: 本文报道了在PSR J0344−0901中观测到的两种现象，即脉冲发射的移动和亚脉冲的移动。同时鉴定了四种发射模式，并对其进行了分析。通过对偏振位置角的建模，得到了该脉冲星的倾斜角和冲击参数。对亚脉冲移动与脉冲发射移动的关联进行了推测。 <div>
We report two phenomena detected in PSR J0344−0901 from two observations conducted at frequencies centered at 1.25 GHz using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope. The first phenomenon manifests as the pulse emission shifting to later longitudinal phases and then gradually returning to its original location. The event lasts for about 216 pulse periods, with an average shift of about 0.°7 measured at the peak of the integrated profile. Changes in the polarization position angle (PPA) are detected around the trailing edge of the profile, together with an increase in the profile width. The second phenomenon is characterized by the apparent movement of subpulses, which results in different subpulse track patterns across the profile window. For the first time in this pulsar, we identify four emission modes, each with unique subpulse movement, and determine the pattern periods for three of them. Pulse nulling was not detected. Modeling of the changes in the PPA using the rotating vector model gives an inclination angle of 75.°12 ± 3.°80 and an impact parameter of −3.°17 ± 5.°32 for this pulsar. We speculate that the subpulse movement may be related to the shifting of the pulse emission.

<title>The Cosmic Ultraviolet Baryon Survey (CUBS). VIII. Group Environment of the Most Luminous Quasars at z ≈ 1</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We investigate the group-scale environment of 15 luminous quasars (luminosity L3000 > 1046 erg s−1) from the Cosmic Ultraviolet Baryon Survey (CUBS) at redshift z ≈ 1. Using the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer integral field spectrograph on the Very Large Telescope, we conduct a deep galaxy redshift survey in the CUBS quasar fields to identify group members and measure the physical properties of individual galaxies and galaxy groups. We find that the CUBS quasars reside in diverse environments. The majority (11 out of 15) of the CUBS quasars reside in overdense environments with typical halo masses exceeding 1013M⊙, while the remaining quasars reside in moderate-size galaxy groups. No correlation is observed between overdensity and redshift, black hole (BH) mass, or luminosity. Radio-loud quasars (5 out of 15 CUBS quasars) are more likely to be in overdense environments than their radio-quiet counterparts in the sample, consistent with the mean trends from previous statistical observations and clustering analyses. Nonetheless, we also observe radio-loud quasars in moderate groups and radio-quiet quasars in overdense environments, indicating a large scatter in the connection between radio properties and environment. We find that the most UV luminous quasars might be outliers in the stellar mass-to-halo mass relations or may represent departures from the standard single-epoch BH relations.

<title>Investigating Ionization in the Intergalactic Medium</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The intergalactic medium (IGM) contains >50% of the baryonic mass of the Universe, yet the mechanisms responsible for keeping the IGM ionized have not been fully explained. Hence, we investigate ion abundances from the largest blind QSO absorption catalog for clouds that show C iv, N v, and O vi simultaneously. The wavelength range of present UV spectrographs, however, makes it possible to probe C iv and O vi only over a small range of redshift (z ≈ 0.12–0.15). As a result, we only have five IGM absorbing clouds, yet these provide a powerful and representative tool to probe the IGM ionization state. We found one cloud to be in collisional ionization equilibrium while three of the five showed signs of being produced by nonequilibrium processes, specifically conductive interfaces and turbulent mixing layers. None of the models we explore here were able to reproduce the ionization state of the remaining system. Energetic processes, such as galactic feedback from star formation and active galactic nucleus winds, would be excellent candidates that can cause such widespread ionization.

<title>Low-mass Population III Star Formation due to the HD Cooling Induced by Weak Lyman–Werner Radiation</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad2fc9</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Lyman–Werner (LW) radiation photodissociating molecular hydrogen (H2) influences the thermal and dynamical evolution of the Population III (Pop III) star-forming gas cloud. The effect of powerful LW radiation has been well investigated in the context of supermassive black hole formation in the early Universe. However, the average intensity in the early Universe is several orders of magnitude lower. For a comprehensive study, we investigate the effects of LW radiation at 18 different intensities, ranging from JLW/J21 = 0 (no radiation) to 30 (H-cooling cloud), on the primordial star-forming gas cloud obtained from a three-dimensional cosmological simulation. The overall trend with increasing radiation intensity is a gradual increase in the gas cloud temperature, consistent with previous works. Due to the HD cooling, however, the dependence of gas cloud temperature on JLW deviates from the aforementioned increasing trend for a specific range of intensities (JLW/J21 = 0.025–0.09). In HD-cooling clouds, the temperature remained below 200 K during 105 yr after the first formation of the high-density region, maintaining a low accretion rate. Finally, the HD-cooling clouds have only a low-mass dense core (above 108 cm−3) with about 1–16 M⊙, inside of which a low-mass Pop III star with ≤0.8 M⊙ (a so-called “surviving star”) could form. The upper limit of star formation efficiency significantly decreases from 10−3 to 10−5 as HD cooling becomes effective. This tendency indicates that, whereas the total gas mass in the host halo increases with the LW radiation intensity, the total Pop III stellar mass does not increase similarly.

NICER has observed a few millisecond pulsars where the geometry of the X-ray-emitting hotspots on the neutron star have been analyzed in order to constrain the mass and radius from X-ray light-curve modeling. One example, PSR J0030 + 0451, has been shown to possibly have significant multipolar magnetic fields at the stellar surface. Using force-free simulations of the magnetosphere structure, it has been shown that the radio, X-ray, and γ-ray light curves can be modeled simultaneously with an appropriate field configuration. An even more stringent test is to compare predictions of the force-free magnetosphere model with observations of radio polarization. This paper attempts to reproduce the radio polarization of PSR J0030 + 0451 using a force-free magnetospheric solution. As a result of our modeling, we can reproduce certain features of the polarization well.

<title>Observation of Kinetic Alfvén Waves inside an Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejection Magnetic Cloud at 1 au</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Recent advancements have significantly enhanced our grasp of interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) in the heliosphere. These observations have uncovered complex kinematics and structural deformations in ICMEs, hinting at the possible generation of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) and kinetic-scale waves. While MHD-scale waves in magnetic clouds have been explored, understanding the dynamics of kinetic-scale mode waves remains challenging. This article demonstrates the first in situ observation of kinetic Alfvén waves (KAWs) within an ICME’s magnetic cloud, notably near the heliospheric current sheet–ICME interaction region, close to the reconnection exhaust. Analysis indicates a distinctive negative bump in the estimated normalized magnetic helicity (σm = −0.38) around the gyrofrequency spread, indicating a right-handed polarization of the wave. Furthermore, examination across flow angle (θVB) within the frequency domain reveals a specific zone (90°–135°) showcasing negative helicity fluctuations, confirming the presence of KAWs. Moreover, we noted a significant rise in temperature anisotropy in the vicinity, indicating the role of KAWs in plasma heating. Identifying KAW challenges established notions about ordered magnetic clouds and raises questions about energy transfer processes within these structures. This finding opens the door to a deeper understanding of energy transfer mechanisms within traditionally nondissipative regions and invites further exploration of low-beta plasma heating and the interactions between waves and particles in magnetic clouds.

<title>Astrometric Microlensing by Primordial Black Holes with the Roman Space Telescope</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Primordial black holes (PBHs) could explain some fraction of dark matter and shed light on many areas of early-Universe physics. Despite over half a century of research interest, a PBH population has so far eluded detection. The most competitive constraints on the fraction of dark matter comprised of PBHs (fDM) in the (10−9–10)M⊙ mass ranges come from photometric microlensing and bound fDM ≲ 10−2–10−1. With the advent of the Roman Space Telescope with its submilliarcsecond astrometric capabilities and its planned Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey (GBTDS), detecting astrometric microlensing signatures will become routine. Compared with photometric microlensing, astrometric microlensing signals are sensitive to different lens masses–distance configurations and contain different information, making it a complimentary lensing probe. At submilliarcsecond astrometric precision, astrometric microlensing signals are typically detectable at larger lens–source separations than photometric signals, suggesting a microlensing detection channel of pure astrometric events. We use a Galactic simulation to predict the number of detectable microlensing events during the GBTDS via this pure astrometric microlensing channel. Assuming an absolute astrometric precision floor for bright stars of 0.1 mas for the GBTDS, we find that the number of detectable events peaks at ≈103fDM for a population of 1M⊙ PBHs and tapers to ≈10fDM and ≈100fDM at 10−4M⊙ and 103M⊙, respectively. Accounting for the distinguishability of PBHs from stellar lenses, we conclude the GBTDS will be sensitive to a PBH population at fDM down to ≈10−1–10−3 for (10−1–102)M⊙ likely yielding novel PBH constraints.

<title>The Slipping Magnetic Reconnection and Damped Quasiperiodic Pulsations in a Circular Ribbon Flare</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The study of circular ribbon (CR) flares is important to understand the three-dimensional magnetic reconnection in the solar atmosphere. We investigate the slipping brightenings and damped quasiperiodic pulsations in a CR flare by multiwavelength observations. During the flaring process, two extreme ultraviolet brightenings (SP1 and SP2) slip synchronously along the ribbon in a counterclockwise direction. The ribbon and fans between them show synchronous enhancement with the microwave and hard X-ray (HXR) CR source. In the magnetohydrostatic extrapolation results and observations, the dome and outer spine display an evident counterclockwise twisting feature. We propose the slipping reconnection occurs between the fan and outer spine in the null point, which covers the region from SP1 to SP2. The fan of SP1 shows the strongest twist and produces the most efficient reconnection. The ribbon after SP1 becomes weak due to the destruction of the fan configuration. The fan of SP2 is in the front of the slipping motion, which initiates new reconnection and brightens the local ribbon. The twisting of the dome continuously promotes new reconnection in the null point, which brightens the ribbon in sequence to display a counterclockwise slipping feature. Thus, the twist of the dome may trigger and dominate the slipping reconnection, and the rotation of the central positive pole could be one possible cause of the twist. After the peak, the microwave and HXR emission shows damped oscillations at a period of 15 s. The collapse of the fan–spine structure may lead to the standing kink oscillations of the fan to modulate the reconnection and particle acceleration process.

<title>Solar Chromospheric Heating by Magnetohydrodynamic Waves: Dependence on the Inclination of the Magnetic Field</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad343f</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad343f</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A proposed mechanism for solar chromospheric heating is magnetohydrodynamic waves propagating upward along magnetic field lines and dissipating their energy in the chromosphere. In particular, compressible magnetoacoustic waves may contribute to the heating. Theoretically, the components below the cutoff frequency cannot propagate into the chromosphere; however, the cutoff frequency depends on the inclination of the magnetic field lines. In this study, using high-temporal cadence spectral data of IRIS and Hinode Solar Optical Telescope spectropolarimeter in plages, we investigated the dependence of the low-frequency waves on magnetic field properties and quantitatively estimated the amount of energy dissipation in the chromosphere. The following results were obtained: (a) The amount of energy dissipated by the low-frequency component (3–6 mHz) increases with the inclination of the field below 40°, whereas it decreases as a function of the inclination of the field above 40°. (b) The amount of the energy is enhanced toward 104 W m−2, which is the energy required for heating in the chromospheric plage regions when the magnetic field is higher than 600 G and inclined more than 40°. (c) In the photosphere, the low-frequency component has much more power in the magnetic field inclined more and weaker than 400 G. The results suggest that the observed low-frequency components can bring the energy along the magnetic field lines and that only a specific range of the inclination angles of the field and the strength of the field may allow the low-frequency component to bring a sufficient amount of the energy into the chromosphere.

We present the first detection of 13CCH in a protoplanetary disk (TW Hya). Using observations of C2H, we measure CCH/13CCH = 65 ± 20 gas with a CO isotopic ratio of 12CO/13CO = 21 ± 5. The TW Hya disk exhibits a gas phase C/O that exceeds unity, and C2H is the tracer of this excess carbon. We confirm that the TW Hya gaseous disk exhibits two separate carbon isotopic reservoirs, as noted previously. We explore two theoretical solutions for the development of this dichotomy. One model represents TW Hya today with a protoplanetary disk exposed to a cosmic-ray ionization rate that is below interstellar as consistent with current estimates. We find that this model does not have sufficient ionization in cold (T < 40 K) layers to activate carbon isotopic fractionation. The second model investigates a younger TW Hya protostellar disk exposed to an interstellar cosmic-ray ionization rate. We find that the younger model has sources of ionization deeper in a colder disk that generates two independent isotopic reservoirs. One reservoir is 12C-enriched carried by methane/hydrocarbon ices, and the other is 13C-enriched carried by gaseous CO. The former potentially provides a source of methane/hydrocarbon ices to power the chemistry that generates the anomalously strong C2H emission in this (and other) disk systems in later stages. The latter provides a source of gaseous 13C-rich material to generate isotopic enrichments in forming giant planets, as recently detected in the super-Jupiter TYC 8998-760-1 b by Zhang et al.

We detected a giant X-ray flare from the RS CVn–type binary star UX Ari using the Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image on 2020 August 17 and started a series of Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer observations 89 minutes later. For a week, the entire duration of the flare was covered with 32 snapshot observations including the rising phase. The X-ray luminosity reached 2 × 1033 erg s−1, and the entire energy release was ∼1038 erg in the 0.5–8.0 keV band. X-ray spectra characterized by continuum emission with lines of Fe xxv Heα and Fe xxvi Lyα were obtained. We found that the temperature peaks before the flux does, which suggests that the period of plasma formation in the magnetic flare loop was captured. Using the continuum information (temperature, flux, and their delay time), we estimated the flare loop size to be ∼3 × 1011 cm and the peak electron density to be ∼4 × 1010 cm−3. Furthermore, using the line ratio of Fe xxv and Fe xxvi, we investigated any potential indications of deviation from collisional ionization equilibrium (CIE). The X-ray spectra were consistent with CIE plasma throughout the flare, but the possibility of an ionizing plasma away from CIE was not rejected in the flux rising phase.

<title>Constraining the PG 1553+113 Binary Hypothesis: Interpreting Hints of a New, 22 yr Period</title>

<div> PG 1553+113, blazar, quasiperiodic oscillation, 2.2 yr, 22 yr
<br /><br />
PG 1553+113是一个著名的类星体，显示出∼2.2年的准周期振荡(QPO)迹象，这一周期在射电、光学、X射线和γ射线波段均有观测数据支持。研究对其历史光学光变曲线进行了一个世纪的观测，发现了约21.8 ± 4.7年的振荡。尽管这∼22年周期本身的统计显著性只有1.6σ，考虑了观测多处效应后的联合显著性却达到了约3.6σ。22年振荡的次一个峰值预计出现在2025年7月左右。研究还发现，PG 1553+113的两个QPO可以在一个合理的超大质量黑洞二元模型中得到解释，该二元系统的质量比≳0.2，偏心率≲0.1，并从一个特征高度比约0.03的盘吸积。这个假设的二元系统会辐射nHz级别的引力波，但其振幅约为现有脉冲星定时阵列所能检测到的10-100倍。 <div>
PG 1553+113 is a well-known blazar exhibiting evidence of a ∼2.2 yr quasiperiodic oscillation (QPO) in the radio, optical, X-ray, and γ-ray bands. Since QPO mechanisms often predict multiple QPOs, we search for a second QPO in its historical optical light curve covering a century of observations. Despite challenging data quality issues, we find hints of a 21.8 ± 4.7 yr oscillation. On its own, this ∼22 yr period has a modest statistical significance of 1.6σ when accounting for the look-elsewhere effect. However, the joint significance of both the 2.2 and 22 yr periods arising from colored noise alone is ∼3.6σ. The next peak of the 22 yr oscillation is predicted to occur around July 2025. We find that such a ∼10:1 relation between two periods can arise in the gas dynamics of a plausible supermassive black hole binary model of PG 1553+113. While the 22 yr QPO is preliminary, an interpretation of PG 1553+113's two QPOs in this binary model suggests that the binary engine has a mass ratio ≳0.2, an eccentricity ≲0.1, and accretes from a disk with characteristic aspect ratio ∼0.03. The putative binary radiates nHz gravitational waves, but the amplitude is ∼10–100 times too low for detection by foreseeable pulsar timing arrays.

<div> 高红移Lyα森林，离子透过现象，平均自由程ABC推断
总结:
高红移Lyα森林的观测数据显示出强烈的变化，不能仅仅归因于密度场的波动。文章提出了两种模型：一种是在红移6以下进行的晚期复电离过程的假设；另一种是与离子化光子的平均自由程和强离子化背景辐射波动有关的模型。通过ABC推断技术对XQR-30在z = 5.0–6.1的有效光学深度分布进行联合约束，推断出观测数据与平均自由程具有波动的模型相吻合，而且平均自由程的平均值与独立测量结果一致，在z ∼ 5–6时有明显的演变，伴随着光电离速率的快速演化。 <div>
The variations in Lyα forest opacity observed at z > 5.3 between lines of sight to different background quasars are too strong to be caused by fluctuations in the density field alone. The leading hypothesis for the cause of this excess variance is a late, ongoing reionization process at redshifts below six. Another model proposes strong ionizing background fluctuations coupled to a short, spatially varying mean free path of ionizing photons, without explicitly invoking incomplete reionization. With recent observations suggesting a short mean free path at z ∼ 6, and a dramatic improvement in z > 5 Lyα forest data quality, we revisit this latter possibility. Here, we apply the likelihood-free inference technique of approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to jointly constrain the hydrogen photoionization rate ΓHI and the mean free path of ionizing photons λmfp from the effective optical depth distributions at z = 5.0–6.1 from XQR-30. We find that the observations are well-described by fluctuating mean free path models with average mean free paths that are consistent with the steep trend implied by independent measurements at z ∼ 5–6, with a concomitant rapid evolution of the photoionization rate.

<div> 关键词: 振荡再连接机制, 电阻率, 当前密度, 傅立叶变换, 欧姆加热<br />
<br />总结: 本研究通过进行八个数量级的电阻率参数研究，探讨了振荡再连接机制的演变以及与空间奇点相关的周期性。通过在不同电阻率水平下对抗性的非线性MHD模拟的解决，采用小波分析、傅立叶变换和ANOVA三种方法研究电阻率与结果周期之间的影响。结果发现背景电阻率水平与振荡再连接机制的周期之间存在独立性。相反，电阻率对当前密度的最大幅值和其衰减速率的性质以及空间奇点处欧姆加热的大小都有显著影响。 <div>
The oscillatory reconnection mechanism is investigated for a parameter study of eight orders of magnitude of resistivity, with a particular interest in the evolution of the oscillating current density at the null point and its associated periodicity. The resistive, nonlinear MHD simulations are solved in 2.5D for different levels of resistivity. Three methods (wavelet analysis, Fourier transform, and ANOVA) are used to investigate the effect of resistivity versus resultant period. It is found that there is an independence between the level of background resistivity and the period of the oscillatory reconnection mechanism. Conversely, it is found that resistivity has a significant effect on the maximum amplitude of the current density and the nature of its decay rate, as well as the magnitude of ohmic heating at the null.

<div> Cepheids, Gaia Data Release 3, kinematics, Galactic warp, precession rate
<br /><br />
Classical Cepheids (CCs) are used to study the kinematics of the Milky Way using data from Gaia Data Release 3. The 3D velocities of 2057 CCs relative to the Galactic center are determined, revealing differences in the VR and Vϕ velocities of the northern and southern warps. This may be related to warp precession or asymmetry in warp structure. The vertical velocities of CCs are found to be more suitable for constraining the warp precession rate. Based on spatial structure parameters, a warp precession rate of ω = 4.9 ± 1.6 km s−1 kpc−1 at 13 kpc is determined, supporting a low precession rate in the warp model. More kinematic information on CCs will help to better constrain the structure and evolution of the Milky Way in the future.

经典可变星、盖亚数据发布3、运动学、银河扭曲、进动速率。研究使用盖亚数据发布3中的经典可变星数据来了解银河系的运动学，通过对2057颗经典可变星的3D速度进行分析发现，南北扭曲的径向速度和方位速度存在差异，可能与扭曲的进动或结构不对称有关。同时发现，经典可变星的垂直速度更适合约束扭曲的进动速率。基于空间结构参数，确定了银河系13千秒差距处的扭曲进动速率为ω = 4.9 ± 1.6 km s−1 kpc−1，支持了扭曲模型中的低进动速率。未来更多关于经典可变星的运动学信息将有助于更好地约束银河系的结构和演化。 <div>
Classical Cepheids (CCs) are excellent tracers for understanding the structure of the Milky Way disk. The latest Gaia Data Release 3 provides a large number of line-of-sight velocity information for Galactic CCs, offering an opportunity for studying the kinematics of the Milky Way. We determine the 3D velocities of 2057 CCs relative to the Galactic center. From the projections of the 3D velocities onto the X–Y plane of the Galactic disk, we find that the VR and Vϕ velocities of the northern and southern warps (directions with highest amplitude) are different. This phenomenon may be related to warp precession or asymmetry in warp structure. By investigating the kinematic warp model, we find that the vertical velocities of CCs are more suitable for constraining the warp precession rate than the line-of-node angle. Our results suggest that CCs at 12–14 kpc are the best sample for determining the Galactic warp precession rate. Based on the spatial structure parameters of Cepheid warp from Chen et al., we determine a warp precession rate of ω = 4.9 ± 1.6 km s−1 kpc−1 at 13 kpc, which supports a low precession rate in the warp model. In the future, more kinematic information on CCs will help to constrain the structure and evolution of the Milky Way better.

总结: 通过分析Gaia DR3数据，重新审视56个高银纬（∣b∣ ≥ 30°）的开放星团（OC）候选者，研究它们的CMD形态以确认其物理实质。使用pyUPMASK和五种异常值检测算法重新确定星团成员，并建立合成CMD来得出可靠的星团属性。随后，对六个候选OC进行结构参数、年龄-质量关系和质量-半径关系的调查，并利用多维方法综合分析星团的物理实际性。结果表明六个候选OC应当是真实的OC，具有明确定义的CMD特征，并且发现其中两个可能是双星星团。 <br /><br />总结: 通过Gaia DR3数据分析确认了六个高银纬开放星团的物理实质，证实了它们具有真实的CMD特征，并且发现两个可能是双星星团。 <div>
Using Gaia DR3 data, we revisit 56 high Galactic latitude (∣b∣ ≥ 30°) open cluster (OC) candidates with poor shapes of color–magnitude diagrams (CMDs), including unclear and paired main sequences (MSs). We aim to confirm their physical reality and explore whether the special MS morphology is intrinsic to genuine OCs. Initially, we redetermine cluster memberships by integrating five outlier detection algorithms into pyUPMASK. However, this work fails to reproduce the 56 clusters. Instead, we find an alternative set of 56 clusters, six of which are non-duplicates. To ascertain whether the six clusters are real OCs, we build synthetic CMDs to derive reliable cluster properties, including fundamental parameters, binary fraction, and mass of the cluster. Subsequently, we investigate the structural parameters and the age–mass and mass–radius relations of the six candidate OCs. Finally, we utilize a multidimensional approach, incorporating cluster properties, spatial structure, kinematic attributes, and CMD verification, to assess their physical reality as genuine OCs further. Our results suggest that the six candidates should be physical OCs, exhibiting well-defined CMD characteristics. Moreover, we discover two of the six OCs as potential binary clusters.

<div> 关键词: SGR J1935+2154, 磁星, 光谱分析, 爆发, X射线

总结:<br /><br />SGR J1935+2154是迄今为止最多产的磁星之一，其爆发活跃，且发出了第一个与X射线爆发相关联的银河快速射电爆发。研究采用了新颖的时间分辨光谱分析技术，成功探测了磁星爆发的真实光谱演化。研究结果对其他磁星的平均爆发特性进行了比较分析，具有重要的科学意义。 <div>
SGR J1935+2154 has truly been the most prolific magnetar over the last decade: it has been entering into burst active episodes once every 1–2 yr since its discovery in 2014, it emitted the first Galactic fast radio burst associated with an X-ray burst in 2020, and it has emitted hundreds of energetic short bursts. Here, we present the time-resolved spectral analysis of 51 bright bursts from SGR J1935+2154. Unlike conventional time-resolved X-ray spectroscopic studies in the literature, we follow a two-step approach to probe true spectral evolution. For each burst, we first extract spectral information from overlapping time segments, fit them with three continuum models, and employ a machine-learning-based clustering algorithm to identify time segments that provide the largest spectral variations during each burst. We then extract spectra from those nonoverlapping (clustered) time segments and fit them again with the three models: the cutoff power-law model, the sum of two blackbody functions, and the model considering the emission of a modified blackbody undergoing resonant cyclotron scattering, which is applied systematically at this scale for the first time. Our novel technique allowed us to establish the genuine spectral evolution of magnetar bursts. We discuss the implications of our results and compare their collective behavior with the average burst properties of other magnetars.

<div> 关键词: MMS mission, ion acceleration, turbulent magnetic reconnection, energetic ions, particle acceleration

总结:<br />
MMS任务通过测量电磁场，构建了一个湍流磁重连区域的试验粒子模拟，以研究观测到的离子加速现象。研究发现三种能量化的离子类型：离子喷流、Speiser样式的能量化离子以及由湍流场加速至较高能量的离子。大多数被湍流场能量化的离子会多次穿过磁场的零点平面。这些发现表明湍流在加速粒子中起到重要作用，并且最高加速能量受湍流区域的大小限制。由于湍流在宇宙等离子体中普遍存在且在尺度上没有限制，MMS的观测结果暗示湍流可能在粒子加速中起到重要作用。 <div>
Using electric and magnetic fields measured by the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission, we construct a test-particle simulation of a turbulent magnetic reconnection region to investigate observed ion acceleration. We identify three types of energized ions: (1) ion jets, (2) Speiser-like energized ions—both of which carry significant energy but do not produce a strong energetic (>80 keV) tail in the ion distribution—and (3) a separate but sizable population of ions that are accelerated to significantly higher energies (>80 keV) by the turbulent fields. The majority of ions that undergo energization by the turbulent fields cross the magnetic null plane multiple times. By preferentially energizing these particles, the turbulence creates a separate population of ions that mostly exits in the dawn direction of the magnetotail and forms a high-energy power-law tail in the ion flux-energy distribution. We also find that the highest acceleration energies are limited by the size of the turbulent region (with respect to ion gyroradii). Since turbulence is widespread in astrophysical plasmas and has no a priori limit on scale size, the MMS observations suggest turbulence may have a significant role in particle acceleration.

这篇文章报告了对Sombrero星系（M104，NGC 4594）中亚秒尺度喷流的多频和多时期长基线干涉观测研究。利用12、22、44和88 GHz的非常长基线阵列数据，研究了喷流的运动学和紧凑核心的性质。研究发现，在12和22 GHz下可以清晰地检测到亚秒尺度喷流，并且在44 GHz下可以解析内部喷流基地至约70个Schwarzschild半径（Rs）。喷流的视运动测量速度分别为0.20 ± 0.08c和0.05 ± 0.02c。核心的测量亮度温度接近于均衡亮度温度，表明辐射粒子的能量密度与亚秒尺度喷流区域的磁场能量密度相当。88 GHz处测得的核心尺寸（约25 ± 5 Rs）偏离了在较低频率下看到的预期频率依赖。这可能表明毫米波辐射的不同来源，可以通过对流支配的吸积流动（ADAF）模型来解释，该模型进一步预测在230和340 GHz处，ADAF可能主导射电发射而不是喷流。<br /><br />总结: 本研究发现在Sombrero星系中存在亚秒尺度的喷流，并测得了其运动学特性和核心性质。测量结果表明喷流的视运动速度和核心亮度温度符合已有理论预期，但在频率为88 GHz处的核心尺寸偏离了预期。这暗示了毫米波辐射可能来自不同的来源，并且可以通过ADAF模型来解释这一现象。 <div>
We report multifrequency and multiepoch very long baseline interferometry studies of the subparsec jet in the Sombrero galaxy (M104, NGC 4594). Using Very Long Baseline Array data at 12, 22, 44, and 88 GHz, we study the kinematics of the jet and the properties of the compact core. The subparsec jet is clearly detected at 12 and 22 GHz, and the inner jet base is resolved down to ∼70 Schwarzschild radii (Rs) at 44 GHz. The proper motions of the jet are measured with apparent subrelativistic speeds of 0.20 ± 0.08c and 0.05 ± 0.02c for the approaching and the receding jet, respectively. Based on the apparent speed and jet-to-counterjet brightness ratio, we estimate the jet viewing angle to be larger than ∼37°, and the intrinsic speed to be between ∼0.10c and 0.40c. Their joint probability distribution suggests the most probable values of the viewing angle and intrinsic speed to be and 0.19 ± 0.04c, respectively. We also find that the measured brightness temperatures of the core at 12, 22, and 44 GHz are close to the equipartition brightness temperature, indicating that the energy density of the radiating particles is comparable to the energy density of the magnetic field in the subparsec jet region. Interestingly, the measured core size at 88 GHz (∼25 ± 5 Rs) deviates from the expected frequency dependence seen at lower frequencies. This may indicate a different origin for the millimeter emission, which can be explained by an advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) model. This model further predicts that at 230 and 340 GHz, the ADAF may dominate the radio emission over the jet.

<div> ΛCDM, general relativity, Hubble tension, alternative cosmological models, gravitational potential<br />
总结: 这篇文章提出了一种基于常规广义相对论的宇宙学模型，可以解决哈勃张力的问题。重新分析ΛCDM模型的基础，表明广义相对论本身并没有明确规定质量密度的哪一部分作为弗里德曼方程的源项，以及哪一部分作为浓缩物体的引力势源。这为常规广义相对论内的另类宇宙模型打开了途径，并证明ΛCDM模型并非是通常引力源下爱因斯坦方程的唯一解。文章强调了ΛCDM模型中引力势源的来源是质量密度偏差，而不是像牛顿理论中一样的浓缩质量总密度。ΛCDM-NG模型利用了引力势源的自由度，将物质在两个源项之间移动，将引力势的源复原为牛顿形式。在ΛCDM-NG模型中不存在哈勃张力，如果浓缩物体的引力势在某个范围内，而这个范围对于实际宇宙来说并不是不合理的。ΛCDM-NG模型中的减速参数与ΛCDM模型不同，这提示了两个模型之间的区别的一个测试方法。 <div>
We offer a cosmological model based on conventional general relativity (no speculative physics) that may resolve the Hubble tension. A reanalysis of the foundation of the Lambda-CDM model shows that general relativity alone does not specify what fraction of the mass density acts as the source term in Friedmann’s equation and what fraction acts as the source of the gravitational potential of condensed objects. This observation opens the way to alternative cosmological models within conventional general relativity, and it proves that the ΛCDM model is not the unique solution of Einstein’s equations for the usual cosmological sources of gravitation. We emphasize that the source of the gravitation potential in the ΛCDM model is the deviation δρm of the mass density away from its average value, and not the total density of condensed masses as in Newtonian theory. Though not often stated, this is a modification of Newtonian gravitation within the ΛCDM model. The ΛCDM-NG model uses the freedom to move matter between source terms to restore the source of gravitational potential to its Newtonian form. There is no Hubble tension in the ΛCDM-NG model if the gravitational potential of condensed objects (stars, galaxies, and dark matter clouds) falls in a certain range, a range that does not seem unreasonable for the actual Universe. The deceleration parameter in the ΛCDM-NG model differs from that in the ΛCDM model, suggesting a test to distinguish between the two models.

<div> 关键词: MeV pulsars, X-ray emission, efficiency, pair multiplicity, viewing angle

总结: 
MeV pulsars的X射线发射具有较高的辐射效率和硬谱，与Fermi-LAT脉冲星相比。估计其辐射效率在keV-MeV能带上在0.01-0.1之间，需要的对数增倍数为10^4-10^7。这表明MeV脉冲星的X射线/软伽马射线发射可能由GeV光子产生的次级对产生。其差异可能与观测角度或者磁轴倾斜角度有关。 <div>
We report on the properties of pulsed X-ray emission from eight MeV pulsars using XMM-Newton, NICER, NuSTAR, and HXMT data. For five of the eight MeV pulsars, the X-ray spectra can be fit by a broken power-law model with a break energy of ∼5–10 keV. The photon indices below and above the break energy are ∼1 and ∼1.5, respectively. In comparison with the X-ray emission of the Fermi-LAT pulsars, the MeV pulsars have a harder spectrum and a higher radiation efficiency in the 0.3–10 keV energy bands. When isotropic emission is assumed, the emission efficiency in the keV–MeV bands is estimated to be ηMeV ∼ 0.01–0.1, and this is similar to the efficiency of the GeV emission of the Fermi-LAT pulsars with a similar spin-down power. To explain the observed efficiency of the MeV pulsars, we estimate the required pair multiplicity as 104–7, which depends on the emission process (curvature radiation or synchrotron radiation) and on the location in the magnetosphere. The high multiplicity indicates that the secondary pairs that are created by a pair-creation process of the GeV photons produce the X-ray/soft gamma-ray emission of the MeV pulsars. We speculate that the difference between MeV pulsars and Fermi-LAT pulsars can be attributed to the difference in viewing angle measured from the spin axis if the emission originates from a region inside the light cylinder (canonical gap model) or to the difference in the inclination angle of the magnetic axis if the emission is produced in the equatorial current sheet outside the light cylinder.

We present a method to quantify the convergence rate of the fast estimators of the covariance matrices in the large-scale structure analysis. Our method is based on the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence, which describes the relative entropy of two probability distributions. As a case study, we analyze the delete-d jackknife estimator for the covariance matrix of the galaxy correlation function. We introduce the information factor or the normalized KL divergence with the help of a set of baseline covariance matrices to diagnose the information contained in the jackknife covariance matrix. Using a set of quick particle mesh mock catalogs designed for the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey DR11 CMASS galaxy survey, we find that the jackknife resampling method succeeds in recovering the covariance matrix with 10 times fewer simulation mocks than that of the baseline method at small scales (s ≤ 40 h−1 Mpc). However, the ability to reduce the number of mock catalogs is degraded at larger scales due to the increasing bias on the jackknife covariance matrix. Note that the analysis in this paper can be applied to any fast estimator of the covariance matrix for galaxy clustering measurements.

<div> SMDS, RST, JWST, dark matter, redshift<br />总结:<br />在早期宇宙形成的超大质量暗物质星体(SMDS)通过Roman Space Telescope (RST)能够被识别，可以使用拉曼散射望远镜辨别SMDS和早期星系，而James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)的光谱技术能够辨别SMDS的吸收线，结合两者的使用可以更好地研究SMDS，并推测这种新型星体可能由暗物质提供能量，或许可以解开观测到的z>6明亮类星体的超大质量黑洞的起源之谜。 <div>
Supermassive dark stars (SMDS) are luminous stellar objects formed in the early Universe at redshift z ∼ 10–20, made primarily of hydrogen and helium, yet powered by dark matter. We examine the capabilities of the Roman Space Telescope (RST), and find it able to identify ∼106M⊙ SMDSs at redshifts up to z ≃ 14. With a gravitational lensing factor of μ ∼ 100, RST could identify SMDS as small as ∼104M⊙ at z ∼ 12 with ∼106 s exposure. Differentiating SMDSs from early galaxies containing zero metallicity stars at similar redshifts requires spectral, photometric, and morphological comparisons. With only RST, the differentiation of SMDS, particularly those formed via adiabatic contraction with M ≳ 105M⊙ and lensed by μ ≳ 100, is possible due to their distinct photometric signatures from the first galaxies. Those formed via dark matter capture can be differentiated only by image morphology: i.e., point object (SMDSs) versus extended object (sufficiently magnified galaxies). By additionally employing James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) spectroscopy, we can identify the He iiλ1640 absorption line, a smoking gun for SMDS detection. Although RST does not cover the required wavelength band (for zemi ≳ 10), JWST does; hence, the two can be used in tandem to identify SMDS. The detection of SMDS would confirm a new type of star powered by dark matter and may shed light on the origins of the supermassive black holes powering bright quasars observed at z ≳ 6.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章主要使用了大量的红巨星光谱数据，创建了恒星参数的二阶多项式模型，以研究恒星光谱中非恒星信息，如扩散星际带。研究发现，许多光谱残留特征可以归因于来自地球大气和星际介质的扩散星际带的残留。在去除大部分地球大气残留后，确定了84个吸收特征，其中25个是扩散星际带，并且可以为银河星际介质科学和正在进行的Sloan Digital Sky Survey V的银河调查项目提供重要帮助。 <div>
Data-driven models of stellar spectra are useful tools to study nonstellar information, such as the diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) caused by intervening interstellar material. Using ∼55,000 spectra of ∼17,000 red clump stars from the APOGEE DR16 data set, we create second-order polynomial models of the continuum-normalized flux as a function of stellar parameters (Teff, , [Fe/H], [α/Fe], and age). The model and data show good agreement within uncertainties across the APOGEE wavelength range, although many regions reveal residuals that are not in the stellar rest-frame. We show that many of these residual features—having average extrema at the level of ∼3% in stellar flux on average—can be attributed to incompletely removed spectral lines from the Earth’s atmosphere and DIBs from the interstellar medium (ISM). After removing most of the remaining contamination from Earth’s sky, we identify 84 absorption features not seen in unreddened sightlights that have <50% probability of being noise artifacts—with 25 of these features having <5% probability of being noise artifacts—including all 10 previously known DIBs in the APOGEE wavelength range. Because many of these features occur in the wavelength windows that APOGEE uses to measure chemical abundances, note that characterization and removal of this nonstellar contamination establish an important step in reaching the precision required for chemical tagging experiments. Proper characterization of these features will benefit Galactic ISM science and the currently ongoing Milky Way Mapper program of Sloan Digital Sky Survey V, which relies on the APOGEE spectrograph.

<div> 银河系，恒星化学丰度分析，铌和铈，铌增加，铁和镁的关系，铌和铈的空间化学分布
<br />
银河系内恒星的化学丰度分析显示，银河系中心附近的恒星以低铌/镁比例为特征，表明核聚变超新星的产出对这一地区的化学丰度有重要影响。与铌相比，铈的变化更为复杂。对于低镁/铁比例和高镁/铁比例的恒星群体，铌和铈的丰度分布各不相同。总体来说，随着金属丰度的降低，铌和铈的丰度均会增加。最金属贫的恒星显示出早期银河系化学富集的特征，这可能主要受核心坍缩超新星和r过程天体物理地点（如磁旋超新星）的影响。空间化学分布显示，铌和铈的丰度在银河系内呈现出明显的地域性差异，不同的镁/铁比例的恒星群体在丰度分布上也有所不同。

This study probes the chemical abundances of the neutron-capture elements cerium and neodymium in the inner Milky Way from an analysis of a sample of ∼2000 stars in the Galactic bulge bar spatially contained within ∣XGal∣ < 5 kpc, ∣YGal∣ < 3.5 kpc, and ∣ZGal∣ < 1 kpc, and spanning metallicities between −2.0 ≲ [Fe/H] ≲ +0.5. We classify the sample stars into low- or high-[Mg/Fe] populations and find that, in general, values of [Ce/Fe] and [Nd/Fe] increase as the metallicity decreases for the low- and high-[Mg/Fe] populations. Ce abundances show a more complex variation across the metallicity range of our bulge-bar sample when compared to Nd, with the r-process dominating the production of neutron-capture elements in the high-[Mg/Fe] population ([Ce/Nd] < 0.0). We find a spatial chemical dependence of Ce and Nd abundances for our sample of bulge-bar stars, with low- and high-[Mg/Fe] populations displaying a distinct abundance distribution. In the region close to the center of the MW, the low-[Mg/Fe] population is dominated by stars with low [Ce/Fe], [Ce/Mg], [Nd/Mg], [Nd/Fe], and [Ce/Nd] ratios. The low [Ce/Nd] ratio indicates a significant contribution in this central region from r-process yields for the low-[Mg/Fe] population. The chemical pattern of the most metal-poor stars in our sample suggests an early chemical enrichment of the bulge dominated by yields from core-collapse supernovae and r-process astrophysical sites, such as magnetorotational supernovae.

<div> 快速射电爆发，FRB，重复器，非重复器，磁层模型
总结：<br /><br />本文提出了一个统一的几何模型，用于区分重复器和非重复器的快速射电爆发。在这个模型中，考虑了中子星磁层内的准切向传播效应。观测到的偏振特性是验证这一统一几何模型的重要线索，因为偏振对准切向传播效应敏感。此外，我们的模型有效解释了频带宽度，持续时间，峰值亮度，能量，亮度温度，时间-频率向下漂移和重复率等其他区分特性，为支持快速射电爆发的磁层起源提供了令人信服的证据。 <div>
Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration extragalactic radio transients. They fall into the categories of repeaters and apparent nonrepeaters. However, such a classification causes a lack of motivation to investigate the physical picture. Here, we propose a unified geometric model to distinguish between repeaters and apparent nonrepeaters, in which the quasi-tangential (QT) propagation effect within the magnetosphere of a neutron star is considered. In this model, apparent nonrepeaters arise from sources whose emitting region has a smaller impact angle with respect to the magnetic axis, while repeaters come from sources whose emitting region has a larger impact angle. The observational discriminant polarization properties between repeaters and apparent nonrepeaters are an important clue for verifying this unified geometric model since the polarization is sensitive to the QT propagation effect. Moreover, our model effectively explains all of the other discriminant properties, including bandwidth, duration, peak luminosity, energy, brightness temperature, time–frequency downward drifting, and repetition rate, providing compelling evidence for the magnetospheric origin of FRBs.

JUNO将充分利用三种不同的方式——带电流相互作用（CC）、中性流相互作用（NC）和弹性散射（ES）来检测8B太阳中微子的物理潜力，从而实现模型无关的观测。利用液体闪烁体探测器中13C核的最大受电质量和预期的低背景水平，首次可以观测到13C上8B太阳中微子的CC和NC相互作用。借助优化的事件选择和μ子否决策略，可以大大抑制偶然符合、μ子诱导同位素和外部背景引起的背景。在CC、NC和ES通道中可以实现优异的信号与背景比，从而保证观测8B太阳中微子。通过本研究的敏感性研究，我们证明JUNO在10年数据采集后，可以实现8B太阳中微子流的1σ精度水平分别为5%、8%和20%。对太阳物理和中微子物理的详细研究将是独特而有用的。此外，结合Sudbury中微子天文台的测量结果，我们预计可以获得8B太阳中微子流的世界最佳精度水平为3%。 <br /><br />总结: JUNO将利用CC、NC和ES相互作用检测8B太阳中微子的物理潜力，实现模型无关的观测。利用13C核的最大受电质量和优化的事件选择和μ子否决策略，可以实现优异的信号与背景比，从而保证观测8B太阳中微子。通过敏感性研究，证明JUNO在10年数据采集后能够实现8B太阳中微子的高精度观测。 <div>
The physics potential of detecting 8B solar neutrinos will be exploited at the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO), in a model-independent manner by using three distinct channels of the charged current (CC), neutral current (NC), and elastic scattering (ES) interactions. Due to the largest-ever mass of 13C nuclei in the liquid scintillator detectors and the expected low background level, 8B solar neutrinos are observable in the CC and NC interactions on 13C for the first time. By virtue of optimized event selections and muon veto strategies, backgrounds from the accidental coincidence, muon-induced isotopes, and external backgrounds can be greatly suppressed. Excellent signal-to-background ratios can be achieved in the CC, NC, and ES channels to guarantee the observation of the 8B solar neutrinos. From the sensitivity studies performed in this work, we show that JUNO, with 10 yr of data, can reach the 1σ precision levels of 5%, 8%, and 20% for the 8B neutrino flux, , and , respectively. Probing the details of both solar physics and neutrino physics would be unique and helpful. In addition, when combined with the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory measurement, the world's best precision of 3% is expected for the measurement of the 8B neutrino flux.

ram-pressure-stripped的星系成员在62个附近的星团中的速度各向异性分布进行了研究。使用先前确定的62个星团的质量配置文件来构建一个合集星团，通过堆叠62个星团的投影相空间样本。我们通过两种方法解决了动力学平衡的Jean方程，MAMPOSSt和Jean反演技术，并确定了β(r)的参数形式和非参数形式。这两种方法一致地表明，受到拉伸剥离作用的候选星系的轨道在距离星团中心越来越径向，从中心几乎各向同性（β≃0）到在维里半径处非常径向（β≃0.7）。受到拉伸剥离影响的星团星系的轨道类似于螺旋星系星团的轨道，但在大半径处更加径向延长。 <br /><br />总结: <br />本文研究了受到拉伸剥离作用的星系成员的速度各向异性分布在星团中的变化，通过两种方法解决了动力学平衡的Jean方程，并确定了它们的径向延展性。结果显示，在星团中心附近，轨道几乎各向同性，而在维里半径处非常径向。这些结果对于了解星系演化和星团内部动力学有重要意义。 <div>
We analyze a sample of 244 ram-pressure-stripped candidate galaxy members within the virial radius of 62 nearby clusters to determine their velocity anisotropy profile β(r). We use previously determined mass profiles for the 62 clusters to build an ensemble cluster by stacking the 62 cluster samples in projected phase space. We solve the Jeans equation for dynamical equilibrium by two methods, MAMPOSSt and the Jeans inversion technique, and determine β(r) both in parametric form and nonparametrically. The two methods consistently indicate that the orbits of the ram-pressure-stripped candidates are increasingly radial with distance from the cluster center, from almost isotropic (β ≃ 0) at the center, to very radial at the virial radius (β ≃ 0.7). The orbits of cluster galaxies undergoing ram pressure stripping are similar to those of spiral cluster galaxies but more radially elongated at large radii.

We explore the cosmological implications of the local limit of nonlocal gravity, which is a classical generalization of Einstein’s theory of gravitation within the framework of teleparallelism. An appropriate solution of this theory is the modified Cartesian flat cosmological model. The main purpose of this paper is to study linear perturbations about the orthonormal tetrad frame field adapted to the standard comoving observers in this model. The observational viability of the perturbed model is examined using all available data regarding the cosmic microwave background. The implications of the linearly perturbed modified Cartesian flat model are examined and it is shown that the model is capable of alleviating the H0 tension.

The calculation of internal atmospheric (longwave) fluxes is a key component of any model of exoplanet atmospheres that requires radiative-transfer (RT) calculations. For atmospheres containing a strong scattering component such as cloud particles, most 1D multiple-scattering RT methods typically involve numerically expensive matrix inversions. This computational bottleneck is exacerbated when multitudes of RT calculations are required, such as in general circulation models (GCMs) and retrieval methods. In an effort to increase the speed of RT calculations without sacrificing too much accuracy, we investigate the applicability of approximate longwave scattering methods developed for the Earth science community to hot Jupiter atmospheres. We test the absorption approximation and variational iteration method (VIM) applied to typical cloudy hot Jupiter scenarios, using 64-stream DISORT calculations as reference solutions. We find the four-stream VIM variant is a highly promising method to explore for use in hot Jupiter GCM and retrieval modeling, and it shows excellent speed characteristics, with typical errors ∼1% for outgoing fluxes and within ∼50%, but with larger errors in the test case of a deep cloud layer, for vertical heating rates. Other methods explored in this study were found to typically produce similar error characteristics in vertical heating rates.

总结:<br /><br />研究使用地球CIR检测来预测火星上的CIR观测，通过Parker螺旋模型计算到达时间，利用Wind数据推导现场参数，预测结果与实际观测值吻合良好，为未来天问一号观测提供了有益参考。 <div>
Using the Stream Interaction Regions list from the Tianwen-1/Mars Orbiter Magnetometer (MOMAG) data between 2021 November and 2021 December and from Wind observations, we present an accurate prediction for the arrival time and in situ parameters of corotating interaction regions (CIRs) when the Earth and Mars have large longitudinal separations. Since CIRs were detected earlier at Earth than at Mars during the period examined, we employ Earth-based CIR detections for predicting CIR observations at Mars. The arrival time is calculated by the Parker spiral model under the assumption of steady corotation of the Sun and coronal holes, while the in situ parameters are derived from Wind data through radial dependent scaling laws. The CIR prediction results are compared to the actual observations obtained from the MOMAG and Mars Ion and Neutral Particle Analyzer instruments onboard Tianwen-1, as well as the Magnetometer and Solar Wind Ion Analyzer instruments onboard MAVEN. The predicted arrival time is close to the observed values with relative errors less than 10%, and the expected in situ data show a good consistency with the Martian measurements. The comparison results indicate that the prediction method has good performance and will be helpful for comparative analysis with Tianwen-1 observations at Mars in the future.

In the current era of high-z galaxy discovery with JWST and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, our ability to study the stellar populations and interstellar medium conditions in a diverse range of galaxies at Cosmic Dawn has rapidly improved. At the same time, the need to understand the current limitations in modeling galaxy formation processes and physical properties in order to interpret these observations is critical. Here, we study the challenges in modeling galaxy dust temperatures, both in the context of forward modeling galaxy spectral properties from a hydrodynamical simulation and via backwards modeling galaxy physical properties from mock observations of far-infrared dust emission. Using the simba model for galaxy formation combined with powderday radiative transfer, we can accurately predict the evolution of dust at high redshift, though several aspects of the model are essentially free parameters (dust composition, subresolution dust in star-forming regions) that dull the predictive power of the model dust temperature distributions. We also highlight the uncertainties in the backwards modeling methods, where we find the commonly used models and assumptions to fit far-infrared spectral energy distributions and infer dust temperatures (e.g., single temperature, optically thin modified blackbody) largely fail to capture the complexity of high-z dusty galaxies. We caution that conclusions inferred from both simulations—limited by resolution and post-processing techniques—and observations—limited by sparse data and simplistic model parameterizations—are susceptible to unique and nuanced uncertainties that can limit the usefulness of current high-z dust measurements.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Supernova blast wave shock is a very important site of cosmic-ray acceleration. However, the detailed physical process of acceleration, in particular, nonlinear interplay between cosmic-ray streaming and magnetic field amplification, has not been studied under a realistic environment. In this paper, using a unique and novel numerical method, we study cosmic-ray acceleration at supernova blast wave shock propagating in the interstellar medium with well-resolved magnetic field amplification by nonresonant hybrid instability (or Bell instability). We find that the magnetic field is mildly amplified under typical interstellar medium conditions that leads to maximum cosmic-ray energy ≃30 TeV for supernova remnants with age ≃1000 yr consistent with gamma-ray observations. The strength of the amplified magnetic field does not reach the so-called saturation level because the cosmic-ray electric current toward the shock upstream has a finite spatial extent, by which Bell instability cannot experience many e-folding times.

Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can power relativistic jets, which are called blazars when pointed close to our line of sight. Depending on the presence or absence of emission lines in their optical spectra, blazars are categorized into flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) or BL Lacertae (BL Lac) objects. According to the “blazar sequence,” as synchrotron peak frequency ( ) shifts to higher energies, the synchrotron peak luminosity decreases. This means that BL Lac objects as luminous as FSRQs, and with synchrotron peak frequencies Hz, should not exist. Detected as a high-synchrotron peak (HSP; Hz) BL Lac object, 4FGL J1520.8-0348 shows high γ-ray luminosity (Lγ > 1046 erg s−1), being at a high redshift of z = 1.46. Since it is an outlier in the “blazar sequence,” the process of its jet acceleration and power may be different from bona fide BL Lac objects. In this work, we constrain its spectral energy distribution (SED) by modeling the multiwavelength data from infrared to γ-ray regime. Simultaneous X-ray data were obtained from X-ray Multi-Mirror Mission and Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array to constrain the synchrotron emission and underlying electron distribution. On undertaking the SED modeling of the source, including the effect of extragalactic background light, we conclude that the source is more likely to be a “blue FSRQ” or “masquerading BL Lac” where the BL Lac object is actually an FSRQ in disguise.

This paper investigates the distribution and implications of cosmic-ray electrons within the intergalactic medium (IGM). Utilizing a synthesis model of the extragalactic background, we evolve the spectrum of Compton-included cosmic rays. The energy density distribution of cosmic-ray electrons peaks at redshift z ≈ 2, and peaks in the ∼MeV range. The fractional contribution of cosmic-ray pressure to the general IGM pressure progressively increases toward lower redshift. At mean density, the ratio of cosmic-ray electron to thermal pressure in the IGM is 0.3% at z = 2, rising to 1.0% at z = 1, and 1.8% at z = 0.1 (considering only the cosmic rays produced locally by Compton scattering). We compute the linear Landau damping rate of plasma oscillations in the IGM caused by the ∼MeV cosmic-ray electrons, and find it to be of order ∼10−6 s−1 for wavenumbers 1.2 ≲ ck/ωp ≲ 5 at z = 2 and mean density (where ωp is the plasma frequency). This strongly affects the fate of TeV e+e− pair beams produced by blazars, which are potentially unstable to oblique instabilities involving plasma oscillations with wavenumber (θ being the angle between the beam and wavevector). Linear Landau damping is at least thousands of times faster than either pair beam instability growth or collisional effects; it thus turns off the pair beam instability except for modes with very small θ (ck/ωp → 1, where linear Landau damping is kinematically suppressed). This leaves open the question of whether the pair beam instability is turned off entirely, or can still proceed via the small-θ modes.

Current imaging observations of protoplanetary disks using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) primarily focus on the submillimeter wavelength, leaving a gap in effective observational approaches for centimeter-sized dust, which is crucial to the issue of planet formation. The forthcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA) and ngVLA may rectify this deficiency. In this paper, we employ multifluid hydrodynamic numerical simulations and radiative transfer calculations to investigate the potential of SKA1-Mid, ngVLA, and SKA2 for imaging protoplanetary disks at subcentimeter/centimeter wavelengths. We create mock images with ALMA/SKA/ngVLA at multiwavelengths based on the hydrodynamical simulation output and test different sensitivity and spatial resolutions. We discover that both SKA and ngVLA will serve as excellent supplements to the existing observational range of ALMA, and their high resolution enables them to image substructures in the disk’s inner region (∼5 au from the stellar). Our results indicate that SKA and ngVLA can be utilized for more extended monitoring programs in the centimeter wave band. While in the subcentimeter range, ngVLA possesses the capability to produce high-fidelity images within shorter observation times (∼1 hr on source time) than previous research, holding potential for future survey observations. We also discuss for the first time the potential of SKA2 for observing protoplanetary disks at a 0.7 cm wavelength.

<title>Persistent Upflows and Downflows at Active Region Boundaries Observed by SUTRI and AIA</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Upflows and downflows at active region (AR) boundaries have been frequently observed with spectroscopic observations at extreme ultraviolet passbands. In this paper, we report the coexistence of upflows and downflows at the AR boundaries with imaging observations from the Solar Upper Transition Region Imager (SUTRI) and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA). With their observations from 2022 September 21 to 2022 September 30, we find 17 persistent opposite flows occurring along the AR coronal loops. The upflows are prominent in the AIA 193 Å images with a velocity of 50–200 km s−1, while the downflows are best seen in the SUTRI 465 Å and AIA 131 Å images with a slower velocity of tens of kilometers per second (characteristic temperatures (log T(K)) for 193, 465, and 131 Å are 6.2, 5.7, and 5.6, respectively). We also analyze the center-to-limb variation of the velocities for both upflows and downflows. The simultaneous observations of downflows and upflows can be explained by the chromosphere–corona mass-cycling process, in which the localized chromospheric plasma is impulsively heated to coronal temperature forming a upflow and then these upflows experience radiative cooling producing a downflow with the previously heated plasma returning to the lower atmosphere. In particular, the persistent downflows seen by SUTRI provide strong evidence of the cooling process in the mass cycle. For upflows associated with open loops, part of the plasma is able to escape outward and into the heliosphere as solar wind.

Sub/millimeter galaxies are a key population for the study of galaxy evolution because the majority of star formation at high redshifts occurred in galaxies deeply embedded in dust. To search for this population, we have performed an extensive survey with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), called the ALMA Lensing Cluster Survey (ALCS). This survey covers 133 arcmin2 area and securely detects 180 sources at z ∼ 0.5–6 with a flux limit of ∼0.2 mJy at 1.2 mm. Here, we report the results of multiwavelength spectral energy distribution analysis of the whole ALCS sample, utilizing the observed-frame UV to millimeter photometry. We find that the majority of the ALCS sources lie on the star-forming main sequence, with a smaller fraction showing intense starburst activities. The ALCS sample contains high infrared-excess sources ( ), including two extremely dust-obscured galaxies (IRX > 5). We also confirm that the ALCS sample probes a broader range in lower dust mass than conventional submillimeter galaxy samples in the same redshift range. We identify six heavily obscured active galactic nucleus (AGN) candidates that are not detected in the archival Chandra data in addition to the three X-ray AGNs reported by Uematsu et al. (2023). The inferred AGN luminosity density shows a possible excess at z = 2–3 compared with that determined from X-ray surveys below 10 keV.

太阳射电U爆发是由沿着太阳冕区闭合磁环的电子束产生的。本研究利用了2020年6月5日观测到的一个具有显著下行分量的U爆发的LOFAR干涉太阳成像数据。通过分析无线电源的质心位置，我们确定了一个大型日冕磁环的束流速度和物理参数，其高度约为1.3 R⊙。在这个高度上，我们发现等离子体温度约为1.1 MK，等离子体压力约为0.20 mdyn，cm-2，最小磁场强度约为0.07 G。从图像中确定的物理性质的相似性表明了一个对称的环。在上升段的平均电子束速度为0.21c，而在下降段为0.14c。这种明显的减速归因于与Langmuir波共振的电子能量范围的减少，可能是由于下行环腿上的正背景等离子体密度梯度的减小。 <br /><br />总结: 本研究利用LOFAR干涉太阳成像数据对具有显著下行分量的U爆发进行了分析。研究确定了大型日冕磁环的束流速度和物理参数，发现了对称的环。此外，研究还发现在下降段出现了明显的减速现象，这可能是由于下行环腿上的正背景等离子体密度梯度的减小引起的。 <div>
Solar radio U-bursts are generated by electron beams traveling along closed magnetic loops in the solar corona. Low-frequency (<100 MHz) U-bursts serve as powerful diagnostic tools for studying large-sized coronal loops that extend into the middle corona. However, the positive frequency drift component (descending leg) of U-bursts has received less attention in previous studies, as the descending radio flux is weak. In this study, we utilized LOFAR interferometric solar imaging data from a U-burst that has a significant descending leg component, observed between 10 and 90 MHz on 2020 June 5th. By analyzing the radio source centroid positions, we determined the beam velocities and physical parameters of a large coronal magnetic loop that reached just about 1.3 R⊙ in altitude. At this altitude, we found the plasma temperature to be around 1.1 MK, the plasma pressure around 0.20 mdyn, cm−2, and the minimum magnetic field strength around 0.07 G. The similarity in physical properties determined from the image suggests a symmetric loop. The average electron beam velocity on the ascending leg was found to be 0.21c, while it was 0.14c on the descending leg. This apparent deceleration is attributed to a decrease in the range of electron energies that resonate with Langmuir waves, likely due to the positive background plasma density gradient along the downward loop leg.

这篇文章是关于红超巨星（RSGs）的下质量限的研究。通过对6602个星体进行分析，使用了五种不同的方法来区分不同的恒星族群。其中机器学习和χ2方法提供了最佳和相对一致的预测。研究得出RSG族群的下限能够达到红巨星分支的Ks带顶部，表明其亮度低至约103.5倍太阳亮度，对应于约100个太阳半径的恒星半径。根据质量-亮度关系，考虑到失去质量的微弱RSGs，RSG族群的最小初始质量约为6.1±0.4太阳质量。这是第一次光谱证据表明RSG族群的下质量限约为6太阳质量。然而，这些微弱RSGs的命运仍然难以捉摸，并可能对恒星演化和超新星模型产生重大影响。
<br /><br />总结: RSGs的下质量限研究，使用了多种分析方法，确定了RSG族群的下限，并得出了其最小初始质量，为6.1±0.4太阳质量。这为恒星演化和超新星模型提供了重要线索。 <div>
The precise definition of the lower mass limit of red supergiant stars (RSGs) is an open question in astrophysics and does not attract much attention. Here, we assemble a spectroscopic evolved cool star sample with 6602 targets, including RSGs, asymptotic giant branch stars, and red giant branch stars, in the Large Magellanic Cloud based on Gaia DR3 and Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV/APOGEE-2. The reference spectrum of each stellar population is built according to the quantile range of relative intensity (1% ∼ 99%). Five different methods, e.g., χ2, cosine similarity, machine learning (ML), equivalent width, and line ratio, are used in order to separate different stellar populations. ML and χ2 provide the best and relatively consistent prediction of a certain population. The derived lower limit of the RSG population is able to reach the Ks-band tip of the red giant branch (Ks ≈12.0 mag), indicating a luminosity as low as about 103.5L⊙, which corresponds to a stellar radius of only about 100 R⊙. Given the mass–luminosity relation of with f ≈ 15.5 ± 3 and taking into account the mass loss of faint RSGs up to now, the minimal initial mass of the RSG population would be about 6.1 ± 0.4 M⊙, which is much lower than the traditional threshold of 8 M⊙ for the massive stars. This is the first spectroscopic evidence, indicating that the lower mass limit of the RSG population is around 6 M⊙. However, the destinies of such faint RSGs are still elusive and may have a large impact on stellar evolutionary and supernova models.

<div> AGN, SNe Ia, ISM, turbulence, multiphase condensation
总结: 该研究对大质量星系中介质的局部密度层化区域进行了高分辨率的流体动力学模拟。研究发现SNe Ia在介质中产生了主要是压缩性的湍流，触发了介质的多相凝结，形成了多种气体。当净冷却率低于净加热率时，SNe Ia产生的热风席卷了局部大部分物质。需要全局模拟来评估这些气体的最终命运。 <div>
Massive elliptical galaxies harbor large amounts of hot gas (T ≳ 106 K) in their interstellar medium (ISM) but are typically quiescent in star formation. The jets of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) inject energy into the ISM, which offsets its radiative losses and keeps it hot. SNe Ia deposit their energy locally within the galaxy compared to the larger few ×10 kiloparsec-scale AGN jets. In this study, we perform high-resolution (5123) hydrodynamic simulations of a local (1 kpc3) density-stratified patch of the ISM of massive galaxies. We include radiative cooling and shell-averaged volume heating, as well as randomly exploding SN Ia. We study the effect of different fractions of supernova (SN) heating (with respect to the net cooling rate), different initial ISM density/entropy (which controls the growth time tti of the thermal instability), and different degrees of stratification (which affect the freefall time tff). We find that SNe Ia drive predominantly compressive turbulence in the ISM with a velocity dispersion of σv up to 40 km s−1 and logarithmic density dispersion of σs ∼ 0.2–0.4. These fluctuations trigger multiphase condensation in regions of the ISM, where , in agreement with theoretical expectations that large density fluctuations efficiently trigger multiphase gas formation. Since the SN Ia rate is not self-adjusting, when the net cooling drops below the net heating rate, SNe Ia drive a hot wind which sweeps out most of the mass in our local model. Global simulations are required to assess the ultimate fate of this gas.

Quasars are bright and unobscured active galactic nuclei (AGN) thought to be powered by the accretion of matter around supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies. The temporal variability of a quasar’s brightness contains valuable information about its physical properties. The UV/optical variability is thought to be a stochastic process, often represented as a damped random walk described by a stochastic differential equation (SDE). Upcoming wide-field telescopes such as the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) are expected to observe tens of millions of AGN in multiple filters over a ten year period, so there is a need for efficient and automated modeling techniques that can handle the large volume of data. Latent SDEs are machine learning models well suited for modeling quasar variability, as they can explicitly capture the underlying stochastic dynamics. In this work, we adapt latent SDEs to jointly reconstruct multivariate quasar light curves and infer their physical properties such as the black hole mass, inclination angle, and temperature slope. Our model is trained on realistic simulations of LSST ten year quasar light curves, and we demonstrate its ability to reconstruct quasar light curves even in the presence of long seasonal gaps and irregular sampling across different bands, outperforming a multioutput Gaussian process regression baseline. Our method has the potential to provide a deeper understanding of the physical properties of quasars and is applicable to a wide range of other multivariate time series with missing data and irregular sampling.

<div> 关键词: JWST NIRSpec, NGC 7469, 活跃星系核（AGN）, 气体运动学, 辐射/冲击激发
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章利用JWST NIRSpec的新光谱数据研究了NGC 7469这个近距离的活跃星系，重点关注了活跃星系核（AGN）在周核区气体的激发和动力学作用。研究发现AGN的光电离作用占据着星系中心300 pc范围内的主要地位，同时还发现了少许区域的冲击激发迹象，可能与紧凑的射电喷流有关。此外，气体的速度场和速度离散度图显示了复杂的气体运动学特征，旋转是主要的特征，但还发现了与气体流入方向一致的非圆形运动。研究还发现了气体的流入速率远超AGN的吸积速率，并且紧凑的射电喷流有足够的能量来推动高度电离的流出气体。因此，NGC 7469内的气体流入和流出处于自我调节的供给-反馈过程中，射电喷流的贡献有助于推动流出气体。 <div>
We present new JWST NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy (IFS) data for the luminous infrared galaxy NGC 7469, a nearby (70.6 Mpc) active galaxy with a Seyfert 1.5 nucleus that drives a highly ionized gas outflow and a prominent nuclear star-forming ring. Using the superb sensitivity and high spatial resolution of the JWST instrument NIRSpec IFS, we investigate the role of the Seyfert nucleus in the excitation and dynamics of the circumnuclear gas. Our analysis focuses on the [Fe ii], H2, and hydrogen recombination lines that trace the radiation/shocked-excited molecular and ionized interstellar medium around the active galactic nucleus (AGN). We investigate gas excitation through H2/Brγ and [Fe ii]/Paβ emission line ratios and find that photoionization by the AGN dominates within the central 300 pc of the galaxy except in a small region that shows signatures of shock-heated gas; these shock-heated regions are likely associated with a compact radio jet. In addition, the velocity field and velocity dispersion maps reveal complex gas kinematics. Rotation is the dominant feature, but we also identify noncircular motions consistent with gas inflows as traced by the velocity residuals and the spiral pattern in the Paα velocity dispersion map. The inflow is 2 orders of magnitude higher than the AGN accretion rate. The compact nuclear radio jet has enough power to drive the highly ionized outflow. This scenario suggests that the inflow and outflow are in a self-regulating feeding–feedback process, with a contribution from the radio jet helping to drive the outflow.

总结: 本研究通过对小麦哲伦云中X射线暂现星SXP 18.3的观测，首次成功地演示了使用卡尔曼滤波器分析来唯一测量磁偶极矩μ。传统方法无法唯一推断μ，但通过卡尔曼滤波器分析可以避免辐射效率η0的问题。此外，研究还得出了时间分辨率的隐含状态变量估计，如质量吸积率和磁盘-磁层边界处的最大应力。这一成功的演示证实了卡尔曼滤波器分析可用于将来研究小麦哲伦云和其他地方的吸积驱动脉冲星群体的磁矩和盘-磁层物理学。 <div>
The magnetic dipole moment μ of an accretion-powered pulsar in magnetocentrifugal equilibrium cannot be inferred uniquely from time-averaged pulse period and aperiodic X-ray flux data, because the radiative efficiency η0 of the accretion is unknown, as are the mass, radius, and distance of the star. The degeneracy associated with the radiative efficiency is circumvented if fluctuations of the pulse period and aperiodic X-ray flux are tracked with a Kalman filter, whereupon μ can be measured uniquely up to the uncertainties in the mass, radius, and distance. Here, the Kalman filter analysis is demonstrated successfully in practice for the first time on Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer observations of the X-ray transient SXP 18.3 in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), which is monitored regularly. The analysis yields and , compared to as inferred traditionally from time-averaged data assuming η0 = 1. The analysis also yields time-resolved estimates of two hidden state variables, the mass accretion rate and the Maxwell stress at the disk–magnetosphere boundary. The success of the demonstration confirms that the Kalman filter analysis can be applied in the future to study the magnetic moments and disk–magnetosphere physics of accretion-powered pulsar populations in the SMC and elsewhere.

Galaxies play a key role in our endeavor to understand how structure formation proceeds in the Universe. For any precision study of cosmology or galaxy formation, there is a strong demand for huge sets of realistic mock galaxy catalogs, spanning cosmologically significant volumes. For such a daunting task, methods that can produce a direct mapping between dark matter halos from dark matter-only simulations and galaxies are strongly preferred, as producing mocks from full-fledged hydrodynamical simulations or semi-analytical models is too expensive. Here, we present a graph-neural-network-based model that is able to accurately predict key properties of galaxies such as stellar mass, g − r color, star formation rate, gas mass, stellar metallicity, and gas metallicity, purely from dark matter properties extracted from halos along the full assembly history of the galaxies. Tests based on the TNG300 simulation of the IllustrisTNG project show that our model can recover the baryonic properties of galaxies to high accuracy, over a wide redshift range (z = 0–5), for all galaxies with stellar masses more massive than 109M⊙ and their progenitors, with strong improvements over the state-of-the-art methods. We further show that our method makes substantial strides toward providing an understanding of the implications of the IllustrisTNG galaxy formation model.

Recent Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations have revealed an increasing number of compact protostellar disks with radii of less than a few tens of astronomical units and that young Class 0/I objects have an intrinsic size diversity. To deepen our understanding of the origin of such tiny disks, we have performed highest-resolution configuration observations with ALMA at a beam size of ∼0.″03 (4 au) on the very low-luminosity Class 0 protostar embedded in the Taurus dense core MC 27/L1521F. The 1.3 mm continuum measurement successfully resolved a tiny, faint (∼1 mJy) disk with a major axis length of ∼10 au, one of the smallest examples in the ALMA protostellar studies. In addition, we detected spike-like components in the northeastern direction at the disk edge. Gravitational instability or other fragmentation mechanisms cannot explain the structures, given the central stellar mass of ∼0.2 M⊙ and the disk mass of ≳10−4M⊙. Instead, we propose that these small spike structures were formed by a recent dynamic magnetic flux transport event due to interchange instability that would be favorable to occur if the parental core has a strong magnetic field. The presence of complex arc-like structures on a larger (∼2000 au) scale in the same direction as the spike structures suggests that the event was not single. Such episodic, dynamical events may play an important role in maintaining the compact nature of the protostellar disk in the complex gas envelope during the main accretion phase.

This paper presents the multiscale temperature structures in the Milky Way (MW) hot gas, as part of the XMM-Newton Line Emission Analysis Program, surveying the O vii, O viii, and Fe-L band emission features in the XMM-Newton archive. In particular, we define two temperature tracers, IOVIII/IOVII (O87) and IFeL/(IOVII + IOVIII) (FeO). These two ratios cannot be explained simultaneously using single-temperature collisional ionization models, which indicates the need for multitemperature structures in hot gas. In addition, we show three large-scale features in the hot gas: the eROSITA bubbles around the Galactic center (GC), the disk, and the halo. In the eROSITA bubbles, the observed line ratios can be explained by a log-normal temperature distribution with a median of and a scatter of σT ≈ 0.2 dex. Beyond the bubbles, the line ratio dependence on the Galactic latitude suggests higher temperatures around the midplane of the MW disk. The scale height of the temperature variation is estimated to be ≈2 kpc assuming an average distance of 5 kpc for the hot gas. The halo component is characterized by the dependence on the distance to the GC, showing a temperature decline from to 5.8. Furthermore, we extract the autocorrelation and cross-correlation functions to investigate the small-scale structures. O87 and FeO ratios show a consistent autocorrelation scale of ≈5° (i.e., ≈400 pc at 5 kpc), which is consistent with the expected physical sizes of X-ray bubbles associated with star-forming regions or supernova remnants. Finally, we examine the cross-correlation between the hot and UV-detected warm gas and show an intriguing anticorrelation.

We report the discovery of 15 exceptionally luminous 10 ≲ z ≲ 14 candidate galaxies discovered in the first 0.28 deg2 of JWST/NIRCam imaging from the COSMOS-Web survey. These sources span rest-frame UV magnitudes of −20.5 > MUV > −22, and thus constitute the most intrinsically luminous z ≳ 10 candidates identified by JWST to date. Selected via NIRCam imaging, deep ground-based observations corroborate their detection and help significantly constrain their photometric redshifts. We analyze their spectral energy distributions using multiple open-source codes and evaluate the probability of low-redshift solutions; we conclude that 12/15 (80%) are likely genuine z ≳ 10 sources and 3/15 (20%) likely low-redshift contaminants. Three of our z ∼ 12 candidates push the limits of early stellar mass assembly: they have estimated stellar masses ∼ 5 × 109M⊙, implying an effective stellar baryon fraction of ϵ⋆ ∼ 0.2−0.5, where ϵ⋆ ≡ M⋆/(fbMhalo). The assembly of such stellar reservoirs is made possible due to rapid, burst-driven star formation on timescales < 100 Myr where the star formation rate may far outpace the growth of the underlying dark matter halos. This is supported by the similar volume densities inferred for M⋆ ∼ 1010M⊙ galaxies relative to M⋆ ∼ 109M⊙—both about 10−6 Mpc−3—implying they live in halos of comparable mass. At such high redshifts, the duty cycle for starbursts would be of order unity, which could cause the observed change in the shape of the UV luminosity function from a double power law to a Schechter function at z ≈ 8. Spectroscopic redshift confirmation and ensuing constraints of their masses will be critical to understand how, and if, such early massive galaxies push the limits of galaxy formation in the Lambda cold dark matter paradigm.

总结: 该研究调查了原始大气中X射线和紫外光诱导光蒸发的扩散极限。研究发现，由于受到粒子碰撞较少的顶层大气控制，质量损失导致的成分分馏比目前认为的更为显著。顶层大气中的这种分馏导致形成向下延伸的成分梯度。质量流出最终达到稳定状态，其中氢损失受到扩散限制。我们推导了扩散限制质量流失速率和交叉质量的新的解析表达式。 <div>
Photoevaporation is thought to play an important role in early planetary evolution. In this study, we investigate the diffusion limit of X-ray- and ultraviolet-induced photoevaporation in primordial atmospheres. We find that compositional fractionation resulting from mass loss is more significant than currently recognized, because it is controlled by the conditions at the top of the atmosphere, where particle collisions are less frequent. Such fractionation at the top of the atmosphere develops a compositional gradient that extends downward. The mass outflow eventually reaches a steady state in which the hydrogen loss is diffusion-limited. We derive new analytic expressions for the diffusion-limited mass-loss rate and the crossover mass.

<div> TESS, photometry, AM Her, AR UMa, accretion
<br /><br />
这篇文章讨论了绕爆发变星AM Herculis（AM Her）和AR Ursae Majoris（AR UMa）的照度测量，以及高速光度测量。AM Her显示出多种高能态，经常在它们之间进行转换。低能态AR UMa的TESS光度测量没有显示出吸积的证据，而麦克唐纳2.1米望远镜捕捉到AR UMa处于高吸积态。AR UMa的低能态时罗切波溢出被关闭，而AM Her的低能态通常仍然发生吸积。我们推导出AM Her和AR UMa的倾斜角分别为50°和70°。为了对AM Her的高能态光变曲线进行建模，我们采用了自组织图光变分类方案，以建立常见的吸积结构。然后，轨道辐射特性可用于在白矮星表面上生产发射区域地图。AM Her的吸积几何结构最符合多极场结构。AR UMa的高能态具有随机吸积耀斑，我们将其归因于通过内拉格朗日点L1的磁碰撞质量转移。为了考虑这种可能性，我们检查了两颗恒星的磁性，并认为L1附近的局部磁场可以引发短暂的吸积事件，并影响AM Her和AR UMa之间的高低能态转换。特别是，AR UMa的默认状态是低能态，而AM Her和大多数其他的活跃的爆发变星的默认状态是高能态。
<br /><br />总结: TESS卫星对AM Her和AR UMa进行了照度测量，并发现它们在高、低能态之间频繁转换。AR UMa的低能态下没有吸积迹象，但在高能态下由麦克唐纳2.1米望远镜观测到了强吸积。AM Her和AR UMa的倾斜角分别为50°和70°。AM Her的吸积几何结构最符合多极场结构，而AR UMa的高能态表现出随机吸积耀斑，磁碰撞质量转移可能导致这种现象。 <div>
Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) photometry of the polars AM Herculis (AM Her) and AR Ursae Majoris (AR UMa) is presented, along with high-speed photometry. AM Her shows a variety of high states with frequent transitions between them. TESS photometry of AR UMa in the low state reveals no evidence of accretion, while the McDonald 2.1 m telescope caught AR UMa in its high accretion state. Roche-lobe overflow is shut off during low states of AR UMa, while accretion often still takes place during low states of AM Her. We derive inclinations of 50° and 70° for AM Her and AR UMa respectively. To model the high-state light curves of AM Her, we employ a self-organized map light-curve classification scheme to establish common accretion configurations. The cyclotron radiation properties then allow the production of emission region maps on the surface of the white dwarf. The accretion geometry of AM Her is most consistent with a multipolar field structure. The high-state photometry of AR UMa has stochastic accretion flaring, which we attribute to magnetically buffeted mass transfer through the inner Lagrangian point L1. To consider this possibility, we examine the magnetism of both stars and argue that the local magnetic field near L1 can initiate short-lived accretion events and affect transitions between high and low accretion states in both AM Her and AR UMa. In particular, AR UMa has the low state as its default, while AM Her and most other active polars are in the high state by default.

<div> BCDs,星团群落,星系,持续恒定的星形成,星系演化
总结:<br /><br />这项研究使用哈勃太空望远镜的高分辨率图像对ESO185-IG13、ESO338-IG04和Haro11三个蓝色紧凑矮星系(BCD)的星团群落进行了研究，首次探索了100百万年之前的星团群落。BCDs据信会在长期的寂静期之后经历强烈的星形成爆发，但关于这些爆发的时间、频率、持续时间和强度以及它们的星形成历史知之甚少。研究发现，被研究的三个星系中的星团群落分布色彩各异，因此具有独特的星团群落和星形成历史。通过假设星团质量函数的归一化与宿主星系的星形成率之间的关联，研究人员建立了基于星团的星形成历史，发现只有Haro11目前正经历着一次爆发，而ESO185在10到40百万年前曾经历了增强的星形成，ESO338在过去几十亿年中的星形成历史相对持续稳定。这些发现表明，并非所有BCDs都在目前经历星形成爆发，并且一些星系在过去几十亿年中一直以相当稳定的速率形成星团和星系（变化幅度大约为2-3倍）。这一情景类似于矮星系和矮星爆星系的星形成历史，它们的星形成率比BCDs低10-1000倍。 <div>
We present a new study of the cluster populations in the blue compact dwarf galaxies (BCD) ESO185-IG13, ESO338-IG04, and Haro11, based on new and archival high-resolution images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, and the first to probe the populations older than ≈100 Myr. BCDs are believed to experience intense bursts of star formation (including at the present day) after long periods of quiescence, but little is known about the timing, frequency, duration, and strength of these bursts or about their star formation histories in general. We find that the cluster population in each of the three galaxies studied here has its own unique distribution of colors and hence a unique cluster and star formation history. From an assumed correlation between the normalization of the cluster mass function and the star formation rate of the host galaxy, we construct cluster-based star formation histories over the past ≈few × Gyr and find that only Haro11 is currently experiencing a burst (≈factor of 10 increase in the rate of star formation for the last ≈20 Myr), whereas ESO185 experienced enhanced star formation (by a factor ≈4) between 10 and 40 Myr ago, and ESO338 has had a fairly constant SFH over the past few Gyr. These findings indicate that not all BCDs are experiencing a burst of star formation at the present day, and that some have been forming stars and clusters at a fairly steady rate (within a factor of ≈2–3) over the past few Gyr. This scenario is similar to the histories of dwarf irregular and dwarf starburst galaxies, which have star formation rates that are 10–1000 times lower than those in BCDs.

The nearby type II supernova, SN 2023ixf in M101 exhibits signatures of early time interaction with circumstellar material in the first week postexplosion. This material may be the consequence of prior mass loss suffered by the progenitor, which possibly manifested in the form of a detectable presupernova outburst. We present an analysis of long-baseline preexplosion photometric data in the g, w, r, i, z, and y filters from Pan-STARRS as part of the Young Supernova Experiment, spanning ∼5000 days. We find no significant detections in the Pan-STARRS preexplosion light curves. We train a multilayer perceptron neural network to classify presupernova outbursts. We find no evidence of eruptive presupernova activity to a limiting absolute magnitude of −7 mag. The limiting magnitudes from the full set of gwrizy (average absolute magnitude ≈ −8 mag) data are consistent with previous preexplosion studies. We use deep photometry from the literature to constrain the progenitor of SN 2023ixf, finding that these data are consistent with a dusty red supergiant progenitor with luminosity ≈ 5.12 and temperature ≈ 3950 K, corresponding to a mass of 14–20 M⊙.

研究太阳探测器帕克太阳探测器(PSP)在接近太阳时的太阳风湍流各向异性。使用Adhikari等人的方法，导出了理论方程，计算了在惯性范围内的二维和板条磁能量、动能的波动比率以及向外/向内的Elsässer能量。在能量含量范围内，我们假设波数k−1的幂律关系。在惯性范围内，磁场波动和向外/向内的Elsässer能量，我们考虑(1)二维和板条波动都服从k−5/3的幂律，以及(2)二维和板条波动分别服从k−5/3和k−3/2的幂律。对于速度波动，我们假设二维和板条成分都服从k−3/2的幂律。我们将惯性范围内的理论方差各向异性与PSP测得的观测值进行比较，发现二维波动的能量密度大于板条波动。而在关于二维和板条湍流之间的k−5/3和k−3/2幂率的理论方差各向异性方面，显示出比假设相同的k−5/3幂率更小的值。最后，PSP测得的湍流能量在能量含量范围内与几乎不可压缩/板条湍流描述的理论结果相似。
<br /><br />总结: 本研究使用PSP接近太阳进行的遇到数据，对太阳风湍流的各向异性进行了研究。通过理论推导和观测比较，得出了二维波动的能量密度大于板条波动的结论。此外，在磁场波动的幂率方面，采用k−5/3和k−3/2的理论值得出的理论结果更小。最后，实测的湍流能量与几乎不可压缩/板条湍流描述的理论结果相似。 <div>
We study solar wind turbulence anisotropy in the inertial and energy-containing ranges in the inbound and outbound directions during encounters 1–9 by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) for distances between ∼21 and 65 R⊙. Using the Adhikari et al. approach, we derive theoretical equations to calculate the ratio between the 2D and slab fluctuating magnetic energy, fluctuating kinetic energy, and the outward/inward Elsässer energy in the inertial range. For this, in the energy-containing range, we assume a wavenumber k−1 power law. In the inertial range, for the magnetic field fluctuations and the outward/inward Elsässer energy, we consider that (i) both 2D and slab fluctuations follow a power law of k−5/3, and (ii) the 2D and slab fluctuations follow the power laws with k−5/3 and k−3/2, respectively. For the velocity fluctuations, we assume that both the 2D and slab components follow a k−3/2 power law. We compare the theoretical results of the variance anisotropy in the inertial range with the derived observational values measured by PSP, and find that the energy density of 2D fluctuations is larger than that of the slab fluctuations. The theoretical variance anisotropy in the inertial range relating to the k−5/3 and k−3/2 power laws between 2D and slab turbulence exhibits a smaller value in comparison to assuming the same power law k−5/3 between 2D and slab turbulence. Finally, the observed turbulence energy measured by PSP in the energy-containing range is found to be similar to the theoretical result of a nearly incompressible/slab turbulence description.

总结：<br />
本文提出了一种基于块矩阵乘法规则的光谱展宽函数（BF）的扩展形式，称为二进制BF（BBF）。该方法可以使用两个光谱模板为二进制星系统的各个组成部分产生分解的BF，并用于推导单个组分的精确旋转剖面和径向速度。通过对模拟光谱和实际观测光谱进行测试，证明了该方法在光谱双星系统上是可行的，即使两个恒星组分的光谱线严重重叠。我们还通过模拟实施了使用BBF进行“勾画”（成像）食双星行星的能力。此外，我们还讨论了实施问题，例如BBF随偏差模板的变化，BBF的利弊以及不适用该方法的情况。 <div>
We propose an extended formalism for the spectral broadening function (BF) based on the multiplication rule of block matrices. The formalism, which we named the binary BF (BBF), can produce decomposed BFs for individual components of a binary star system by using two spectral templates. The decomposed BFs can be used to derive precise rotational profiles and radial velocities for individual components. We test the BBF on simulated spectra and actual observational spectra to show that the method is feasible on spectroscopic binaries, even when the spectral lines of two stellar components are heavily blended. To demonstrate the capability of the method, we conduct a simulation of “sketching” (imaging) a transiting circumbinary exoplanet using the BBF. We also discuss issues of implementation such as the variation of BBF with biased templates, the pros and cons of BBF, and cases when the method is not applicable.

If a Galactic core-collapse supernova explosion occurs in the future, it will be critical to rapidly alert the community to the direction of the supernova by utilizing neutrino signals in order to enable the initiation of follow-up optical observations. In addition, there is anticipation that observation of the diffuse supernova neutrino background will yield discoveries in the near future, given that experimental upper limits are approaching theoretical predictions. We have developed a new supernova event simulator for water Cherenkov neutrino detectors, such as the highly sensitive Super-Kamiokande. This simulator calculates the neutrino interaction in water for two simulation purposes, individual core-collapse supernova bursts and diffuse supernova neutrino background. Based on this simulator, we can evaluate the precision in determining the location of supernovae and estimate the expected number of events related to the diffuse supernova neutrino background in Super-Kamiokande. In this paper, we describe the basic structure of the simulator and its demonstration.

<br /><br />总结:
本研究首次使用仅近红外数据对超新星同胞进行分析。通过对已发表的近红外光度数据进行校准，并使用SALT3-NIR和SNooPy模型拟合光度曲线，发现同胞之间绝对视星等差异中位数为0.248和0.186等级。通过模拟实验估计了这些差异的不确定性，并发现统计上，在近红外波段不存在内在散射的可能性。与仅使用光学数据相比，同一组超新星同胞之间的绝对视星等差异中位数为0.177等级。目前尚不清楚这些结果是由于统计数据不足还是近红外数据质量不佳，这些问题都将在南希·格雷斯·罗曼空间望远镜的使用中得到改善。 <div>
The study of supernova (SN) siblings, supernovae with the same host galaxy, is an important avenue for understanding and measuring the properties of Type Ia SN Ia light curves (LCs). Thus far, sibling analyses have mainly focused on optical LC data. Considering that LCs in the near-infrared (NIR) are expected to be better standard candles than those in the optical, we carry out the first analysis compiling SN siblings with only NIR data. We perform an extensive literature search of all SN siblings and find six sets of siblings with published NIR photometry. We calibrate each set of siblings ensuring they are on homogeneous photometric systems, fit the LCs with the SALT3-NIR and SNooPy models, and find median absolute differences in μ values between siblings of 0.248 and 0.186 mag, respectively. To evaluate the significance of these differences beyond measurement noise, we run simulations that mimic these LCs and provide an estimate for uncertainty on these median absolute differences of ∼0.052 mag, and we find that, statistically, our analysis rules out the nonexistence of intrinsic scatter in the NIR at the 99% level. When comparing the same sets of SN siblings, we observe a median absolute difference in μ values between siblings of 0.177 mag when using optical data alone as compared to 0.186 mag when using NIR data alone. It is unclear if these results may be due to limited statistics or poor quality NIR data, all of which will be improved with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.

总结:<br />
本文介绍了使用机器学习模型预测球状星团（GCs）中的中等质量黑洞（IMBHs）的方法及其局限性。作者使用 anchors 方法和 Certifiably Optimal RulE ListS (CORELS) 在解释性和可解释性方面进行了研究，以解决模型的不透明性问题。他们还通过测量模拟数据的真实性来评估模型的偏见，以减轻模型在外推时产生偏见预测的风险。最后，他们将这些分类器应用于真实GC数据，得到了预测的分类、预测置信度、异常值检测等信息。文章提出了对于GC中IMBH的预测方法，并对模型的解释性和泛化能力进行了深入探讨。 <div>
Definitive evidence that globular clusters (GCs) host intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) is elusive. Machine-learning (ML) models trained on GC simulations can in principle predict IMBH host candidates based on observable features. This approach has two limitations: first, an accurate ML model is expected to be a black box due to complexity; second, despite our efforts to simulate GCs realistically, the simulation physics or initial conditions may fail to reflect reality fully. Therefore our training data may be biased, leading to a failure in generalization to observational data. Both the first issue—explainability/interpretability—and the second—out of distribution generalization and fairness—are active areas of research in ML. Here we employ techniques from these fields to address them: we use the anchors method to explain an Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) classifier; we also independently train a natively interpretable model using Certifiably Optimal RulE ListS (CORELS). The resulting model has a clear physical meaning, but loses some performance with respect to XGBoost. We evaluate potential candidates in real data based not only on classifier predictions but also on their similarity to the training data, measured by the likelihood of a kernel density estimation model. This measures the realism of our simulated data and mitigates the risk that our models may produce biased predictions by working in extrapolation. We apply our classifiers to real GCs, obtaining a predicted classification, a measure of the confidence of the prediction, an out-of-distribution flag, a local rule explaining the prediction of XGBoost, and a global rule from CORELS.

<div> 关键词: 磁场演化, 太阳系外行星, 潮汐相互作用, 卫星保留, 辐射功率

总结:
本文研究了气态巨行星与其母恒星和它的系外卫星之间的磁性和潮汐相互作用，重点关注它们的保留情况。首先，讨论了行星地核生成的标度定律，然后根据维里定理构建了行星磁场的演化规律，并发现初始熵对高质量行星的磁场演化非常重要。在估计了星-行星和行星-卫星磁相互作用引起的磁力矩后，发现它可以补偿潮汐力，并绕过动力潮汐响应无效的频谷。对于卫星的保留，考虑了两种情况。在存在环绕行星的盘的情况下，通过比较盘的内外半径，发现磁场过强或与母恒星距离过近的行星很难容纳卫星。在后续的无盘演化中，通过比较行星的减速和卫星迁移的时间尺度，发现几天周期的热木星不太可能保留大型卫星，尽管它们可以被来自被潮汐瓦解的卫星碎片形成的环围绕。与此相反，围绕温暖或寒冷木星形成的卫星可以被保留。最后，我们估算了由星-行星和行星-卫星磁相互作用导致的射电功率和流量密度，并给出了通过FAST探测的上限距离。 <div>
We study the magnetic and tidal interactions of a gas-giant exoplanet with its host star and with its exomoons, and focus on their retention. We briefly revisit the scaling law for planetary dynamo in terms of its mass, radius, and luminosity. Based on the virial theorem, we construct an evolution law for planetary magnetic field and find that its initial entropy is important for the field evolution of a high-mass planet. We estimate the magnetic torques on orbit arising from the star–planet and planet–moon magnetic interactions, and find that it can compensate tidal torques and bypass frequency valleys where dynamical-tide response is ineffective. For exomoon’s retention, we consider two situations. In the presence of a circumplanetary disk (CPD), by comparison between CPD’s inner and outer radii, we find that planets with too strong magnetic fields or too small distance from its host star tend not to host exomoons. During the subsequent CPD-free evolution, we find, by comparison between a planet’s spin-down and a moon’s migration timescales, that hot Jupiters with periods of several days are unlikely to retain large exomoons, albeit they could be surrounded by rings from the debris of tidally disrupted moons. In contrast, moons, if formed around warm or cold Jupiters, can be preserved. Finally, we estimate the radio power and flux density due to the star–planet and planet–moon magnetic interactions and give the upper limit of detection distance by FAST.

Recently, the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 has garnered attention due to its emission of an extremely luminous radio burst, reminiscent of fast radio bursts (FRBs). SGR J1935+2154 is one of the most active magnetars, displaying flaring events nearly every year, including outbursts as well as short and intermediate bursts. Here, we present our results on the properties of the persistent and bursting X-ray emission from SGR J1935+2154 during the initial weeks following its outburst on 2022 October 10. The source was observed with XMM-Newton and NuSTAR (quasi-)simultaneously during two epochs, separated by ∼5 days. The persistent emission spectrum is well described by an absorbed blackbody plus power-law model up to an energy of ∼25 keV. No significant changes were observed in the blackbody temperature (kTBB ∼ 0.4 keV) and emitting radius (RBB ∼ 1.9 km) between the two epochs. However, we observed a slight variation in the power-law parameters. Moreover, we detected X-ray pulsations in all the data sets and derived a spin-period derivative of s s−1. This is 3.8 times larger than the value measured after the first recorded outburst in 2014. Additionally, we performed quasi-simultaneous radio observations using three 25–32 m class radio telescopes for a total of 92.5 hr to search for FRB-like radio bursts and pulsed emission. However, our analysis did not reveal any radio bursts or periodic emission.

We report multiepoch astrometric very long baseline interferometry observations of the chromospherically active binary HR 1099 (V711 Tau, HD 22468) at six epochs over 63 days using the Very Long Baseline Array at 22.2 GHz. We determined hourly radio positions at each epoch with a positional uncertainty significantly smaller than the component separation. The aggregate radio positions at all epochs define an ellipse in the comoving reference frame with an inclination and longitude of ascending node Ω = 212° ± 22°. The ellipse center is offset from the Third Gaia Celestial Reference Frame position by Δα = , Δδ = mas. All radio centroids are well displaced from the binary center of mass at all epochs, ruling out emission from the interbinary region. We examined the motion of the radio centroids within each epoch by comparing hourly positions over several hours. The measured speeds were not statistically significant for five of the six epochs, with 2σ upper limits in the range 200–1000 km s−1. However, for one flaring epoch, there was a 3σ detection v⊥ = 228 ± 85 km s−1. This speed is comparable to the mean speed of observed coronal mass ejections on the Sun.

<div> SN 2022jox, Type II supernova, high-ionization flash, circumstellar material, mass-loss rate

总结:<br /><br />本文报告了对SN 2022jox的高频光学和紫外线观测结果。该超新星展现出早期光谱中的高电离闪烁特征，并在爆炸后的几天内消失。SN 2022jox在爆发后约0.75天被Distance Less Than 40 Mpc survey发现，并随后获得了光谱和紫外光度的跟进数据。超新星达到了峰值亮度MV∼−17.3 mag，估计的56Ni质量为0.04 M⊙，这是正常II型超新星的典型数值。对早期光变曲线的建模和光谱中的闪烁特征表明了与周围物质的相互作用，这些物质是由一个具有质量损失率的前体星产生的。SN 2022jox的质量损失率远高于已知II型超新星前体——红超巨星的平静质量损失率，但与类似的核心坍缩超新星的推断值相当，这表明爆炸前几个月或几年内前体星发生了喷发事件或超级风。此外，在大约200天的光谱中还有一些迟发的CSM相互作用的迹象。 <div>
We present high-cadence optical and ultraviolet (UV) observations of the Type II supernova (SN), SN 2022jox which exhibits early spectroscopic high-ionization flash features of H i, He ii, C iv, and N iv that disappear within the first few days after explosion. SN 2022jox was discovered by the Distance Less Than 40 Mpc survey ∼0.75 day after explosion with follow-up spectra and UV photometry obtained within minutes of discovery. The SN reached a peak brightness of MV ∼ −17.3 mag, and has an estimated 56Ni mass of 0.04 M⊙, typical values for normal Type II SNe. The modeling of the early light curve and the strong flash signatures present in the optical spectra indicate interaction with circumstellar material (CSM) created from a progenitor with a mass-loss rate of . There may also be some indication of late-time CSM interaction in the form of an emission line blueward of Hα seen in spectra around 200 days. The mass-loss rate of SN 2022jox is much higher than the values typically associated with quiescent mass loss from red supergiants, the known progenitors of Type II SNe, but is comparable to inferred values from similar core-collapse SNe with flash features, suggesting an eruptive event or a superwind in the progenitor in the months or years before explosion.

总结:<br />
这篇文章研究了弱线类星体的特性，针对活动星系核的光谱能量分布进行了云模拟计算，发现C iv的等效宽度会受到软X射线过剩组分的影响，而具有较大黑洞质量和软X射线较弱的类星体会表现出较弱的紫外线发射线。 <div>
Weak-line quasars (WLQs) are a notable group of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) that show unusually weak UV lines even though their optical-UV continuum shapes are similar to those of typical quasars. The physical mechanism for WLQs is an unsolved puzzle in the AGN unified model. We explore the properties of UV emission lines by performing extensive photoionization calculations based on Cloudy simulations with different spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of AGNs. The AGN continua are built from several observational empirical correlations, where the blackbody emission from the cold disk, the power-law emission from the hot corona, and a soft X-ray excess component are considered. We find that the equivalent width (EW) of C iv from our models is systematically lower than observational values if the component of soft X-ray excess is neglected. The EW will increase several times and is roughly consistent with the observations after considering the soft X-ray excess component as constrained from normal type I AGNs. We find that the UV lines are weak for QSOs with quite large black hole mass (e.g., MBH > 109M⊙) and weak soft X-ray emission due to the deficit of ionizing photons. As an example, we present the strength of C iv based on the multiband SEDs for three nearby weak-line AGNs, where the weaker soft X-ray emission normally predicts the weaker lines.

这篇文章报告了对T2.5行星质量物体SIMP J013656.5+093347进行的J-和Ks-波段多波长观测的分析结果。研究重新分析了2015年一夜的观测数据，并首次检测到J-和Ks-波段光度曲线之间存在相位差。研究利用Sonora Bobcat模型表明，为了解释观测到的相位差，该物体的大气层中必须至少存在两个不同的云层。这一结果与该物体的大气检测结果一致，也与其他类似L/T转变物体的最新研究结果一致。 <br /><br />总结: 多波长光度测量揭示了SIMP J013656.5+093347大气层中存在至少两个不同的云层，与最新的大气检测结果一致。 <div>
Multiwavelength photometry of brown dwarfs and planetary-mass objects provides insight into their atmospheres and cloud layers. We present near-simultaneous J- and Ks-band multiwavelength observations of the highly variable T2.5 planetary-mass object, SIMP J013656.5+093347. We reanalyze observations acquired over a single night in 2015 using a recently developed data reduction pipeline. For the first time, we detect a phase shift between J- and Ks-band light curves, which we measure to be . Previously, phase shifts between near-infrared and mid-infrared observations of this object were detected and attributed to probing different depths of the atmosphere, and thus different cloud layers. Using the Sonora Bobcat models, we expand on this idea to show that at least two different patchy cloud layers must be present to explain the measured phase shift. Our results are generally consistent with recent atmospheric retrievals of this object and other similar L/T transition objects.

Ganymede的微型磁层与朱庇特等离子体的共旋流相互作用产生Alfvénic power，为木卫三在朱庇特电离层形成极光足迹做出贡献。研究使用了木卫三磁层的三维、高分辨率全球磁流体力学模型，调查了在稳态上游条件下木卫三磁层中产生的Alfvénic power的时间变化。结果显示：（1）由于磁重联和Kelvin-Helmholtz不稳定性引起的Alfvénic power呈准周期性变化，周期约为71-333秒，与木卫三极光足迹发出功率的100秒周期性一致；（2）当木卫三位于朱庇特等离子体片区内，其朱轴磁场成分较小，Alfvénic power的大小也较小，而当木卫三位于等离子体片区外时，朱轴磁场较大，Alfvénic power也较大。 
<br /><br />总结: 
Ganymede的微型磁层与Jovian等离子体流相互作用产生Alfvénic power，其变化周期与Ganymede极光足迹发出功率周期一致。Alfvénic power的大小与Ganymede所处位置的Jovian等离子体片区的By分量大小相关。 <div>
Alfvénic power is generated through the interaction between the mini-magnetosphere of Ganymede and the corotating flow of the Jovian plasma, contributing to the formation of the Ganymede auroral footprint at Jupiter’s ionosphere. Using a three-dimensional, high-resolution global magnetohydrodynamic model of the Ganymede magnetosphere, we investigate the temporal variations of the Alfvénic power generated in the mini-magnetosphere of the moon under steady-state upstream conditions. Results show that (1) the Alfvénic power caused by the intermittent magnetic reconnections and the Kelvin–Helmholtz instabilities is quasiperiodic, varying over time with the periods about 71–333 s, which are consistent with the 100 s timescale periodicities of the Ganymede footprint's emitted power; and (2) the magnitude of the Alfvénic power is smaller when Ganymede is inside the Jovian plasma sheet where the By component is smaller, and larger when the moon is outside the plasma sheet where the By component is larger.

Recent observational and simulation studies have revealed that ambipolar diffusion is an important phenomenon in the outer regions of a protoplanetary disk (PPD). However, numerous simulation studies have found that ambipolar diffusion suppresses the turbulence caused by the magnetorotational instability (MRI) in these regions of a PPD. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of ambipolar diffusion on the Rossby wave instability (RWI) at large radii of a PPD. To accomplish this, we examine the occurrence of the RWI in a PPD threaded by the magnetic field in the presence of ambipolar diffusion. Additionally, we scale the ambipolar diffusivity with respect to both the toroidal magnetic field and an important parameter known as the Elsässer number. We obtain the growth rate of unstable RWI modes in the outer regions of a PPD using linear perturbation analysis. In our nonaxisymmetric perturbation analysis, we find that the amplitude of the toroidal field oscillates in various modes for small values of the Elsässer numbers. For small Elsässer numbers, the growth rate of unstable modes associated with the RWI decreases. In other words, ambipolar diffusion suppresses the perturbation caused by the RWI. This effect is similar to the effect of ambipolar diffusion on the MRI. In contrast to the MRI, where there is a range around 1 for the Elsässer numbers, the existence of ambipolar diffusion supports the occurrence of RWI. Finally, we compare our findings with those of simulation studies to emphasize the importance of RWI in the outer regions of a PPD.

<title>Prospects of Identifying Hierarchical Triple Mergers for the Third-generation Ground-based Detectors</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A hierarchical triple merger (HTM) constitutes a type of event in which two successive black hole (BH) mergers occur sequentially within the observational window of gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, which has an important role in testing general relativity and studying BH population. In this work, we conduct an analysis to determine the feasibility of identifying HTMs from a large GW event catalog using third-generation ground-based GW detectors. By comparing the Bhattacharyya coefficient that measures the overlap between the posterior distributions of the remnant and progenitor BH parameters, we find that the overlap between the event pair can serve as a preliminary filter, which balances between computational demand and the probability of false alarms. Following this initial, time-efficient, yet less accurate screening, a subset of potential HTM candidates will be retained. These candidates will subsequently be subjected to a more precise, albeit time-intensive, method of joint parameter estimation for verification. Ultimately, this process will enable us to robustly identify HTMs.

The thorium and six second-peak r-process element (56 ≤ Z ≤ 72) abundances are determined for the α-poor star LAMOST J1124+4535 based on a high-resolution spectrum obtained with the High Dispersion Spectrograph on the Subaru Telescope. The age of J1124+4535 is 11.3 ± 4.4 Gyr using thorium and other r-process element abundances. J1124+4535 is confirmed to be a Galactic halo metal-poor ([Fe/H] = −1.27 ± 0.1) star with extreme r-process element overabundance ([Eu/Fe] = 1.13 ± 0.08) and α element deficiency ([Mg/Fe] = −0.31 ± 0.09) by the LAMOST-Subaru project. Along with the subsolar α-to-iron ratios (e.g., [Mg/Fe], [Si/Fe], [Ca/Fe]), the relatively low abundances of Na, Cr, Ni, and Zn in J1124+4535 show a significant departure from the general trends of the Galactic halo but are in good agreement with those of dwarf galaxies. The chemical abundances and kinematics of J1124+4535 suggest it was formed in the late stage of star formation in a dwarf galaxy that has been disrupted by the Milky Way. The star formation of its progenitor dwarf galaxy lasted more than 2 Gyr and has been affected by a rare r-process event before the occurrence of accretion event.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report on the orbit of the binary system powering the most extreme ultraluminous X-ray pulsar known to date: NGC 5907 ULX-1 (hereafter ULX1). ULX1 has been the target of a substantial multi-instrument campaign, mainly in the X-ray band, but no clear counterparts are known in other bands. Although ULX1 is highly variable and pulsations can be transient (regardless of the source flux), the timing data collected so far allow us to investigate the orbit of this system. We find an orbital period and a projected semi-axis . The most likely ephemeris is Porb = 5.6585(6) days, A1 = 3.1(4) lt-s, and the epoch of ascending nodes passage is Tasc = 57751.37(5) MJD. However, there are six similar solutions acceptable within 3σ. We find further indications that ULX1 is a high-mass X-ray binary. This implies that we are observing its orbit face on, with an inclination <5°.

<title>Morphological Evolution of Disk Galaxies and Their Concentration, Asymmetry, and Clumpiness (CAS) Properties in Simulations across Toomre’s Q Parameter</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We investigate the morphological and structural evolution of disk galaxies in simulations for a wide range of Toomre’s Q parameters. In addition to the inspection of conventional bar modes, we compute the concentration, asymmetry, and clumpiness (CAS) parameters to enlarge the understanding of the galaxy evolution. These parameters are widely employed to analyze the light distribution of the observed galaxies, but the adaptation to numerical simulations is not much considered. While the bar formation takes place in a considerable range of Q around 1, barred galaxies originating from Q > 1 and Q < 1 disks yield CAS values that differ significantly. Disks starting with Q < 1 develop clumps due to local gravitational instabilities along with the bar, and these clumps play a central role in enhancing the CAS values. This process is absent in the Q > 1 counterparts in which the evolution is dominated by linearly unstable two-armed modes that lead to lower CAS values. Likewise, unbarred galaxies that are obtainable from disks with Q far below and far above 1 exhibit greatly different CAS magnitudes. It turns out that the CAS parameters can serve as indicators of the initial kinematical state and the evolution history of a disk of any morphology. In addition, we find an alternative mechanism of the formation of the lopsided barred galaxy when Q ≲ 1. Bars that evolve in the midst of the clumps can spontaneously become lopsided at the end.

<div> Parker Solar Probe, observations, reconnection exhausts, current sheets, plasma

总结:<br />
Parker Solar Probe在接触4-11期间分析了极径小于0.26天文单位的观测数据，发现在当前表面（current sheets, CSs）中存在重新连接排气。这些重新连接排气在各种径向距离上几乎都有相同的概率出现，但在典型的慢速风区具有Tp < 0.80 MK的平静等离子体中更为常见。高Tp > 0.80 MK的快速风区中很少支持重新连接排气现象。观测还显示了在几个CSs中存在的局部温度梯度，其中局部闭合磁场线上的高Tp等离子体和局部开放磁场线上的低Tp等离子体为一种交换型重新连接。CS的几何形状分析直接支持了X线平分磁场旋转θ角的性质，无论磁场和等离子体是否对称，以最大化重新连接速率和可用磁能量。CS正常宽度dcs的分布表明，通过分层分叉CS的嵌套层次多尺度重新连接过程可能是观察到的中位数dcs ∼ 1000 km之上的幂律分布的导致原因，而在此中位数以下的离子动能耗散尺度则存在指数型dcs分布。磁场剪切θ角在极径小于0.26天文单位和1天文单位时基本相同，中位数在太阳附近是θ ∼ 55°，而在1天文单位附近是θ ∼ 65°。相比之下，切向流剪切分布在太阳附近和远离太阳的地方是不同的。在太阳附近存在双峰切向流剪切角分布，有较强的切向流剪切角大小。这种分布会随着径向距离的增加而改变，变成了相对平坦的较弱的流切向流剪切角的分布。 <div>
Parker Solar Probe observations are analyzed for the presence of reconnection exhausts across current sheets (CSs) within R < 0.26 au during encounters 4–11. Exhausts are observed with nearly equal probability at all radial distances with a preference for quiescent Tp < 0.80 MK plasmas typical of a slow-wind regime. High Tp > 0.80 MK plasmas of a fast wind characterized by significant transverse fluctuations rarely support exhausts irrespective of the CS width. Exhaust observations demonstrate the presence of local temperature gradients across several CSs with a higher-Tp plasma on locally closed fields and a lower-Tp plasma on locally open field lines for an interchange-type reconnection. A CS geometry analysis directly supports the property that X-lines bisect the magnetic field rotation θ-angle, whether the fields and plasmas are asymmetric or not, to maximize reconnection rates and available magnetic energy. The CS normal width dcs distributions suggest that a multiscale reconnection process through nested layers of bifurcated CSs may be responsible for observed power-law distributions beyond the median dcs ∼ 1000 km with an exponential dcs distribution present for ion kinetic dissipation scales below this median. Magnetic field shear θ-angles are essentially identical at R < 0.26 and 1 au with medians at θ ∼ 55° near the Sun and θ ∼ 65° at 1 au. In contrast, the tangential flow shear distributions are different near and far from the Sun. A bimodal flow shear angle distribution is present near the Sun with strong shear flow magnitudes. This distribution is modified with radial distance toward a relatively flat distribution of weaker flow shear magnitudes.

总结:
最近的IXPE观测支持了激波模型对X射线发射的解释，但报告了与激波模型先前理论预期相比较低的极化程度。通过重新考虑激波产生的磁场在不同方向上的分布，可以描述射流中X射线和无线电发射的极化特性，并发现在低频发射中磁场的贡献显著。同时，理赫特迈尔—梅施科夫不稳定性产生的磁场对低频发射的极化特性可能有显著影响。 <div>
Recent Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) observations of blazars tend to support the shock model for the X-ray emission, but report a low degree of polarization (Π ∼ 10%) in X-rays compared with the previous theoretical expectations in the shock model. In order to reconcile the theoretical expectations with observations, we revisit the polarization of the shock emission by considering different types of directions in the distribution of the shock-generated magnetic fields (sgMFs). Here, with along the shock normal direction is used to describe the direction in the distribution of sgMFs in the shock comoving frame. It is found that the polarization in the X-ray and radio emission for a general jet in blazars can be described as and , respectively. Correspondingly, one can have ζsg ∼ 1−1.5 according to IXPE observations. Besides the sgMFs, the magnetic fields generated by the Richtmyer–Meshkov instability (RMI) (rmMFs) are supposed to be present in the jets. The direction of the rmMFs is mainly distributed along the shock normal in the simulations and thus is adopted to describe the direction of the distribution in rmMFs. We find that rmMFs are likely to significantly affect the polarization properties at low-frequency emission, especially when the sgMFs decay rapidly. Based on contemporaneous radio and X-ray observations, we find that the emission of electrons in rmMFs makes a significant contribution to the low-frequency emission and the ordered background magnetic fields can be neglected.

总结:
NGC 4138是一个低光度活动星系核(AGN)宿主，研究了其内部的PAH辐射发射。研究发现，星系内的PAH带比值随半径变化显著。使用新的PAH光谱模型，研究了AGN对PAH颗粒大小分布的影响。独立模拟了NGC 4138内部辐射场的变化，并用模型预测了PAH发射光谱的相关变化。结果表明，星火环中的星光混合度对PAH带比值的趋势有显著影响，辐射模型预测了这些趋势的形状。AGN的小颗粒截断和PAH电离分数的变化可能解释了较短波段的行为，但无法解释较长波段的情况。另外，研究发现在离中心约270pc的地方，PAH带比值略有增加，这表明AGN可能直接影响该区域的PAH发射。<br /><br /> <div>
We present a focused study of radially resolved varying PAH emission in the low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN)-host NGC 4138 using deep Spitzer/infrared spectrograph spectral maps. Using new model PAH spectra, we investigate whether these variations could be associated with changes to the PAH grain size distribution due to photodestruction by the AGN. Separately, we model the effects of the varying radiation field within NGC 4138, and we use this model to predict the corresponding changes in the PAH emission spectrum. We find that PAH band ratios are strongly variable with radius in this galaxy with short-to-long wavelength band ratios peaking in the starburst ring. The changing mix of starlight appears to have a considerable effect on the trends in these band ratios, and our radiation model predicts the shapes of these trends. However, the amplitude of observed variation is ∼2.5 × larger than predicted for some ratios. A cutoff of small grains in the PAH size distribution, as has been suggested for AGN, together with changes in PAH ionization fraction could explain the behavior of the shorter bands, but this model fails to reproduce longer band behaviors. Additionally, we find that short-to-long wavelength PAH band ratios increase slightly within ∼270 pc of the center, suggesting that the AGN may directly influence PAH emission there.

<div> 关键词：quasar 1604+159, VLBA, polarization, magnetic field, RM

总结: 
研究以美国超长基线阵列（VLBA）观测的夸萨尔1604+159为对象，对其视差尺度下的总强度、谱指数、线偏振和旋转测度分布进行了分析。在2002年以5.0、8.4和15.4 GHz和2020年以4.6、5.1、6.0、7.8、12.2、15.2和43.9 GHz进行了观测。研究发现了核心-喷流结构，喷流延伸至距核心约25mas的范围。通过线偏振分布，将源结构划分为中央区和喷流区，发现喷流区的线偏振随时间变化。核心偏移指数kr表明核心在2002年接近均衡状态，而2020年已偏离。在核心检测到了横向RM梯度，为螺旋磁场的证据。通过15 GHz观测，发现RM随频率呈幂律增加，表明介质中的快速电子密度下降。总体而言，该研究对夸萨尔1604+159的磁场结构和偏振变化进行了全面的研究。 <div>
We have analyzed the total intensity, spectral index, linear polarization, and rotation measure (RM) distributions at the parsec scale for the quasar 1604+159. The source was observed at 5.0, 8.4, and 15.4 GHz in 2002 and 4.6, 5.1, 6.0, 7.8, 12.2, 15.2, and 43.9 GHz in 2020 with the American Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). Combining the polarization results of Monitoring of Jets in Active Galactic Nuclei with VLBA Experiments at 15 GHz from 2009 to 2013, we studied the evolution of magnetic field at the parsec scale for the source. We detected a core-jet structure. The jet extends to the distance of ∼25 mas from the core at a direction of ∼66° north by east. The shape of the jet derived from 15 GHz data varies slightly with time and could be described by a straight line. Based on the linear polarization distribution in 2002, we divided the source structure into the central region and the jet region. In the jet region, we find the polarized emission varies with time. The flatter spectral index values and electric vector position angle direction indicate the possible existence of shocks, contributing to the variation of polarization in the jet with time. In the central region, the derived core shift index kr values indicate that the core in 2002 is close to the equipartition case, while it deviated from the case in 2020. The measured magnetic field strength in 2020 is 2 orders of magnitude lower than that in 2002. We detected transverse RM gradients, evidence of a helical magnetic field, in the core. The polarized emission orients in general toward the jet direction in the core. At 15 GHz, in the place close to the jet base, the polarization direction changes significantly with time from perpendicular to parallel to the jet direction. The evolution of RM and magnetic field structure are potential reasons for the observed polarization change. The core ∣RM∣ in 2020 increases with frequency following a power law with index a = 2.7 ± 0.5, suggesting a fast electron density falloff in the medium with distance from the jet base.

<div> SN 2020udy, NGC 0812, optical observations, type Iax supernova, 56Ni synthesis<br />
<br />总结:<br />这篇文章报道了对明亮的Iax型超新星SN 2020udy的光学观测和分析。研究发现，SN 2020udy的光变曲线的演变类似于其他明亮的Iax型超新星。分析模型表明，爆炸过程中合成了0.08 ± 0.01 M⊙的56Ni。其光谱特征与Iax型超新星的其他明亮成员相似，呈现出弱的Si ii线。随着时间的推移，铁族元素成为光谱中的主要特征。对SN 2020udy的光谱进行了丰度层析建模，发现外部喷发物中存在分层结构。在最大光度后，化学元素的均匀混合足以解释光谱演化。与普通Ia型超新星不同，光球逼近法在+100天之前仍然保持稳健，需要额外的连续光源。总的来说，SN 2020udy的观测特征与碳氧白矮星的爆炸一致。 <div>
We present optical observations and analysis of the bright type Iax supernova SN 2020udy hosted by NGC 0812. The evolution of the light curve of SN 2020udy is similar to that of other bright type Iax SNe. Analytical modeling of the quasi-bolometric light curves of SN 2020udy suggests that 0.08 ± 0.01 M⊙ of 56Ni would have been synthesized during the explosion. The spectral features of SN 2020udy are similar to those of the bright members of type Iax class, showing a weak Si ii line. The late-time spectral sequence is mostly dominated by iron group elements with broad emission lines. Abundance tomography modeling of the spectral time series of SN 2020udy using TARDIS indicates stratification in the outer ejecta; however, to confirm this, spectral modeling at a very early phase is required. After maximum light, uniform mixing of chemical elements is sufficient to explain the spectral evolution. Unlike in the case of normal type Ia SNe, the photospheric approximation remains robust until +100 days, requiring an additional continuum source. Overall, the observational features of SN 2020udy are consistent with the deflagration of a carbon–oxygen white dwarf.

<br /><br />总结:
本研究通过对Fermi伽马射线暴监测到的具有红移的GRB的能量、光度、等待时间和持续时间分布进行研究，首次考虑了选择效应。研究讨论了结果与SOC理论框架的兼容性，并发现能量和光度分布模型中存在内在的幂律断裂。这些发现有助于解析GRB引擎释放能量的规律，为解决GRB物理中最困惑的问题提供了重要线索。 <div>
Discovered more than 50 years ago, gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt emission remains the most puzzling aspect of GRB physics. Its complex and irregular nature should reveal how newborn GRB engines release their energy. In this respect, the possibility that GRB engines could operate as self-organized critical (SOC) systems has been put forward. Here, we present the energy, luminosity, waiting time, and duration distributions of individual pulses of GRBs with known redshift detected by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor. This is the first study of this kind in which selection effects are accounted for. The compatibility of our results with the framework of SOC theory is discussed. We found evidence for an intrinsic break in the power-law models that describe the energy and the luminosity distributions.

<div> 关键词: 磁重联, 湍流, 等离子体, 能量转换, 太空飞船
总结: 
本研究利用磁层多尺度太空飞船获取的高分辨率数据，直接证明了湍流在促进磁重联过程中起着重要作用。我们发现湍流的强度对能量转换具有显著影响，较强的湍流会产生更一致的具有较小空间尺度的结构，这些结构对磁重联过程中的能量转换至关重要。然而，我们发现湍流对粒子加热影响不大，但会影响这两个事件中离子的整体动能。这些发现显著推进了我们对天体物理等离子体中湍流和重联关系的理解。 <br /><br /> <div>
Magnetic reconnection and turbulence are two of the most significant mechanisms for energy dissipation in collisionless plasma. The role of turbulence in magnetic reconnection poses an outstanding problem in astrophysics and plasma physics. It is still unclear whether turbulence can modify the reconnection process by enhancing the reconnection rate or energy conversion rate. In this study, utilizing unprecedented high-resolution data obtained from the Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft, we provide direct evidence that turbulence plays a vital role in promoting energy conversion during reconnection. We reached this conclusion by comparing magnetotail reconnection events with similar inflow Alfvén speed and plasma β but varying amplitudes of turbulence. The disparity in energy conversion was attributed to the strength of turbulence. Stronger turbulence generates more coherent structures with smaller spatial scales, which are pivotal contributors to energy conversion during reconnection. However, we find that turbulence has negligible impact on particle heating, but it does affect the ion bulk kinetic energy in these two events. These findings significantly advance our understanding of the relationship between turbulence and reconnection in astrophysical plasmas.

<div> NIR spectroscopy, HD 200775, forbidden lines, disk winds, high-resolution<br />
总结:<br />
本研究使用高分辨率近红外（NIR）光谱对HD 200775进行了分析，发现了八条禁线，其中包括[S ii]、[N i]和[Fe ii]等元素的禁线。研究表明这些禁线可以作为盘风迹象的有力指标，尤其是[N i]线可以用于推导盘风气体的基本物理参数。研究结论具有重要意义，但是对这些禁线的研究仅限于一颗天体，因此需要进一步的研究来验证其性质。 <div>
In this study, we performed high-resolution near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy (R = 28,000; λ = 0.90–1.35 μm) with a high signal-to-noise ratio on HD 200775, a very young (∼0.1 Myr old) and massive intermediate-mass star (a binary star with a mass of about 10 M⊙ each) with a protoplanetary disk. The obtained spectra show eight forbidden lines of three elements: two of [S ii] (10289 and 10323 Å), two of [N i] (10400 and 10410 Å), and four of [Fe ii] (12570, 12946, 12981, and 13209 Å). This is the first time that the [N i] lines are detected in a young stellar object with a doublet deblended. Gaussian fitting of the spectra indicates that all line profiles have low-velocity components and exhibit blueshifted features, suggesting that all lines originate from the disk winds (magnetohydrodynamic disk wind and/or photoevaporative wind). Based on the fit, the [N i] and [Fe ii] lines are categorized into narrow components, while the [S ii] lines are at the boundary between broad and narrow components. These forbidden lines are suggested to be very promising disk wind tracers among the existing ones because they are in the NIR-wavelength range, which can be observed from early stages with high sensitivities. Among these lines, [N i] lines would be a rather powerful probe for deriving the basic physical parameters of disk wind gases. However, the study of these lines herein is limited to one object; thus, further studies are needed to examine their properties.

这项研究更新了包括1092个6.7 GHz甲醇激射源的目录。此外，利用上海天马射电望远镜观测了214个星形成区域的NH3 (1, 1), NH3 (2, 2), 和 NH3 (3, 3)跃迁，以检验与银河尺度上甲醇激射源相关的分子云的激发温度和柱密度等物理环境的差异。统计结果表明，Perseus臂中的6.7 GHz甲醇激射源数量明显低于其他三个主要螺旋臂。此外，Perseus臂的气体柱密度也是NH3观测到的主要螺旋臂中最低的。这两点发现表明，与其他三个主要螺旋臂相比，Perseus臂的高质量恒星形成速率最低。我们还观测到一个趋势，即6.7 GHz甲醇激射源的亮度和氨气柱密度均随着银心距的增加而下降。这一发现表明，银河系内部的物质密度通常比外部高，进一步暗示在螺旋臂的前端更容易形成高质量恒星。此外，我们发现螺旋臂区域中氨气的柱密度高于螺旋臂间区域，支持前者更可能是高质量恒星的诞生地。<br /><br />总结: 该研究更新了6.7 GHz甲醇激射源目录，并观测了NH3跃迁，发现Perseus臂中的6.7 GHz甲醇激射源数量较低，气体柱密度也最低，提示该区域的高质量恒星形成速率低。研究还表明在银心距增加时，银河系内部的物质密度更高，高质量恒星更容易形成，并且螺旋臂区域中氨气的柱密度更高，更可能是高质量恒星的诞生地。 <div>
An updated catalog consisting of 1092 6.7 GHz methanol maser sources is reported in this work. Additionally, the NH3 (1, 1), NH3 (2, 2), and NH3 (3, 3) transitions were observed toward 214 star-forming regions using the Shanghai Tianma radio telescope in order to examine the differences in physical environments, such as the excitation temperature and column density of molecular clouds associated with methanol masers on the Galactic scale. Statistical results reveal that the number of 6.7 GHz methanol masers in the Perseus arm is significantly lower than that in the other three main spiral arms. In addition, the Perseus arm also has the lowest gas column density among the main spiral arms traced by the NH3 observations. Both findings suggest that the Perseus arm has the lowest rate of high-mass star formation compared to the other three main spiral arms. We also observed a trend in which both the luminosity of the 6.7 GHz methanol masers and the ammonia gas column density decreased with the galactocentric distance. This finding indicates that the density of material in the inner Milky Way is generally higher than that in the outer Milky Way. This further suggests that high-mass stars are more easily formed at the head of the spiral arms. Furthermore, we found that the column density of ammonia gas is higher in the regions on the arms than in the inter-arm regions, supporting that the former is more likely to be the birthplace of high-mass stars.

<br /><br />总结:
GRS 1734-292是一个无线安静的星系，既没有剧烈的星暴活动，也没有喷流活动。然而，费米探测到了这个星系在GeV波段的活动。通过ALMA的观测，证实了在星系中心约100光年范围内存在毫米过剩，并且这种过剩还具有时间变化。根据观测结果，研究人员认为这种活动可能源自于核心区域小于100个Schwarzschild半径的紧凑源上的辐射活动。未来更高分辨率的毫米波观测将有助于进一步揭示这一现象的真相，为我们提供了解活动星系核中高能粒子加速位置的重要线索。 <div>
GRS 1734-292 is a radio-quiet galaxy, exhibiting neither intense starburst nor jet activities. However, Fermi-LAT detected this object in the GeV band. The origin of nonthermal activity in this Seyfert galaxy is an intriguing question. We report Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of GRS 1734-292 at frequencies of 97.5, 145, and 225 GHz. These observations confirmed the millimeter excess within the central ⪅100 pc region and its time variability based on two separate observations conducted 4 days apart. The timescale of variability aligns with the light-crossing time for a compact source smaller than <100 Schwarzschild radius. If we take into account the power-law synchrotron emission originating from the corona (i.e., the hot plasma located above the accretion disk), the millimeter spectrum indicates the coronal magnetic field of ≈10 G and the size of ≈10 Schwarzschild radius. An alternative explanation for this millimeter emission could be synchrotron and free–free emission from disk winds (i.e., fast wide-opening angle outflows from the disk) with the size of ≈10 pc, although it may be difficult to explain the fast variability. Future millimeter observations with higher resolution (<0.″01) will enable the differentiation between these two scenarios. Such observations will provide insights into the acceleration sites of high-energy particles at the core of active galactic nuclei.

Drawing from the Chandra archive and using a carefully selected set of nearby dwarf galaxies, we present a calibrated high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) luminosity function in the low-mass galaxy regime and search for an already hinted at dependence on metallicity. Our study introduces a new sample of local dwarf galaxies (D < 12.5 Mpc and M* < 5 × 109M⊙), expanding the specific star formation rates (sSFR) and gas-phase metallicities probed in previous investigations. Our analysis of the observed X-ray luminosity function indicates a shallower power-law slope for the dwarf galaxy HMXB population. In our study, we focus on dwarf galaxies that are more representative in terms of sSFR compared to prior work. In this regime, the HMXB luminosity function exhibits significant stochastic sampling at high luminosities. This likely accounts for the pronounced scatter observed in the galaxy-integrated HMXB population’s LX/SFR versus metallicity for our galaxy sample. Our calibration is necessary to understand the active galactic nuclei content of low-mass galaxies identified in current and future X-ray survey fields and has implications for binary population synthesis models, as well as X-ray-driven cosmic heating in the early Universe.

反射光谱的计算模型考虑了返回辐射的影响，能够对Kerr时空中的薄吸积盘进行准确计算。通过使用真实入射辐射的光谱，该模型在吸积盘上每个点都能计算出反射光谱。使用lamppost冠状结构进行模拟观测，我们发现在黑洞自转参数极高、冠状高度和盘的电离参数低时，带有返回辐射的relxill模型无法很好地拟合模拟数据，某些参数可能被显著高估或低估。随着黑洞自转参数值的降低和冠状高度的增加，我们能够得到更好的拟合，并恢复出正确的输入参数数值。

<br /><br />总结: 本研究提出了一个新的模型来计算Kerr时空中薄吸积盘的反射光谱，考虑了返回辐射的影响。模拟观测表明，在一些特定参数范围内，现有模型无法很好地拟合数据，但可以在更低的自转参数和更高的冠状高度下得到更好的拟合结果和正确的参数恢复。 <div>
We present a new model to calculate reflection spectra of thin accretion disks in Kerr spacetimes. Our model includes the effect of returning radiation, which is the radiation that is emitted by the disk and returns to the disk because of the strong light bending near a black hole. The major improvement with respect to the existing models is that it calculates the reflection spectrum at every point on the disk by using the actual spectrum of the incident radiation. Assuming a lamppost coronal geometry, we simulate simultaneous observations of NICER and NuSTAR of bright Galactic black holes and we fit the simulated data with the latest version of relxill (modified to read the table of reflionx, which is the nonrelativistic reflection model used in our calculations). We find that relxill with returning radiation cannot fit well the simulated data when the black hole spin parameter is very high and the coronal height and disk’s ionization parameter are low, and some parameters can be significantly overestimated or underestimated. We can find better fits and recover the correct input parameters as the value of the black hole spin parameter decreases and the value of the coronal height increases.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a timing solution for the 5.31 ms spider millisecond pulsar (MSP) J1242−4712, discovered with the GMRT. PSR J1242−4712 orbits a companion of minimum mass 0.08 M⊙ with an orbital period of 7.7 hr and occupies a relatively unexplored region in the orbital period versus companion mass space. We did not detect gamma-ray pulsations for this MSP, and also could not identify the optical counterpart for PSR J1242–4712 in available optical/near-infrared data. The profile of J1242−4712 evolves with frequency, showing a clear single component at lower frequencies and a three-component profile at 650 MHz. PSR J1242−4712 eclipses for a very short duration near superior conjunction (orbital phase ∼ 0.23−0.25) below 360 MHz. Moreover, significant dispersion measure delays and errors in the pulse times of arrivals are observed near inferior conjunction (orbital phase ∼ 0.7), along with an observed eclipse in one epoch at 650 MHz. Observed eclipses and significant orbital period variability suggest that PSR J1242−4712 is possibly not a helium star−white dwarf binary, but has a semi- or nondegenerate companion, indicating that this is a “spider” MSP lying in a region between typical black widows and redbacks. This system may represent a distinct category of spider MSPs, displaying characteristics that bridge the gap between known black widow and redback MSPs.

<title>Identifying Plasma Fractionation Processes in the Chromosphere Using IRIS</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The composition of the solar corona differs from that of the photosphere, with the plasma thought to fractionate in the solar chromosphere according to the first ionization potential (FIP) of the different elements. This produces a FIP bias, wherein elements with a low FIP are preferentially enhanced in the corona compared to their photospheric abundance, but direct observations of this process remain elusive. Here, we use a series of spectroscopic observations of active region AR 12759 as it transited the solar disk over a period of 6 days from 2020 April 2–7 taken using the Hinode Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer and Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) instruments to look for signatures of plasma fractionation in the solar chromosphere. Using the Si x/S x and Ca xiv/Ar xiv diagnostics, we find distinct differences between the FIP bias of the leading and following polarities of the active region. The widths of the IRIS Si iv lines exhibited clear differences between the leading and following polarity regions, indicating increased unresolved wave activity in the following polarity region compared to the leading polarity region, with the chromospheric velocities derived using the Mg ii lines exhibiting comparable, albeit much weaker, behavior. These results are consistent with plasma fractionation via resonant/nonresonant waves at different locations in the solar chromosphere following the ponderomotive force model, and indicate that IRIS could be used to further study this fundamental physical process.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Based on the LAMOST DR9 Medium Resolution Spectra (MRS) catalog, combined with astrometries from Gaia DR3, we conducted an investigation into the substructures in the stellar halo to obtain their chemical and kinematic information. We employed the HDBSCAN algorithm in the (Lz, E, Lxy) space for clustering and utilized Mahalanobis distance to merge the clustering results. Ultimately, within the LAMOST DR9 MRS catalog, we identified members of Gaia–Sausage–Enceladus (GSE), Helmi streams, and the high-α disk and in situ halo. Additionally, there are three clusters that cannot be correlated with known substructures. Based on their angular momentum (Lz) characteristics, we have tentatively named two of them High-Lz-Cluster-1 (HLC-1) and High-Lz-Cluster-2 (HLC-2), both exhibiting high angular momentum (Lz) features. The third cluster, owing to its extremely low Lz, is termed the Low-Lz-Cluster. Then detailed analysis about those substructures are executed including member stars’ identification and kinematic and chemical distribution. The resulting GSE member stars exhibit a well-defined metallicity distribution function with its peak at [Fe/H] ∼ −1.2, consistent with previous findings, and we found there appear to be some differences in the distribution on the Vtotal–rgal plane between GSE and its included Splash component. Regarding Helmi streams, in the [Mg/Fe]–[Fe/H] plane we detected potential traces of the α-knee phenomenon at [Fe/H] ∼ −1.53. Finally, we tentatively provide the possible origin for the HLC-1 and HLC-2.

Diffusion coefficients of energetic charged particles in turbulent magnetic fields are a fundamental aspect of diffusive transport theory but remain incompletely understood. In this work, we use quasi-linear theory to evaluate the spatial variation of the parallel diffusion coefficient κ∥ from the measured magnetic turbulence power spectra in the inner heliosphere. We consider the magnetic field and plasma velocity measurements from Parker Solar Probe made during Orbits 5–13. The parallel diffusion coefficient is calculated as a function of radial distance from 0.062 to 0.8 au, and the particle energy from 100 keV to 1 GeV. We find that κ∥ increases exponentially with both heliocentric distance and energy of particles. The fluctuations in κ∥ are related to the episodes of large-scale magnetic structures in the solar wind. By fitting the results, we also provide an empirical formula of κ∥ = (5.16 ± 1.22) × 1018r1.17±0.08E0.71±0.02 (cm2 s−1) in the inner heliosphere, which can be used as a reference in studying the transport and acceleration of solar energetic particles as well as the modulation of cosmic rays.

We investigate the suppression of star formation in galaxy pairs based on the isolated galaxy pair sample derived from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey survey. By comparing the star formation rate between late-type galaxies (LTGs) in galaxy pairs and those in the isolated environment, we detect a signal of the suppression of star formation in galaxy pairs at dp < 100 kpc and 200 kpc < dp < 350 kpc. The occurrence of the suppression of star formation in these LTGs requires their companion galaxies to have an early-type morphology (ns > 2.5). The suppression of star formation in wide galaxy pairs at 200 kpc < dp < 350 kpc mainly occurs in massive LTGs, while in close galaxy pairs at dp < 100 kpc, it only appears in LTGs with a massive companion ( ), nearly independent of their own stellar mass. Based on these findings, we infer that the suppression of star formation in wide galaxy pairs is actually a result of galaxy conformity, while in close galaxy pairs, it stems from the influence of hot circumgalactic medium surrounding companion galaxies.

<title>Resonant Absorption of Magnetohydrodynamic Body Modes under Photospheric Conditions</title>

Observations reveal that surface and body modes exist in solar pores under photospheric conditions. While the effects of resonant absorption on photospheric surface modes are well established, its effect on body modes is not known yet. In this paper, we investigate resonant absorption for the body modes under photospheric conditions. We numerically solve the dispersion relation induced by thin boundary approximation and obtain the wave dispersion curves and damping rates of three arbitrarily chosen body modes for sausage and kink waves, respectively. The results show that resonant absorption for the body modes is weaker than for the slow surface modes in both cusp and Alfvén continua. The damping behavior of body modes is similar to slow surface modes while the higher body mode has stronger resonant absorption.

<title>Study of Magnetic Field and Turbulence in the TeV Halo around the Monogem Pulsar</title>

Magnetic fields are ubiquitous in the interstellar medium, including extended objects such as supernova remnants and diffuse halos around pulsars. Its turbulent characteristics govern the diffusion of cosmic rays and the multiwavelength emission from pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe). However, the geometry and turbulence nature of the magnetic fields in the ambient region of PWN is still unknown. Recent gamma-ray observations from HAWC and synchrotron observations suggest a highly suppressed diffusion coefficient compared to the mean interstellar value. In this study, we present the first direct observational evidence of the orientation of the mean magnetic field and turbulent characteristics by employing a recently developed statistical parameter “Yturb” in the extended halo around the Monogem pulsar. Our study points to two possible scenarios: nearly aligned toward the line of sight (LOS) with compressible modes dominance or high inclination angle toward the LOS and characterized by Alfvénic turbulence. The first scenario appears consistent with other observational signatures. Furthermore, we report that the magnetic field has an observed correlation length of approximately 3 ± 0.6 pc in the Monogem halo. Our study highlights the pivotal role of magnetic field and turbulence in unraveling the physical processes in TeV halos and cosmic-ray transport.

<title>Unraveling the Cr Isotopes of Ryugu: An Accurate Aqueous Alteration Age and the Least Thermally Processed Solar System Material</title>

<div> Ryugu, asteroid, aqueous alteration age, Mn-Cr method, solar system evolution
总结:<br />
研究使用Mn-Cr方法测定了龙宫粒子的水改造年龄，得出了形成Ca-Al富集体(CAI)后4.13 + 0.62/−0.55百万年的年龄。这个年龄相当于4563.17 + 0.60/−0.67百万年前。龙宫样本的55Mn/52Cr，ε54Cr和初始ε53Cr值高于任何碳质球粒陨石样本，暗示其母本体是由原始盘的外部区域最少热加工的前体物质形成。尽管龙宫等含水小行星与太阳的距离不同，它们在有限的时间内（在CAI之后的3.8±1.8百万年）经历了水改造。这些年龄与碳质无球粒陨石NWA 6704/6693的结晶年龄误差相同。龙宫和NWA 6704/6693的ε54Cr和初始ε53Cr值相同，但它们显示出不同的Δ'17O值。这表明形成龙宫和NWA 6703/6693母体的前体物质是在原始太阳星盘中的相邻位置形成，并经历了类似程度的热加工，但龙宫的母本体由较高的冰/尘埃比率在原始星盘的外部区域形成。 <div>
The analysis of samples returned from the C-type asteroid Ryugu has drastically advanced our knowledge of the evolution of early solar system materials. However, no consensus has been obtained on the chronological data, which is important for understanding the evolution of the asteroid Ryugu. Here, the aqueous alteration age of Ryugu particles was determined by the Mn–Cr method using bulk samples, yielding an age of 4.13 + 0.62/−0.55 Myr after the formation of Ca–Al-rich inclusions (CAI). The age corresponds to 4563.17 + 0.60/−0.67 Myr ago. The higher 55Mn/52Cr, ε54Cr, and initial ε53Cr values of the Ryugu samples relative to any carbonaceous chondrite samples implies that its progenitor body formed from the least thermally processed precursors in the outermost region of the protoplanetary disk. Despite accreting at different distances from the Sun, the hydrous asteroids (Ryugu and the parent bodies of CI, CM, CR, and ungrouped C2 meteorites) underwent aqueous alteration during a period of limited duration (3.8 ± 1.8 Myr after CAI). These ages are identical to the crystallization age of the carbonaceous achondirtes NWA 6704/6693 within the error. The ε54Cr and initial ε53Cr values of Ryugu and NWA 6704/6693 are also identical, while they show distinct Δ'17O values. This suggests that the precursors that formed the progenitor bodies of Ryugu and NWA 6703/6693 were formed in close proximity and experienced a similar degree of thermal processing in the protosolar nebula. However, the progenitor body of Ryugu was formed by a higher ice/dust ratio, than NWA6703/6693, in the outer region of the protoplanetary disk.

Parker Solar Probe在2022年2月27日和28日观察到了一个小的分散事件，表明在低日冕和35个太阳半径以上之间，无散射传播是主要的传输机制。该事件发生在PSP遇到过多次的特定通量管沿特定轨道条件下。PSP轨道的这一部分相对于旋转的太阳表面具有几乎静止的角运动，使得PSP的运动在旋转参考系中基本呈径向运动。这一事件的时间离散通常出现在脉冲太阳能粒子事件中，并且速度包括核心太阳风离子的速度。特别是在事件开始时，3He含量远大于通常在∼100keV到数MeV的能量范围内观察到的氦的太阳能粒子丰度。事件后期，铁增加。组成特征表明这是一个加速机制的例子，用于在SEP事件中产生所需的种子能粒子，以解释这些事件中各种物种的富集高于太阳丰度。对PSP任务中类似轨道条件的初步搜索尚未发现其他类似事件，尽管所需的有利条件（孤立的脉冲加速和与最小磁场波动的良好有序磁场连接）很少实现，鉴于满足这些观测条件的PSP轨迹的小部分。 <br /><br />总结: Parker Solar Probe在2022年2月观察到了一个小的分散事件，揭示了无散射传播作为主要传输机制。通过特定轨道条件，该事件提供了关于脉冲太阳能粒子事件的时间离散以及关于氦和铁等成分的重要信息。这对于理解SEP事件中的加速机制具有重要意义，而在PSP任务中类似的轨道条件较少发现。 <div>
Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observations of a small dispersive event on 2022 February 27 and 28 indicate scatter-free propagation as the dominant transport mechanism between the low corona and greater than 35 solar radii. The event occurred during unique orbital conditions that prevailed along specific flux tubes that PSP encountered repeatedly between 25 and 35 Rs during outbound orbit 11. This segment of the PSP orbit exhibits almost stationary angular motion relative to the rotating solar surface, such that in the rotating frame, PSP’s motion is essentially radial. The time dispersion often observed in impulsive solar energetic particle (SEP) events continues in this case down to velocities including the core solar-wind ion velocities. Especially at the onset of this event, the 3He content is much larger than the usual SEP abundances seen in the energy range from ∼100 keV to several MeV for helium. Later in the event, iron is enhanced. The compositional signatures suggest this to be an example of an acceleration mechanism for generating the seed energetic particles required by shock (or compression) acceleration models in SEP events to account for the enrichment of various species above solar abundances in such events. A preliminary search of similar orbital conditions over the PSP mission has not revealed additional such events, although favorable conditions (isolated impulsive acceleration and well-ordered magnetic field connection with minimal magnetic field fluctuation) that would be required are infrequently realized, given the small fraction of the PSP trajectory that meets these observation conditions.

There exist very few mid-infrared (IR) observations of supernovae (SNe) in general. Therefore, SN 1987A, the closest visible SN in 400 yr, gives us the opportunity to explore the mid-IR properties of SNe, the dust in their ejecta, and the surrounding medium and to witness the birth of an SN remnant (SNR). The James Webb Space Telescope, with its high spatial resolution and extreme sensitivity, gives a new view on these issues. We report on the first imaging observations obtained with the Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI). We build temperature maps and discuss the morphology of the nascent SNR. Our results show that the temperatures in the equatorial ring (ER) are quite nonuniform. This could be due to dust destruction in some parts of the ring, as had been assumed in some previous works. We show that the IR emission extends beyond the ER, illustrating the fact that the shock wave has now passed through this ring to affect the circumstellar medium on a larger scale. Finally, while submillimeter Atacama Large Millimeter Array observations have hinted at the location of the compact remnant of SN 1987A, we note that our MIRI data have found no such evidence.

<title>A Multiwavelength Light-curve Model of the Classical Nova V339 Del: A Mechanism for the Coexistence of Dust Dip and Supersoft X-Rays</title>

<div> 关键词: 新星V339 Del 2013, 光度曲线, 尘埃壳形成, 硬X射线, 白矮星质量<br />
总结: <br />
这篇文章讨论了2013年新发现的经典新星V339 Del的特点，该新星的V光度曲线出现1.5等星的明显下降，因为形成了一个尘埃壳，与此同时还存在着软X射线的辐射。作者提出了一个多波段光度曲线模型，成功地复现了y和V光度曲线以及伽马射线和X射线光度曲线。在模型中，光度曲线下降后出现了强烈的激波，尘埃壳的形成抑制了[O iii]的辐射，导致V光度曲线下降，之后又逐渐恢复。白矮星的质量被确定为1.25 ± 0.05 M☉，V波段的距离模数为(m − M)V = 12.2 ± 0.2；考虑到消光作用，距离为d = 2.1 ± 0.2 kpc，E(B − V) = 0.18。 <div>
The classical nova V339 Del 2013 is characterized by a 1.5 mag dip of the V light curve owing to a dust shell formation, with which soft X-ray emissions coexist. We present a Strömgren y-band light curve, which represents continuum emission, not influenced by strong [O iii] emission lines. The y light curve monotonically decreases in marked contrast to the V light curve that shows a 1.5 mag dip. We propose a multiwavelength light-curve model that reproduces the y and V light curves as well as the gamma-ray and X-ray light curves. In our model, a strong shock arises far outside the photosphere after optical maximum, because later ejected matter collides with earlier ejected gas. Our shocked shell model explains optical emission lines, Hα, hard X-ray, and gamma-ray fluxes. A dust shell forms behind the shock that suppresses [O iii]. This low flux of [O iii] shapes a 1.5 mag drop in the V light curve. Then, the V flux recovers with an increasing contribution from [O iii] lines, while the y flux does not. However, the optical depth of the dust shell is too small to absorb the photospheric (X-ray) emission of the white dwarf. This is the reason that a dust shell and soft X-ray radiation coexist. We determined the white dwarf mass to be MWD = 1.25 ± 0.05 M☉ and the distance modulus in the V band to be (m − M)V = 12.2 ± 0.2; the distance is d = 2.1 ± 0.2 kpc for the reddening of E(B − V) = 0.18.

这篇文章研究了太阳内部的惯性波模式，发现在高方位阶数下，这些模式似乎与薄壳Rossby-Haurwitz模型有所偏离。研究采用了谱特征值求解器计算了差异旋转条件下的太阳惯性模式的谱。特别是关注赤道Rossby模式，发现计算得到的模式频率与观测的太阳模式频率非常接近，但n=0的模式明显向后偏转。这表明太阳的测量结果可能与n较高的模式相对应。此外，数值得到的特征函数似乎位于对流区内部，与太阳观测有显著差异，使推断变得更加复杂。 
<br /><br />总结: 挖掘了太阳内部的惯性波模式特性，发现了高方位阶数下模式的偏离及差异旋转影响，对赤道Rossby模式进行了重点研究，发现了模式频率的相似之处以及n=0模式的偏转，也指出了数值计算得到的特征函数的深层位置与太阳观测存在的差异。 <div>
Inertial wave modes in the Sun are of interest owing to their potential to reveal new insight into the solar interior. These predominantly retrograde-propagating modes in the solar subsurface appear to deviate from the thin-shell Rossby–Haurwitz model at high azimuthal orders. We present new measurements of sectoral inertial modes at m > 15 where the modes appear to become progressively less retrograde compared to the canonical Rossby–Haurwitz dispersion relation in a corotating frame. We use a spectral eigenvalue solver to compute the spectrum of solar inertial modes in the presence of differential rotation. Focussing specifically on equatorial Rossby modes, we find that the numerically obtained mode frequencies lie along distinct ridges, one of which lies strikingly close to the observed mode frequencies in the Sun. We also find that the n = 0 ridge is deflected strongly in the retrograde direction. This suggests that the solar measurements may not correspond to the fundamental n = 0 Rossby–Haurwitz solutions as was initially suspected, but to those for a higher n. The numerically obtained eigenfunctions also appear to sit deep within the convection zone—unlike those for the n = 0 modes—which differs substantially from solar measurements and complicates inference.

We present the results of models of impulsively heated coronal loops using the 1D hydrodynamic Adaptively Refined Godunov Solver code. The impulsive heating events (which we refer to as nanoflares) are modeled by discrete pulses of energy along the loop. We explore the occurrence of cold condensations due to the effective equivalent of thermal nonequilibrium in loops with steady heating, and examine its dependence on nanoflare timing and intensity and also nanoflare location along the loop, including randomized distributions of nanoflares. We find that randomizing the distribution of nanoflares, both in time/intensity and location, diminishes the likelihood of condensation occurring as compared to distributions with regularly occurring nanoflares with the same average properties. The usual criteria that condensation is favored for heating near loop footpoints and with high cadences are more strict for randomized (as opposed to regular) nanoflare distributions, and for randomized distributions the condensations stay in the loop for a shorter amount of time. That said, condensation can sometimes occur in cases where the average values of parameters (frequency or location) are beyond the critical limits above which condensation does not occur for corresponding steady, non-randomized values of those parameters. These properties of condensation occurring due to randomized heating can be used in the future to investigate the diagnostics of coronal heating mechanisms.

The Macquart relation describes the correlation between the dispersion measure (DM) of fast radio bursts (FRBs) and the redshift z of their host galaxies. The scatter of the Macquart relation is sensitive to the distribution of baryons in the intergalactic medium including those ejected from galactic halos through feedback processes. The variance of the distribution in DMs from the cosmic web (DMcosmic) is parameterized by a fluctuation parameter F. In this work, we present a new measurement of F using 78 FRBs of which 21 have been localized to host galaxies. Our analysis simultaneously fits for the Hubble constant H0 and the DM distribution due to the FRB host galaxy. We find that the fluctuation parameter is degenerate with these parameters, most notably H0, and use a uniform prior on H0 to measure at the 3σ confidence interval and a new constraint on the Hubble constant . Using a synthetic sample of 100 localized FRBs, the constraint on the fluctuation parameter is improved by a factor of ∼2. Comparing our F measurement to simulated predictions from cosmological simulation (IllustrisTNG), we find agreement between redshifts 0.4 < z and z < 2.0. However, at z < 0.4, the simulations underpredict F, which we attribute to the rapidly changing extragalactic DM excess distribution at low redshift.

Using general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations, it has been suggested that the rotational energy of a rapidly rotating black hole (BH) is preferentially extracted along the magnetic field lines threading the event horizon in the middle and lower latitudes. Applying this angle-dependent Poynting flux to the jet downstream, we demonstrate that the jets exhibit limb-brightened structures at various viewing angles, as observed from Mrk 501, M87, and Cyg A between 5° and 75°, and that the limb brightening is enhanced when the jet is collimated strongly. It is also found that the jet width perpendicular to the propagation direction shrinks at the projected distance of the altitude where the jet collimates from a conical shape (near the BH) to a parabolic one (in the jet). Comparing with Very Long Baseline Interferometry observations, we show that this collimation takes place within the deprojected altitude of 100 Schwarzschild radii from the BH in the case of the M87 jet.

The existence of strongly bound water molecules on silicate surfaces, above the desorption temperature of water ice, was first predicted by computational studies and has recently been demonstrated by laboratory experiments. Such trapped water may be present in various astrophysical environments and there is now evidence for its presence in the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) and in extraterrestrial particles. We present here new results of a laboratory study of the phenomenon of trapping (strong bonding) of water molecules by silicates. We show that the efficiency of the trapping is strongly dependent on the properties and composition of the surface. Our results point out that the presence of trapped water should be due to the hydrophilic properties of the silicate surface and that the nature of the trapping is physical (physisorption rather than chemisorption). We demonstrate that water can be trapped on silicates up to temperatures of about 470 K, which speaks for the presence of wet silicate grains in the terrestrial planet formation zone in planet-forming disks. Studying the thermal and UV stability of trapped water, we conclude that the detection of trapped water in the diffuse ISM speaks for its efficient continuous formation. We discuss our results as relevant to fundamental scientific questions, such as the oxygen depletion problem, the origin of water on Earth, and the formation of rocky planets.

<div> Gaia Data Release 2, M dwarf gap, convective transition mass, Hα emission, Ca ii H and K activity

总结:
Gaia Data Release 2中发现了M矮星间隙现象，也称为Jao Gap，它表现为主序线上在与对流转变质量（约0.35 M⊙）附近的一小段明度范围内，星体密度减少了17%。之前的研究表明，太阳附近的恒星在Jao Gap的G亮度附近存在Hα发射的缺乏现象。作者推测，这一现象可能是由于Jao Gap特征形成和恒星辐射性转变区的破坏所导致的恒星磁拓扑的复杂变化。本研究还观察到Ca ii H和K活动与Hα在Jao Gap附近表现出类似的异常行为，活动的恒星间变化增加。研究提出了一个恒星磁场演化的玩具模型，表明这种增加可能是由于Jao Gap形成所驱动的周期混合事件引起的磁场随机破坏。 <div>
The Gaia M dwarf gap, also known as the Jao Gap, is a novel feature discovered in the Gaia Data Release 2 G versus BP-RP color–magnitude diagram. This gap represents a 17% decrease in stellar density in a thin magnitude band around the convective transition mass (∼0.35 M⊙) on the main sequence. Previous work has demonstrated a paucity of Hα emission coincident with the G magnitude of the Jao Gap in the solar neighborhood. The exact mechanism that results in this paucity is as of yet unknown; however, the authors of the originating paper suggest that it may be the result of complex variations to a star’s magnetic topology driven by the Jao Gap’s characteristic formation and breakdown of stars’ radiative transition zones. We present a follow-up investigating another widely used magnetic activity metric, Calcium ii H and K emission. Ca ii H and K activity appears to share a similar anomalous behavior as Hα does near the Jao Gap magnitude. We observe an increase in star-to-star variation of magnetic activity near the Jao Gap. We present a toy model of a star’s magnetic field evolution, which demonstrates that this increase may be due to stochastic disruptions to the magnetic field originating from the periodic-mixing events characteristic of the convective kissing instabilities that drive the formation of the Jao Gap.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章介绍了机器学习在核物质方程状态中的应用。研究者构建了一个神经网络平台，用于限制核物质状态方程的行为。他们发现神经网络可以合理预测参数空间，并为强子相互作用的限制提供新的线索。文中以相对论平均场近似为例说明了平台的可行性和效率。结果表明神经网络可以确实估计模型参数，使得核物质在饱和密度周围的性质和中子星的整体性质都可以满足。当前模块化设计的神经网络的优化和扩展到其他有效模型都是直接的。 <div>
Due to its powerful capability and high efficiency in big data analysis, machine learning has been applied in various fields. We construct a neural network platform to constrain the behaviors of the equation of state of nuclear matter with respect to the properties of nuclear matter at saturation density and the properties of neutron stars. It is found that the neural network is able to give reasonable predictions of parameter space and provide new hints into the constraints of hadron interactions. As a specific example, we take the relativistic mean field approximation in a widely accepted Walecka-type model to illustrate the feasibility and efficiency of the platform. The results show that the neural network can indeed estimate the parameters of the model at a certain precision such that both the properties of nuclear matter around saturation density and global properties of neutron stars can be saturated. The optimization of the present modularly designed neural network and extension to other effective models is straightforward.

总结: 
这篇文章报道了对X3Σ−基态的氘化分子离子SD+进行了实验室测量，并确定了其旋转、离心畸变、自旋-自旋相互作用和超精细结构常数。通过这些参数，提供了SD+的准确亚毫米波静止频率，以便在天文学上进行探测。研究人员利用Atacama大型毫米/亚毫米阵列(ALMA)对PKS 1830-211夸萨的SD+吸收线进行了调查，确定了分子吸收线的上限总柱密度为3 × 1012 cm−2。 <div>
Seven rotational and fine-structure transitions of the deuterated molecular ion SD+ in the X3Σ− ground electronic state have been measured in the 271–863 GHz region in the laboratory. This ion has been produced by direct-current glow discharge using a mixture of D2S and argon in a free space cell in a temperature range of −140°C to −160°C. The rotational, centrifugal distortion, spin–spin interaction, and hyperfine constants have been determined; the standard deviation of the residuals in the fitting is 109 kHz. The set of obtained spectroscopic parameters provides a list of accurate submillimeter rest frequencies of SD+ for astronomical detection. We have investigated lines of SD+ toward the quasar PKS 1830-211 using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array archive, as the z = 0.89 molecular absorber exists in front of this quasar. A data set covering the 297 GHz region includes the NJ = 23–12 transition at 561 GHz due to redshift, providing an upper limit of the column density Ntot = 3 × 1012 cm−2 for SD+.

<div> 关键词: 小尺度场向电流, 磁层边界层, 能量耗散, 太阳风, 磁层耦合<br />
总结: <br />
这项研究利用2015年5月至2018年6月的Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS)任务的高分辨率测量数据，统计性地研究了磁层边界层中小尺度场向电流（SFACs）的性质。共成功识别了2235个SFACs，它们的持续时间主要在0.2到0.3秒之间，宽度大多小于1个离子惯性长度，主要分布在5到25个电子惯性长度之间。SFACs的主要载体是电子，超过70%的SFACs表现出净能量耗散，其中大部分能量耗散发生在平行方向。SFACs在空间上分布广泛，且在靠近磁层的边界层中发生率更高。此外，不到一半的SFACs出现在众所周知的结构中，约54%的SFACs出现在“其他”未知结构中。这些结果提高了我们对磁层边界层中电流系统和SFACs在太阳风和磁层耦合中的作用的理解。 <div>
Based on high-resolution measurements from the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission from 2015 May to 2018 June, we statistically investigate the properties of small-scale field-aligned currents (SFACs) in the magnetopause boundary layer. A total of 2235 SFACs are successfully identified. The durations of SFACs mainly fall between 0.2 and 0.3 s. Over 90% of SFACs have a width of less than 1 ion inertia length and are primarily distributed from 5 to 25 electron inertia lengths, implying that the SFACs belong to the kinetic-scale current layer. The main carriers of SFACs are electrons, and over 70% of SFACs exhibit net energy dissipation (i.e., J · E′ > 0) with the majority of energy dissipation taking place in the parallel direction. SFACs are widely distributed spatially, and the occurrence rate of SFACs is higher in the boundary layer closer to the magnetosphere. Additionally, less than half of the total SFACs are identified in well-known structures, including the magnetic reconnection region, flux transfer event, Kelvin–Helmholtz vortex, and exhaust region, and 54% of the SFACs are in the “others” unknown structures. These results improve our comprehension of the current system at the magnetopause and the roles of SFACs in the coupling between the solar wind and magnetosphere.

总结:<br />
本文详细计算了宇宙γ射线与太阳光子相互作用，产生电子-正电子对的吸收光学深度。该效应在距离太阳较近的γ射线源处最为显著，吸收光学深度可高达τγγ ∼ 10−2。文章还考虑了亚光速Lorentz不变性（LIV）对吸收截面阈值的影响，首次展示亚光速LIV可导致τγγ与非LIV情况相比增加或减少。研究表明，至少在原理上，可通过HAWC或LHAASO在≳20 TeV的能量范围内观测太阳附近γ射线源，探测LIV效应，尽管由于效应规模微小，测量将极为困难。 <div>
We compute in detail the absorption optical depth for astrophysical γ-ray photons interacting with solar photons to produce electron–positron pairs. This effect is greatest for γ-ray sources at small angular distances from the Sun, reaching optical depths as high as τγγ ∼ 10−2. We also calculate this effect including modifications to the absorption cross-section threshold from subluminal Lorentz invariance violation (LIV). We show for the first time that subluminal LIV can lead to increases or decreases in τγγ compared to the non-LIV case. We show that, at least in principle, LIV can be probed with this effect with observations of γ-ray sources near the Sun at ≳20 TeV by HAWC or LHAASO, although a measurement will be extremely difficult due to the small size of the effect.

<div> 关键词: AT2022cmc, TDE, NuSTAR, X-ray spectra, jetted tidal disruption event<br />
总结:<br />
研究报告了最近十年发现的第一个轴向射流式潮汐破坏事件（TDE）AT2022cmc，也是迄今为止已知的第四个轴向射流式TDE候选者。研究团队对AT2022cmc进行了NuSTAR硬X射线（3-30 keV）观测，并使用NICER、Swift和XMM-Newton获得了软X射线（0.3-6 keV）观测。他们的分析表明，这个宽带X射线光谱可以很好地用fν ∝ ν−0.5（fν ∝ ν−1）来描述，其中ν−0.5（ν−1）在观测者框架中的Ebk ∼ 10 keV的休息能量以下（以上）。他们的模型实现了广义洛伦兹因子的约束，表明射流的核心洛伦兹因子大约为10-100。他们的解释对其他来源如γ射线暴的相对论射流的性质有广泛的影响。这种性质不同于Pasham等人提出的模型，后者认为无线电和X射线来自于物质为主导的射流中的同一发射区。 <div>
AT2022cmc was recently reported as the first on-axis jetted tidal disruption event (TDE) discovered in the last decade, and the fourth on-axis jetted TDE candidate known so far. In this work, we present NuSTAR hard X-ray (3–30 keV) observations of AT2022cmc, as well as soft X-ray (0.3–6 keV) observations obtained by NICER, Swift, and XMM-Newton. Our analysis reveals that the broadband X-ray spectra can be well described by a broken power law with fν ∝ ν−0.5 (fν ∝ ν−1) below (above) the rest-frame break energy of Ebk ∼ 10 keV at the observer frame tobs = 7.8 and 17.6 days since discovery. At tobs = 36.2 days, the X-ray spectrum is consistent with either a single power law or a broken power law. By modeling the spectral energy distribution from radio to hard X-ray across the three NuSTAR observing epochs, we find that the submillimeter/radio emission originates from external shocks at large distances ≳1017 cm from the black hole, the UV/optical light comes from a thermal envelope with radius ∼1015 cm, and the X-ray emission is consistent with synchrotron radiation powered by energy dissipation at intermediate radii within the (likely magnetically dominated) jet. We constrain the bulk Lorentz factor of the jet to be of the order 10–100. Our interpretation differs from the model proposed by Pasham et al. where both the radio and X-rays come from the same emitting zone in a matter-dominated jet. Our model for the jet X-ray emission has broad implications on the nature of relativistic jets in other sources such as gamma-ray bursts.

Mirror stars are a generic prediction of dissipative dark matter (DM) models, including minimal atomic DM and twin baryons in the mirror twin Higgs model. Mirror stars can capture regular matter from the interstellar medium through extremely suppressed kinetic mixing interactions between the regular and the dark photon. This accumulated “nugget” will draw heat from the mirror star core and emit highly characteristic X-ray and optical signals. In this work, we devise a general parameterization of mirror star nugget properties that is independent of the unknown details of mirror star stellar physics, and use the Cloudy spectral synthesis code to obtain realistic and comprehensive predictions for the thermal emissions from optically thin mirror star nuggets. We find that mirror star nuggets populate an extremely well-defined and narrow region of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram that only partially overlaps with the white dwarf population. Our detailed spectral predictions, which we make publicly available, allow us to demonstrate that optically thin nuggets can be clearly distinguished from white dwarf stars by their continuum spectrum shape, and from planetary nebulae and other optically thin standard sources by their highly exotic emission-line ratios. Our work will enable realistic mirror star telescope searches, which may reveal the detailed nature of DM.

总结: 
太阳X射线光谱仪在Hinotori任务期间观测得到了高分辨率的光谱数据，用于研究太阳耀斑中高度电离铁离子的发射线。研究对数据进行了单温度拟合，并与理论预测进行了比较。结果表明，在特定波长范围内，通过使用从j/w强度比估算的单电子温度进行的合成光谱拟合效果良好。此外，还推导出观测线比的经验关系，并根据观察到的线比估计了Fe+25/Fe+24的离子分数。最后指出，Fe xxv线比的系统过量可能暗示了原子参数或原子建模的问题。 <div>
High-resolution spectra observed by the Solar X-ray spectrometer on board the Hinotori mission are revisited. Flat crystals slightly offset to the satellite spin axis produce automatic spectral scans for emission lines emerging from highly charged iron ions in solar flares every half-spin time period. All the downlinked data of the mission are converted to FITS format and major flare spectral data are revived as IDL save files in ISAS/DARTS. Based on these data sets, single-temperature fits are performed for the emission line complex of highly charged iron ions in the wavelength range of 1.75–1.95 Å and compared with theoretical predictions. Synthetic spectra with single electron temperatures estimated from j/w line-intensity ratios fit fairly well for Fe xxiv and Fe xxiii lines in the wavelength range of 1.85–1.88 Å, while intensity ratios of Fe xxv lines (x, y, z) and the inner-shell excitation line of Fe xxiv (q) to the Fe xxv resonance line (w) have systematic excesses. Empirical relations for the observed line ratios are derived. Ion fractions of Fe+25/Fe+24 estimated by intensity ratios of Lyα/w in the temperature range of log Te=7.25–7.45 are consistent with values in ionization equilibrium, and the remaining excesses of the Fe xxv line ratios may suggest problems with the atomic parameters or atomic modeling.

We report commissioning observations of the Si x 1430 nm solar coronal line observed coronagraphically with the Cryogenic Near-Infrared Spectropolarimeter at the National Science Foundation’s Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope. These are the first known spatially resolved observations of this spectral line, which has strong potential as a coronal magnetic field diagnostic. The observations target a complex active region located on the solar northeast limb on 2022 March 4. We present a first analysis of these data that extracts the spectral line properties through a careful treatment of the variable atmospheric transmission that is known to impact this spectral window. Rastered images are created and compared with extreme-UV observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) instrument. A method for estimating the electron density from the Si x observations is then demonstrated that makes use of the forbidden line density-sensitive emissivity and an emission-measure analysis of the SDO/AIA bandpass observations. In addition, we derive an effective temperature and nonthermal line width across the region. This study informs the calibration approaches required for more routine observations of this promising diagnostic line.

The focus of this study is on the spatial and temporal distributions of 2704 solar jets throughout Solar Cycle 24, from beginning to end. This work is a follow-up paper by Liu et al. With this extended data set, we have further confirmed the two distinct distributions of coronal jets: one located in polar regions and another at lower latitudes. Further analysis of the series of coronal jets revealed kink oscillations of the global solar magnetic field. Additionally, studying the northern and southern hemispheres separately showed an antiphase correlation that can be interpreted as a global sausage oscillatory pattern of the loci of the coronal jets. We also investigated how the variability of the solar cycle may impact the power law index of coronal jets by dividing the data set into the rising and declining phases of Solar Cycle 24. However, there is no compelling evidence to suggest that the power law index changes after the maximum. It is worth noting that based on this vast database of solar jets, the degradation of the 304 Å channel of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly instrument on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory can also be identified and confirmed. Finally, we searched for compelling signatures of the presence of active longitude in the coronal jet database. There was no obvious evidence with a high probability of an active longitude; therefore, this question remains yet to be addressed further.

Exploring the concept of a massive photon has been an important area in astronomy and physics. If photons have mass, their propagation in nonvacuum space would be affected by both the nonzero mass mγ and the presence of a plasma medium. This would lead to a delay time proportional to , which deviates from the classical dispersion relation (proportional to ν−2). For the first time, we have derived the dispersion relation of a photon with a nonzero mass propagating in plasma. To reduce the impact of variations in the dispersion measure (DM), we employed the high-precision timing data to constrain the upper bound of the photon mass. Specifically, the DM/time of arrival (TOA) uncertainties derived from ultrawide bandwidth (UWB) observations conducted by the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA) are used. The dedispersed pulses from fast radio bursts (FRBs) with minimal scattering effects are also used to constrain the upper bound of photon mass. The stringent limit on the photon mass is determined by uncertainties of the TOA of pulsars, with an optimum value of 9.52 × 10−46 kg (5.34 × 10−10 eV c−2). In the future, it is essential to investigate the photon mass, as pulsar timing data are collected by PPTA and UWB receivers, or FRBs with wideband spectra are detected by UWB receivers.

在这篇文章中，研究了在低βp（βp = 0.25）冲击波情况下，通过1D和2D粒子在单元模拟中测量了热电子的能量激发。研究发现，电子加热由双极、B-平行电位跳跃Δϕ∥描述，它与电子温度跳跃大致成线性关系。在模拟中得出的电位跳跃为 -0.2，与之前的测量和模拟结果一致。不考虑离对角线电子压强张量项可能会导致在低βp冲击波中对Δϕ∥的系统低估。此外，研究还关注了两种θBn = 65°的冲击波情况，分别是具有沿B方向的30di鸣波前体的情况和具有倾斜于B的短5di鸣波前体的情况。在鸣波前体中，Δϕ∥随着冲击波朝向呈现出沿多个鸣波波长的逐渐上升，并且在磁场波谷内还具有局部尖峰。对于θBn = 65°的情况的1D模拟显示，Δϕ∥对电子等离子体与回旋频率比值ωpe/Ωce的依赖性较弱，当mi/me增加到真实的质子-电子值1836时，Δϕ∥减少了一倍。 <div>
We measure the thermal electron energization in 1D and 2D particle-in-cell simulations of quasi-perpendicular, low-beta (βp = 0.25) collisionless ion–electron shocks with mass ratio mi/me = 200, fast Mach number –4, and upstream magnetic field angle θBn = 55°–85° from the shock normal . It is known that shock electron heating is described by an ambipolar, B-parallel electric potential jump, Δϕ∥, that scales roughly linearly with the electron temperature jump. Our simulations have –0.2 in units of the pre-shock ions’ bulk kinetic energy, in agreement with prior measurements and simulations. Different ways to measure ϕ∥, including the use of de Hoffmann–Teller frame fields, agree to tens-of-percent accuracy. Neglecting off-diagonal electron pressure tensor terms can lead to a systematic underestimate of ϕ∥ in our low-βp shocks. We further focus on two θBn = 65° shocks: a ( ) case with a long, 30di precursor of whistler waves along , and a ( ) case with a shorter, 5di precursor of whistlers oblique to both and B; di is the ion skin depth. Within the precursors, ϕ∥ has a secular rise toward the shock along multiple whistler wavelengths and also has localized spikes within magnetic troughs. In a 1D simulation of the , θBn = 65° case, ϕ∥ shows a weak dependence on the electron plasma-to-cyclotron frequency ratio ωpe/Ωce, and ϕ∥ decreases by a factor of 2 as mi/me is raised to the true proton–electron value of 1836.

<div> UMa3/U1、暗物质、N-body simulations、LCDM halo、多次观测

UMa3/U1是迄今为止已知的银河系卫星中最微弱的，其质量较小，半光半径为3 ±1 pc。有可能是已发现的最暗淡的星系，或者是围绕银河系轨道上已知最微弱的自引力星团。其视向速度离散性暗示存在暗物质，尽管目前的测量由于未知的潜在双星贡献而不确定。N-body模拟表明，如果是自引力的话，该系统在银河系潮汐场中不可能存活比单次轨道（约0.4 Gyr）更久，这强烈暗示了该系统受到大量暗物质的稳定。如果UMa3/U1在一个约10^9M⊙的线性冷暗物质（LCDM）暗物质晕中形成，则其速度离散度有望预测为大约1 km s^-1。这与目前的估计大致一致，不考虑双星，则将σlos放在1-4 km s^-1的范围内。由于其密集的拱，这样的暗物质晕应该能够在银河系潮汐场中存活下来，使UMa3/U1到目前为止相对完好无损。这意味着UMa3/U1可能是银河系最微弱和最密集的矮星系卫星，对于替代暗物质模型以及LCDM宇宙学中光亮星系形成的最低暗物质晕质量阈值都有重要影响。我们的研究呼吁进行多次高分辨率光谱跟进观测以确认这一非凡系统的暗物质含量。<br /><br />总结:UMa3/U1是银河系中最微弱的卫星系统之一，其中可能存在大量暗物质，对于宇宙学和星系形成模型有重要影响。我们需要进行多次观测以确认其暗物质成分。 <div>
The recently discovered stellar system Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1 (UMa3/U1) is the faintest known Milky Way satellite to date. With a stellar mass of and a half-light radius of 3 ± 1 pc, it is either the darkest galaxy ever discovered or the faintest self-gravitating star cluster known to orbit the Galaxy. Its line-of-sight velocity dispersion suggests the presence of dark matter, although current measurements are inconclusive because of the unknown contribution to the dispersion of potential binary stars. We use N-body simulations to show that, if self-gravitating, the system could not survive in the Milky Way tidal field for much longer than a single orbit (roughly 0.4 Gyr), which strongly suggests that the system is stabilized by the presence of large amounts of dark matter. If UMa3/U1 formed at the center of a ∼109M⊙ cuspy LCDM halo, its velocity dispersion would be predicted to be of order ∼1 km s−1. This is roughly consistent with the current estimate, which, neglecting binaries, places σlos in the range 1–4 km s−1. Because of its dense cusp, such a halo should be able to survive the Milky Way tidal field, keeping UMa3/U1 relatively unscathed until the present time. This implies that UMa3/U1 is plausibly the faintest and densest dwarf galaxy satellite of the Milky Way, with important implications for alternative dark matter models and for the minimum halo mass threshold for luminous galaxy formation in the LCDM cosmology. Our results call for multi-epoch high-resolution spectroscopic follow-up to confirm the dark matter content of this extraordinary system.

<br />总结:
本研究使用哈勃空间望远镜对孤立、抑制的矮星系Tucana中374颗红巨星分支恒星的金属丰度进行测量。研究发现了Tucana的全局金属丰度分布功能，以及其金属丰度梯度。Tucana的红巨星分支呈现出两个不同的金属丰度分布，与银河系卫星相比，Tucana在固定恒星质量下更为富含金属。此外，约有2%的Tucana恒星的铁丰度低于-3%，而20%的恒星的铁丰度高于-1%。这项研究为社区提供了进行光谱后续观测的目录。 <div>
We measure the metallicities of 374 red giant branch (RGB) stars in the isolated, quenched dwarf galaxy Tucana using Hubble Space Telescope narrowband (F395N) calcium H and K imaging. Our sample is a factor of ∼7 larger than what is available from previous studies. Our main findings are as follows. (i) A global metallicity distribution function (MDF) with and . (ii) A metallicity gradient of −0.54 ± 0.07 dex (−2.1 ± 0.3 dex kpc−1) over the extent of our imaging (∼2.5 Re), which is steeper than literature measurements. Our finding is consistent with predicted gradients from the publicly available FIRE-2 simulations, in which bursty star formation creates stellar population gradients and dark matter cores. (iii) Tucana’s bifurcated RGB has distinct metallicities: a blue RGB with and and a red RGB with and . (iv) At fixed stellar mass, Tucana is more metal-rich than Milky Way satellites by ∼0.4 dex, but its blue RGB is chemically comparable to the satellites. Tucana’s MDF appears consistent with star-forming isolated dwarfs, though MDFs of the latter are not as well populated. (v) About 2% of Tucana’s stars have [Fe/H] < −3% and 20% have [Fe/H] > −1. We provide a catalog for community spectroscopic follow-up.

<div> AGN, continuum emission, broad emission lines, reverberation mapping, Broad Emission Line MApping Code
<br />
这篇文章介绍了一种新的前向建模工具——Broad Emission Line MApping Code，该工具可以模拟宽发射线区域对任何给定输入光变曲线的速度分辨的回响响应。通过模拟以母线驱动的大气流的球状BLR和具有开普勒旋转的盘状BLR的一组模型对单个光谱脉冲的速度响应，我们计算了响应加权的时间延迟（反射“滞后”），这被认为是BLR的光度加权半径的代理。我们发现，当云层以各向同性发射并且是辐射为主时（部分电离）时，响应加权的延迟才等价于光度加权的半径。否则，光度加权的半径可能会被高估多达两倍。 
<br /><br />总结: <div>
The variable continuum emission of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) produces corresponding responses in the broad emission lines, which are modulated by light travel delays, and contain information on the physical properties, structure, and kinematics of the emitting gas region. The reverberation mapping technique, a time series analysis of the driving light curve and response, can recover some of this information, including the size and velocity field of the broad-line region (BLR). Here we introduce a new forward-modeling tool, the Broad Emission Line MApping Code, which simulates the velocity-resolved reverberation response of the BLR to any given input light curve by setting up a 3D ensemble of gas clouds for various specified geometries, velocity fields, and cloud properties. In this work, we present numerical approximations to the transfer function by simulating the velocity-resolved responses to a single continuum pulse for sets of models representing a spherical BLR with a radiatively driven outflow and a disklike BLR with Keplerian rotation. We explore how the structure, velocity field, and other BLR properties affect the transfer function. We calculate the response-weighted time delay (reverberation “lag”), which is considered to be a proxy for the luminosity-weighted radius of the BLR. We investigate the effects of anisotropic cloud emission and matter-bounded (completely ionized) clouds and find the response-weighted delay is only equivalent to the luminosity-weighted radius when clouds emit isotropically and are radiation-bounded (partially ionized). Otherwise, the luminosity-weighted radius can be overestimated by up to a factor of 2.

总结:<br />
本研究通过对未来的鲁宾天文台遗产空间与时间调查（LSST）的模拟光变曲线进行分析，预测了二进制超大质量黑洞在这项调查中的可检测性。研究发现，虽然固有变异性可能导致对两个黑洞的干扰，但对于大部分的潜在二进制光变曲线，二进制信号的周期和相位可以被辨别出来。然而，由于赛弗尔星系核的固有变异性，二进制幅度被高估且难以恢复。此外，最亮的赛弗尔星系核模拟光变曲线的假阳性率高达60％。因此，使用光度周期性进行纯电磁探测的二进制样本中将存在大量的假阳性。本研究为了解鲁宾所发现的二进制候选者的真实和假阳性率提供了一种重要且经济的方法。 <div>
Periodic signatures in time-domain observations of quasars have been used to search for binary supermassive black holes (SMBHs). These searches, across existing time-domain surveys, have produced several hundred candidates. The general stochastic variability of quasars, however, can masquerade as a false-positive periodic signal, especially when monitoring cadence and duration are limited. In this work, we predict the detectability of binary SMBHs in the upcoming Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We apply computationally inexpensive sinusoidal curve fits to millions of simulated LSST Deep Drilling Field light curves of both single, isolated quasars and binary quasars. The period and phase of simulated binary signals can generally be disentangled from quasar variability. Binary amplitude is overestimated and poorly recovered for two-thirds of potential binaries due to quasar accretion variability. Quasars with strong intrinsic variability can obscure a binary signal too much for recovery. We also find that the most luminous quasars mimic current binary candidate light curves and their properties: The false-positive rates are 60% for these quasars. The reliable recovery of binary period and phase for a wide range of input binary LSST light curves is promising for multi-messenger characterization of binary SMBHs. However, pure electromagnetic detections of binaries using photometric periodicity with amplitude greater than 0.1 mag will result in samples that are overwhelmed by false positives. This paper represents an important and computationally inexpensive way forward for understanding the true and false-positive rates for binary candidates identified by Rubin.

总结: 
1. 介绍了Perseus星系团作为X射线天空中最亮的星系团的特点及其对研究星系团内部介质的重要性。
2. 提到了以前由于NuSTAR点扩散函数的延伸翼和AGN的活跃性使得对Perseus星系团中心附近的弥散辐射的研究几乎不可能进行。
3. 介绍了新开发的nucrossarf开源软件包，允许对点源和弥散源的贡献进行建模，以便考虑AGN的散射光。
4. 对使用NuSTAR对Perseus星系团进行的弥散硬X射线（3-25keV）辐射分析的结果进行了概述，发现了超出20keV的约10%的辐射过量。
5. 讨论了这种过量的潜在起源和影响，并提出了对nucrossarf系统不确定性的表征，这对未来的工作可能有用。 <div>
As the brightest galaxy cluster in the X-ray sky, Perseus is an excellent target for studying the intracluster medium (ICM), but until recently, its active galactic nucleus (AGN) made studies of the diffuse emission near its center nearly impossible to accomplish with NuSTAR, due to the extended wings of NuSTAR's point-spread function. The development of a new open-source software package—nucrossarf—now allows the contribution from point and diffuse sources to be modeled so that scattered light from the AGN can be accounted for. Using this technique, we present an analysis of diffuse hard X-ray (3–25 keV) emission from the ICM using three archival NuSTAR observations of the Perseus cluster. We find a ∼10% excess of emission beyond 20 keV not describable by purely thermal models. By performing similar analyses of AGNs in archival observations, we have characterized the systematic uncertainty of the modeled AGN contribution to be 3.4%. However, in order to explain the excess, the total scattered AGN emission would have to be 39% stronger than we have measured. We test physical explanations for the excess, such as diffuse inverse-Compton emission potentially originating from the radio mini-halo, but we determine that none of the models are compelling. An upper limit on the inverse-Compton flux (≤1.5 × 10−11 erg s−1 cm−2) and a corresponding lower limit on the global magnetic field strength (≥0.35 μG) are derived. We discuss the potential origin and implications of the excess and present our characterization of the nucrossarf systematic uncertainty, which should be useful for future work.

We present Submillimeter Array (SMA) mapping of 12CO J = 2 → 1, 13CO J = 2 → 1, and CN N = 2 → 1 emission from the ring-like planetary nebula NGC 3132, one of the subjects of JWST Early Release Observation near-infrared imaging. The ∼5″ resolution SMA data demonstrate that the Southern Ring’s main, bright, molecule-rich ring is indeed an expanding ring, as opposed to a limb-brightened shell, in terms of its intrinsic (physical) structure. This suggests that NGC 3132 is a bipolar nebula viewed more or less pole-on (inclination ∼15°–30°). The SMA data furthermore reveal that the nebula harbors a second expanding molecular ring that is aligned almost orthogonally to the main, bright molecular ring. We propose that this two-ring structure is the remnant of an ellipsoidal molecular envelope of ejecta that terminated the progenitor star’s asymptotic giant branch evolution and was subsequently disrupted by a series of misaligned fast, collimated outflows or jets resulting from interactions between the progenitor and one or more companions.

<br /><br />总结:本研究重新评估了来自NVSS目录的偶极估计与CMB测量之间的明显不一致。研究发现，在确定预期的偶极信号时，考虑NVSS源的shot noise和聚类以及运动贡献至关重要。我们使用了聚类红移方法和交叉匹配技术来优化聚类项的估计。然后，在标准的ΛCDM宇宙学模型中，包括所有（即运动、shot noise和聚类）偶极分量，推导出了NVSS偶极的概率分布。我们的模型与以往大部分文献中的NVSS偶极测量基本一致，精度达到或优于2σ。我们得出结论，NVSS偶极与CMB偶极的运动起源在ΛCDM模型内是一致的。 <div>
The dipole moment in the angular distribution of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is thought to originate from the doppler effect and our motion relative to the CMB frame. Observations of large-scale structure (LSS) should show a related “kinematic dipole” and help test the kinematic origin of the CMB dipole. Intriguingly, many previous LSS dipole studies suggest discrepancies with the expectations from the CMB. Here, we reassess the apparent inconsistency between the CMB measurements and dipole estimates from the NVSS catalog of radio sources. We find that it is important to account for the shot noise and clustering of the NVSS sources, as well as kinematic contributions, in determining the expected dipole signal. We use the clustering redshift method and a cross-matching technique to refine estimates of the clustering term. We then derive a probability distribution for the expected NVSS dipole in a standard ΛCDM cosmological model including all (i.e., kinematic, shot noise, and clustering) dipole components. Our model agrees with most of the previous NVSS dipole measurements in the literature at better than ≲2σ. We conclude that the NVSS dipole is consistent with a kinematic origin for the CMB dipole within ΛCDM.

本文提出了一种通过观测高红移时期的H i 21 cm和CO线强度图来重建宇宙初始密度分布的方法。H i 21 cm和CO线强度图提供了关于密度场的互补信息，H i 21 cm场是中性区域的物质分布的代理，而CO线强度图对高密度的星形成区域敏感，这些区域是再电离源。通过共轭梯度法和代价函数最小化的方式，通过分析得到代价函数的梯度的解析表达式来实现密度场的重建。研究结果显示，通过半数值模拟再电离的输入图来重新模拟的强度图在再电离的所有阶段具有小于7%的均方根误差。这种重建方法在CO图上应用了一个乐观的水平的射线噪声或者每幅图应用了小于标准偏差的10%的白噪声时，仍然表现出了约10%的均方根误差的鲁棒性。这个概念验证的工作证明了重建方法的稳健性，从而提供了一种从高红移观测中重建宇宙初始密度分布的有效技术。 <div>
The initial density distribution provides a basis for understanding the complete evolution of cosmological density fluctuations. While reconstruction in our local Universe exploits the observations of galaxy surveys with large volumes, observations of high-redshift galaxies are performed with a small field of view and therefore can hardly be used for reconstruction. Here, we propose reconstructing the initial density field using the H i 21 cm and CO line intensity maps from the epoch of reionization. Observations of these two intensity maps provide complementary information on the density field—the H i 21 cm field is a proxy of matter distributions in the neutral regions, while the CO line intensity maps are sensitive to the high-density, star-forming regions that host the sources for reionization. Technically, we employ the conjugate gradient method and develop the machinery for minimizing the cost function for the intensity mapping observations. Analytical expressions for the gradient of cost function are derived explicitly. We show that the resimulated intensity maps match the input maps of mock observations using semi-numerical simulations of reionization with an rms error ≲7% at all stages of reionization. This reconstruction is also robust with an rms error of ∼10% when an optimistic level of shot noise is applied to the CO map or white noise at the level of ≲10% of the standard deviation is applied to each map. Our proof-of-concept work demonstrates the robustness of the reconstruction method, thereby providing an effective technique for reconstructing the cosmological initial density distribution from high-redshift observations.

总结:
太阳风观测受限于黄道平面附近，IMAP任务计划的GLOWS仪器旨在通过观测星际中性氢的反散射辉光，间接获取太阳风的纬度结构。研究发现，太阳光照的变化会立即反映在辉光上，但其调整时间比变化上升时间更长。相反，星际氢的电离率变化会与辉光亮度呈反相关，并且存在数月的延迟。此外，辉光对于太阳极地区的电离率变化不敏感，因此需要使用适当的参数函数来近似电离率剖面，以检测极地区的电离率和太阳风变化。 <div>
Direct observations of solar wind are mostly limited to the vicinity of the ecliptic plane. Retrieving the latitudinal structure of solar wind indirectly based on observations of the backscatter glow of interstellar neutral hydrogen is complex and requires support from theoretical models. The GLOWS instrument, to operate on the planned IMAP mission, will scan the helioglow along circumsolar rings with an angular distance of ∼75°. Its objective is to retrieve the latitudinal structure of the ionization rate of interstellar hydrogen and with this the structure of the solar wind. In preparation for the future analysis, we studied the sensitivity of the light curves to temporal and latitudinal variation of the ionization rate of interstellar hydrogen and the solar Lyα illumination. Based on carefully planned numerical experiments, we analyze the time delay and relaxation time of the system for variations of the ionization rate and solar illumination in heliolatitude and with time. We found that variations in the solar illumination are reflected in the helioglow without delay, but relaxation takes longer than the variation rise time. By contrast, variations in the ionization rate are anticorrelated with the helioglow brightness with a delay of several months. We also found that the helioglow is not sensitive to variations in the ionization rate at the solar poles, so retrieving the ionization rate and solar wind at the poles requires approximation of the ionization rate profiles with appropriate parametric functions.

The far-infrared (FIR) opacity of dust in dark clouds within the Ophiuchus molecular cloud is investigated through multiwavelength infrared observations from UKIDSS, Spitzer, and Herschel. Employing the infrared color excess technique with both near-infrared and mid-infrared photometric data, a high-resolution extinction map in the K band (AK) is constructed for three dark clouds: L1689, L1709, and L1712. The derived extinction map has a resolution of and reaches a depth of AK ∼ 3 mag. The FIR optical depths τ250 at a reference wavelength of 250 μm are obtained by fitting the Herschel PACS and SPIRE continuum data at 100, 160, 250, 350, and 500 μm using a modified blackbody model. The average dust opacity per unit gas mass at 250 μm, rκ250, is determined through a pixel-by-pixel correlation of τ250 with AK, yielding a value of approximately 0.09 cm2 g−1, which is about 2–3 times higher than the typical value in the diffuse interstellar medium. Additionally, an independent analysis across 16 subregions within the Ophiuchus cloud indicates spatial variations in dust opacity, with values ranging from 0.07 to 0.12 cm2 g−1. Although the observed trend of increasing dust opacity with higher extinction implies grain growth, our findings indicate that rapid grain growth has clearly not yet occurred in the dark clouds studied in this work.

HESS J1813-178 is one of the brightest and most compact TeV γ-ray sources, and whether its γ-ray emission is associated with supernova remnant (SNR), pulsar wind nebula (PWN), or young stellar cluster (YSC) is still under debate. By analyzing the GeV γ-ray data in the field of HESS J1813-178 using 14 yr of PASS 8 data recorded by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT), we report the discovery of three different sources with different spectra in this region. The hard source with a PL spectral index of 2.11 ± 0.08 has a small size extension, which is spatially and spectrally coincident with the TeV γ-ray emission from HESS J1813-178. CO observations display the dense molecular clouds surrounding HESS J1813-178 in the velocity range of 45–60 km s−1. The possible origins of the γ-ray emission from HESS J1813-178 are discussed, including SNR G12.820.02, the PWN driven by the energetic X-ray pulsar PSR J1813-1749 and YSC Cl 1813-178. However, none of them can be ruled out clearly. Note that the maximum energy of protons in the hadronic model should exceed a few hundred TeV, which makes HESS J1813-178 a promising PeVatron. A detailed LHAASO data analysis about the morphology and spectrum would be helpful to investigate the origin of the γ-ray emission in this region and test its PeVatron nature.

<title>Relativistic Alfvén Turbulence at Kinetic Scales</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In a strongly magnetized, magnetically dominated relativistic plasma, Alfvénic turbulence can extend to scales much smaller than the particle inertial scales. It leads to an energy cascade somewhat analogous to inertial- or kinetic-Alfvén turbulent cascades existing in nonrelativistic space and astrophysical plasmas. Based on phenomenological modeling and particle-in-cell numerical simulations, we propose that the energy spectrum of such relativistic kinetic-scale Alfvénic turbulence is close to k−3 or slightly steeper than that due to intermittency corrections or Landau damping. We note the analogy of this spectrum with the Kraichnan spectrum corresponding to the enstrophy cascade in 2D incompressible fluid turbulence. Such turbulence strongly energizes particles in the direction parallel to the background magnetic field, leading to nearly one-dimensional particle momentum distributions. We find that these distributions have universal log-normal statistics.

<title>Search for GeV Gamma-Ray Emission from Possible TeV-bright Red Dwarfs with Fermi-LAT</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Red dwarfs have been suggested to be among the possible astrophysical species accelerating particles and emitting TeV γ-rays. In an effort to search for the GeV γ-ray counterparts of the suggested TeV emission from eight red dwarfs, we analyze the 0.2–500 GeV γ-ray emission of the regions covering them, exploiting the ∼13.6 yr Pass 8 data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). A GeV γ-ray emission excess with a significance of 3.8σ is detected in the direction of the red dwarf V962 Tau. This emission contains V962 Tau in a 1σ error radius and is independent of the catalog source. However, the stellar flare scenario can hardly explain the total energy and lightcurve (LC) derived from the γ-ray emission in view of the spectral analysis. We also analyze the LCs in the positions of the eight red dwarfs, and no time bin with a significance >5σ is found. Therefore, no significant emission from the red dwarfs could be concluded to have been detected by Fermi-LAT.

<title>Dwarf Pulses of 10 Pulsars Detected by FAST</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
How pulsars radiate is a long-standing problem. Detailed polarization measurements of individual pulses shed light on currently unknown emission processes. Recently, based on supersensitive observations, dwarf pulses have been recognized as weak narrow pulses often appearing during the nulling state. In this study, we report the detection of dwarf pulses from 10 pulsars, PSRs B0525+21, B1237+25, J1538+2345, J1824−0127, J1851−0053, B1901+10, J1939+10, B1944+17, B2000+40, and J2112+4058, based on observations conducted with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope. Dwarf pulses of five pulsars are clearly discernible in the two-dimensional distribution of pulse intensity and pulse width. For the other five pulsars, PSRs J1538+2345, J1824−0127, J1939+10, B2000+40, and J2112+4058, only a few dwarf pulses are detected from pulse stacks. The dwarf pulses can emerge in both cone and core emission components for PSR B1237+25, and the polarization angles of these dwarf pulses are mostly in the orthogonal polarization mode of normal pulses for PSR B1944+17. In general, pulsars with detected dwarf pulses tend to be located within the “death valley” region of the distribution of pulsar periods and period derivatives.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study conducts mineralogical and chemical investigations on the oldest achondrite, Erg Chech 002 (∼4565 million yr old). This meteorite exhibits a disequilibrium igneous texture characterized by high-Mg-number (atomic Mg/(Mg + Fe2+)) orthopyroxene xenocrysts (Mg number = 60–80) embedded in an andesitic groundmass. Our research reveals that these xenocrysts were early formed crystals, loosely accumulated or scattered in the short-period magma ocean on the parent body. Subsequently, these crystals underwent agitation due to the influx of external materials. The assimilation of these materials enriched the 16O component of the magma ocean and induced a relatively reduced state. Furthermore, this process significantly cooled the magma ocean and inhibited the evaporation of alkali elements, leading to elevated concentrations of Na and K within the meteorite. Our findings suggest that the introduced materials are probably sourced from the reservoirs of CR clan meteorites, indicating extensive transport and mixing of materials within the early solar system.

<title>Giant Biconical Dust Filaments in the Starburst Galaxy NGC 1808</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad2eab</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the results from an analysis of multiwavelength archival data on the multiphase outflow in the starburst galaxy NGC 1808. We report the detection at 70 and 100 μm of dust filaments that extend up to ∼13 kpc from the galactic midplane and trace an edge-brightened biconical structure along the minor axis of the galaxy. The inner filaments are roughly cospatial with previously identified optical dust filaments, extraplanar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission, and neutral and ionized gaseous outflows. The 70/160 μm flux ratio, a proxy for the dust temperature, is elevated along the edges of the cones, indicating that the dusty medium has been driven out of the central regions of these cones and is possibly shock-heated by a large-scale outflow. We establish lower limits on the extraplanar dust mass and mean height above the stellar disk of and ∣ z ∣ ∼ 5 kpc. The energy requirement of (5.1–9.6) × 1056 erg needed to lift the dusty material, assuming a Milky Way–like dust-to-gas ratio, can be supplied by the current starburst, with a measured star formation rate of 3.5–5.4 M⊙ yr−1 over a timescale of (4–26) ξ−1 Myr, where ξ is the efficiency of energy transfer. We conclude that a starburst-driven outflow is the most likely mechanism by which the dust features were formed.

<title>Young Star Clusters Dominate the Production of Detached Black Hole–Star Binaries</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad2f2c</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The recent discovery of two detached black hole–star (BH–star) binaries from Gaia’s third data release has sparked interest in understanding the formation mechanisms of these systems. We investigate the formation of these systems by dynamical processes in young star clusters (SCs) and via isolated binary (IB) evolution, using a combination of direct N-body and population synthesis simulations. We find that dynamical formation in SCs is nearly 50 times more efficient per unit of star formation at producing BH–star binaries than IB evolution. We expand this analysis to the full Milky Way (MW) using a FIRE-2 hydrodynamical simulation of an MW-mass galaxy. Even assuming that only 10% of star formation goes into SCs, we find that approximately four out of every five BH–star systems are formed dynamically, and that the MW contains a total of ∼2 × 105 BH–star systems. Many of these dynamically formed systems have longer orbital periods, greater eccentricities, and greater black hole masses than their isolated counterparts. For binaries older than 100 Myr, we show that any detectable system with e ≳ 0.5 or MBH ≳ 10 M⊙ can only be formed through dynamical processes. Our MW model predicts between 64 and 215 such detections from the complete DR4 Gaia catalog, with the majority of systems being dynamically formed in massive and metal-rich SCs. Finally, we compare our populations to the recently discovered Gaia BH1 and Gaia BH2, and conclude that the dynamical scenario is the most favorable formation pathway for both systems.

总结: 
本文研究了下一代地基毫米波波长LIM调查在约束ΛCDM以外的几种模型方面的潜力。研究考虑了CO旋转线的自相关谱和[C ii]精细结构线的测量，在红移范围为0.25< z <12。作者针对约旦-布朗斯-迪克和轴子驱动的早期暗能量模型以及基于宇宙尺度的引力有效描述的三个现象模型进行了深入研究。研究表明，未来十年内可部署的LIM调查具有显著改善所有考虑模型的潜力，提高水平从几倍到一个数量级。 <div>
Line intensity mapping (LIM) can provide a powerful means to constrain the theory of gravity and the nature of dark energy at low and high redshifts by mapping the large-scale structure over many redshift epochs. In this paper, we investigate the potential of the next generation ground-based millimeter-wavelength LIM surveys in constraining several models beyond ΛCDM, involving either a dynamic dark energy component or modifications of the theory of gravity. Limiting ourselves to two-point clustering statistics, we consider the measurements of auto-spectra of several CO rotational lines (from J = 2−1 to J = 6−5) and the [C ii] fine structure line in the redshift range of 0.25 < z < 12. We consider different models beyond ΛCDM, each one with different signatures and peculiarities. Among them, we focus on Jordan–Brans–Dicke and axion-driven early dark energy models as examples of well-studied scalar-tensor theories acting at late and early times, respectively. Additionally, we consider three phenomenological models based on an effective description of gravity at cosmological scales. We show that LIM surveys deployable within a decade (with ∼108 spectrometer hours) have the potential to improve upon the current bounds on all considered models significantly. The level of improvements range from a factor of a few to an order of magnitude.

总结: <br />
本研究报告了第一个银河脉冲超亮X射线源 (PULX) Swift J0243.6+6124 的相位分辨光谱结果，利用由硬X射线调制望远镜 (Insight-HXMT) 收集的数据对其2017年至2018年的突发峰值进行建模。Insight-HXMT的广泛能量覆盖范围使我们能够获得更精确的光谱连续体，以减少广铁线轮廓与其他组件之间的耦合。我们使用三种不同的连续体光谱模型，但得到类似的铁线结果。首次在PULX中检测到广铁线的脉冲特征。该铁线宽度和强度的变化，σ约为1.2-1.5keV，其相位偏移约为脉冲相位的0.25。我们推测内部厚盘不均匀的受加速柱的辐射产生了广铁线的调制变化。此外，非脉冲窄线被认为来自外部盘区域。 <div>
We report the phase-resolved spectral results of the first Galactic pulsating ultraluminous X-ray source (PULX) Swift J0243.6+6124, modeling its 2017–2018 outburst peak using data collected by the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (Insight-HXMT). The broad energy coverage of Insight-HXMT allows us to obtain a more accurate spectral continuum to reduce the coupling of broad iron line profiles with other components. We use three different continuum spectrum models but obtain similar iron line results. For the first time, we detect the pulse characteristics of the broad iron line in a PULX. The variation in the width and intensity of this iron line with σ ∼ 1.2–1.5 keV has a phase offset of about 0.25 from the pulse phase. We suggest that the uneven irradiation of the thick inner disk by the accretion column produces the modulated variation of the broad iron line. In addition, the nonpulsed narrow line is suggested to come from the outer disk region.

<div> CSS galaxies, AGN feedback, UV emission, jet-induced star formation, Hubble Space Telescope

总结:<br /><br />本文首次系统搜索紧凑陡峭谱（CSS）射电星系中来自射电源驱动的活跃星系核（AGN）反馈的紫外线特征。通过对7个强大的CSS星系进行观察，发现其中6个存在延伸的紫外线连续发射，与射电喷流轴向共同存在的紫外线结。这表明射电诱导的恒星形成可能是原因。此外，观察结果与演化综合模型一致，显示出最近约1-8百万年内的星形成活动可能是由当前或较早期的射电发射引发的，或者是由于受到周围密集环境的限制，射电源增长受挫。虽然需要进一步观测来限制观察到的紫外线中的活动相关成分，但检测到的射流诱导恒星形成确认了射流反馈模型的一个重要预测。 <div>
We present the first systematic search for UV signatures from radio source-driven active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback in Compact Steep Spectrum (CSS) radio galaxies. Owing to their characteristic sub-galactic jets (1–20 kpc projected linear sizes), CSS hosts are excellent laboratories for probing galaxy scale feedback via jet-triggered star formation. The sample consists of seven powerful CSS galaxies, and two galaxies host to radio sources >20 kpc as the control, at low to intermediate redshifts (z < 0.6). Our new Hubble Space Telescope images show extended UV continuum emission in six out of seven CSS galaxies, with five CSS hosts exhibiting UV knots cospatial and aligned along the radio-jet axis. Young (≲ 10 Myr), massive (≳ 5 M⊙) stellar populations are likely to be the dominant source of the blue excess emission in radio galaxies at these redshifts. Hence, the radio-aligned UV regions could be attributed to jet-induced starbursts. Lower near-UV star formation rates compared to other indicators suggest low scattered AGN light contribution to the observed UV. Dust attenuation of UV emission appears unlikely from high internal extinction correction estimates in most sources. Comparison with evolutionary synthesis models shows that our observations are consistent with recent (∼1−8 Myr old) star-forming activity likely triggered by current or an earlier episode of radio emission, or by a confined radio source that has frustrated growth, due to a dense environment. While follow-up spectroscopic and polarized light observations are needed to constrain the activity-related components in the observed UV, the detection of jet-induced star formation is a confirmation of an important prediction of the jet feedback paradigm.

Magnetic reconnection is understood to be the main physical process that facilitates the transformation of magnetic energy into heat, motion, and particle acceleration during solar eruptions. Yet, observational constraints on reconnection region properties and dynamics are limited due to a lack of high-cadence and high-spatial-resolution observations. By studying the evolution and morphology of postreconnected field-lines footpoints, or flare ribbons and vector photospheric magnetic field, we estimate the magnetic reconnection flux and its rate of change with time to study the flare reconnection process and dynamics of the current sheet above. We compare high-resolution imaging data to study the evolution of the fine structure in flare ribbons as ribbons spread away from the polarity inversion line. Using data from two illustrative events (one M- and X-class flare), we explore the relationship between the ribbon-front fine structure and the temporal development of bursts in the reconnection region. Additionally, we use the RibbonDB database to perform statistical analysis of 73 (C- to X-class) flares and identify quasiperiodic pulsation (QPP) properties using the Wavelet Transform. Our main finding is the discovery of QPP signatures in the derived magnetic reconnection rates in both example events and the large flare sample. We find that the oscillation periods range from 1 to 4 minutes. Furthermore, we find nearly cotemporal bursts in Hard X-ray (HXR) emission profiles. We discuss how dynamical processes in the current sheet involving plasmoids can explain the nearly cotemporal signatures of quasiperiodicity in the reconnection rates and HXR emission.

The strongly coupled hydrodynamic, magnetic, and radiation properties of the plasma in the solar chromosphere make it a region of the Sun's atmosphere that is poorly understood. We use data obtained with the high-resolution Visible Broadband Imager (VBI) equipped with an Hβ filter and the Visible Spectro-Polarimeter (ViSP) on the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope to investigate the fine-scale structure of the plage chromosphere. To aid in the interpretation of the VBI imaging data, we also analyze spectra from the CHROMospheric Imaging Spectrometer on the Swedish Solar Telescope. The analysis of spectral properties, such as enhanced line widths and line depths, explains the high contrast of the fibrils relative to the background atmosphere demonstrating that Hβ is an excellent diagnostic for the enigmatic fine-scale structure of the chromosphere. A correlation between the parameters of the Hβ line indicates that opacity broadening created by overdense fibrils could be the main reason for the spectral line broadening frequently observed in chromospheric fine-scale structures. Spectropolarimetric inversions of the ViSP data in the Ca ii 8542 Å and Fe i 6301/6302 Å lines are used to construct semiempirical models of the plage atmosphere. Inversion outputs indicate the existence of dense fibrils in the Ca ii 8542 Å line. The analyses of the ViSP data show that the morphological characteristics, such as orientation, inclination, and length of fibrils, are defined by the topology of the magnetic field in the photosphere. Chromospheric maps reveal a prominent magnetic canopy in the area where fibrils are directed toward the observer.

Much of the information gleaned from observations of star-forming regions comes from the analysis of their molecular emission spectra, particularly in the radio regime. The time-consuming nature of fitting synthetic spectra to observations interactively for such line-rich sources, however, often results in such analysis being limited to data extracted from a single-dish observation or a handful of pixels from an interferometric observation. Yet, star-forming regions display a wide variety of physical conditions that are difficult, if not impossible, to accurately characterize with such a limited number of spectra. We have developed an automated fitting routine that visits every pixel in the field of view of an Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) data cube and determines the best-fit physical parameters, including excitation temperature and column densities, for a given list of molecules. In this proof-of-concept work, we provide an overview of the fitting routine and apply it to 0.″26, 1.1 km s−1 resolution ALMA observations of two sites of massive star formation in NGC 6334I. Parameters were found for 21 distinct molecules by generating synthetic spectra across 7.48 GHz of spectral bandwidth between 280 and 351 GHz. Spatial images of the derived parameters for each of the >8000 pixels are presented with special attention paid to the C2H4O2 isomers and their relative variations. We highlight the greater scientific utility of the column density and velocity images of individual molecules compared to traditional moment maps of single transitions.

We describe a novel method for modeling the global, steady solar wind using photospheric magnetic fields as a driving boundary condition. Prior wind models in this class include both rapid heuristic methods that use potential field extrapolation and variants thereof, trading rigor for computation speed, and detailed 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models that attempt to simulate the entire solar corona with a degree of physical rigor, but require large amounts of computation. The Field Line Universal relaXer, an open-source numerical code that implements the “fluxon” semi-Lagrangian approach to MHD modeling, provides an intermediate approach between these two general classes. In particular, the fluxon approach to MHD describes the magnetic field through discrete analogs of magnetic field lines, relaxing these structures to a stationary state of force balance. In this work we introduce a 1D solar wind solution along each field line, providing an ensemble of solutions that are interpolated back onto a uniform grid at an outer boundary surface. This provides advantages in physical rigor over heuristic semianalytic techniques, and in computational efficiency over full 3D MHD techniques. Here we describe the underlying methodology and the FLUXPipe modeling pipeline process.

在本研究中，我们研究了标量场膨胀模型与高斯-邦内特项耦合形成原始黑洞的机制。通过耦合函数增强了曲率扰动，导致原始黑洞的形成并产生了可探测的次级引力波。我们确定了三组不同的势函数参数，形式为ϕ的1/3次方、ϕ的2/5次方和ϕ的2/3次方。通过调整模型参数，在超缓慢滚动阶段减速充气，并增强了曲率扰动。我们的计算预测了与LIGO-Virgo观测数据相符合的质量为10^30kg的原始黑洞的形成。此外，我们还发现质量分别约为10^19kg和10^21kg的原始黑洞，可以解释OGLE数据中的超短时间微引力透镜事件。此外，我们提出的机制可能导致在10^15kg和10^16kg的质量尺度上形成原始黑洞，贡献了宇宙中大约99%的暗物质。我们还研究了我们模型中次级引力波的产生。在所有模型情况下，次级引力波的密度参数都呈现出与引力波探测器灵敏度曲线相交的尖峰，为验证我们的发现提供了一种手段。我们的数值结果展示了次级引力波频谱随频率的幂律行为，具体为f的3/2次方。此外，在红外区域，即f << fc时，幂指数采用对数依赖形式，特别是f的2/3次方。

In this study, we investigate the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) in a scalar field inflationary model coupled to the Gauss–Bonnet term with fractional power-law potentials. The coupling function enhances the curvature perturbations, then results in the generation of PBHs and detectable secondary gravitational waves (GWs). We identify three separate sets of parameters for the potential functions of the form ϕ1/3, ϕ2/5, and ϕ2/3. By adjusting the model parameters, we decelerate the inflaton during the ultra-slow-roll phase and enhance curvature perturbations. Our calculations predict the formation of PBHs with masses of , which are compatible with LIGO-Virgo observational data. Additionally, we find PBHs with masses around and , which can explain ultra-short-timescale microlensing events in OGLE data. Furthermore, our proposed mechanism could lead to the formation of PBHs in mass scales around and , contributing to approximately 99% of the dark matter in the Universe. We also study the production of secondary GWs in our model. In all cases of the model, the density parameter of secondary GWs exhibits peaks that intersect the sensitivity curves of GW detectors, providing a means to verify our findings using data of these detectors. Our numerical results demonstrate a power-law behavior for the spectra of with respect to frequency, given by . Additionally, in the infrared regime where f ≪ fc, the power index takes a log-dependent form, specifically .

<div> 关键词: 准周期性喷发，X射线，超大质量黑洞，EMRI，射电观测<br />
总结: <br />
研究报告了eRO-QPE1的长期光变趋势，以及QPE的消失和重新出现，伴随着变暗和降温。研究还观察到射电观测的非检测，以及QPE定时残差的可能调制。结果暂时支持EMRI-盘碰撞模型推动QPE，并且证明了QPE的时序调制可以联合约束超大质量黑洞自旋和盘密度分布。 <br /> <div>
Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are luminous X-ray outbursts recurring on hour timescales, observed from the nuclei of a growing handful of nearby low-mass galaxies. Their physical origin is still debated, and usually modeled as (a) accretion disk instabilities or (b) interaction of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) with a lower mass companion in an extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI). EMRI models can be tested with several predictions related to the short- and long-term behavior of QPEs. In this study, we report on the ongoing 3.5 yr NICER and XMM-Newton monitoring campaign of eRO-QPE1, which is known to exhibit erratic QPEs that have been challenging for the simplest EMRI models to explain. We report (1) complex, non-monotonic evolution in the long-term trends of QPE energy output and inferred emitting area; (2) the disappearance of the QPEs (within NICER detectability) in 2023 October, and then the reappearance by 2024 January at a luminosity of ∼100× fainter (and temperature of ∼3× cooler) than the initial discovery; (3) radio non-detections with MeerKAT and Very Large Array observations partly contemporaneous with our NICER campaign (though not during outbursts); and (4) the presence of a possible ∼6 day modulation of the QPE timing residuals, which aligns with the expected nodal precession timescale of the underlying accretion disk. Our results tentatively support EMRI–disk collision models powering the QPEs, and we demonstrate that the timing modulation of QPEs may be used to jointly constrain the SMBH spin and disk density profile.

Thanks to the precise astrometric measurements of proper motions by the Gaia mission, a new tidal stellar stream has been discovered in the northern hemisphere. The distribution of star count shows that the stream is approximately 80° long and 1.°70 wide. Observations of 21 member stars, including 14 RR Lyrae stars, indicate that the stream has an eccentric and retrograde orbit with e = 0.58. The low metallicity, high total energy, and large angular momentum suggest that it is associated with the merging event Sequoia. This discovery suggests the possibility of finding more substructures with high eccentricity orbits, even in the inner halo.

<title>A Relook at the Black Hole Binary Candidate J1328+2752 with VLBI</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present multiband follow-up observations of the supermassive binary black hole (BBH) candidate and misaligned double–double radio galaxy, J1328+2752. To investigate its parsec-scale structure, we have carried out observations with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) and the European Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) Network. Additionally, we have obtained optical spectroscopic observations with the 3.6 m Devasthal Optical Telescope. Within 3.5 yr of our previous VLBI observations, the central parsec-scale radio structure of J1328+2752 has changed from a double component to a single central component and its flux density has increased by a factor of 3 in the 5 GHz VLBA observations. The new radio component is largely unresolved at 3, 5, and 8 GHz. The multifrequency radio data shows a convex-shaped spectrum for this unresolved component. The turnover frequency is at ∼3 GHz. While the total intensity image does not reveal any details, a super-resolved VLBA 5 and 8 GHz spectral index image does indicate the presence of two components at a separation of ∼4.2 pc with spectral indices −0.5 ± 0.3 and −0.9 ± 0.3. We have not observed a simultaneous change in the optical line profiles or intensities over the past few years. The radio structure, the variation of the flux density, and spectral shape can potentially be consistent both with the signature of a young radio source or a BBH at the center of J1328+2752.

<title>The Role of a Neutron Component in the Photospheric Emission of Long-duration Gamma-Ray Burst Jets</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs), thought to be produced during core-collapse supernovae, may have a prominent neutron component in the outflow material. If present, neutrons can change how photons scatter in the outflow by reducing its opacity, thereby allowing the photons to decouple sooner than if there were no neutrons present. Understanding the details of this process could therefore allow us to probe the central engine of LGRBs, which is otherwise hidden. Here, we present results of the photospheric emission from an LGRB jet, using a combination of relativistic hydrodynamic simulations and radiative transfer postprocessing using Monte Carlo radiation transfer code. We control the size of the neutron component in the jet material by varying the equilibrium electron fraction Ye, and we find that the presence of neutrons in the GRB fireball affects the Band parameters α and E0, while the picture with the β parameter is less clear. In particular, the break energy E0 is shifted to higher energies. Additionally, we find that increasing the size of the neutron component also increases the total radiated energy of the outflow across multiple viewing angles. Our results not only shed light on LGRBs but are also relevant to short-duration gamma-ray bursts associated with binary neutron star mergers due to the likelihood of a prominent neutron component in such systems.

<title>COMAP Early Science. VIII. A Joint Stacking Analysis with eBOSS Quasars</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a new upper limit on the cosmic molecular gas density at z = 2.4–3.4 obtained using the first year of observations from the CO Mapping Array Project (COMAP). COMAP data cubes are stacked on the 3D positions of 243 quasars selected from the Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) catalog, yielding a 95% upper limit for flux from CO(1–0) line emission of 0.129 Jy km s−1. Depending on the balance of the emission between the quasar host and its environment, this value can be interpreted as an average CO line luminosity of eBOSS quasars of ≤1.26 × 1011 K km pc2 s−1, or an average molecular gas density in regions of the Universe containing a quasar of ≤1.52 × 108M⊙ cMpc−3. The upper limit falls among CO line luminosities obtained from individually targeted quasars in the COMAP redshift range, and the value is comparable to upper limits obtained from other line intensity mapping (LIM) surveys and their joint analyses. Further, we forecast the values obtainable with the COMAP/eBOSS stack after the full 5 yr COMAP Pathfinder survey. We predict that a detection is probable with this method, depending on the CO properties of the quasar sample. Based on the achieved sensitivity, we believe that this technique of stacking LIM data on the positions of traditional galaxy or quasar catalogs is extremely promising, both as a technique for investigating large galaxy catalogs efficiently at high redshift and as a technique for bolstering the sensitivity of LIM experiments, even with a fraction of their total expected survey data.

<title>Double Power-law Formation by Sequential Particle Acceleration</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Spectral double power laws are common in solar high-energy phenomena such as flares and interplanetary energetic-electron events. However, the physical mechanism that produces the changes in power-law index within a single spectrum is unclear. We developed a fully analytical method of forming single power-law spectra from sequential acceleration of particles orbiting inside and hopping between simulated large-scale magnetic islands formed by flare reconnection. Here, we extend the analytical method to the formation of double power-law spectra by assuming sequential acceleration in two successive regions with different acceleration and particle-transport rates. The resulting spectral distribution is continuous and smooth, with a flattening at low energies, two power-law regions at mid-energies, and a steep rollover at high energies. The model provides analytical expressions for the spectral indices, all energy breaks, and normalization constants as functions of just three physical parameters of each acceleration region: (1) the energy gain in each accelerator, (2) the percentage of particles transferred between accelerators, and (3) the number of accelerators visited. One of the most salient predictions of our work is that the spectral index at high (low) energies is determined by the parameters of the first “seed” (second) acceleration region. By constructing the spectral distribution through an iterative analytical process, the evolution toward a double power law is easily characterized and explained. Our analytical model provides tools to interpret space- and ground-based observations from RHESSI, FOXSI, NuSTAR, Solar Orbiter/STIX, EOVSA, and future high-energy missions.

<title>Tropical Cyclones on Tidally Locked Rocky Planets: Dependence on Rotation Period</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad2ea5</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Tropical cyclones occur over the Earth’s tropical oceans, with characteristic genesis regions and tracks tied to the warm ocean surface that provide energy to sustain these storms. The study of tropical cyclogenesis and evolution on Earth has led to the development of environmental favorability metrics that predict the strength of potential storms from the local background climate state. Simulations of the gamut of transiting terrestrial exoplanets orbiting late-type stars may offer a test of this Earth-based understanding of tropical cyclogenesis. Previous work has demonstrated that tropical cyclones are likely to form on tidally locked terrestrial exoplanets with intermediate rotation periods of ∼8–10 days. In this study, we test these expectations using ExoCAM simulations with both a sufficient horizontal resolution of 0.°47 × 0.°63 required to permit tropical cyclogenesis along with a thermodynamically active slab ocean. We conduct simulations of tidally locked and ocean-covered Earth-sized planets orbiting late-type M dwarf stars with varying rotation periods from 4–16 days in order to cross the predicted maximum in tropical cyclogenesis. We track tropical cyclones that form in each simulation and assess their location of maximum wind, evolution, and maximum wind speeds. We compare the resulting tropical cyclone locations and strengths to predictions based on environmental favorability metrics, finding good agreement between Earth-based metrics and our simulated storms with a local maximum in both tropical cyclone frequency and intensity at a rotation period of 8 days. Our results suggest that environmental favorability metrics used for tropical cyclones on Earth may also be applicable to temperate tidally locked Earth-sized rocky exoplanets with abundant surface liquid water.

<title>Sensitivity of Cosmological Parameter Estimation to Nonlinear Prescription from Cosmic Shear</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Several ongoing and upcoming large-scale structure surveys aim to explore the nonlinear regime of structure formation with high precision. Making reliable cosmological inferences from these observations necessitates precise theoretical modeling of the mildly nonlinear regime. In this work we explore how the choice of nonlinear prescription would impact parameter estimation from cosmic shear measurements for a Euclid-like survey. Specifically, we employ two different nonlinear prescriptions of halofit and the Effective Field Theory of the Large Scale Structure and compare their measurements for the three different cosmological scenarios of ΛCDM, wCDM, and (w0, wa) CDM. We also investigate the impact of different nonlinear cutoff schemes on parameter estimation. We find that the predicted errors on most parameters shrink considerably as smaller scales are included in the analysis, with the amount depending on the nonlinear prescription and the cutoff scheme used. We use predictions from the halofit model to analyze the mock data from DarkSky N-body simulations and quantify the parameter bias introduced in the measurements due to the choice of nonlinear prescription. We observe that σ8 and ns have the largest measurement bias induced by inaccuracies of the halofit model.

<title>A Study of the Merging Dwarf Galaxy VCC322</title>

Galaxy interactions and mergers can enhance or reduce star formation, but a complete understanding of the involved processes is still lacking. The effect of dwarf galaxy mergers is even less clear than their massive counterpart. We present a study on a dwarf merger remnant in the Virgo cluster, VCC322, which might form a triple system with VCC334 and VCC319. We identify a prominent long and straight tail-like substructure that has a size comparable to its host galaxy VCC322. By comparing the color–color (g − r versus r − H) distribution with simple stellar population models, we infer that the metallicity and stellar age of this tail are Z⋆ ∼ 0.02 Z⊙ and t⋆ ∼ 10 Gyr, respectively. In VCC319, we find a sign of isophotal twisting. This suggests that VCC319 may be subject to tidal interaction. An analysis of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey optical spectra of VCC322 indicates mass- and light-weighted ages of about 109.8 yr and 107.5 yr, respectively, indicating an ongoing star formation activity. However, the star formation in VCC322 seems suppressed when compared to other star-forming dwarfs of comparable stellar masses. Our finding of shock excitation of optical emission lines indicates that interaction-induced shock may contribute to the heating of cold gas and suppression of star formation.

<title>Generalized Coronal Loop Scaling Laws and Their Implication for Turbulence in Solar Active Region Loops</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad3031</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad3031</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Recent coronal loop modeling has emphasized the importance of combining both Coulomb collisions and turbulent scattering to characterize field-aligned thermal conduction, which invokes a hybrid loop model. In this work, we generalize the hybrid model by incorporating a nonuniform heating and cross section that are both formulated by a power-law function of temperature. Based on the hybrid model solutions, we construct scaling laws that relate loop-top temperature (Ta) and heating rate (Ha) to other loop parameters. It is found that the loop-top properties for turbulent loops are additionally power-law functions of the turbulent mean free path (λT), with the functional forms varying from situation to situation, depending on the specification of the heating and/or areal parameters. More importantly, both a sufficiently footpoint-concentrated heating and a cross-sectional expansion with height can effectively weaken (strengthen) the negative (positive) power-law dependence of Ta (Ha) on λT. The reason lies in a notable reduction of heat flux by footpoint heating and/or cross-sectional expansion in the turbulence-dominated coronal part, where turbulent scattering introduces a much weaker dependence of the conduction coefficient on temperature. In this region, therefore, the reduction of the heat flux predominately relies on a backward flattening of the temperature gradient. Through numerical modeling that incorporates more realistic conditions, this scenario is further consolidated. Our results have important implications for solar active region (AR) loops. With the factors of nonuniform heating and cross section taken into account, AR loops can bear relatively stronger turbulence while still keeping a physically reasonable temperature for nonflaring loops.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In a previous study, Huang et al. used the Alfvén Wave Solar atmosphere Model, one of the widely used solar wind models in the community, driven by ADAPT-GONG magnetograms to simulate the solar wind in the last solar cycle and found that the optimal Poynting flux parameter can be estimated from either the open field area or the average unsigned radial component of the magnetic field in the open field regions. It was also found that the average energy deposition rate (Poynting flux) in the open field regions is approximately constant. In the current study, we expand the previous work by using GONG magnetograms to simulate the solar wind for the same Carrington rotations and determine if the results are similar to the ones obtained with ADAPT-GONG magnetograms. Our results indicate that similar correlations can be obtained from the GONG maps. Moreover, we report that ADAPT-GONG magnetograms can consistently provide better comparisons with 1 au solar wind observations than GONG magnetograms, based on the best simulations selected by the minimum of the average curve distance for the solar wind speed and density.

<br />SN 2022joj 是一颗附近的特殊Ia型超新星，其快速衰减率(Δm15，B = 1.4 mag)。初期表现为极端红色，随后出现蓝移的光谱特性，最终逐渐趋向典型SNe Ia。根据观测结果，SN 2022joj与白矮星质量约1 M⊙和0.01至0.05 M⊙之间的薄He壳层的双重爆炸模型有较强的一致性。此外，该超新星的星云光谱与预期的双重爆炸模型有所偏差，产生了强烈的[Fe iii]发射。然而，随着He壳层变薄，这些超新星开始变得更像典型的SNe Ia，这引发了触发大多数SNe Ia的可能机制，并且强调了观测超新星的早期重要性。 <br /><br />总结:  SN 2022joj 是一颗特殊的Ia型超新星，其具有快速衰减率和异常的红色光谱特性。观测结果与双重爆炸模型相吻合，但星云光谱与预期有所偏差，这可能暗示了触发大多数SNe Ia的机制并强调了早期观测的重要性。 <div>
We present photometric and spectroscopic data for SN 2022joj, a nearby peculiar Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) with a fast decline rate (Δm15,B = 1.4 mag). SN 2022joj shows exceedingly red colors, with a value of approximately B − V ≈ 1.1 mag during its initial stages, beginning from 11 days before maximum brightness. As it evolves, the flux shifts toward the blue end of the spectrum, approaching B − V ≈ 0 mag around maximum light. Furthermore, at maximum light and beyond, the photometry is consistent with that of typical SNe Ia. This unusual behavior extends to its spectral characteristics, which initially displayed a red spectrum and later evolved to exhibit greater consistency with typical SNe Ia. Spectroscopically, we find strong agreement between SN 2022joj and double detonation models with white dwarf masses of around 1 M⊙ and a thin He shell between 0.01 and 0.05 M⊙. Moreover, the early red colors are explained by line-blanketing absorption from iron peak elements created by the double detonation scenario in similar mass ranges. The nebular spectra in SN 2022joj deviate from expectations for double detonation, as we observe strong [Fe iii] emission instead of [Ca ii] lines as anticipated, though this is not as robust a prediction as early red colors and spectra. The fact that as He shells get thinner these SNe start to look more like normal SNe Ia raises the possibility that this is the triggering mechanism for the majority of SNe Ia, though evidence would be missed if the SNe are not observed early enough.

The ever-growing sample of observed supernovae (SNe) enhances our capacity for comprehensive SN population studies, providing a richer data set for understanding the diverse characteristics of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and possibly those of their progenitors. Here, we present a data-driven analysis of observed SN Ia photometric light curves collected in the Open Supernova Catalog. Where available, we add the environmental information from the host galaxy. We focus on identifying subclasses of SNe Ia without imposing the predefined subclasses found in the literature to date. To do so, we employ an implicit rank-minimizing autoencoder neural network for developing low-dimensional data representations, providing a compact representation of the SN light-curve diversity. When we analyze light curves alone, we find that one of our resulting latent variables is strongly correlated with redshift, allowing us to approximately “de-redshift” the other latent variables describing each event. After doing so, we find that three of our latent variables account for ∼95% of the variance in our sample, and provide a natural separation between 91T and 91bg thermonuclear SNe. Of note, the 02cx subclass is not unambiguously delineated from the 91bg sample in our results, nor do either the overluminous 91T or the underluminous 91bg/02cx samples form a clearly distinct population from the broader sample of “other” SN Ia events. We identify the physical characteristics of SN light curves that best distinguish SNe 91T from SNe 91bg and 02cx, and discuss prospects for future refinements and applications to other classes of SNe as well as other transients.

<div> GW detections, galaxy redshift surveys, CHIMERA, cosmological parameters, GW population parameters
<br /><br />总结:
本研究探讨了引力波和星系调查之间的协同作用，以共同限制宇宙学和引力波种群参数。研究引入了CHIMERA，这是一种新颖的引力波宇宙学代码，结合了紧凑双子融合体的种群特性和星系目录的信息。研究发现，在LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O4和O5观测运行的代表性情景中，利用光谱或光度红移测量的星系目录，可以实现对H0的百分之一级测量。此外，文章还强调了未来获得光谱星系目录的重要性，以最大化引力波宇宙学的科学收益。 <div>
With the growing number of gravitational wave (GW) detections and the advent of large galaxy redshift surveys, a new era in cosmology is emerging. This study explores the synergies between GWs and galaxy surveys to jointly constrain cosmological and GW population parameters. We introduce CHIMERA, a novel code for GW cosmology combining information from the population properties of compact binary mergers and galaxy catalogs. We study constraints for scenarios representative of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O4 and O5 observing runs, assuming to have a complete catalog of potential host galaxies with either spectroscopic or photometric redshift measurements. We find that a percent-level measurement of H0 could be achieved with the best 100 binary black holes (BBHs) in O5 using a spectroscopic galaxy catalog. In this case, the intrinsic correlation that exists between H0 and the BBH population mass scales is broken. Instead, by using a photometric catalog the accuracy is degraded up to a factor of ∼9, leaving a significant correlation between H0 and the mass scales that must be carefully modeled to avoid bias. Interestingly, we find that using spectroscopic redshift measurements in the O4 configuration yields a better constraint on H0 compared to the O5 configuration with photometric measurements. In view of the wealth of GW data that will be available in the future, we argue the importance of obtaining spectroscopic galaxy catalogs to maximize the scientific return of GW cosmology.

<div> PDS 70, massive planets, protoplanetary disk, CO isotopologue, gas structure

PDS 70是一个拥有两颗质量巨大的行星的原行星盘，其倾斜的盘面结构为直接探测行星盘垂直气体结构提供了独特的机会。采用高空间分辨率观测了一系列CO同位素线和HCO+J = 4−3，从盘面气体结构(由12CO描绘)到接近盘面(由含量较少的同位素和HCO+描绘)绘制了完整的二维（r，z）盘面结构。在PDS 70盘面上，12CO追踪高度z/r约为0.3，13CO位于z/r约为0.1，C18O起源于盘面或附近。HCO+的表面出现在z/r约为0.2，是为数不多的在盘上得到高保真度约束的非CO发射表面之一。在12CO J = 3−2线中，我们解析了一个在空洞壁上高度的垂直下降和急剧上升，使得PDS 70成为第一个直接在发射线高度上看到这种效应的过渡盘。在外盘中，PDS 70的CO发射高度似乎对其恒星质量和盘尺寸来说是典型的，并且并不受到两个内部嵌入的行星的实质性改变。通过结合CO同位素和HCO+线，我们得出了二维气体温度结构，并估算出一个约为56-85天文单位的盘面CO雪线。这意味着PDS 70b和70c都位于CO雪线内部，并且很可能正在吸积具有高C/O比约为1.0的气体，这为未来从JWST（詹姆斯·韦伯太空望远镜）等方面测量行星大气和正确地建模它们的形成历史提供了背景。 <br /><br />总结: PDS 70拥有两颗质量巨大的行星而且其盘面结构倾斜，通过CO同位素和HCO+线观测得出了该行星盘的二维气体温度结构，估算出了盘面CO雪线的位置，在盘中心拥有高C/O比的气体，这为未来行星大气测量和形成历史建模提供了重要背景。 <div>
PDS 70 hosts two massive, still-accreting planets and the inclined orientation of its protoplanetary disk presents a unique opportunity to directly probe the vertical gas structure of a planet-hosting disk. Here, we use high-spatial-resolution (≈0.″1; 10 au) observations in a set of CO isotopologue lines and HCO+J = 4−3 to map the full 2D (r, z) disk structure from the disk atmosphere, as traced by 12CO, to closer to the midplane, as probed by less abundant isotopologues and HCO+. In the PDS 70 disk, 12CO traces a height of z/r ≈ 0.3, 13CO is found at z/r ≈ 0.1, and C18O originates at, or near, the midplane. The HCO+ surface arises from z/r ≈ 0.2 and is one of the few non-CO emission surfaces constrained with high-fidelity in disks to date. In the 12CO J = 3−2 line, we resolve a vertical dip and steep rise in height at the cavity wall, making PDS 70 the first transition disk where this effect is directly seen in line-emitting heights. In the outer disk, the CO emission heights of PDS 70 appear typical for its stellar mass and disk size and are not substantially altered by the two inner embedded planets. By combining CO isotopologue and HCO+ lines, we derive the 2D gas temperature structure and estimate a midplane CO snowline of ≈ 56–85 au. This implies that both PDS 70b and 70c are located interior to the CO snowline and are likely accreting gas with a high C/O ratio of ≈ 1.0, which provides context for future planetary atmospheric measurements from, e.g., JWST, and for properly modeling their formation histories.

MAXI J1820+070在2018年爆发期间进行了多波段光谱分析，利用AstroSat远紫外、软X射线和硬X射线数据，以及Las Cumbres Observatory和NICER的（准）同时光学和X射线数据。在软态中，研究发现软X射线和UV/光学存在过量成分，而硬态中光学/UV也有显著过量成分，表明外圆盘中存在更强的重新辐射。通过具体的光谱拟合，确定了BH自旋参数以及盘的密度和内盘结构。硬态中还观察到了两个成分的冕，并分析了它们所产生的反射特征。<br /><br />总结: <div>
We present a comprehensive multiwavelength spectral analysis of the black hole (BH) X-ray binary MAXI J1820+070 during its 2018 outburst, utilizing AstroSat far-UV, soft X-ray, and hard X-ray data, along with (quasi-)simultaneous optical and X-ray data from the Las Cumbres Observatory and NICER, respectively. In the soft state, we detect soft X-ray and UV/optical excess components over and above the intrinsic accretion disk emission (kTin ∼ 0.58 keV) and a steep X-ray power-law component. The soft X-ray excess is consistent with a high-temperature blackbody (kT ∼ 0.79 keV), while the UV/optical excess is described by UV emission lines and two low-temperature blackbody components (kT ∼ 3.87 and ∼0.75 eV). Employing continuum spectral fitting, we determine the BH spin parameter (a = 0.77 ± 0.21), using the jet inclination angle of 64° ± 5° and a mass spanning 5–10 M☉. In the hard state (HS), we observe a significantly enhanced optical/UV excess component, indicating a stronger reprocessed emission in the outer disk. Broadband X-ray spectroscopy in the HS reveals a two-component corona, each associated with its reflection component, in addition to the disk emission (kTin ∼ 0.19 keV). The softer coronal component dominates the bolometric X-ray luminosity and produces broader relativistic reflection features, while the harder component gets reflected far from the inner disk, yielding narrow reflection features. Furthermore, our analysis in the HS suggests a substantial truncation of the inner disk (≳51 gravitational radii) and a high disk density (∼1020 cm−3).

<div> quiescent galaxies, JWST, size, stellar mass, redshift
总结:
本研究利用James Webb太空望远镜(NIRCam)对z ≥ 3的静止星系的光学形态进行了系统研究。通过UVJ颜色或NUVUVJ颜色选择样本，重点关注了26个zphot介于2.8和4.6之间的静止星系，利用NIRCam图像拟合Sérsic模型约束它们的大小。我们发现观测波长与大小之间呈负相关，并通过多波段的大小测量推导了它们在0.5微米处的大小。在z ≥ 3时期，我们的静止星系表现出了在0.5微米处的大小与恒星质量之间显著的相关性。我们的分析结果显示，相较于较低红移时期，我们的大小-恒星质量关系较低，当M⋆ = 5 × 1010M⊙时振幅约为0.6千秒差距。样本主要包括具有类似球状结构的星系，其平均Sérsic指数和轴比分别约为n ∼ 3-4和q ∼ 0.6-0.8。另一方面，我们观察到低Sérsic指数星系的比例随着红移的增加而增加，这表明3 < z < 5可能是形态转变开始的时期，出现了一定比例的非常明显的扁盘状已停止形成星系。 <div>
We present the results of a systematic study of the rest-frame optical morphology of quiescent galaxies at z ≥ 3 using the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Based on a sample selected by UVJ color or NUVUVJ color, we focus on 26 quiescent galaxies with at 2.8 < zphot < 4.6 with publicly available JWST data. Their sizes are constrained by fitting the Sérsic profile to all available NIRCam images. We see a negative correlation between the observed wavelength and the size and derive their size at the rest frame 0.5 μm using size measurements in multiple bands. Our quiescent galaxies show a significant correlation between the rest-frame 0.5 μm size and the stellar mass at z ≥ 3. The analytical fit for them at implies that our size–stellar mass relations are below those at lower redshifts, with the amplitude of ∼0.6 kpc at M⋆ = 5 × 1010M⊙. This value agrees with the extrapolation of the size evolution of quiescent galaxies at z < 3 in the literature, implying that the size of quiescent galaxies increases monotonically from z ∼ 3–5. Our sample mainly comprises galaxies with bulge-like structures according to their median Sérsic index and axis ratio of n ∼ 3–4 and q ∼ 0.6–0.8, respectively. On the other hand, there is a trend of increasing fraction of galaxies with low Sérsic index at higher redshift, suggesting 3 < z < 5 might be the epoch of onset of morphological transformation with a fraction of very notable disky quenched galaxies.

这篇文章介绍了Parker Solar Probe和Solar Orbiter的发射，以及它们在太阳风研究中的作用。通过使用数据驱动的磁流体力学模拟，评估了两种模型在模拟地球、SolO和Parker位置的太阳风特性的准确度。研究发现，两种模型在Parker位置的表现相当好，但在SolO和地球位置的表现不佳。最后，文章还追踪了SolO位置的场线，发现了与Hinode/EIS观测结果相符的活跃区出流迹象。总的来说，该研究结果显示AFT和ADAPT模型在各种位置的表现相似，并且与纯粹的WSA模型相当。 
<br />总结: Parker Solar Probe和Solar Orbiter的数据被用于进行太阳风模拟研究，结果显示AFT和ADAPT模型在不同位置的太阳风特性模拟效果相似，但在SolO和地球位置需要改进。另外，研究追踪了SolO位置的场线，发现了活跃区出流迹象。 <div>
The launches of Parker Solar Probe (Parker) and Solar Orbiter (SolO) are enabling a new era of solar wind studies that track the solar wind from its origin at the photosphere, through the corona, to multiple vantage points in the inner heliosphere. A key ingredient for these models is the input photospheric magnetic field map that provides the boundary condition for the coronal portion of many heliospheric models. In this paper, we perform steady-state, data-driven magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the solar wind during Carrington rotation 2258 with the Grid GAMERA model. We use the ADAPT and AFT flux transport models and quantitatively assess how well each model matches in situ measurements from Parker, SolO, and Earth. We find that both models reproduce the magnetic field components at Parker quantitatively well. At SolO and Earth, the magnetic field is reproduced relatively well, though not as well as at Parker, and the density is reproduced extremely poorly. The velocity is overpredicted at Parker, but not at SolO or Earth, hinting that the Wang–Sheeley–Arge (WSA) relation, fine-tuned for Earth, misses the deceleration of the solar wind near the Sun. We conclude that AFT performs quantitatively similarly to ADAPT in all cases, and that both models are comparable to a purely WSA heliospheric treatment with no MHD component. Finally, we trace field lines from SolO back to an active region outflow that was observed by Hinode/EIS, and which shows evidence of elevated charge state ratios.

<div> HLXs, extragalactic, X-ray sources, intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs), Hubble Space Telescope imaging
<br /><br />总结:
研究团队系统性地建立了HLX候选样本，利用哈勃太空望远镜的成像资料进行了首次统一的HLX恒星核群体研究，得出至少88%的HLX可能是来自外部星系的具有大质量黑洞的情况。50%的样本通过HST成像揭示了将HLX与宿主星系连接起来的特征，强烈表明这些情况并非背景/前景的污染可能性。根据活跃星系核的质量比例关系，估计29%的污染率后，我们的样本中多达60%可能与IMBH相关。与已知的HLX类似，X射线亮度相对于其恒星核质量系统性升高，可能是因为合并驱动的吸积率增强。最小质量的恒星核更可能出现在更大的核偏移处，并更可能在宿主星系的晕中漂泊。HLX的星系占据率约为10^-2，并且与质量呈强烈的反比关系。多达12%的HLX候选情况可能与球状星团内形成或异常亮X射线双星情况一致。 <div>
Hyper-luminous X-ray sources (HLXs) are extragalactic off-nuclear X-ray sources with luminosities exceeding the theoretical limit for accretion onto stellar-mass compact objects. Many HLXs may represent intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) deposited in galaxy halos through mergers, and the properties of the stellar cores surrounding HLXs provide powerful constraints on this scenario. Therefore, we have systematically built the largest sample of HLX candidates with archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging (24) for the first uniform population study of HLX stellar cores down to low masses. Based on their host galaxy redshifts, at least 21 (88%) have stellar core masses ≥ 107M⊙ and hence are consistent with accretion onto massive black holes from external galaxies. In 50% of the sample, the HST imaging reveals features connecting the HLXs with their host galaxies, strongly suggesting against the background/foreground contaminant possibility in these cases. Assuming a mass scaling relation for active galactic nuclei and accounting for an estimated contamination fraction of 29%, up to ∼60% of our sample may be associated with IMBHs. Similar to previously known HLXs, the X-ray luminosities are systematically elevated relative to their stellar core masses, possibly from merger-driven accretion rate enhancements. The least massive stellar cores are preferentially found at larger nuclear offsets and are more likely to remain wandering in their host galaxy halos. The HLX galaxy occupation fraction is ∼ 10−2 and has a strong inverse mass dependence. Up to three of the HLX candidates (12%) are potentially consistent with formation within globular clusters or with exceptionally luminous X-ray binaries.

总结: 
KSP-OT-201712a是一颗特殊的矮新星，表现出在停滞期间的爆发现象，具有罕见的双峰Hα发射线和弱He I发射线。该系统的次星温度高达4570K，表明它开始质量传递时约为主序星寿命的93%。由此推测该系统随着质量传递的进化将发生巨大的质量转移。最终，在氢包层耗尽之前，将演化成为氦新星或AM CVn系统，甚至在演化的终点会爆发成为Ia型超新星。  <br /><br /> <div>
We present the discovery of a peculiar dwarf nova KSP-OT-201712a using high-cadence, multicolor observations made with the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network. KSP-OT-201712a exhibits a rare presence of outbursts during standstills, as well as strong Hα emission for a dwarf nova below the period minimum with an orbital period of 58.75 ± 0.02 minutes. The outburst cycles are ∼6.6 days within standstills but increase to ∼15 days outside of them. Both B − V and V − I colors become bluer and redder as the outburst luminosities increase and decrease, respectively, for the outburst within standstill, while they evolve in the opposite directions outside of the standstills. The presence of strong double-peaked Hα and weak He i emission lines with He/H flux ratio of 0.27, together with absorption lines of Mg b and Na D in the source, leads to the estimation Teff ≃ 4570 ± 40 K, [Fe/H] ≃ 0.06 ± 0.15 dex, and log g ≃ 4.5 ± 0.1 for its secondary. KSP-OT-201712a is the second He-deficient dwarf nova below the period minimum, while the temperature of the secondary is measured for the first time in such objects. We identify it to be an ER UMa-type dwarf nova, suggesting that the evolution of dwarf novae across the period minimum is accompanied by large mass transfers. The high temperature of the secondary indicates that the system started its mass transfer when the secondary was about 93% of its main-sequence age. The system will evolve to a helium cataclysmic variable or to AM CVn once its hydrogen envelope is exhausted before it explodes as a Type Ia supernova.

The growth of supermassive black holes is strongly linked to their galaxies. It has been shown that the population mean black hole accretion rate ( ) primarily correlates with the galaxy stellar mass (M⋆) and redshift for the general galaxy population. This work aims to provide the best measurements of as a function of M⋆ and redshift over ranges of 109.5 < M⋆ < 1012M⊙ and z < 4. We compile an unprecedentedly large sample with 8000 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and 1.3 million normal galaxies from nine high-quality survey fields following a wedding cake design. We further develop a semiparametric Bayesian method that can reasonably estimate and the corresponding uncertainties, even for sparsely populated regions in the parameter space. is constrained by X-ray surveys sampling the AGN accretion power and UV-to-infrared multiwavelength surveys sampling the galaxy population. Our results can independently predict the X-ray luminosity function (XLF) from the galaxy stellar mass function (SMF), and the prediction is consistent with the observed XLF. We also try adding external constraints from the observed SMF and XLF. We further measure for star-forming and quiescent galaxies and show that star-forming is generally larger than or at least comparable to the quiescent .

Diatomic molecules phosphorus monoxide (PO) and phosphorus mononitride (PN) are the main reservoirs of gas-phase phosphorus in interstellar and circumstellar environments, indicating the possibility of forming new phosphorus-bearing molecules through reactions with other interstellar species. To explore the astrochemistry of PO and PN, new simple phosphorus-bearing molecules [O, C, N, P] and [2O, C, N, P] were generated in the gas phase and isolated in cryogenic matrices for characterization with matrix-isolation IR and UV/vis spectroscopy in combination with calculations at the CCSD(T)-F12a/VTZ-F12 level of theory. In an inert argon matrix, OPCN isomerizes to OPNC upon UV-light irradiation at 365 nm, followed by successive isomerizations to PNCO and POCN with concomitant dissociation to diatomic PN and CO under further irradiation at 193 nm. By analogy, the isomerization of O2PCN to O2PNC and OPNCO followed by fragmentation to OPN/CO and PN/CO2 occurs in the matrix upon irradiation at 193 nm. In a chemically active CO ice, the photolytic reaction of OPCN with CO yields CO2 and PCN, and O2PCN reacts with CO by forming OPCN and CO2, in which the photochemical networks for these P-bearing species linking the astrochemically important PN and PO have been proposed. The experimental identification of these phosphorus-bearing molecules is supported by quantum chemical calculations, and the spectroscopic data may aid in their detection in the interstellar and circumstellar medium.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present optical photometry and spectroscopy of the Type IIn supernova (SN) 2021qqp. Its unusual light curve is marked by a long precursor for ≈300 days, a rapid increase in brightness for ≈60 days, and then a sharp increase of ≈1.6 mag in only a few days to a first peak of Mr ≈ −19.5 mag. The light curve then declines rapidly until it rebrightens to a second distinct peak of Mr ≈ −17.3 mag centered at ≈335 days after the first peak. The spectra are dominated by Balmer lines with a complex morphology, including a narrow component with a width of ≈1300 km s−1 (first peak) and ≈2500 km s−1 (second peak) that we associate with the circumstellar medium (CSM) and a P Cygni component with an absorption velocity of ≈8500 km s−1 (first peak) and ≈5600 km s−1 (second peak) that we associate with the SN–CSM interaction shell. Using the luminosity and velocity evolution, we construct a flexible analytical model, finding two significant mass-loss episodes with peak mass loss rates of ≈10 and ≈5 M⊙ yr−1 about 0.8 and 2 yr before explosion, respectively, with a total CSM mass of ≈2–4 M⊙. We show that the most recent mass-loss episode could explain the precursor for the year preceding the explosion. The SN ejecta mass is constrained to be ≈5–30 M⊙ for an explosion energy of ≈(3–10) × 1051 erg. We discuss eruptive massive stars (luminous blue variable, pulsational pair instability) and an extreme stellar merger with a compact object as possible progenitor channels.

<title>Contribution of γ-Ray Burst Afterglow Emissions to the Isotropic Diffuse γ-Ray Background</title>

The isotropic diffuse γ-ray background (IGRB) serves as a fundamental probe of the evolution of the extreme Universe. Although various astrophysical sources have been proposed as potential contributors to the IGRB, the dominant population is still under debate. γ-ray bursts (GRBs) are among candidate contributors of IGRB, although they are not as frequently discussed as blazars or starburst galaxies. Recent observations of TeV emission from GRB afterglows have provided fresh insights into this subject. This work aims to investigate the potential contribution of GRB afterglows to the IGRB under the standard afterglow model. We carefully examine the influence of each microphysical parameter of the afterglow model on this contribution, with a particular emphasis on the significant role played by the initial kinematic energy. To determine the energy and quantify the contribution of GRB afterglow to IGRBs, we utilize the observed GRB afterglow energy emissions from the Swift X-ray Telescope and Fermi Large Area Telescope instruments. Our calculations, considering the synchrotron self-Compton emission, suggest that GRB afterglows make up less than 10% of the IGRBs. To enhance the precision of our findings, it is crucial to further constrain these parameters by conducting additional ground-based observations of GRB afterglows.

<title>Suprathermal Electron Transport in the Solar Wind: Effects of Coulomb Collisions and Whistler Turbulence</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The nature and radial evolution of solar wind electrons in the suprathermal energy range are studied. A wave–particle interaction tensor and a Fokker–Planck Coulomb collision operator are introduced into the kinetic transport equation describing electron collisions and resonant interactions with whistler waves. The diffusion tensor includes diagonal and off-diagonal terms, and the Coulomb collision operator applies to arbitrary electron velocities describing collisions with both background protons and electrons. The background proton and electron densities and temperatures are based on previous turbulence models that mediate the supersonic solar wind. The electron velocity distribution functions and electron heat flux are calculated. Comparison and analysis of the numerical results with analytical solutions and observations in the near-Sun region are made. The numerical results reproduce well the creation of the sunward electron deficit observed in the near-Sun region. The deficit of the electron velocity distribution function below the core Maxwellian fit at low velocities results from Coulomb collisions, and the excess part above the core Maxwellian fit at high velocities is determined by strong wave–particle interactions.

<title>An Unusual Pulse Shape Change Event in PSR J1713+0747 Observed with the Green Bank Telescope and CHIME</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The millisecond pulsar J1713+0747 underwent a sudden and significant pulse shape change between 2021 April 16 and 17 (MJDs 59320 and 59321). Subsequently, the pulse shape gradually recovered over the course of several months. We report the results of continued multifrequency radio observations of the pulsar made using the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment and the 100 m Green Bank Telescope in a 3 yr period encompassing the shape change event, between 2020 February and 2023 February. As of 2023 February, the pulse shape had returned to a state similar to that seen before the event, but with measurable changes remaining. The amplitude of the shape change and the accompanying time-of-arrival residuals display a strong nonmonotonic dependence on radio frequency, demonstrating that the event is neither a glitch (the effects of which should be independent of radio frequency, ν) nor a change in dispersion measure alone (which would produce a delay proportional to ν−2). However, it does bear some resemblance to the two previous “chromatic timing events” observed in J1713+0747, as well as to a similar event observed in PSR J1643−1224 in 2015.

We examine the central stellar velocity dispersion of subhalos based on IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. The central velocity dispersion is a fundamental observable that links galaxies with their dark matter subhalos. We carefully explore simulated stellar velocity dispersions derived with different definitions to assess possible systematics. We explore the impact of variation in the identification of member stellar particles, the viewing axes, the velocity dispersion computation technique, and simulation resolution. None of these issues impact the velocity dispersion significantly; any systematic uncertainties are smaller than the random error. We examine the stellar mass–velocity dispersion relation as an observational test of the simulations. At fixed stellar mass, the observed velocity dispersions significantly exceed the simulation results. This discrepancy is an interesting benchmark for the IllustrisTNG simulations because the simulations are not explicitly tuned to match this relation. We demonstrate that the stellar velocity dispersion provides measures of the dark matter velocity dispersion and the dark matter subhalo mass.

<title>A Measurement of the Assembly of Milky Way Analogs at Redshifts 0.5 < z < 2 with Resolved Stellar Mass and Star Formation Rate Profiles</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The resolved mass assembly of Milky Way–mass galaxies has been previously studied in simulations, the local Universe, and at higher redshifts using infrared (IR) light profiles. To better characterize the mass assembly of Milky Way analogs (MWAs), as well as their changes in star formation rate (SFR) and color gradients, we construct resolved stellar mass and SFR maps of MWA progenitors selected with abundance matching techniques up to z ∼2 using deep, multiwavelength imaging data from the Hubble Frontier Fields. Our results using stellar mass profiles agree well with previous studies that utilize IR light profiles, showing that the inner 2 kpc of the galaxies and the regions beyond 2 kpc exhibit similar rates of stellar mass growth. This indicates the progenitors of MWAs from z ∼ 2 to the present do not preferentially grow their bulges or their disks. The evolution of the SFR profiles indicates a greater decrease in SFR density in the inner regions versus the outer regions. Sérsic parameters indicate modest growth in the central regions at lower redshifts, perhaps indicating slight bulge growth. However, the Sérsic index does not rise above n ∼ 2 until z < 0.5, meaning these galaxies are still disk-dominated systems. We find that the half-mass radii of the MWA progenitors increase between 1.5 < z < 2, but remain constant at later epochs (z < 1.5). This implies mild bulge growth since z ∼ 2 in MWA progenitors, in line with previous MWA mass assembly studies.

We present the results of a spectral analysis using simultaneous multifrequency (22, 43, 86, and 129 GHz) very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations of the Korean VLBI Network on BL Lac object, Markarian 421. The data we used were obtained from 2013 January to 2018 June. The light curves showed several flux enhancements with global decreases. To separate the variable and quiescent components in the multifrequency light curves for milliarcsecond-scale emission regions, we assumed that the quiescent radiation comes from the emission regions radiating constant optically thin synchrotron emissions (i.e., a minimum flux density with an optically thin spectral index). The quiescent spectrum determined from the multifrequency light curves was subtracted from the total CLEAN flux density, yielding a variable component in the flux that produces the time-dependent spectrum. We found that the observed spectra were flat at 22–43 GHz, and relatively steep at 43–86 GHz, whereas the quiescent-corrected spectra are sometimes quite different from the observed spectra (e.g., sometimes inverted at 22–43 GHz). The quiescent-corrected spectral indices were much more variable than the observed spectral indices. This spectral investigation implies that the quiescent-spectrum correction can significantly affect the multifrequency spectral index of variable compact radio sources such as blazars. Therefore, the synchrotron self-absorption B-field strength (BSSA) can be significantly affected because BSSA is proportional to the fifth power of turnover frequency.

<title>Impact of Overlapping Signals on Parameterized Post-Newtonian Coefficients in Tests of Gravity</title>

Gravitational waves have been instrumental in providing deep insights into the nature of gravity. Next-generation detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope, are predicted to have a higher detection rate given the increased sensitivity and lower cutoff frequency. However, this increased sensitivity raises challenges concerning parameter estimation due to the foreseeable overlap of signals from multiple sources. Overlapping signals (OSs), if not properly identified, may introduce biases in estimating post-Newtonian (PN) coefficients in parameterized tests of general relativity (GR). We investigate how OSs affect −1PN to 2PN terms in parameterized GR tests, examining their potential to falsely suggest GR deviations. We estimate the prevalence of such misleading signals in next-generation detectors, and their collective influence on GR tests. We compare the effects of OSs on coefficients at different PN orders, concluding that overall the 1PN coefficient suffers the most. Our findings also reveal that while a nonnegligible portion of OSs exhibit biases in PN coefficients that might individually prefer to conclude deviations from GR, collectively, the direction to deviate is random and a statistical combination will still be in favor of GR.

<title>Global Impact of Emerging Internetwork Fields on the Low Solar Atmosphere</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Small-scale, newly emerging internetwork (IN) magnetic fields are considered a viable source of energy and mass for the solar chromosphere and possibly the corona. Multiple studies show that single events of flux emergence can indeed locally heat the low solar atmosphere through interactions of the upward propagating magnetic loops and the preexisting ambient field lines. However, the global impact of the newly emerging IN fields on the solar atmosphere is still unknown. In this paper, we study the spatiotemporal evolution of IN bipolar flux features and analyze their impact on the energetics and dynamics of the quiet-Sun atmosphere. We use high-resolution, multiwavelength, coordinated observations obtained with the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph, Hinode, and the Solar Dynamics Observatory to identify emerging IN magnetic fields and follow their evolution. Our observational results suggest that only the largest IN bipoles are capable of heating locally the low solar atmosphere, while the global contribution of these bipoles appears to be marginal. However, the total number of bipoles detected and their impact estimated in this work is limited by the sensitivity level, spatial resolution, and duration of our observations. To detect smaller and weaker IN fields that would maintain the basal flux, and examine their contribution to the chromospheric heating, we will need higher resolution, higher sensitivity, and longer time series obtained with current and next-generation ground- and space-based telescopes.

<title>Episodic Energy Release during the Main and Post-impulsive Phases of a Solar Flare</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
When and where the magnetic field energy is released and converted in eruptive solar flares remains an outstanding topic in solar physics. To shed light on this question, here we report multiwavelength observations of a C9.4-class eruptive limb flare that occurred on 2017 August 20. The flare, accompanied by a magnetic flux rope eruption and a white light coronal mass ejection, features three post-impulsive X-ray and microwave bursts immediately following its main impulsive phase. For each burst, both microwave and X-ray imaging suggest that the nonthermal electrons are located in the above-the-loop-top region. Interestingly, contrary to many other flares, the peak flux of the three post-impulsive microwave and X-ray bursts shows an increase for later bursts. Spectral analysis reveals that the sources have a hardening spectral index, suggesting a more efficient electron acceleration into the later post-impulsive bursts. We observe a positive correlation between the acceleration of the magnetic flux rope and the nonthermal energy release during the post-impulsive bursts in the same event. Intriguingly, different from some other eruptive events, this correlation does not hold for the main impulse phase of this event, which we interpret as energy release due to the tether-cutting reconnection before the primary flux rope acceleration occurs. In addition, using footpoint brightenings at conjugate flare ribbons, a weakening reconnection guide field is inferred, which may also contribute to the hardening of the nonthermal electrons during the post-impulsive phase.

We analyze variability in 15-season optical lightcurves from the doubly imaged lensed quasar SDSS J165043.44+425149.3 (SDSS1650), comprising five seasons of monitoring data from the Maidanak Observatory (277 nights in total, including the two seasons of data previously presented in Vuissoz et al.), five seasons of overlapping data from the Mercator telescope (269 nights), and 12 seasons of monitoring data from the US Naval Observatory, Flagstaff Station at lower cadence (80 nights). We update the 2007 time-delay measurement for SDSS1650 with these new data, finding a time delay of days, with image A leading image B. We analyze the microlensing variability in these lightcurves using a Bayesian Monte Carlo technique to yield measurements of the size of the accretion disk at λrest = 2420 Å, finding a half-light radius of log(r1/2/cm) = assuming a 60° inclination angle. This result is unchanged if we model 30% flux contamination from the broad-line region. We use the width of the Mg ii line in the existing Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectra to estimate the mass of this system’s supermassive black hole, finding MBH = 2.47 × 109M⊙. We confirm that the accretion disk size in this system, whose black hole mass is on the very high end of the MBH scale, is fully consistent with the existing quasar accretion disk size–black hole mass relation.

We present Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (Fermi-GBM) and Swift Burst Alert Telescope (Swift-BAT) searches for gamma-ray/X-ray counterparts to gravitational-wave (GW) candidate events identified during the third observing run of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. Using Fermi-GBM onboard triggers and subthreshold gamma-ray burst (GRB) candidates found in the Fermi-GBM ground analyses, the Targeted Search and the Untargeted Search, we investigate whether there are any coincident GRBs associated with the GWs. We also search the Swift-BAT rate data around the GW times to determine whether a GRB counterpart is present. No counterparts are found. Using both the Fermi-GBM Targeted Search and the Swift-BAT search, we calculate flux upper limits and present joint upper limits on the gamma-ray luminosity of each GW. Given these limits, we constrain theoretical models for the emission of gamma rays from binary black hole mergers.

总结:<br /><br /> 近几十年来，通过Hubble Space Telescope（HST）进行的快照项目，针对超新星（SNe）和超新星冒名者进行了研究。这些研究旨在通过两种滤镜获得晚期光度，揭示能量残留的来源，包括放射性衰变、SN冲击波与周围星际物质的相互作用，还是光回声的存在。此外，这些结果也为之前HST周期中其他调查者的快照项目提供了补充和延伸。 <div>
Over recent decades, robotic (or highly automated) searches for supernovae (SNe) have discovered several thousand events, many of them in quite nearby galaxies (distances < 30 Mpc). Most of these SNe, including some of the best-studied events to date, were found before maximum brightness and have associated with them extensive follow-up photometry and spectroscopy. Some of these discoveries are so-called “SN impostors,” thought to be superoutbursts of luminous blue variable stars, although possibly a new, weak class of massive-star explosions. We conducted a Snapshot program with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and obtained images of the sites of 31 SNe and four impostors, to acquire late-time photometry through two filters. The primary aim of this project was to reveal the origin of any lingering energy for each event, whether it is the result of radioactive decay or, in some cases, ongoing late-time interaction of the SN shock with preexisting circumstellar matter, or the presence of a light echo. Alternatively, lingering faint light at the SN position may arise from an underlying stellar population (e.g., a host star cluster, companion star, or a chance alignment). The results from this study complement and extend those from Snapshot programs by various investigators in previous HST cycles.

<div> 候选天体BH1, 失败超新星, 星体融合, 红外观测, 理论模糊

总结:
候选天体N6946-BH1（BH1）是一个可能的失败超新星候选天体，被认为是一种异常事件，在这种事件中，一颗大质量恒星消失时没有预期的明亮超新星爆炸，而是伴随着坍缩形成黑洞。文章报告了BH1的最新观测结果，发现先前所有的观测其实是至少三个不同天体的混合。在近红外波段，BH1比前体源暗淡，但与2017年时的状态相似。而在中红外波段，流量似乎比最佳前体模型的估计流量要亮。总体来看，该天体的总光度为前体源的13%至25%。此外，红外观测结果与聚环香烃特征相一致，这种特征是在尘埃被近紫外辐射照射时产生的。目前，BH1的解释仍不确定。观测结果符合恒星融合的预期，但失败超新星假设中的理论模糊使得很难排除其他可能性。 <div>
N6946-BH1 (BH1) is the first plausible candidate for a failed supernova (SN), a peculiar event in which a massive star disappears without the expected bright SN, accompanied by collapse into a black hole (BH). Following a luminous outburst in 2009, the source experienced a significant decline in optical brightness, while maintaining a persistent IR presence. While it was proposed to be a potential failed SN, such behavior has been observed in SN impostor events in nearby galaxies. Here, we present late-time observations of BH1, taken 14 yr after disappearance, using JWST’s NIRCam and MIRI instruments to probe a never before observed region of the object’s spectral energy distribution (SED). We show for the first time that all previous observations of BH1 (pre- and postdisappearance) are actually a blend of at least three sources. In the near-infrared, BH1 is notably fainter than the progenitor but retains similar brightness to its state in 2017. In the mid-infrared the flux appears to have brightened compared to the inferred fluxes from the best-fitting progenitor model. The total luminosity of the source is between 13% and 25% that of the progenitor. We also show that the IR SED appears consistent with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon features that arise when dust is illuminated by near-ultraviolet radiation. At present, the interpretation of BH1 remains uncertain. The observations match expectations for a stellar merger, but theoretical ambiguity in the failed SN hypothesis makes it hard to dismiss.

One-dimensional stellar evolution calculations produce uncertain predictions for quantities like the age, core mass, core compactness, and nucleosynthetic yields; a key source of uncertainty is the modeling of interfaces between regions that are convectively stable and those that are not. Theoretical and numerical work has demonstrated that there should be numerous processes adjacent to the convective boundary that induce chemical and angular momentum transport, as well as modify the thermal structure of the star. One such process is called convective penetration, wherein vigorous convection extends beyond the nominal convective boundary and alters both the composition and thermal structure. In this work, we incorporate the process of convective penetration in stellar evolution calculations using the stellar evolution software instrument mesa. We implement convective penetration according to the description presented by Anders et al. to to calculate a grid of models from the pre-main sequence to helium core depletion. The extent of the convective penetration zone is self-consistently calculated at each time step without introducing new free parameters. We find both a substantial penetration zone in all models with a convective core and observable differences to global stellar properties such as the luminosity and radius. We present how the predicted radial extent of the penetration zone scales with the total stellar mass, age, and metallicity of the star. We discuss our results in the context of existing numerical and observational studies.

本研究提出，伽马射线暴的X射线余辉中的平台和急剧衰减可能产生于一个Blandford–Znajek喷流，此喷流可能是一个具有准周期振荡特征的旋转喷流。这种光变曲线不太可能由一个短寿命的超大质量磁星引起，因此更可能是由Kerr黑洞作为中心引擎。伽马射线暴050904的X射线余辉表现出了九个耀斑，特征是由一个具有准周期振荡特征的平台和急剧衰减，这可以通过旋转BZ喷流模型很好地重新现。因此，一个区分这两种引擎的潜在线索在于是否在整个平台和随后的急剧衰减期间存在准周期振荡的特征，因为磁星情景暗示着在平台结束时的坍缩。<br /><br />总结: 本研究提出X射线余辉可能源自旋转BZ喷流，而不是磁星，而通过对伽马射线暴050904的分析支持了这一观点。 <div>
A stellar-mass black hole (BH) or a millisecond magnetar is believed to be born as the central engine of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The presence of plateaus in the X-ray extended emission or afterglow of GRBs is widely accepted as an indicator of a magnetar central engine, particularly those with a sharp decay (faster than t−3), the so-called internal plateau. However, an alternative model, by taking the evolution of the magnetic flux at the BH horizon into account, suggests that an internal plateau can also arise from a jet powered by the Blandford–Znajek (BZ) mechanism (hereafter, a BZ jet). In this study, we propose that a precessional BZ jet would manifest a quasiperiodic oscillation (QPO) signature on the internal plateau and the subsequent sharp decay. Such lightcurves cannot be readily explained by the activity of a short-lived, supermassive magnetar, thus favoring a Kerr BH as the central engine. The X-ray afterglow of GRB 050904, comprising nine flares, is characterized by a QPO-modulated plateau and sharp decay, which can be well reproduced by a precessional BZ jet model. Therefore, one potential clue for distinguishing between these two engines lies in whether the QPO signature is present throughout the entire plateau and the subsequent sharp decay, as the magnetar scenario suggests a collapse at the end of the plateau.

We present JWST MIRI Medium Resolution Spectrograph (MRS) observations of the β Pictoris system. We detect an infrared excess from the central unresolved point source from 5 to 7.5 μm which is indicative of dust within the inner ∼7 au of the system. We perform point-spread function (PSF) subtraction on the MRS data cubes and detect a spatially resolved dust population emitting at 5 μm. This spatially resolved hot dust population is best explained if the dust grains are in the small grain limit (2πa ≪ λ). The combination of unresolved and resolved dust at 5 μm could suggest that dust grains are being produced in the inner few astronomical units of the system and are then radiatively driven outwards, where the particles could accrete onto the known planets in the system, β Pictoris b and c. We also report the detection of an emission line at 6.986 μm that we attribute to [Ar ii]. We find that the [Ar ii] emission is spatially resolved with JWST and appears to be aligned with the dust disk. Through PSF-subtraction techniques, we detect β Pictoris b at the 5σ level in our MRS data cubes and present the first mid-infrared spectrum of the planet from 5 to 7 μm. The planet’s spectrum is consistent with having absorption from water vapor between 5 and 6.5 μm. We perform atmosphere model grid fitting of the spectra and photometry of β Pictoris b and find that the planet’s atmosphere likely has a substellar C/O ratio.

该研究对PG 1302−102类星体进行了密集的多波段监测，利用Swift和Las Cumbres Observatory 网络望远镜。通过对该类星体进行持续9个月的观测，展现出不同波长之间相互关联的中等到显著水平的变化。研究测量了波段之间的时间延迟，结果表明存在与标准盘反射预期一致的τ∝ λ4/3关系，并展示了利用这种新颖角度研究超大质量黑洞双星的可行性。尽管源物理特性类似于其他通过探测技术映射的活动星系核，但并未发现支持该类星体包含超大质量黑洞双星的普遍假设的证据。这表明该研究为LSST深度钻探领域提供了新的可能性。 <br /><br />总结: <div>
We present an intensive multiwavelength monitoring campaign of the quasar PG 1302−102 with Swift and the Las Cumbres Observatory network telescopes. At z ∼ 0.3, it tests the limits of the reverberation mapping (RM) technique in probing the accretion disk around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) and extends the parameter space to high masses and high accretion rates. This is also the first time the RM technique has been applied to test disk structures predicted in the SMBH binary model that has been suggested for this source. PG 1302−102 was observed at a ∼daily cadence for ∼9 months in 14 bands spanning from X-ray to UV and optical wavelengths, and it shows moderate to significant levels of variability correlated between wavelengths. We measure the interband time lags, which are consistent with a τ ∝ λ4/3 relation as expected from standard disk reprocessing, albeit with large uncertainties. The disk size implied by the lag spectrum is consistent with the expected disk size for its black hole mass within uncertainties. While the source resembles other reverberation-mapped active galactic nuclei in many respects, and we do not find evidence supporting the prevalent hypothesis that it hosts an SMBH binary, we demonstrate the feasibility of studying SMBH binaries from this novel angle and suggest possibilities for the LSST Deep Drilling Fields.

As the closest major galaxy merger and home to thousands of super star clusters (SSCs), the Antennae Galaxies (NGC 4038 and NGC 4039) are an important location to study the molecular clouds at sites of vigorous star formation. We cataloged giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in the region where the two galaxies overlap using high-resolution (∼0.″1–10 pc) Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of the 12CO(2−1) and 13CO(2−1) emission lines. Of the 72 individual GMCs identified in the overlap region, 17 are within uncertainties of having the necessary mass, pressure, and size needed to form SSCs. Of those 17 GMCs, only one has significant ionizing radiation, indicating that the birth environments are likely still intact in the 16 other GMCs. We compared the physical properties calculated from 12CO(2−1) GMC data with observations of 10 other galaxies obtained using the same emission line and similar resolution. Compared to other sources in this sample, the GMCs from the Antennae, as well as in other starbursts and in the centers of galaxies, have the highest luminosities, surface densities, and turbulent pressures. The GMCs in starbursts and at the centers of galaxies also have large line widths, although the line widths in the Antennae are among the widest. These comparative results also indicate that the Antennae GMCs have the highest virial parameters despite their high densities.

总结:
在这篇文章中，研究人员发现，原行星盘受到中央恒星的辐射控制，导致了所谓的辐照不稳定性。他们的研究表明，这种不稳定性会使盘形成一种阶梯状的形态，具有明亮的环和黑暗的间隙。这种状态可以通过RADMC-3D代码验证为热平衡。这一发现对行星盘的演化和行星形成有重要的影响，而之前关于辐射盘保持光滑状态的研究存在错误。这项研究的结果可能需要更复杂的辐射动力学模拟来进一步验证。<br /><br /> <div>
Much of a protoplanetary disk is thermally controlled by irradiation from the central star. Such a disk, long thought to have a smoothly flaring shape, is unstable due to the so-called irradiation instability. But what is the outcome of such an instability? In particular, is it possible that such a disk settles into a shape that is immune to the instability? We combine Athena++ with a simplified thermal treatment to show that passively heated disks settle into a staircase shape. Here, the disk is punctuated by bright rings and dark gaps, with the bright rings intercepting the lion’s share of stellar illumination, and the dark gaps are hidden in their shadows. The optical surface of such a disk (the height at which starlight is absorbed) resembles a staircase. Although our simulations do not have realistic radiative transfer, we use the RADMC-3D code to show that this steady state is in good thermal equilibrium. It is possible that realistic disks reach such a state via ways not captured by our simulations. In contrast to our results here, two previous studies have claimed that irradiated disks stay smooth. We show here that they err on different issues. The staircase state, if confirmed by more sophisticated radiative hydrodynamic simulations, has a range of implications for disk evolution and planet formation.

总结: 
本研究在银河系中心超大质量黑洞周围约0.4 pc的范围内进行了光变性的观测，首次估计了年轻恒星的固有双星分数。实验中发现了三颗双星，通过详细的光变模拟和实验敏感度的分析，估算出银河系中心年轻恒星双星分数至少为71%（68%的置信度）或者42%（95%的置信度）。这一结果与太阳附近年轻恒星群体的表现一致，然而，与之前的研究相比，本研究得出的双星分数显著更高。因此，支持了双星分数在径向上存在依赖性的动力学预测。这一研究也提示了银河系中心的年轻恒星双星分数与其它地区存在差异。 <br /><br /> <div>
We present the first estimate of the intrinsic binary fraction of young stars across the central ≈0.4 pc surrounding the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the Milky Way Galactic center (GC). This experiment searched for photometric variability in 102 spectroscopically confirmed young stars, using 119 nights of 10″ wide adaptive optics imaging observations taken at W. M. Keck Observatory over 16 yr in the -[2.1 μm] and H-[1.6 μm] bands. We photometrically detected three binary stars, all of which are situated more than 1″ (0.04 pc) from the SMBH and one of which, S2-36, is newly reported here with spectroscopic confirmation. All are contact binaries or have photometric variability originating from stellar irradiation. To convert the observed binary fraction into an estimate of the underlying binary fraction, we determined the experimental sensitivity through detailed light-curve simulations, incorporating photometric effects of eclipses, irradiation, and tidal distortion in binaries. The simulations assumed a population of young binaries, with stellar ages (4 Myr) and masses matched to the most probable values measured for the GC young star population, and underlying binary system parameters (periods, mass ratios, and eccentricities) similar to those of local massive stars. As might be expected, our experimental sensitivity decreases for eclipses narrower in phase. The detections and simulations imply that the young, massive stars in the GC have a stellar binary fraction ≥71% (68% confidence), or ≥42% (95% confidence). This inferred GC young star binary fraction is consistent with that typically seen in young stellar populations in the solar neighborhood. Furthermore, our measured binary fraction is significantly higher than that recently reported by Chu et al. based on radial velocity measurements for stars ≲1″ of the SMBH. Constrained with these two studies, the probability that the same underlying young star binary fraction extends across the entire region is <1.4%. This tension provides support for a radial dependence of the binary star fraction, and therefore, for the dynamical predictions of binary merger and evaporation events close to the SMBH.

This study explores the behavior of machine-learning-based flare forecasting models deployed in a simulated operational environment. Using Georgia State University’s Space Weather Analytics for Solar Flares benchmark data set, we examine the impacts of training methodology and the solar cycle on decision tree, support vector machine, and multilayer perceptron performance. We implement our classifiers using three temporal training windows: stationary, rolling, and expanding. The stationary window trains models using a single set of data available before the first forecasting instance, which remains constant throughout the solar cycle. The rolling window trains models using data from a constant time interval before the forecasting instance, which moves with the solar cycle. Finally, the expanding window trains models using all available data before the forecasting instance. For each window, a number of input features (1, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 120) and temporal sizes (5, 8, 11, 14, 17, and 20 months) were tested. To our surprise, we found that, for a window of 20 months, skill scores were comparable regardless of the window type, feature count, and classifier selected. Furthermore, reducing the size of this window only marginally decreased stationary and rolling window performance. This implies that, given enough data, a stationary window can be chosen over other window types, eliminating the need for model retraining. Finally, a moderately strong positive correlation was found to exist between a model’s false-positive rate and the solar X-ray background flux. This suggests that the solar cycle phase has a considerable influence on forecasting.

The propagation of meridional circulation below the base of the convection zone (CZ) of low-mass stars may play a crucial role in the transport of angular momentum and also significantly contribute to the transport of chemical species and magnetic fields within their stable radiative zone (RZ). We systematically study these large-scale mean flows by performing three-dimensional global numerical simulations in a spherical shell that consists of a convective region overlying a stably stratified region. We find that the meridional flows can penetrate distances as large as ∼0.21ro (where ro is the outer radius) below the base of the CZ, provided that the Eddington–Sweet timescale tES is much shorter than the viscous timescale tν, as measured by the parameter . In the solar-like regime, where σ ≲ 1 in the upper RZ, we find that the angular momentum transport in the deep RZ is determined primarily by the action of the Coriolis force on meridional flows. In contrast, in models run in the σ > 1 regime, the meridional flows become weaker and the viscous effects dominate. We find that the penetration lengthscale δMC of these mean flows when σ ≲ 1 is proportional to σ−0.22. Our findings may provide a better understanding of the role of the meridional flows in the dynamics of the solar interior and inform future numerical studies that are focused on capturing solar-like dynamics self-consistently.

<title>Measuring Galaxy Abundance and Clustering at High Redshift from Incomplete Spectroscopic Data: Tests on Mock Catalogs</title>

The number density and correlation function of galaxies are two key quantities to characterize the distribution of the observed galaxy population. High-z spectroscopic surveys, which usually involve complex target selection and are incomplete in redshift sampling, present both opportunities and challenges to measure these quantities reliably in the high-z Universe. Using realistic mock catalogs, we show that target selection and redshift incompleteness can lead to significantly biased results, especially due to the flux-limit selection criteria. We develop a new method to correct the flux-limit effect, using information provided by the parent photometric data from which the spectroscopic sample is constructed. Our tests using realistic mock samples show that the method is able to reproduce the true stellar mass function and correlation function reliably. Mock catalogs are constructed for the existing zCOSMOS and VIPERS surveys, as well as for the forthcoming Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) galaxy evolution survey. The same set of mock samples are used to quantify the total variance expected for different sample sizes. We find that the total variance decreases very slowly when the survey area reaches about 4 deg2 for the abundance and about 8 deg2 for the clustering, indicating that the cosmic variance is no longer the dominant source of error for PFS-like surveys. We also quantify the improvements expected in the PFS-like galaxy survey relative to zCOSMOS and VIPERS surveys.

<title>Under Einstein’s Microscope: Measuring Properties of Individual Rotating Massive Stars from Extragalactic Microcaustic Crossings</title>

Highly magnified stars residing in caustic crossing lensed galaxies at z ≃ 0.7–1.5 in galaxy cluster lensing fields inevitably exhibit recurrent brightening events as they traverse a microcaustic network cast down by foreground intracluster stars. The detectable ones belong to nature’s most massive and luminous class of stars, with evolved blue supergiants being the brightest ones at optical wavelengths. Considering single stars in this work, we study to what extent intrinsic stellar parameters are measurable from multifilter light curves, which can be obtained with optical/near-IR space telescopes during one or multiple caustic crossing events. We adopt a realistic model for the axisymmetric surface brightness profiles of rotating O/B stars and develop a numerical lensing code that treats finite source size effects. With a single microcaustic crossing, the ratio of the surface rotation velocity to the breakup value is measurable to a precision of ∼0.1–0.2 for feasible observation parameters with current space telescopes, with all unknown intrinsic and extrinsic parameters marginalized over and without a degeneracy with inclination. Equatorial radius and bolometric luminosity can be measured to 1/3 and 2/3 of the fractional uncertainty in the microcaustic strength, for which the value is not known at each crossing but an informative prior can be obtained from theory. Parameter inference precision may be further improved if multiple caustic crossing events for the same lensed star are jointly analyzed. Our results imply new opportunities to survey individual massive stars in star formation sites at z ≃ 0.7–1.5 or beyond.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Until now, how the magnetic fields in M/X-class flaring active regions (ARs) differ from C-class flaring ARs remains unclear. Here, we calculate the key magnetic field parameters within the area of high photospheric free energy density (HED region) for 323 ARs (217 C- and 106 M/X-flaring ARs), including total photospheric free magnetic energy density Efree, total unsigned magnetic flux ΦHED, mean unsigned current helicity hc, length of the polarity inversion lines LPIL with a steep horizontal magnetic gradient, etc., and compare these with flare/coronal mass ejection (CME) properties. We first show the quantitative relations among the flare intensity, the eruptive character, and ΦHED. We reveal that ΦHED is a measure for the GOES flux upper limit of the flares in a given region. For a given ΦHED, there exists the lower limit of FSXR for eruptive flares. This means that only the relatively strong flares with the large fraction of energy release compared to the total free energy are likely to generate a CME. We also find that the combinations of Efree–LPIL and Efree–hc present a good ability to distinguish between C-class and M/X-class flaring ARs. Using determined critical values of Efree and LPIL, one predicts correctly 93 out of 106 M/X-class flaring ARs and 159 out of 217 C-class flaring ARs. The large LPIL or hc for M/X-class flaring ARs probably implies the presence of a compact current with twisted magnetic fields winding about it.

<title>Aliasing from Galactic Plane Setting in Widefield Radio Interferometry</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Measurements with widefield radio interferometers often include the near-infinite gradient between the sky and the horizon. This causes aliasing inherent to the measurement itself and is purely a consequence of the Fourier basis. For this reason, the horizon is often attenuated by the instrumental beam down to levels deemed inconsequential. However, this effect is enhanced via our own Galactic plane as it sets over the course of a night. We show all-sky simulations of the Galactic plane setting in a low-frequency radio interferometer in detail for the first time. We then apply these simulations to the Murchison Widefield Array to show that a beam attenuation of 0.1% is not sufficient in some precision science cases. We determine that the noise statistics of the residual data image are drastically more Gaussian with aliasing removal, and explore consequences in simulation for cataloging of extragalactic sources and 21 cm Epoch of Reionization detection via the power spectrum.

<title>Locating Heating Channels of the Solar Corona in a Plage Region with the Aid of High-resolution 10830 Å Filtergrams</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this paper, with a set of high-resolution He i 10830 Å filtergrams, we select an area in a plage, very likely an extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) moss area, as an interface layer to follow the clues of coronal heating channels down to the photosphere. The filtergrams are obtained from the 1 m aperture New Vacuum Solar Telescope. We make a distinction between the darker and the brighter regions in the selected area and name the two regions enhanced absorption patches (EAPs) and low absorption patches (LAPs). With well-aligned, nearly simultaneous data from multiple channels of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly and the continuum of the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board Solar Dynamics Observatory, we compare the EUV/UV emissions, emission measure, mean temperature, and continuum intensity in the two kinds of regions. The following progress is made: (1) The mean EUV emissions over EAPs are mostly stronger than the corresponding emissions over LAPs except for the emission at 335 Å. The UV emissions at 1600 and 1700 Å fail to capture the difference between the two regions. (2) In the logarithmic temperature range of 5.6–6.2, EAPs have a higher EUV emission measure than LAPs, but they have a lower mean coronal temperature. (3) The mean continuum intensity over EAPs is lower. Based on the above progress, we suggest that the energy for coronal heating in the moss region can be traced down to some areas in intergranular lanes with enhanced density of both cool and hot material. The lower temperature over the EAPs is due to the greater fraction of cool material over there.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The high-speed solar wind decelerates as it travels through the Earth’s bow shock, during which a portion of the incident flow energy is converted into the plasma thermal energy. However, the energy partition of plasma heating among different species, as well as the energy dissipation mechanism, remains elusive. In this paper, we quantify the plasma heating and the energy dissipation by calculating the pressure–strain interactions in 33 quasi-perpendicular bow shocks observed by the Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft. Our results show that the Joule dissipation measured by and the quasi-viscous dissipation quantified by PiD are distinct in the examined shocks. We also reveal that ions gain more energy than electrons, and the compressive effect is more important than the incompressible channel in plasma heating. PiD contributed by the gyrotropic pressure tensor is consistently positive for electrons; however, there is no discernible distinction between the gyrotropic and nongyrotropic contribution to PiD for ions.

We study the circular polarization of the magnetic-field-induced transition (MIT) between the 3d5(6S)4d7D2 and 3d5(6S)4p7P4° states of Cr i at 533.03 nm (wavelength in air). The fractional circular polarization V/I of this spectral line resulting from the solution of the radiation transfer problem in a sunspot model permeated by a homogeneous magnetic field of 3 kG shows amplitudes of about 2%. Spectropolarimetric observations of two sunspots were obtained with the Zurich Imaging Polarimeter-3 at the Istituto ricerche solari Aldo e Cele Daccò observatory in Locarno, Switzerland. The observed V/I profiles show approximately antisymmetrical shapes with an amplitude of around 0.1% and 0.2% for the two sunspots. The center of this profile coincides with the wavelengths predicted for the abovementioned MIT. We apply an inversion code to the spectropolarimetric data of the Cr i-permitted lines at 532.91 and 532.98 nm, as well as to the MIT line at 533.03 nm, to infer a stratification of the emitting atmosphere. We compare the V/I profiles synthesized in the inferred atmosphere models with the observations, showing that the observed signal likely corresponds to the MIT line.

JWST has detected many overmassive galactic systems at z > 4, where the mass of the black hole, M•, is 10–100 times larger than expected from local relations, given the host’s stellar mass, M⋆. This paper presents a model to describe these overmassive systems in the high-z Universe. We suggest that the black hole mass is the main driver of high-z star formation quenching. Supermassive black holes globally impact their high-z galaxies because their hosts are physically small, and the black holes have duty cycles close to unity at z > 4. In this regime, we assume that black hole mass growth is regulated by the quasar’s output, while stellar mass growth is quenched by it and uncorrelated to the global properties of the host halo. We find that the ratio M•/M⋆ controls the average star formation efficiency: if M•/M⋆ > 8 × 1018(nΛ/ fEdd)[(ΩbMh)/(ΩmM⋆) − 1], then the galaxy is unable to form stars efficiently. Once this ratio exceeds the threshold, a runaway process brings the originally overmassive system toward the local M•–M⋆ relation. Furthermore, the M•–M⋆ relation evolves with redshift as ∝(1 + z)5/2. At z ∼ 5, we find an overmassive factor of ∼55, in excellent agreement with current JWST data and the high-z relation inferred from those. Extending the black hole horizon farther in redshift and lower in mass will test this model and improve our understanding of the early coevolution of black holes and galaxies.

<title>On the Transition Stage of Pulsar Pulsed Radio Emission and Its Potential Association with Radio Pulsar Nulling</title>

While the precise mechanism of generating pulsed coherent radio emission from pulsars remains elusive, certain gap-invoking models (especially, the inner gap model) offer a comprehensive and plausible explanation for the genesis and termination of such emissions. However, the transition stage between the period of persistent radio emission and the period of radio-quiet emission remains poorly understood, despite observations indicating that a radio pulsar in the pulse-nulling state is undergoing the transition stage. In this study, we present a qualitative explanation for the elusive transition stage by modeling pulsar magnetospheres analytically as equivalent resistive–capacitive circuits based on the inner gap model. Our result indicates that, due to lengthy spin-down, older radio pulsars will gradually shift from the state of persistent radio emission to a certain type of pulse-nulling state by delayed sparks within their inner gaps.

短周期外行星LHS 3844b被认为处于潮汐锁定状态，具有永久的昼夜两侧，可能受到极端的辐射。先前的研究表明，LHS 3844b可能没有大气层，这使得它成为约束行星自转的理想对象。通过对LHS 3844b的斯皮策相位曲线进行重新分析，采用了一个无大气层的热模型，我们排除了快速非同步自转的可能性，将行星的离心率限制在小于0.001的范围内，同时推测可能存在微弱的潮汐加热或者表面受到太空风化的影响。这些结果支持了短周期岩质外行星潮汐锁定的假设，并显示太空风化可以显著改变无大气层外行星的表面特征。<br /><br />总结: 研究表明LHS 3844b很可能被潮汐锁定，限制了其自转速度和轨道离心率，同时提出了可能存在微弱的潮汐加热或者表面太空风化的可能性。 <div>
Short-period exoplanets on circular orbits are thought to be tidally locked into synchronous rotation. If tidally locked, these planets must possess permanent day- and night-sides, with extreme irradiation on the dayside and none on the nightside. However, so far the tidal locking hypothesis for exoplanets is supported by little to no empirical evidence. Previous work showed that the super-Earth LHS 3844b likely has no atmosphere, which makes it ideal for constraining the planet’s rotation. Here we revisit the Spitzer phase curve of LHS 3844b with a thermal model of an atmosphere-less planet and analyze the impact of nonsynchronous rotation, eccentricity, tidal dissipation, and surface composition. Based on the lack of observed strong tidal heating we rule out rapid nonsynchronous rotation (including a Mercury-like 3:2 spin–orbit resonance) and constrain the planet's eccentricity to less than ∼0.001 (more circular than Io's orbit). In addition, LHS 3844b’s phase curve implies that the planet either still experiences weak tidal heating via a small-but-nonzero eccentricity (requiring an undetected orbital companion), or that its surface has been darkened by space weathering; of these two scenarios we consider space weathering more likely. Our results thus support the hypothesis that short-period rocky exoplanets are tidally locked, and further show that space weathering can significantly modify the surfaces of atmosphere-less exoplanets.

这篇文章报告了ALH 77307中发现的含有最高25Mg同位素组成的古代橄榄石，该成分挑战了当前的恒星模型。实验结果表明，这些橄榄石的地球化学特征与在超新星中形成并在前超新星阶段发生过氢摄取的假设最为接近。这是首个对来自氢燃烧超新星的古代橄榄石进行详细地球化学研究的报道，实现了3D分析和无与分析体积相关的贡献，同时获得了前所未有的空间分辨率。研究结果表明，橄榄石可能在重元素贫瘠的环境中凝结，或者在前超新星阶段末期或迅速坍缩时形成了局部气体组成不同的区域。 
<br /><br />总结: <br />presolar olivine, isotopic composition, hydrogen-burning SN, 3D analysis, spatial resolutions <div>
We have discovered a presolar olivine from ALH 77307 with the highest 25Mg isotopic composition measured in a silicate to date (δ25Mg = 3025.1‰ ± 38.3‰). Its isotopic compositions challenge current stellar models, with modeling of magnesium, silicon, and oxygen showing a closest match to formation in a supernova (SN) where hydrogen ingestion occurred in the pre-SN phase. Presolar grains within primitive astromaterials retain records of processes and environmental changes throughout stellar evolution. However, accessing these records has proved challenging due to the average grain size (∼150 nm) of presolar silicates, their sensitivity to extraction agents, and instrumental restrictions, limiting the range of isotopic and chemical signatures which can be studied per grain volume. Here, we present the first known detailed geochemical study of a presolar silicate from a hydrogen-burning SN, studied in 3D without contributions to the analysis volume and at unprecedented spatial resolutions (<1 nm), essential for constraining physical and chemical processes occurring within this recently proposed stellar environment. From our results, we infer either (i) condensation within an environment depleted of heavy elements compatible with the olivine lattice under the pressure and temperature conditions during condensation, or (ii) during periods of limited mixing either near the end of the pre-SN phase or from a collapse so rapid localized pockets of different gas compositions formed.

We use SEDz*—a code designed to chart the star formation histories (SFHs) of 6 < z < 12 galaxies—to analyze the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 894 galaxies with deep JWST/NIRCam imaging by JADES in the GOODS-S field. We show how SEDz* matches observed SEDs using stellar-population templates, graphing the contribution of each epoch by epoch to confirm the robustness of the technique. Very good SED fits for most SFHs demonstrate the compatibility of the templates with stars in the first galaxies—as expected, because their light is primarily from main-sequence A stars, free of post-main-sequence complexity, and insensitive to heavy-element compositions. We confirm earlier results from Dressler et al. (1) There are four types of SFHs: SFH1, burst; SFH2, stochastic; SFH3, “contiguous” (three epochs), and SFH4, “continuous” (four to six epochs). (2) Starbursts—both single and multiple—are predominant (∼70%) in this critical period of cosmic history, although longer SFHs (0.5–1.0 Gyr) contribute one-third of the accumulated stellar mass. These 894 SFHs contribute 1011.14, 1011.09, 1011.00, and 1010.60M⊙ for SFH1–4, respectively, adding up to ∼4 × 1011M⊙ by z = 6 for this field. We suggest that the absence of rising SFHs could be explained as an intense dust-enshrouded phase of star formation lasting tens of Myr that preceded each of the SFHs we measure. We find no strong dependencies of SFH type with the large-scale environment; however, the discovery of a compact group of 30 galaxies, 11 of which had first star formation at z = 11–12, suggests that long SFHs could dominate in rare, dense environments.

总结: 该研究涵盖了CMB-S4实验的重要性以及引入了一种新的引力透镜重建管道。该管道实现了对任意天空覆盖范围的最佳透镜重建并与CMB-S4的去透镜性能进行测试。研究发现，经过有效处理，重建的透镜 B 模方差减少了 92%–93%，达到了预期的性能，并为日后研究提供了重要的数据和方法。 <div>
The tightest constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio r can only be obtained after removing a substantial fraction of the lensing B-mode sample variance. The planned Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)-S4 experiment (cmb-s4.org) will remove the lensing B-mode signal internally by reconstructing the gravitational lenses from high-resolution observations. We document here a first lensing reconstruction pipeline able to achieve this optimally for arbitrary sky coverage. We make it part of a map-based framework to test CMB-S4 delensing performance and its constraining power on r, including inhomogeneous noise and two non-Gaussian Galactic polarized foreground models. The framework performs component separation of the high-resolution maps, followed by the construction of lensing B-mode templates, which are then included in a parametric small-aperture map cross-spectra-based likelihood for r. We find that the lensing reconstruction and framework achieve the expected performance, compatible with the target σ(r) ≃ 5 · 10−4 in the absence of a tensor signal, after an effective removal of 92%–93% of the lensing B-mode variance, depending on the simulation set. The code for the lensing reconstruction can also be used for cross-correlation studies with large-scale structures, lensing spectrum reconstruction, cluster lensing, or other CMB lensing-related purposes. As part of our tests, we also demonstrate the joint optimal reconstruction of the lensing potential with the lensing curl potential mode at second order in the density fluctuations.

We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) deep spectroscopy for a lensed galaxy at zspec = 8.496 with whose optical nebular lines and stellar continuum are detected by JWST/NIRSpec and NIRCam Early Release Observations in the field of SMACS J0723.3–7327. Our ALMA spectrum shows [O iii] 88 μm and [C ii] 158 μm line detections at 4.0σ and 4.5σ, respectively. The redshift and position of the [O iii] line coincide with those of the JWST source, while the [C ii] line is blueshifted by 90 km s−1 with a spatial offset of 0.″5 (≈0.5 kpc in the source plane) from the centroid of the JWST source. The NIRCam F444W image, including [O iii] λ5007 and Hβ line emission, spatially extends beyond the stellar components by a factor of >8. This indicates that the z = 8.5 galaxy has already experienced strong outflows as traced by extended [O iii] λ5007 and offset [C ii] emission, which would promote ionizing photon escape and facilitate reionization. With careful slit-loss corrections and the removal of emission spatially outside the galaxy, we evaluate the [O iii] 88 μm/λ5007 line ratio, and derive the electron density ne by photoionization modeling to be cm−3, which is comparable with those of z ∼ 2–3 galaxies. We estimate an [O iii] 88 μm/[C ii] 158 μm line ratio in the galaxy of >4, as high as those of known z ∼ 6–9 galaxies. This high [O iii] 88 μm/[C ii] 158 μm line ratio is generally explained by the high ne as well as the low metallicity ( ), high ionization parameter ( ), and low carbon-to-oxygen abundance ratio (log(C/O) = [−0.52: −0.24]) obtained from the JWST/NIRSpec data; further [C ii] follow-up observations will constrain the covering fraction of photodissociation regions.

The occurrence of a first-order hadron–quark matter phase transition at high baryon densities is investigated in astrophysical simulations of core-collapse supernovae, to decipher yet incompletely understood properties of the dense matter equation of state (EOS) using neutrinos from such cosmic events. It is found that the emission of a nonstandard second neutrino burst, dominated by electron antineutrinos, is not only a measurable signal for the appearance of deconfined quark matter but also reveals information about the state of matter at extreme conditions encountered at the supernova (SN) interior. To this end, a large set of spherically symmetric SN models is investigated, studying the dependence on the EOS and the stellar progenitor. General relativistic neutrino-radiation hydrodynamics is employed featuring three-flavor Boltzmann neutrino transport and a microscopic hadron-quark hybrid matter EOS class. Therefore, the DD2 relativistic mean-field hadronic model is employed, and several variations of it, and the string-flip model for the description of deconfined quark matter. The resulting hybrid model covers a representative range of onset densities for the phase transition and latent heats. This facilitates the direct connection between intrinsic signatures of the neutrino signal and properties of the EOS. In particular, a set of linear relations has been found empirically. These potentially provide a constraint for the onset density of a possible QCD phase transition from the future neutrino observation of the next galactic core-collapse SN, if a millisecond electron anti-neutrino burst is present around or less than 1 s.

总结:<br />
文章研究了巨大球状星团中多重恒星群的现象，发现第一种恒星群在球状星团中所占比例随着星团质量的增加而减少。通过假设固定的恒星质量阈值、星团质量与第一种恒星群比例之间的幂律关系以及第一种恒星群比例随时间保持不变等假设，对第一种恒星群比例随星团质量的关系进行了详细解析，并推论出在演化开始时具有至少4·105M⊙的最低质量阈值。这一高质量阈值严重限制了从演化星团中流失的第二种恒星群的数量，与银河星系晕的低第二种恒星群比例相吻合。根据假设的第一种恒星群比例恒定，推断了第二种恒星群不一定是在中心区域形成。 Magellanic Clouds集群在（质量，第一种恒星群比例）空间的位置与预期的中间时代集群在温和潮汐场中演化时一致。内外模型星团的分布与观测到的也一致。总的来说，该研究对球状星团中多重恒星群的现象进行了深入的研究和推断。 <div>
The phenomenon of multiple stellar populations is exacerbated in massive globular clusters, with the fraction of first-population (1P) stars a decreasing function of the cluster present-day mass. We decipher this relation in far greater detail than has been done so far. We assume (i) a fixed stellar mass threshold for the formation of second-population (2P) stars, (ii) a power-law scaling between the mass mecl of newly formed clusters and their 1P star fraction F1P, and (iii) a constant F1P over time. The F1P(mecl) relation is then evolved up to an age of 12 Gyr for tidal field strengths representative of the entire Galactic halo. The 12 Gyr old model tracks cover the present-day distribution of Galactic globular clusters in the (mass, F1P) space extremely well. The distribution is curtailed on its top right side by the scarcity of clusters at large Galactocentric distances and on its bottom left side by the initial scarcity of very high-mass clusters and dynamical friction. Given their distinct dissolution rates, “inner” and “outer” model clusters are offset from each other, as observed. The locus of Magellanic Clouds clusters in the (mass, F1P) space is as expected for intermediate-age clusters evolving in a gentle tidal field. Given the assumed constancy of F1P, we conclude that 2P stars do not necessarily form centrally concentrated. We infer a minimum mass of 4 · 105M⊙ for multiple-population clusters at secular evolution onset. This high-mass threshold severely limits the number of 2P stars lost from evolving clusters, thereby fitting the low 2P star fraction of the Galactic halo field.

总结: <br /><br />研究使用WISPR观察到小尺度特征，推测为Kelvin–Helmholtz不稳定性，这些特征出现在Parker Solar Probe在7.5 R⊙和9.5 R⊙之间的日冕质量抛射尾部附近，持续约30分钟。通过分析涡旋的尺寸和边界层的厚度，以及估计的线性增长率，支持了KHI的候选性。研究强调了PSP/WISPR在观察太阳低层和中层日冕中此类现象的独特能力，尤其是当PSP的近日点距离太阳更近时。 <div>
We present a comprehensive analysis aimed at proving the hypothesis that a train of small-scale features observed by the Wide-field Imager (WISPR) onboard the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) are the signature of a Kelvin–Helmholtz instability (KHI). These features were seen near the flank of a Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) wake between 7.5 R⊙ and 9.5 R⊙, lasting for about 30 minutes. The CME was a slow event, associated with a streamer blowout. We analyzed the size of the eddies and found growth during their evolution while maintaining separation distances and alignment typical of Kelvin–Helmholtz vortexes. We then assessed the magnetic field conditions that would make the observation of such an instability plausible. Two methods were used to cross-check our findings. The measured thickness of the boundary layer supports KHI candidacy, and the estimated linear growth rate suggests nonlinear saturation within the expected timescale. We conclude that a KHI is a plausible explanation for the observed features, and therefore that such instabilities might exist in the low and middle solar corona (within ∼15 R⊙) and can be detected in white light observations. Their observation, however, might be rare due to stringent conditions like the observer’s proximity, suitable viewing circumstances, magnetic field topology, and flow properties. This study highlights the unique capability of PSP/WISPR in observing such phenomena, especially as PSP perihelia reach closer distances to the Sun.

文章介绍了年轻恒星源HH 30的特点和结构。通过Hubble Space Telescope观测到HH 30的离子光学喷流，同时Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array观测到了12CO的残余包层。光学喷流具有窄的外观、基部较大的线宽和高温度。通过位置-速度图可以识别三种主要结构：具有大谱线宽度的极高速宽角风组分、12CO中观测到的极低速环境介质、以及与主要风和周围环境介质在速度和位置上都有嵌套的12CO跟踪的低速区域。在光学喷流周围形成了多层空腔结构，由内部盘区域起源的原子气体通过禁闭线发出明亮的光学喷流，宽角部分扩展形成低密度腔体。12CO纤维环绕着风腔混合并通过磁场相互作用向内部运动。HH 30系统是Shang等人提出的统一风模型的理想表现，通过其中区分的原子和分子物种混合以及环绕的寒冷分子环境物质。 <div>
The young stellar source HH 30 is a textbook example of an ionic optical jet originating from a disk in an edge-on system shown by the Hubble Space Telescope. It has a remnant envelope in 12CO observed by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The optical jet is characterized by its narrow appearance, large line width at the base, and high temperature inferred from line diagnostics. Three featured structures can be identified, most evident in the transverse position–velocity diagrams: an extremely-high-velocity wide-angle wind component with large spectral widths in the optical, a very-low-velocity ambient surrounding medium seen in 12CO, and a low-velocity region traced by 12CO nested both in velocity and location between the primary wind and ambient environment. A layered cavity with multiple shells forms nested morphological and kinematic structures around the optical jet. The atomic gas originating from the innermost region of the disk attains a sufficient temperature and ionization to emit brightly in forbidden lines as an optical jet. The wide-angle portion expands, forming a low-density cavity. The filamentary 12CO encompassing the wind cavity is mixed and advected inward through the action of the magnetic interplay of the wide-angle wind with the molecular ambient medium. The magnetic interplay results in the layered shells penetrating deeply into the vast cavity of tenuous atomic wind material. The HH 30 system is an ideal manifestation of the unified wind model of Shang et al. (2020, 2023), with clearly distinguishable atomic and molecular species mixed through the atomic lightly ionized magnetized wind and the surrounding cold molecular ambient material.

总结:
本文介绍了Solar Orbiter上的Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX)提供了进行太阳耀斑立体X射线观测的独特机会，该观测与当前和未来的地球X射线任务进行比较。这些观测将产生几十年来第一次可靠的硬X射线（HXR）直接度量，提供耀斑加速电子的一个新的诊断，并有助于限制耀斑中加速电子的过程。文章展示了HXR直接度量如何随着不同的电子和耀斑特性而变化，并展示了建模可以如何从数据中提取这些通常未知的特性。最后，文章展示了通过与本文建模的比较如何提取HXR直接度量，并呈现了两个耀斑的初步HXR直接度分析，证明了这样的观测的可行性和挑战，以及如何通过与此处展示的建模比较来提取HXR直接度量。 <div>
The Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) on board Solar Orbiter (SolO) provides a unique opportunity to systematically perform stereoscopic X-ray observations of solar flares with current and upcoming X-ray missions at Earth. These observations will produce the first reliable measurements of hard X-ray (HXR) directivity in decades, providing a new diagnostic of the flare-accelerated electron angular distribution and helping to constrain the processes that accelerate electrons in flares. However, such observations must be compared to modeling, taking into account electron and X-ray transport effects and realistic plasma conditions, all of which can change the properties of the measured HXR directivity. Here, we show how HXR directivity, defined as the ratio of X-ray spectra at different spacecraft viewing angles, varies with different electron and flare properties (e.g., electron angular distribution, highest-energy electrons, and magnetic configuration), and how modeling can be used to extract these typically unknown properties from the data. Finally, we present a preliminary HXR directivity analysis of two flares, observed by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor and SolO/STIX, demonstrating the feasibility and challenges associated with such observations, and how HXR directivity can be extracted by comparison with the modeling presented here.

<br /><br />总结:
本文研究了相对论性再连接流速度的缩放，同时考虑了沿着重新连接磁场的剪切流和指向重新连接平面外的引导场。在非相对论性再连接中，已发现超阿尔文剪切流会抑制再连接。我们将这一现象的分析模型扩展到相对论情况，并发现了类似的行为，这得到了粒子在单元模拟的证实。与非相对论极限不同的是，引导场的加入降低了平面内的阿尔文速度，导致了更慢的流出喷流以及在强磁化等离子体中更有效地抑制了再连接。 <div>
The scaling of the relativistic reconnection outflow speed is studied in the presence of both shear flows parallel to the reconnecting magnetic fields and guide fields pointing out of the reconnection plane. In nonrelativistic reconnection, super-Alfvénic shear flows have been found to suppress reconnection. We extend the analytical model of this phenomenon to the relativistic regime and find similar behavior, which is confirmed by particle-in-cell simulations. Unlike the nonrelativistic limit, the addition of a guide field lowers the in-plane Alfvén velocity, contributing to slower outflow jets and the more efficient suppression of reconnection in strongly magnetized plasmas.

<title>Relative Yield of Thermal and Nonthermal Emission during Weak Flares Observed by STIX during 2021 September 20–25</title>

<div> 关键词: 太阳耀斑, 多波段观测, 热-非热能量, 等离子体参数, 太阳飞行器<br />
总结: <br />本研究分析了2021年9月20日至25日期间太阳飞行器接收到的来自近距离观测的约200次较弱耀斑的多波段辐射数据。通过关联硬X射线通量和软X射线通量，并结合耀斑峰值软X射线通量，确定了强非热耀斑。对20次强非热弱耀斑的多波段观测结果表明硬X射线通量与辐射度存在反比关系，而与等离子体温度呈正相关。这表明在得到非热能量输入后，低密度环路中的等离子体温度比高密度环路中的温度更高。同时，研究结果进一步表明太阳耀斑最初阶段的等离子体参数对热-非热能量分配起着决定性作用。 <div>
The disparate nature of the thermal–nonthermal energy partition during flares, particularly during weak flares, is still an open issue. Following the Neupert effect, quantifying the relative yield of X-ray emission in different energy bands can enable the inferring of the underlying energy release mechanism. During 2021 September 20–25, the Solar Orbiter mission—being closer to the Sun (∼0.6 au) and having a moderate separation angle (<40°) from the Sun–Earth line—offered a unique opportunity to analyze multiwavelength emission from ∼200 (mostly weak) flares, commonly observed by the Spectrometer Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX), STEREO-A, GOES, and the Solar Dynamics Observatory. Associating the quotient (qf) of hard X-ray fluence (12–20 keV) and soft X-ray flux (4–10 keV) with the peak soft X-ray flux enabled us to identify strongly nonthermal flares. A multiwavelength investigation of spectral and imaging-mode observations of the 20 strongly nonthermal weak flares reveals an inverse relationship of qf with the emission measure (and density), and a positive relationship with the flare plasma temperature. This indicates that the plasma in tenuous loops attains higher temperatures compared to that in the denser loops, in response to nonthermal energy deposition. This is in agreement with the plasma parameters of the coronal loops, as derived by applying the one-dimensional Palermo–Harvard hydrodynamical code to coronal loop plasma with different initial coronal loop base pressures when subjected to similar heating inputs. Our investigation, therefore, indicates that the plasma parameters of the flaring loop in the initial phase have a decisive role in the thermal–nonthermal energy partitioning.

<div> 关键词: 活动星系核（AGN），Sloan数字化天空测量（SDSS），Hα谱线，星形成，负反馈<br />
总结:<br />这篇手稿提供了支持低红移Sloan数字化天空测量（SDSS）Type 2 AGN宿主星系中全球负面活动星系核（AGN）反馈的线索，基于窄Hα发射线光度LHα和光学连续光度λLcont之间的不同依赖关系。研究发现，在Type 2 AGN中，λLcont和LHα的相关性显著低于星形成星系，即Type 2 AGN中的窄Hα发射线光度明显较低。此外，Dn（4000）和HδA的属性也提供了间接证据，支持Type 2 AGN中全球负面AGN反馈。本研究不仅支持局部Type 2 AGN中全球负面AGN反馈的存在，还展示了对全球负面AGN反馈对星形成抑制的量化。 <div>
In this manuscript, clues are provided to support globally negative active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback on star formation in the host galaxies of the local low-redshift Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Type 2 AGN, based on the different dependence of narrow Hα line luminosity LHα on optical continuum luminosity λLcont between star-forming galaxies and Type 2 AGN. Through the measured LHα and λLcont in SDSS star-forming galaxies, there is a strong linear correlation between λLcont and LHα, accepted as a standard correlation without the effects of AGN activity. Meanwhile, considering the apparent contribution of AGN activity to the narrow Hα line emissions in Type 2 AGN, the correlation between λLcont and LHα in the SDSS Type 2 AGN leads to a statistically lower LHα in Type 2 AGN than in star-forming galaxies, with a significance level higher than 5σ, even after considering necessary effects (including effects of host galaxy properties), leading to the accepted conclusion on the globally negative AGN feedback in the local Type 2 AGN. Meanwhile, the properties of Dn(4000) and HδA can provide indirect clues to support the globally negative AGN feedback in local Type 2 AGN, due to older stellar ages in Type 2 AGN. Moreover, it is interesting to expect more than 50% narrow Hα emissions globally suppressed in the host galaxies of Type 2 AGN relative to the star-forming galaxies. The results not only support globally negative AGN feedback in local Type 2 AGN, but also show further clues on the quantification of suppressions of star formation by the globally negative AGN feedback.

该研究评估了主宇宙中心星系不匹配率以及来自Dark Energy Survey 5 Yr（DES-SN5YR）光度样本模拟的宇宙学参数偏差。他们发现1.7%的SNe匹配到错误的主星系，这导致了红移的错误。采用他们的分析流程，他们发现由于包括了匹配错误的SNe，暗能量状态参数（Δw）的偏差很小，远小于来自DES-SN5YR样本的不确定性。他们鼓励进一步的研究，通过更好的主星系匹配算法或选择性剔除来减小这种偏差。<br /><br />总结: 评估了SNe Ia的主星系匹配率和其对宇宙学参数的偏差；发现偏差远小于样本不确定性；鼓励进一步研究改进匹配算法。 <div>
Redshift measurements, primarily obtained from host galaxies, are essential for inferring cosmological parameters from type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Matching SNe to host galaxies using images is nontrivial, resulting in a subset of SNe with mismatched hosts and thus incorrect redshifts. We evaluate the host galaxy mismatch rate and resulting biases on cosmological parameters from simulations modeled after the Dark Energy Survey 5 Yr (DES-SN5YR) photometric sample. For both DES-SN5YR data and simulations, we employ the directional light radius method for host galaxy matching. In our SN Ia simulations, we find that 1.7% of SNe are matched to the wrong host galaxy, with redshift differences between the true and matched hosts of up to 0.6. Using our analysis pipeline, we determine the shift in the dark energy equation of state parameter (Δw) due to including SNe with incorrect host galaxy matches. For SN Ia–only simulations, we find Δw = 0.0013 ± 0.0026 with constraints from the cosmic microwave background. Including core-collapse SNe and peculiar SNe Ia in the simulation, we find that Δw ranges from 0.0009 to 0.0032, depending on the photometric classifier used. This bias is an order of magnitude smaller than the expected total uncertainty on w from the DES-SN5YR sample of ∼0.03. We conclude that the bias on w from host galaxy mismatch is much smaller than the uncertainties expected from the DES-SN5YR sample, but we encourage further studies to reduce this bias through better host-matching algorithms or selection cuts.

本研究旨在探讨概率深度学习模型在宇宙学中的应用，重点是通过光度红移估计对大规模天文调查的角色。作者使用超级HSC调查中的星系数据集进行了实验，研究了神经网络和概率BNN在光度红移估计方面的表现，并评估了它们满足LSST光度红移学科要求的性能。实验结果显示，BNN能够准确地产生不确定性，通过覆盖率测试发现，在0 < z < 2.5的范围内，67.2%的星系的1σ不确定性覆盖了光谱值。同时，与其他机器学习模型相比，BNN在0 < z < 2.5范围内满足了LSST的光度红移学科要求中的三分之二。 
<br /><br />总结: <div>
We present results exploring the role that probabilistic deep learning models can play in cosmology from large-scale astronomical surveys through photometric redshift (photo-z) estimation. Photo-z uncertainty estimates are critical for the science goals of upcoming large-scale surveys such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST); however, common machine learning methods typically provide only point estimates and lack uncertainties on predictions. We turn to Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) as a promising way to provide accurate predictions of redshift values with uncertainty estimates. We have compiled a galaxy data set from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Survey with grizy photometry, which is designed to be a smaller-scale version of large surveys like LSST. We use this data set to investigate the performance of a neural network and a probabilistic BNN for photo-z estimation and evaluate their performance with respect to LSST photo-z science requirements. We also examine the utility of photo-z uncertainties as a means to reduce catastrophic outlier estimates. The BNN outputs the estimate in the form of a Gaussian probability distribution. We use the mean and standard deviation as the redshift estimate and uncertainty. We find that the BNN can produce accurate uncertainties. Using a coverage test, we find excellent agreement with expectation—67.2% of galaxies between 0 < 2.5 have 1σ uncertainties that cover the spectroscopic value. We also include a comparison to alternative machine learning models using the same data. We find the BNN meets two out of three of the LSST photo-z science requirements in the range 0 < z < 2.5.

We present fluxes and light curves for a population of asteroids at millimeter wavelengths, detected by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) over 18,000 deg2 of the sky using data from 2017 to 2021. We utilize high cadence maps, which can be used in searching for moving objects such as asteroids and trans-Neptunian Objects, as well as for studying transients. We detect 170 asteroids with a signal-to-noise of at least 5 in at least one of the ACT observing bands, which are centered near 90, 150, and 220 GHz. For each asteroid, we compare the ACT measured flux to predicted fluxes from the near-Earth asteroid thermal model fit to WISE data. We confirm previous results that detected a deficit of flux at millimeter wavelengths. Moreover, we report a spectral characteristic to this deficit, such that the flux is relatively lower at 150 and 220 GHz than at 90 GHz. Additionally, we find that the deficit in flux is greater for S-type asteroids than for C-type.

Type Ia supernovae (SNe) remain poorly understood despite decades of investigation. Massive computationally intensive hydrodynamic simulations have been developed and run to model an ever-growing number of proposed progenitor channels. Further complicating the matter, a large number of subtypes of Type Ia SNe have been identified in recent decades. Due to the massive computational load required, inference of the internal structure of Type Ia SNe ejecta directly from observations using simulations has previously been computationally intractable. However, deep-learning emulators for radiation transport simulations have alleviated such barriers. We perform abundance tomography on 40 Type Ia SNe from optical spectra using the radiative transfer code TARDIS accelerated by the probabilistic DALEK deep-learning emulator. We apply a parametric model of potential outer ejecta structures to comparatively investigate abundance distributions and internal ionization fractions of intermediate-mass elements (IMEs) between normal and 1991T-like Type Ia SNe in the early phases. Our inference shows that the outer ejecta of 1991T-like Type Ia SNe is underabundant in the typical intermediate mass elements that heavily contribute to the spectral line formation seen in normal Type Ia SNe at early times. Additionally, we find that the IMEs present in 1991T-like Type Ia SNe are highly ionized compared to those in the normal Type Ia population. Finally, we conclude that the transition between normal and 1991T-like Type Ia SNe appears to be continuous observationally and that the observed differences come out of a combination of both abundance and ionization fractions in these SNe populations.

Some high-z active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are found to reside in extreme star-forming galaxies, such as hyperluminous infrared galaxies (HyLIRGs), with AGN-removed LIR of >1013L⊙. In this paper, we report NOEMA observations of six apparent starburst HyLIRGs associated with optical quasars at z ∼ 2–3 in the Stripe 82 field, to study their dust and molecular CO properties. Five out of the six candidates are detected with CO(4–3) or CO(5–4) emission, and four in the 2 mm dust continuum. Based on the linewidth– diagnostics, we find that four galaxies are likely unlensed or weakly lensed sources. The molecular gas mass is in the range of (with , where μ is the unknown possible gravitational magnification factor). We fit their spectral energy distributions, after including the observed 2 mm fluxes and upper limits, and estimate their apparent (uncorrected for possible lensing effects) star formation rates (μSFRs) to be ∼400–2500 M⊙ yr−1, with a depletion time of ∼20–110 Myr. We notice interesting offsets, of ∼10–40 kpc spatially or ∼1000–2000 km s−1 spectroscopically, between the optical quasar and the millimeter continuum or CO emissions. The observed velocity shift is likely related to the blueshifted broad-emission-line region of quasars, though mergers or recoiling black holes are also possible causes, which can explain the spatial offsets and the high intrinsic star formation rates in the HyLIRG quasar systems.

Testing the standard cosmological model (ΛCDM) at small scales is challenging. Galaxies that inhabit low-mass dark matter halos provide an ideal test bed for dark matter models by linking observational properties of galaxies at small scales (low mass, low velocity) to low-mass dark matter halos. However, the observed kinematics of these galaxies do not align with the kinematics of the dark matter halos predicted to host them, obscuring our understanding of the low-mass end of the galaxy–halo connection. We use deep H i observations of low-mass galaxies at high spectral resolution in combination with cosmological simulations of dwarf galaxies to better understand the connection between dwarf galaxy kinematics and low-mass halos. Specifically, we use H i line widths to directly compare to the maximum velocities in a dark matter halo and find that each deeper measurement approaches the expected one-to-one relationship between the observed kinematics and the predicted kinematics in ΛCDM. We also measure baryonic masses and place these on the baryonic Tully–Fisher relation (BTFR). Again, our deepest measurements approach the theoretical predictions for the low-mass end of this relation, a significant improvement on similar measurements based on line widths measured at 50% and 20% of the peak. Our data also hint at the rollover in the BTFR predicted by hydrodynamical simulations of ΛCDM for low-mass galaxies.

The formation of binary stars is highly influenced by magnetic fields, which play a crucial role in transporting angular momentum. We conducted 3D numerical simulations of binary star accretion via a circumbinary disk, taking into account a magnetic field perpendicular to the disk and an infalling envelope. Our simulations reproduce the following phenomena: (1) the spiral arms associated with circumstellar disks; (2) the turbulence in the circumbinary disk, induced by magnetorotational instability (MRI); (3) a fast outflow launched from each circumstellar disk; and (4) a slow outflow from the circumbinary disk. The binary models exhibit a higher α-parameter than the corresponding single-star models, indicating that the binary stars enhance the MRI turbulence. Moreover, an infalling envelope also enhances the turbulence, leading to a high α-parameter. While the spiral arms promote radial flow, causing the transfer of mass and angular momentum within the circumbinary disk, the MRI turbulence and outflows are the main drivers of angular momentum transfer to reduce the specific angular momentum of the system.

这篇文章报告了对2FHL J1745.1–3035进行的多时期、多天文台的X射线分析。该源在50 GeV以上具有非常硬的γ射线光子指数，Γγ = 1.2 ± 0.4，并被Fermi-LAT发现为TeV辐射体。通过联合XMM-Newton、Chandra和NuSTAR观测，使用超过20年的存档XMM-Newton观测，研究了2FHL J1745.1–3035的X射线光谱特性。联合X射线光谱显示最佳拟合为带有断裂功率定律模型，断裂能量Eb∼7keV：在10keV以下的能量范围内，该源非常硬，Γ1∼0.6，在NuSTAR测量的更高能量范围内显著变软，Γ2∼1.9。通过Chandra进行了空间分辨的X射线分析，发现了边缘延展的证据（最多达到角尺寸r∼5″），这一结果支持了紧凑脉冲星风星云的情形。根据X射线和γ射线特性，2FHL J1745.1–3035是一个有力的脉冲星风星云候选体。由于其作为极端TeV辐射体的特性，进一步得到了HESS J1745-303的TeV延展源的探测支持，2FHL J1745.1–3035是未来使用切伦科夫望远镜阵的理想候选体。 <br /><br />总结: 多时期的X射线分析显示2FHL J1745.1–3035具有极端的γ射线光子指数和TeV发射特性；X射线光谱表明其可能是一个脉冲星风星云候选体；同时与TeV延展源HESS J1745-303的探测结果相吻合，值得进一步使用切伦科夫望远镜阵进行跟踪观测。 <div>
We present a multi-epoch, multi-observatory X-ray analysis for 2FHL J1745.1–3035, a newly discovered very high-energy Galactic source detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) located in close proximity to the Galactic Center (l = 358.°5319; b = −0.°7760). The source shows a very hard γ-ray photon index above 50 GeV, Γγ = 1.2 ± 0.4, and is found to be a TeV emitter by the Fermi–LAT. We conduct a joint XMM-Newton, Chandra, and NuSTAR observing campaign, combining archival XMM-Newton observations, to study the X-ray spectral properties of 2FHL J1745.1–3035 over a time span of over 20 yr. The joint X-ray spectrum is best fitted as a broken-power-law model with break energy Eb ∼ 7 keV: the source is very hard at energies below 10 keV, with Γ1 ∼ 0.6, and significantly softer in the higher energy range measured by NuSTAR with Γ2 ∼ 1.9. We also perform a spatially resolved X-ray analysis with Chandra, finding evidence for marginal extension (up to an angular size r ∼ 5″), a result that supports a compact pulsar wind nebula scenario. Based on the X-ray and γ-ray properties, 2FHL J1745.1–3035 is a powerful pulsar wind nebula candidate. Given its nature as an extreme TeV emitter, further supported by the detection of a coincident TeV extended source HESS J1745-303, 2FHL J1745.1–3035 is an ideal candidate for a follow up with the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array.

<br /><br />总结:
该研究报道了对25个尚未重复的快速无线电爆发（FRBs）进行的全极化分析，这些FRB是在1.4 GHz上由110天线深度综合阵列（DSA-110）在委托观测期间检测到的。文章介绍了针对这一新型设备开发的数据降噪、校准和分析程序的细节。研究结果显示，20个FRBs在±106 rad m−2范围内具有法拉第旋转测量值（RMs），其中15个FRBs与100%极化一致，10个具有高（≥70%）线偏极化分数，2个具有高（≥30%）圆偏极化分数。结果不支持多路径RM散射作为主要解极化机制。与先前发表的FRB极化测量相结合后，研究比较了FRB子种群和银河脉冲星的极化特性。研究支持了一种情况，即FRB发射本质上是高度线偏极化的，传播效应可以导致圆偏极化和解极化。年轻的脉冲星发射和磁层传播几何形态可能对FRB极化的起源形成有用的类比。 <div>
We report on a full-polarization analysis of the first 25 as yet nonrepeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) detected at 1.4 GHz by the 110-antenna Deep Synoptic Array (DSA-110) during commissioning observations. We present details of the data-reduction, calibration, and analysis procedures developed for this novel instrument. Faraday rotation measures (RMs) are searched between ±106 rad m−2 and detected for 20 FRBs, with magnitudes ranging from 4 to 4670 rad m−2. Fifteen out of 25 FRBs are consistent with 100% polarization, 10 of which have high (≥70%) linear-polarization fractions and two of which have high (≥30%) circular-polarization fractions. Our results disfavor multipath RM scattering as a dominant depolarization mechanism. Polarization-state and possible RM variations are observed in the four FRBs with multiple subcomponents. We combine the DSA-110 sample with polarimetry of previously published FRBs, and compare the polarization properties of FRB subpopulations and FRBs with Galactic pulsars. Although FRB polarization fractions are typically higher than those of Galactic pulsars, and cover a wider range than those of pulsar single pulses, they resemble those of the youngest (characteristic ages <105 yr) pulsars. Our results support a scenario wherein FRB emission is intrinsically highly linearly polarized, and propagation effects can result in conversion to circular polarization and depolarization. Young pulsar emission and magnetospheric propagation geometries may form a useful analogy for the origin of FRB polarization.

<title>The Fate of the Interstellar Medium in Early-type Galaxies. III. The Mechanism of Interstellar Medium Removal and the Quenching of Star Formation</title>

<div> ETGs, quenching, cold ISM, star formation, SFE
<br /><br />总结:
本研究探讨了早期星系（ETGs）中恒星形成的抑制机制。研究发现，ETGs中冷间星介质（ISM）的减少速度与尘埃、分子和原子气体的减少速度相似，排除了一系列潜在的ISM消除机制，表明低质量恒星的电离和/或超新星引起的电离/流出可能是主要机制。此外，研究还提供了内部产生的ISM的证据，并发现星系中恒星形成的抑制不能仅通过气体量的减少来解释，因为SFR的下降速度比冷气体的减少速度更快，而星系的SFE低于恒星形成星系的SFE，可能是由于气体的稳定性增强。 <div>
Understanding how galaxies quench their star formation is crucial for studies of galaxy evolution. Quenching is related to a decrease of cold gas. In the first paper we showed that the dust removal timescale in early-type galaxies (ETGs) is about 2.5 Gyr. Here we present carbon monoxide and 21 cm hydrogen line observations of these galaxies and measure the timescale of removal of the cold interstellar medium (ISM). We find that all the cold ISM components (dust and molecular and atomic gas) decline at similar rates. This allows us to rule out a wide range of potential ISM-removal mechanisms (including starburst-driven outflows, astration, or a decline in the number of asymptotic giant branch stars), and artificial effects like the stellar mass–age correlation, environmental influence, mergers, and selection bias, leaving ionization by evolved low-mass stars and ionization/outflows by Type Ia supernovae or active galactic nuclei as viable mechanisms. We also provide evidence for an internal origin of the detected ISMs. Moreover, we find that the quenching of star formation in these galaxies cannot be explained by a reduction in the gas amount alone, because the star formation rates (SFRs) decrease faster (on a timescale of about 1.8 Gyr) than the amount of cold gas. Furthermore, the star formation efficiency (SFE) of the ETGs ( ) is lower than that of star-forming galaxies, whereas their gas mass fractions ( ) are normal. This may be explained by the stabilization of gas against fragmentation, for example due to morphological quenching, turbulence, or magnetic fields.

<div> 关键词: Pulsar timing, algorithm, binary pulsars, Green Bank Telescope, Terzan 5

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章介绍了一个自动化的脉冲星定时算法，用于测量脉冲星的旋转频率、位置、双星参数等信息。通过应用统计F-检验和减少的χ2在最小值附近的二次依赖关系，可以高效而系统地确定脉冲星的全局旋转计数。作者使用这个算法在Terzan 5球状星团的两颗新发现的双星脉冲星PSR J1748−2446aq和J1748−2446at上建立了定时解决方案，利用了过去13年的约70次Green Bank Telescope观测。 <div>
Pulsar timing is a powerful tool that, by accounting for every rotation of a pulsar, precisely measures the spin frequency, spin frequency derivatives, astrometric position, binary parameters when applicable, properties of the interstellar medium, and potentially general relativistic effects. Typically, this process demands fairly stringent scheduling requirements for monitoring observations as well as deep domain knowledge to “phase connect” the timing data. We present an algorithm that automates the pulsar-timing process for binary pulsars, whose timing solutions have an additional level of complexity, although the algorithm works for isolated pulsars as well. Using the statistical F-test and the quadratic dependence of the reduced χ2 near a minimum, the global rotation count of a pulsar can be determined efficiently and systematically. We have used our algorithm to establish timing solutions for two newly discovered binary pulsars, PSRs J1748−2446aq and J1748−2446at, in the globular cluster Terzan 5, using ∼70 Green Bank Telescope observations from the last 13 yr.

<div> 关键词: neutrinos, gamma-ray bursts, IceCube-DeepCore, sub-photospheric collision, baryon loading
总结:<br /><br /> 这项研究使用IceCube-DeepCore数据对2268次伽马射线暴（GRBs）进行了8年的中微子探测，探索了光球以下的爆发物理过程。研究发现没有发现中微子的证据，但对GRB 221009A的分析提供了对重子装载的最具约束力的限制。相比于IceCube在太子到拍他子电子伏特能量范围内的观测，本文给出的中微子限制是一个有益的补充。 <div>
We present the results of a search for 10–1000 GeV neutrinos from 2268 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) over 8 yr of IceCube-DeepCore data. This work probes burst physics below the photosphere where electromagnetic radiation cannot escape. Neutrinos of tens of giga electronvolts are predicted in sub-photospheric collision of free-streaming neutrons with bulk-jet protons. In a first analysis, we searched for the most significant neutrino-GRB coincidence using six overlapping time windows centered on the prompt phase of each GRB. In a second analysis, we conducted a search for a group of GRBs, each individually too weak to be detectable, but potentially significant when combined. No evidence of neutrino emission is found for either analysis. The most significant neutrino coincidence is for Fermi-GBM GRB bn 140807500, with a p-value of 0.097 corrected for all trials. The binomial test used to search for a group of GRBs had a p-value of 0.65 after all trial corrections. The binomial test found a group consisting only of GRB bn 140807500 and no additional GRBs. The neutrino limits of this work complement those obtained by IceCube at tera electronvolt to peta electronvolt energies. We compare our findings for the large set of GRBs as well as GRB 221009A to the sub-photospheric neutron-proton collision model and find that GRB 221009A provides the most constraining limit on baryon loading. For a jet Lorentz factor of 300 (800), the baryon loading on GRB 221009A is lower than 3.85 (2.13) at a 90% confidence level.

总结: 本研究利用高时空分辨率的观测仪器观察到了双层磁流体力线的形成过程，发现双重爆发引发了两个磁通绳系统。观测结果表明，第一个磁通绳的爆发经历了短暂的停顿后成功喷发，而第二个磁通绳则是失败的喷发。这表明新形成的磁通绳在较高高度达到了新的平衡状态，可以被视为一个临时的双层磁通绳系统。研究结果支持了系留剪切模型，并提出了当背景日冕磁场在高度上呈现鞍状磁衰减指数分布时，两次连续的受限系留剪切喷发会自然产生双层磁通绳系统的假设。 <div>
Double-decker filaments and their eruptions have been widely observed in recent years, but their physical formation mechanism is still unclear. Using high spatiotemporal resolution, multi-wavelength observations taken by the New Vacuum Solar Telescope and the Solar Dynamics Observatory, we show the formation of a double-decker pair of flux rope system by two successive tether-cutting eruptions in a bipolar active region. Due to the combined effect of photospheric shearing and convergence motions around the active region’s polarity inversion line (PIL), the arms of two overlapping inverse-S-shaped short filaments reconnected at their intersection, which created a simultaneous upward-moving magnetic flux rope (MFR) and a downward-moving post-flare-loop (PFL) system striding the PIL. Meanwhile, four bright flare ribbons appeared at the footpoints of the newly formed MFR and the PFL. As the MFR rose, two elongated flare ribbons connected by a relatively larger PFL appeared on either side of the PIL. After a few minutes, another MFR formed in the same way at the same location and then erupted in the same direction as the first one. Detailed observational results suggest that the eruption of the first MFR might experienced a short pause before its successful eruption, while the second MFR was a failed eruption. This implies that the two newly formed MFRs might reach a new equilibrium at relatively higher heights for a while, which can be regarded as a transient double-decker flux rope system. The observations can well be explained by the tether-cutting model, and we propose that two successive confined tether-cutting eruptions can naturally produce a double-decker flux rope system, especially when the background coronal magnetic field has a saddle-like distribution of magnetic decay index profile in height.

总结:
大气层模拟包括了光与大气的相互作用，使用光子Monte Carlo方法实现。气象分布基于历史数据编译全球气候分布，垂直热力学量的自洽垂直剖面，云量和云覆盖的空间模型，以及四种气溶胶的全球分布。通过物理第一原理实现物理交互，从而产生出包括差分星差测量和椭圆点扩散函数在内的新兴图像特性。使用共同的大气层表示框架通过模拟单个光子来自洽地模拟所有现象。文章还总结了一些微妙的相关性，包括温度与背景和差分星差测量的反相关性，湿度与月背景的相关性，PSF翼与云深度的相关性，背景与云深度的反相关性，以及月背景与云深度的相关性。 <div>
We present a self-consistent representation of the atmosphere and implement the interactions of light with the atmosphere using a photon Monte Carlo approach. We compile global climate distributions based on historical data, self-consistent vertical profiles of thermodynamic quantities, spatial models of cloud variation and cover, and global distributions of four kinds of aerosols. We then implement refraction, Rayleigh scattering, molecular interactions, and Tyndall–Mie scattering to all photons emitted from astronomical sources and various background components using physics first principles. This results in emergent image properties that include: differential astrometry and elliptical point spread functions (PSFs) predicted completely to the horizon, arcminute-scale spatial-dependent photometry variations at 20 mmag for short exposures, excess background spatial variations at 0.2% due to the atmosphere, and a PSF wing due to water droplets. We use a common atmosphere representation framework to self-consistently model all phenomena by simulating individual photons. We reproduce the well-known correlations in image characteristics: correlations in altitude with absolute photometry (overall transmission) and relative photometry (spectrally dependent transmission), anticorrelations of altitude with differential astrometry (nonideal astrometric patterns) and background levels, and an anticorrelation in absolute photometry with cloud depth. However, we also find further subtle correlations including an anticorrelation of temperature with background and differential astrometry, a correlation of temperature with absolute and relative photometry, an anticorrelation of absolute photometry with humidity, a correlation of humidity with lunar background, a significant correlation of PSF wing with cloud depth, an anticorrelation of background with cloud depth, and a correlation of lunar background with cloud depth.

We analyze and compare the satellite halo populations at z ∼ 2 in the high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations of a 1012M⊙ target halo (z = 0 mass) carried out on eight widely used astrophysical simulation codes (Art-I, Enzo, Ramses, Changa, Gadget-3, Gear, Arepo-t, and Gizmo) for the AGORA High-resolution Galaxy Simulations Comparison Project. We use slightly different redshift epochs near z = 2 for each code (hereafter “z ∼ 2”) at which the eight simulations are in the same stage in the target halo’s merger history. After identifying the matched pairs of halos between the CosmoRun simulations and the DMO simulations, we discover that each CosmoRun halo tends to be less massive than its DMO counterpart. When we consider only the halos containing stellar particles at z ∼ 2, the number of satellite galaxies is significantly fewer than that of dark matter halos in all participating AGORA simulations and is comparable to the number of present-day satellites near the Milky Way or M31. The so-called “missing satellite problem” is fully resolved across all participating codes simply by implementing the common baryonic physics adopted in AGORA and the stellar feedback prescription commonly used in each code, with sufficient numerical resolution (≲100 proper pc at z = 2). We also compare other properties such as the stellar mass–halo mass relation and the mass–metallicity relation. Our work highlights the value of comparison studies such as AGORA, where outstanding problems in galaxy formation theory are studied simultaneously on multiple numerical platforms.

本研究使用了Newman-Janis算法构建了在f(R) scalaron引力理论中的一个轴对称渐近平坦度量，即Kerr-scalaron度量。通过使用紧凑型恒星轨道和黑洞影子来研究新度量的天文学后果。研究发现，质量在10^-17 - 10^-16 eV范围内的scalaron与观测到的发射环尺寸相符。新度量能够复制S2等星体轨道的Schwarzschild极近点位移，并且scalaron对于小于45天文单位的轨道具有支配性的Schwarzschild进动。新度量下的Lense-Thirring(LT)进动在S2轨道内的幅度为(12.25-24.5) μas yr^-1，并且进动时间尺度与S星体的年龄非常接近。 <div>
Astronomical tests of spacetime metric and gravitation theory near the Galactic center (GC) black hole, Sgr A*, have gained momentum with the observations of compact stellar orbits near the black hole and measurement of the black hole shadow. Deviation from the Kerr metric is a potential signature of modified gravity theory. In this work, we use the Newman–Janis algorithm to construct an axially symmetric and asymptotically flat metric in f(R) scalaron gravity theory. We call it the Kerr-scalaron metric. To study the astronomical consequences of the new metric, we use the compact stellar orbits and the black hole shadow. We use the observed size of the emission ring of the GC black hole shadow for estimating the deviation of the new metric from general relativity. It has been found that scalarons with masses within 10−17–10−16 eV are compatible with the observed emission ring size for a black hole spin of χ = 0.9. The Schwarzschild limit of the pericenter shift is estimated for compact stellar orbits near the black hole. General relativistic pericenter shift in wider orbits, including S stars such as S4716 and S2, has been reproduced with these scalarons. The parameter fSP measuring the deviation from Schwarzschild pericenter shift has been found to be fSP = 1.00–1.04 within stellar orbits with semimajor axes of 45–100 au. Scalarons have the capability to dominate Schwarzschild precession for orbits with semimajor axes much smaller than 45 au. Lense–Thirring (LT) precession with the new metric is estimated for the compact orbits. The massive scalarons produce LT precession with magnitude (12.25–24.5) μas yr−1 in the orbit of S2. The LT precession timescale is within 0.1% of the age of the S stars.

All-sky maps of the thermal Sunyaev–Zel’dovich effect (SZ) tend to suffer from systematic features arising from the component-separation techniques used to extract the signal. In this work, we investigate one of these methods, known as needlet internal linear combination (NILC), and test its performance on simulated data. We show that NILC estimates are strongly affected by the choice of the spatial localization parameter (Γ), which controls a bias-variance trade-off. Typically, NILC extractions assume a fixed value of Γ over the entire sky, but we show there exists an optimal Γ that depends on the SZ signal strength and local contamination properties. Then we calculate the NILC solutions for multiple values of Γ and feed the results into a neural network to predict the SZ signal. This extraction method, which we call Deep-NILC, is tested against a set of validation data, including recovered radial profiles of resolved systems. Our main result is that Deep-NILC offers significant improvements over choosing fixed values of Γ.

The ‘Alopeke data reveal no significant optical detections at the FRB position and we place 3σ upper limits to the optical fluences of <8.3 × 10−3 and <7.7 × 10−3 Jy ms after correcting for line-of-sight extinction. Together, these yield the most sensitive limits to the optical-to-radio fluence ratio of an FRB on these timescales with ην < 3 × 10−3 by roughly an order of magnitude. These measurements rule out progenitor models where FRB 20180916B has a similar fluence ratio to optical pulsars, such as the Crab pulsar, or where optical emission is produced as inverse-Compton radiation in a pulsar magnetosphere or young supernova remnant. Our ongoing program with ‘Alopeke on Gemini-North will continue to monitor repeating FRBs, including FRB 20180916B, to search for optical counterparts on millisecond timescales.

<div> 分析, 星系, 分子气体, 星形成, 抑制
<br /><br />总结:
本研究调查了星系从星系主序到被动状态时分子气体和星形成特性的变化。研究发现随着星系从主序向绿谷过渡，比较于主序星系，特定星形成率表面密度（ΣsSFR）的径向分布在1.5 Re的星系中心半径范围内被抑制。通过结合气体分数（fgas）和星形成效率（SFE）的径向分布，我们可以识别出确定不同星系中ΣsSFR的潜在机制。分析fgas和SFE对ΣsSFR的相对贡献揭示了多种抑制模式。大约一半的抑制星系的星形成主要受单一模式（即fgas或SFE）或两者的组合驱动。对所有星系的集体分析显示，在中心区域（R < 0.5 Re）内的星形成减少主要归因于SFE的下降。相反，在盘区域（R > 0.5 Re），fgas和SFE都对星形成的抑制有所贡献。我们的发现表明在我们的样本星系中可能存在多种抑制机制，甚至在单个星系内也是如此。我们还将我们的观测结果与星系模拟进行了比较，并讨论了我们数据的影响。 <div>
Star formation quenching is one of the key processes that shape the evolution of galaxies. In this study, we investigate the changes in molecular gas and star formation properties as galaxies transit from the star-forming main sequence to the passive regime. Our analysis reveals that as galaxies move away from the main sequence toward the green valley the radial profile of specific star formation rate surface density (ΣsSFR) is suppressed compared with main-sequence galaxies out to a galactocentric radius of 1.5 Re(∼7 kpc for our sample). By combining radial profiles of gas fraction (fgas) and star formation efficiency (SFE), we can discern the underlying mechanism that determines ΣsSFR at different galactocentric radii. Analysis of relative contributions of fgas and SFE to ΣsSFR uncovers a diverse range of quenching modes. Star formation in approximately half of our quenching galaxies is primarily driven by a single mode (i.e., either fgas or SFE), or a combination of both. A collective analysis of all galaxies reveals that the reduction in star formation within the central regions (R < 0.5 Re) is primarily attributable to a decrease in SFE. Conversely, in the disk regions (R > 0.5 Re), both fgas and SFE contribute to the suppression of star formation. Our findings suggest that multiple quenching mechanisms may be at play in our sample galaxies, and even within a single galaxy. We also compare our observational outcomes with those from galaxy simulations and discuss the implications of our data.

<title>Dense Core Collisions in Molecular Clouds: Formation of Streamers and Binary Stars</title>

Dense core collisions, previously regarded as minor in star formation, are proposed to play a significant role in structure formation around protostellar envelopes and binary formation. Using archival data of nearby star-forming regions, we determine the frequencies of core collisions. Our calculations reveal that a typical core is likely to undergo multiple interactions with other cores throughout its lifetime. To further investigate the core collision process, we employ adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamic simulations with sink particles. Our simulations demonstrate that following the formation of a protostar within a gravitationally unstable core, the merging core’s accreting gas gives rise to a rotationally supported circumstellar disk. Meanwhile, the region compressed by the shock between the cores develops into asymmetric arms that connect with the disk. Gas along these arms tends to migrate inward, ultimately falling toward the protostar. One of the arms, a remnant of the shock-compressed region, dominates over the second core gas, potentially exhibiting a distinct chemical composition. This is consistent with recent findings of large-scale streamers around protostars. Additionally, we found that collisions with velocities of ∼1.5 km s−1 result in the formation of a binary system, as evidenced by the emergence of a sink particle within the dense section of the shocked layer. Overall, dense core collisions are highlighted as a critical process in creating 103 au-scale streamers around protostellar systems and binary stars.

<title>Characterizing the Gamma-Ray Emission Properties of the Globular Cluster M5 with the Fermi-LAT</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We analyzed the globular cluster M5 (NGC 5904) using 15 yr of gamma-ray data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). Using rotation ephemerides generated from Arecibo and FAST radio telescope observations, we searched for gamma-ray pulsations from the seven millisecond pulsars (MSPs) identified in M5. We detected no significant pulsations from any of the individual pulsars. In addition, we searched for possible variations of the gamma-ray emission as a function of orbital phase for all six MSPs in binary systems, but we did not detect any significant modulations. The gamma-ray emission from the direction of M5 is well described by an exponentially cutoff power-law spectral model, although other models cannot be excluded. The phase-averaged emission is consistent with being steady on a timescale of a few months. We estimate the number of MSPs in M5 to be between 1 and 10, using the gamma-ray conversion efficiencies for well-characterized gamma-ray MSPs in the Third Fermi-LAT Catalog of Gamma-ray Pulsars, suggesting that the sample of known MSPs in M5 is (nearly) complete, even if it is not currently possible to rule out a diffuse component of the observed gamma rays from the cluster.

<div> pulsar binaries, multiband emission, broadband spectral energy distributions, intrabinary shock, gamma-ray emission
<br />总结:
本研究调查了脉冲星双星系统XSS J12270−4859、PSR J2039−5617和PSR J2339−0533的多波段发射，这些系统在X射线和伽马射线波段中表现出轨道调制。我们通过补充X射线测量结果与已发表的伽马射线结果，构建了源的宽带光谱能量分布和多波段轨道光变曲线，并使用了脉内冲击（IBS）情景模拟了这些数据。虽然X射线数据可通过IBS中电子/正电子的同步辐射来解释，但伽马射线数据却难以仅用IBS组分解释。因此，我们探讨了其他已被提出的脉冲星双星系统中伽马射线发射的情景：（1）上游未冲击的风区的逆康普顿发射和（2）与伴星千高斯磁场相互作用的电子/正电子的同步辐射。情景（1）要求风的整体运动在到达IBS之前显著减速至∼1000 km s−1，以增加停留时间，在这种情况下形成强激波是不可行的，与X射线现象学不一致。情景（2）可以解释数据，如果我们假设具有Lorentz因子∼ 108（∼0.1 PeV）的电子/正电子通过IBS并利用大部分脉冲星电压降。这些发现提出了脉冲星双星系统轨道调制的伽马射线信号可能为我们提供关于脉冲星风流结构和能量转化、以及脉冲星附近近PeV能量的粒子加速的见解。这些信号还可能增进我们对这些系统中低质量恒星可能拥有千高斯磁场的理解。 <div>
We investigated the multiband emission from the pulsar binaries XSS J12270−4859, PSR J2039−5617, and PSR J2339−0533, which exhibit orbital modulation in the X-ray and gamma-ray bands. We constructed the sources’ broadband spectral energy distributions and multiband orbital light curves by supplementing our X-ray measurements with published gamma-ray results, and we modeled the data using intrabinary shock (IBS) scenarios. While the X-ray data were well explained by synchrotron emission from electrons/positrons in the IBS, the gamma-ray data were difficult to explain with the IBS components alone. Therefore, we explored other scenarios that had been suggested for gamma-ray emission from pulsar binaries: (1) inverse-Compton emission in the upstream unshocked wind zone and (2) synchrotron radiation from electrons/positrons interacting with the kilogauss magnetic field of the companion. Scenario (1) requires that the bulk motion of the wind substantially decelerates to ∼1000 km s−1 before reaching the IBS for increased residence time, in which case the formation of a strong shock is untenable, inconsistent with the X-ray phenomenology. Scenario (2) can explain the data if we assume the presence of electrons/positrons with a Lorentz factor ∼ 108 (∼0.1 PeV) that pass through the IBS and tap a substantial portion of the pulsar voltage drop. These findings raise the possibility that the orbitally modulating gamma-ray signals from pulsar binaries can provide insights into the flow structure and energy conversion within pulsar winds and particle acceleration nearing PeV energies in pulsars. These signals may also yield greater understanding of kilogauss magnetic fields potentially hosted by the low-mass stars in these systems.

<div> Gaia Data Release 3, astrometry, spectroscopy, Shakti, Shiva
<br />
这篇文章使用Gaia Data Release 3的天体测量和光谱学数据研究了银河系内部的轨道-金属丰度空间中的两个新的亚结构：Shakti和Shiva。
Shakti和Shiva被识别为明亮（G < 16）且金属贫（-2.5 < [M/H] < -1.0）恒星(Lz, E)分布中的两个受限制的、高对比度的过密现象。
它们的恒星质量都大于107M⊙，并分布在银河内太阳圈内的顺行轨道上。
这两个结构在轨道空间分布上表明它们可能来自于外部的来源；然而，它们成员的丰度模式（来自于APOGEE）更像是被认为是原地形成的。
上述较矛盾的特征可以通过解释成员恒星的丰度[Mg/Fe]、[Al/Fe]、[Mg/Mn]相对于[Fe/H]的分布仅仅是快速富集的迹象来进行调和。
这可能暗示了两种可能的情景：Shakti和Shiva是由转动的巴尔对位场星体的某种方式共振轨道捕获而形成的。
或者，Shakti和Shiva是原星系的碎片，快速形成恒星并早期聚合，类似于银河系贫弱的旧核心天体，只不过在银河潜在场中更浅，并且在轨道空间中仍然可辨。

Using Gaia Data Release 3 astrometry and spectroscopy, we study two new substructures in the orbit–metallicity space of the inner Milky Way: Shakti and Shiva. They were identified as two confined, high-contrast overdensities in the (Lz, E) distribution of bright (G < 16) and metal-poor (−2.5 < [M/H] < − 1.0) stars. Both have stellar masses of M⋆ ≳ 107M⊙, and are distributed on prograde orbits inside the solar circle in the Galaxy. Both structures have an orbit-space distribution that points toward an accreted origin; however, their abundance patterns—from APOGEE—are such that are conventionally attributed to an in situ population. These seemingly contradictory diagnostics could be reconciled if we interpret the abundances [Mg/Fe], [Al/Fe], [Mg/Mn] versus [Fe/H] distribution of their member stars merely as a sign of rapid enrichment. This would then suggest one of two scenarios. Either these prograde substructures were created by some form of resonant orbit trapping of the field stars by the rotating bar; a plausible scenario proposed by Dillamore et al. Or, Shakti and Shiva were protogalactic fragments that formed stars rapidly and coalesced early, akin to the constituents of the poor old heart of the Milky Way, just less deep in the Galactic potential and still discernible in orbit space.

<div> 关键词: 星形成, 外流, 磁流体力学, 磁场, 类零星等

总结: <br /><br />这篇文章研究了外流在星形成过程中的重要性，通过高分辨率的三维嵌套网格非理想磁流体力学模拟，发现外流主要来自磁假盘，而不是来自扩展的离心盘。部分磁假盘的气体流向上升，在某些区域被磁压梯度力驱动，而在其他区域则表现出磁离心力的特征。这一外流区域的结构和动力学特性可以用重力、角动量、磁场和非理想磁流体力学的基本物理理论来解释。 <div>
Outflows play a pivotal role in star formation as one of its most visible markers and a means of transporting mass, momentum, and angular momentum from the infalling gas into the surrounding molecular cloud. Their wide reach (at least thousands of astrnomical units) is a contrast to typical disk sizes (∼10–100 au). We employ high-resolution three-dimensional nested-grid nonideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations to study outflow properties in the Class 0 phase. We find that no disk wind is driven from the extended centrifugal disk that has weak magnetic coupling. The low-velocity winds emerge instead from the infalling magnetic pseudodisk. Much of the disk actually experiences an infall of matter rather than outflowing gas. Some of the pseudodisk wind (PD-wind) moves inward to regions above the disk and either falls onto the disk or proceeds upward. The upward flow gives the impression of a disk wind above a certain height even if the gas is originally emerging from the pseudodisk. The PD-wind has the strongest flow coming from a disk interaction zone that lies just outside the disk and is an interface between the inwardly advected magnetic field of the pseudodisk and the outwardly diffusing magnetic field of the disk. The low-velocity wind exhibits the features of a flow driven by the magnetic pressure gradient force in some regions and those of a magnetocentrifugal wind in other regions. We interpret the structure and dynamics of the outflow zone in terms of the basic physics of gravity, angular momentum, magnetic fields, and nonideal MHD.

总结:
太阳磁场包括闭合和开放场线，物理模型估计的开放磁通量与实际观测存在显著差异，尤其是在太阳活动最大时期。利用EUV或氦I观测的开放磁通量估计与物理模型结果一致，但与实测存在争议。本文指出差异源自开闭边界的动态。研究结果表明，靠近活跃区和中纬度极冠洞边界的强磁场是开放磁通量缺失的主要来源。这些结果解决了开放磁通量问题中的矛盾。 <div>
The solar magnetic fields emerging from the photosphere into the chromosphere and corona are comprised of a combination of closed (field lines with both ends rooted at the Sun) and open (field lines with only one end at the Sun) fields. Since the early 2000s, the magnitude of total unsigned open magnetic flux estimated by coronal models has been in significant disagreement with in situ spacecraft observations, especially during solar maximum. Estimates of total open unsigned magnetic flux using coronal hole observations (e.g., using extreme ultraviolet or helium (He) I) are in general, in average agreement with the coronal model results and thus show similar disagreements with in situ observations. This paper provides a brief overview of the problem, summarizes the proposed explanations for the discrepancies, and presents results that strongly support the explanation that the discrepancy is due to dynamics at the open-closed boundary. These results are derived from the determination of the total unsigned open magnetic flux, utilizing the Wang–Sheeley–Arge model at a particular spatial resolution and different field-line tracing methods. One of these methods produces excellent agreement with in situ observations. Our results imply that strong magnetic fields in close proximity to active regions and residing near the boundaries of mid-latitude coronal holes are the primary source of the missing open flux. Furthermore, the results outlined here resolve many of the seemingly contradictory facts that have made the open-flux problem so difficult.

We measure the bolometric luminosity of a complete and unbiased 12 μm-selected sample of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the local Universe. For each galaxy, we used a 10-band radio-to-X-ray spectral energy distribution (SED) to isolate the genuine AGN continuum in each band, including subarcsecond measurements where available, and correcting those contaminated by the host galaxy. We derive the median SED of Seyfert type 1 AGN, Seyferts with hidden broad lines (HBLs), Seyferts of type 2, and LINER nuclei in our sample. The median Seyfert 1 SED shows the characteristic blue bump feature in the UV, but nevertheless, the largest contribution to the bolometric luminosity comes from the IR and X-ray continua. The median SEDs of both HBL and type 2 AGN are affected by starlight contamination in the optical/UV. The median SED of HBL AGN is consistent with that of Seyfert 1s, when an extinction of AV ∼ 1.2 mag is applied. The comprehensive SEDs allowed us to measure accurate bolometric luminosities and derive robust bolometric corrections for the different tracers. The 12 μm and K-band nuclear luminosities have good linear correlations with the bolometric luminosity, similar to those in the X-rays. We derive bolometric corrections for either continuum bands (K band, 12 μm, 2–10 keV, and 14–195 keV) or narrow emission lines (mid-IR high-ionization lines of [O iv] and [Ne v] and optical [O iii] 5007 Å) as well as for combinations of IR continuum and line emission. A combination of continuum plus line emission accurately predicts the bolometric luminosity up to quasar luminosities (∼1046 erg s−1).

Solar energetic particle (SEP) events have been observed by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) spacecraft since its launch in 2018. These events include sources from solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The IS⊙IS instrument suite on board PSP is measuring ions over energies from ∼ 20 keV nucleon−1 to 200 MeV nucleon−1 and electrons from ∼ 20 keV to 6 MeV. Previous studies sought to group CME characteristics based on their plasma conditions and arrived at general descriptions with large statistical errors, leaving open questions on how to properly group CMEs based solely on their plasma conditions. To help resolve these open questions, the plasma properties of CMEs have been examined in relation to SEPs. Here, we reexamine one plasma property, the solar wind proton temperature, and compare it to the proton SEP intensity in a region immediately downstream of a CME-driven shock for seven CMEs observed at radial distances within 1 au. We find a statistically strong correlation between proton SEP intensity and bulk proton temperature, indicating a clear relationship between SEPs and the conditions in the solar wind. Furthermore, we propose that an indirect coupling of SEP intensity to the level of turbulence and the amount of energy dissipation that results is mainly responsible for the observed correlation between SEP intensity and proton temperature. These results are key to understanding the interaction of SEPs with the bulk solar wind in CME-driven shocks and will improve our ability to model the interplay of shock evolution and particle acceleration.

Photonic lanterns (PLs) are tapered waveguides that gradually transition from a multimode fiber geometry to a bundle of single-mode fibers (SMFs). They can efficiently couple multimode telescope light into a multimode fiber entrance at the focal plane and convert it into multiple single-mode beams. Thus, each SMF samples its unique mode (lantern principal mode) of the telescope light in the pupil, analogous to subapertures in aperture masking interferometry (AMI). Coherent imaging with PLs can be enabled by the interference of SMF outputs and applying phase modulation, which can be achieved using a photonic chip beam combiner at the backend (e.g., the ABCD beam combiner). In this study, we investigate the potential of coherent imaging by the interference of SMF outputs of a PL with a single telescope. We demonstrate that the visibilities that can be measured from a PL are mutual intensities incident on the pupil weighted by the cross correlation of a pair of lantern modes. From numerically simulated lantern principal modes of a 6-port PL, we find that interferometric observables using a PL behave similarly to separated-aperture visibilities for simple models on small angular scales (<λ/D) but with greater sensitivity to symmetries and capability to break phase angle degeneracies. Furthermore, we present simulated observations with wave front errors (WFEs) and compare them to AMI. Despite the redundancy caused by extended lantern principal modes, spatial filtering offers stability to WFEs. Our simulated observations suggest that PLs may offer significant benefits in the photon-noise-limited regime and in resolving small angular scales at the low-contrast regime.

Photospheric faculae are markers of the solar magnetic field, appearing as bright regions along the edges of granules on the Sun’s surface. Using data from the Debrecen Solar Faculae Database, we investigated the spatiotemporal distribution of photospheric faculae between 2010 May 1 and 2014 December 31 and found the following. (i) At lower latitudes, there is an enhanced abundance of faculae appearing as stripes at given Carrington longitudes, which are interpreted as indicative of the presence of active longitudes. (ii) At higher latitudes, we identified so-called crisscross patterns of facular appearance. These patterns are likely the result of faculae in regions situated along the boundaries of supergranules. Last but not least, (iii) various periods of oscillatory phenomena were identified in this facular data set, including a longer periodic range consistent with the quasi-biennial oscillations and shorter ones with periods of 4–12 days. Our findings are supported by the visualization of a simple heuristic thought experiment and more complex dynamo simulations, strengthening the proposed interpretation of the three observed solar phenomena reported.

总结:<br />
研究发现磁场强度对中子星合并残留物的中心引擎有重要影响，不同的磁场强度会导致不同的物质喷射情况，产生不同的r-过程元素丰度模式。对磁场强度的改变也会影响物质喷射的几何形状，暗示着复杂的中心引擎动力学在影响镧系元素的喷射过程。特别是，在actinide产生方面，磁场强度特别敏感，一倍增的磁场强度可能导致1个亿年后残余物中的actinide质量分数增加6倍以上。这可能与金属贫瘠的、r-过程增强型恒星中actinide增强的可变性相关联。 <div>
Magnetohydrodynamic turbulence drives the central engine of post-merger remnants, potentially powering both a nucleosynthetically active disk wind and the relativistic jet behind a short gamma-ray burst. We explore the impact of the magnetic field on this engine by simulating three post-merger black hole accretion disks using general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics with Monte Carlo neutrino transport, in each case varying the initial magnetic field strength. We find increasing ejecta masses associated with increasing magnetic field strength. We find that a fairly robust main r-process pattern is produced in all three cases, scaled by the ejected mass. Changing the initial magnetic field strength has a considerable effect on the geometry of the outflow and hints at complex central engine dynamics influencing lanthanide outflows. We find that actinide production is especially sensitive to magnetic field strength, with the overall actinide mass fraction calculated at 1 Gyr post-merger increasing by more than a factor of 6 with a tenfold increase in magnetic field strength. This hints at a possible connection to the variability in actinide enhancements exhibited by metal-poor, r-process-enhanced stars.

总结: <br />研究发现在mid-K-dwarf ϵ Indi A中检测到了类太阳振荡，使其成为已测量振荡的最冷的矮星。通过两次径向速度观测活动，使用高分辨率光谱仪HARPS（2011）和UVES（2021），计算功率谱并确定在5265±110μHz处存在功率过剩，这是迄今在任何恒星中测量到的最高频率的类太阳振荡。根据比例关系和干涉测量的已知半径，测得了0.782±0.023 M⊙的恒星质量，并确定了峰值功率的幅度。此外，还注意到两次观测活动水平略有差异。这项工作证实了可以在使用高精度光谱仪获得的径向速度测量中检测到mid-K型恒星的低振幅类太阳振荡。 <div>
We have detected solar-like oscillations in the mid-K-dwarf ϵ Indi A, making it the coolest dwarf to have measured oscillations. The star is noteworthy for harboring a pair of brown dwarf companions and a Jupiter-type planet. We observed ϵ Indi A during two radial velocity campaigns, using the high-resolution spectrographs HARPS (2011) and UVES (2021). Weighting the time series, we computed the power spectra and established the detection of solar-like oscillations with a power excess located at 5265 ± 110 μHz—the highest frequency solar-like oscillations so far measured in any star. The measurement of the center of the power excess allows us to compute a stellar mass of 0.782 ± 0.023 M⊙ based on scaling relations and a known radius from interferometry. We also determine the amplitude of the peak power and note that there is a slight difference between the two observing campaigns, indicating a varying activity level. Overall, this work confirms that low-amplitude solar-like oscillations can be detected in mid-K-type stars in radial velocity measurements obtained with high-precision spectrographs.

<div> 太阳，射电爆发，电子密度，紫外成像，日冕环路
<br />
太阳型号J射电爆发是III型爆发的一种变体，可用于理解太阳能电子和局部电子密度。本研究调查了2017年9月9日的J型爆发事件。通过将极紫外成像（EUV）和EUV成像光谱仪（EIS）的数据相结合，来分析该事件。在4分钟内，出现了几次形态相似的J型爆发。我们详细研究了其中两次，发现它们之间的不同谐波频带之间存在2±0.5秒的延迟。在J型爆发期间，只有一个日冕环路的北脚点明显变亮，与不断喷发的喷流连续注入环路的行为相关。明亮脚点的EUV强度与245MHz和410MHz的射电通量呈0.2和0.4的相关系数。这些观察结果表明J型爆发可能起源于这个日冕环路。通过分析从EIS数据诊断的沿着日冕环路的电子数密度分布和从J型爆发计算出的等离子体频率的时间演化，我们确定激发这两次J型爆发的高能电子的速度分别为0.10±0.02c和0.12±0.02c。我们的结果证实了先前对J型爆发的研究。
<br /><br />总结: 本研究通过对2017年9月9日的太阳型号J射电爆发事件进行分析，发现了这种爆发的一些特征和规律。通过对电子密度、紫外强度、射电通量等数据的观察和分析，确定了J型爆发起源和相关的物理过程。这为太阳活动和紫外爆发的研究提供了重要的观测和分析依据。 <div>
The solar type J radio burst is a variant of type III bursts, which are a probe for understanding solar energetic electrons and local electron density. This study investigates a type J burst event on 2017 September 9. We have combined the data from the extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) imaging and the EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) to analyze the event. Within 4 minutes several type J bursts with similar morphology occur. Two of them, with clear fundamental and second harmonic bands, are studied in detail. We find a delay of 2 ± 0.5 s between their different harmonic bands. During type J bursts, only one coronal loop brightens significantly at its northern footpoint, in correlation with the continuous injection of erupting jets into the loop. The EUV intensity of the brightening footpoint is correlated with the radio flux at 245 and 410 MHz, with correlation coefficients of 0.2 and 0.4, respectively. These observations suggest that the type J bursts should originate from this coronal loop. By analyzing the electron number density distribution along the coronal loop diagnosed from the EIS data and the time evolution of the plasma frequency calculated from the type J burst, we determine that the velocities of the energetic electrons exciting the two type Js are 0.10 ± 0.02c and 0.12 ± 0.02c. Our results confirm previous studies on type J bursts.

<title>Anomalous Emission from Li- and Na-like Ions in the Corona Heated via Alfvén Waves</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The solar ultraviolet intensities of spectral lines originating from Li- and Na-like ions have been observed to surpass the expectations derived from plasmas with coronal approximation. The violation of the coronal approximation can be partially attributed to nonequilibrium ionization (NEI) due to dynamic processes occurring in the vicinity of the transition region. To investigate the impact of these dynamics in the Alfvén wave-heated coronal loop, a set of equations governing NEI for multiple ion species was solved numerically in conjunction with 1.5-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic equations. Following the injection of Alfvén waves from the photosphere, the system undergoes a time evolution characterized by phases of evaporation, condensation, and quasi-steady states. During the evaporation phase, the ionization fractions of Li- and Na-like ions were observed to increase when compared to the fractions in ionization equilibrium, which led to an enhancement in the intensity of up to 1.6. This over-fractionation of Li- and Na-like ions was found to be induced by the evaporation process. While collisions between shocks and the transition region temporarily led to deviations from ionization equilibrium, on average over time, these deviations were negligible. Conversely, under-fractions of the ionization fraction led to a reduction in intensity down to 0.9 during the condensation phase and the quasi-steady state. Given the dependency of the over/under-fractionation on mass circulations between the chromosphere and the corona, these observations will serve as valuable benchmarks to validate not only Alfvén wave models but also other existing mechanisms on coronal heating.

The Mg ii k and h line intensity ratios can be used to probe the characteristics of the plasma in the solar atmosphere. In this study, using the observations recorded by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrometer, we study the variation of the Mg ii k and h intensity ratio for three flares belonging to X-class, M-class, and C-class, throughout their evolution. We also study the k-to-h intensity ratio as a function of magnetic flux density obtained from the line-of-sight magnetograms recorded by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory. Our results reveal that, while the intensity ratios are independent of magnetic flux density, they show significant changes during the evolution of the C-class and M-class flares. The intensity ratios start to increase at the start of the flare and peak during the impulsive phase before the flare peak and decrease rapidly thereafter. The values of the ratios fall even below the preflare level during the peak and decline phases of the flare. These results are important in light of heating and cooling of localized plasma and provide further constraint on the understanding of flare physics.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We discuss the possibility of enhancing intelligent life searches toward the Galactic center. From the clockwork orbital motions of stars around the Sgr A* black hole, we can determine the distance to the Galactic center at an exceptional accuracy, despite its remoteness ∼8.3 kpc. In addition, we can define precise reference epochs by selecting a prominent object such as the bright B-type star S2. These properties have a particular affinity for the coordinated signaling scheme that was hypothesized by Seto for systematically connecting intentional senders to searchers without a prior communication. If S2 is actually being used as a common reference clock, we can compress the search directions around the Galactic center by more than 2 orders of magnitude, with the scanning interval of ∼16 yr.

We present a UV to millimeter spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis of 16 hyperluminous, dust-obscured quasars at z ∼ 3, selected by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. We aim to investigate the physical properties of these quasars, with a focus on their molecular gas content. We decompose the SEDs into three components: stellar, cold dust, and active galactic nucleus (AGN). By doing so, we are able to derive and analyze the relevant properties of each component. We determine the molecular gas mass from CO line emission based on Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations. By including ALMA observations in the multiwavelength SED analysis, we derive the molecular gas fractions, gas depletion timescales, and star formation efficiencies (SFEs). Their sample median and 16th–84th quartile ranges are , tdepl ∼ Myr, and SFE ∼ K km s−1 pc−2, respectively. Compared to main-sequence galaxies, they have lower molecular gas content and higher SFEs, similar to quasars in the literature. This suggests that the gas in these quasars is rapidly depleted, likely as the result of intense starburst activity and AGN feedback. The observed correlations between these properties and the AGN luminosities further support this scenario. Additionally, we infer the black hole to stellar mass ratio and black hole mass growth rate, which indicate significant central black hole mass assembly over short timescales. Our results are consistent with the scenario that our sample represents a short transition phase toward unobscured quasars.

State-of-the-art surveys reveal that most massive stars in the Universe evolve in close binaries. Massive stars in such systems are expected to develop aspherical envelopes due to tidal interactions and/or rotational effects. Recently, it was shown that point explosions in oblate stars can produce relativistic equatorial ring-like outflows. Moreover, since stripped-envelope stars in binaries can expand enough to fill their Roche lobes anew, it is likely that these stars die with a greater degree of asphericity than the oblate spheroid geometry previously studied. We investigate the effects of this asymmetry by studying the gas dynamics of axisymmetric point explosions in stars in various stages of filling their Roche lobes. We find that point explosions in these pear-shaped stars produce transrelativistic ejecta that coalesce into bullets pointed both toward and away from the binary companion. We present this result and comment on key morphological differences between core-collapse explosions in spherical versus distorted stars in binary systems, effects on gravitational wave sources, and observational signatures that could be used to glean these explosion geometries from current and future surveys.

总结:<br /><br />该研究利用Gaia Data Release 3的数据结合LAMOST光谱调查，发现了三个可能包含紧凑天体的宽双星系统。其中两个系统的光谱显示主序伴星，没有额外的成分，因此推测其中存在紧凑天体。第三个系统的可见星是一个被剥夺了外部气层的巨星，但光谱中未观测到发射线。该系统可能含有一个大质量的白矮星或中子星，但不能排除是F型矮星的可能性。此外，对包含白矮星或中子星的大约10个双星系统进行的运动学和化学分析表明，这些系统大多位于银河系的薄盘内。 <div>
The Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) mission has identified and provided about 440,000 binary systems with orbital solutions, offering a valuable resource for searching binaries including a compact component. By combining the Gaia DR3 data with radial velocities from the LAMOST spectroscopic survey, we identify three wide binaries possibly containing a compact object. For two of these sources with a main-sequence companion, no obvious excess is observed in the blue/red band of the Gaia DR3 XP spectra, and the LAMOST medium-resolution spectra exhibit clear single-lined features. The absence of an additional component from spectral disentangling analysis further suggests the presence of compact objects within these systems. On the other hand, the visible star of the third source is a stripped giant star. In contrast to most binaries including stripped stars, no emission line is detected in the optical spectra. The unseen star could potentially be a massive white dwarf or neutron star, but the possibility of an F-type dwarf star scenario cannot be ruled out. An examination of about 10 binaries containing white dwarfs or neutron stars using both kinematic and chemical methods suggests most of these systems are located in the thin disk of the Milky Way.

The solar wind electrons carry a significant heat flux into the heliosphere. The weakly collisional state of the solar wind implicates collisionless processes as the primary factor that constrains nonthermal features of the velocity distribution function (VDF), including the heat flux. Previous observational work suggests that the electron VDF sometimes becomes unstable to the whistler wave, but reliance on model VDFs (e.g., drifting bi-Maxwellians) has proven insufficient for an exact description of the behavior of the solar wind electrons—in particular, the regulation of the heat flux. The characterization of these processes requires methods to obtain fine details of the VDF and quantification of the impact of kinetic processes on the VDF. We employ measurements of the electron VDF by Solar Orbiter’s Solar Wind Analyser and of the magnetic field by the Radio and Plasma Waves instrument to study an unstable solar wind electron configuration. Through a Hermite–Laguerre expansion of the VDF, we implement a low-pass filter in velocity space to remove velocity space noise and obtain a VDF suitable for analysis. With our method, we directly measure the instability growth rate and the rate of change of the electron heat flux through wave–particle interactions.

总结: 
本文使用数值磁流体动力学（MHD）模拟和TIGRESS模拟星系盘，研究了宇宙射线（CRs）与多相星际介质（ISM）之间的动态相互作用。研究发现CRs在多相ISM气体中的传输存在三种不同的情况，并且“活跃MHD”模拟预测CR压力分布更加平滑。CR压力在中平面附近与其他气体压力组分相当，但CR的尺度高度要大得多。除此之外，研究还发现CRs对于快速热流出流几乎没有影响，但对于大部分温暖/温热气体的外平面材料都能高效加速。总的来说，本研究有助于理解CRs在驱动星系流出流中的作用。 <br /><br /> <div>
We investigate the dynamical interaction between cosmic rays (CRs) and the multiphase interstellar medium (ISM) using numerical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations with a two-moment CR solver and TIGRESS simulations of star-forming galactic disks. We previously studied the transport of CRs within TIGRESS outputs using a “postprocessing” approach, and we now assess the effects of the MHD backreaction to CR pressure. We confirm our previous conclusion that there are three quite different regimes of CR transport in multiphase ISM gas, while also finding that simulations with “live MHD” predict a smoother CR pressure distribution. The CR pressure near the midplane is comparable to other pressure components in the gas, but the scale height of CRs is far larger. Next, with a goal of understanding the role of CRs in driving galactic outflows, we conduct a set of controlled simulations of the extraplanar region above z = 500 pc, with imposed boundary conditions flowing from the midplane into this region. We explore a range of thermal and kinematic properties for the injected thermal gas, encompassing both hot, fast-moving outflows, and cooler, slower-moving outflows. The boundary conditions for CR energy density and flux are scaled from the supernova rate in the underlying TIGRESS model. Our simulations reveal that CRs efficiently accelerate extraplanar material if the latter is mostly warm/warm-hot gas, in which CRs stream at the Alfvén speed, and the effective sound speed increases as density decreases. In contrast, CRs have very little effect on fast, hot outflows where the Alfvén speed is small, even when the injected CR momentum flux exceeds the injected MHD momentum flux.

<div> Blazars, radio emissions, VLASS, algorithm, classification
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章介绍了一种基于VLASS图像形态学的算法来对射电源进行类别划分，识别它们是否为类星体。研究表明，在三个已有的目录中，有超过12%的候选对象不太可能是类星体，而其中3%的Roma-BzCAT确认的类星体在VLASS形态学上被划分错误。对所有资源及其射电形态分类的结果表可在网上查阅。 <div>
Blazars are radio-loud active galactic nuclei whose jets have a very small angle to our line of sight. Observationally, the radio emissions are mostly compact or compact-core with a one-sided jet. With 2.″5 resolution at 3 GHz, the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) enables us to resolve the structure of some blazar candidates in the sky north of decl. −40°. We introduce an algorithm to classify radio sources as either blazar-like or non-blazar-like based on their morphology in the VLASS images. We apply our algorithm to three existing catalogs, including one of the known blazars (Roma-BzCAT) and two blazar candidates identified by Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer colors and radio emission (WIBRaLS, KDEBLLACS). We show that in all three catalogs, there are objects with morphologies inconsistent with being blazars. Considering all the catalogs, more than 12% of the candidates are unlikely to be blazars, based on this analysis. Notably, we show that 3% of the Roma-BzCAT confirmed blazars could be a misclassification based on their VLASS morphology. The resulting table with all sources and their radio morphological classification is available online.

<div> 高能粒子，太阳耀斑，模拟，波动，加热<br />
总结:<br />
研究使用粒子在细胞模拟中产生的高能质子和α粒子引发的波浪。初始分布函数包括两个群体：一个由各向异性（T∥ > T⊥）的一侧kappa函数表示的高能流动群体和一个冷的Maxwellian背景群体。这些分布的非等向性和非零热流不稳定化了在质子回旋频率以下的一系列频率的斜波。这些波将粒子散射到在波浪框架中的恒定能量面上的初始分布的尾部。非线性谐振宽度的重叠使得粒子在模拟结束时散射成近各向同性的分布。使用测试粒子探索了3He的动态。它们的温度可以增加近20倍。这样的波动传播到耀斑地点上下的区域可能会导致3He的加热和转运到耀斑加速区域。加热的3He会被传送到耀斑地点的数量与波能成比例。使用我们模拟的值，我们表明加热的3He将驱动到加速区域的丰度应接近太阳冕中的4He。因此，耀斑产生的高能离子所产生的波是驱动在突发性耀斑中观测到的3He增强的一个强有力的候选者。 <div>
The waves generated by high-energy proton and alpha particles streaming from solar flares into regions of colder plasma are explored using particle-in-cell simulations. Initial distribution functions for the protons and alphas consist of two populations: an energetic, streaming population represented by an anisotropic (T∥ > T⊥), one-sided kappa function and a cold, Maxwellian background population. The anisotropies and nonzero heat fluxes of these distributions destabilize oblique waves with a range of frequencies below the proton cyclotron frequency. These waves scatter particles out of the tails of the initial distributions along constant-energy surfaces in the wave frame. Overlap of the nonlinear resonance widths allows particles to scatter into near-isotropic distributions by the end of the simulations. The dynamics of 3He are explored using test particles. Their temperatures can increase by a factor of nearly 20. Propagation of such waves into regions above and below the flare site can lead to heating and transport of 3He into the flare acceleration region. The amount of heated 3He that will be driven into the flare site is proportional to the wave energy. Using values from our simulations, we show that the abundance of 3He driven into the acceleration region should approach that of 4He in the corona. Therefore, waves driven by energetic ions produced in flares are a strong candidate to drive the enhancements of 3He observed in impulsive flares.

We report the first high-resolution, detailed abundances of 21 elements for giants in the Galactic bulge/bar within 1° of the Galactic plane, where high extinction has rendered such studies challenging. Our high-signal-to-noise-ratio and high-resolution, near-infrared spectra of seven M giants in the inner bulge, located at (l, b) = (0°, +1°), are observed using the IGRINS spectrograph. We report the first multichemical study of the inner Galactic bulge by investigating, relative to a robust new solar neighborhood sample, the abundance trends of 21 elements, including the relatively difficult to study heavy elements. The elements studied are: F, Mg, Si, S, Ca, Na, Al, K, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Y, Ce, Nd, and Yb. We investigate bulge membership of all seven stars using distances and orbital simulations, and we find that the most metal-poor star may be a halo interloper. Our investigation also shows that the inner bulge as close as 1° north of the Galactic Center displays a similarity to the inner disk sequence, following the high-[α/Fe] envelope of the solar vicinity metal-rich population, though no firm conclusions for a different enrichment history are evident from this sample. We find a small fraction of metal-poor stars ([Fe/H] > −0.5), but most of our stars are mainly of supersolar metallicity. Fluorine is found to be enhanced at high metallicity compared to the solar neighborhood, but confirmation with a larger sample is required. We will apply this approach to explore the populations of the nuclear stellar disk and the nuclear star cluster.

<div> 星系，金属丰度，星形成历史，气体动力学，辐射梯度
总结:<br /><br />这项研究探索了238个星形成星系在0.6 < z < 2.6红移范围内的气体金属丰度梯度与多种星系性质之间的关系。研究发现金属丰度梯度与大多数星系性质几乎没有相关性，包括质量加权年龄、最近星形成率、尘埃衰减和形态学。然而，金属丰度梯度与“演化时间”之间存在显著但适度的相关性，演化较为成熟的星系展现出较平缓的梯度。此外，有证据表明，具有多次星形成事件的星系倾向于形成更负的气体金属丰度梯度。研究总结认为，气体动力学，例如径向流入和流出，可能是设定气体金属丰度梯度的重要过程，除了星形成历史的演变。由于梯度在很大程度上独立于星系的物理性质，并且仅在一定程度上取决于它们的星形成历史，这说明了气体动力学的时间尺度明显短于星形成的演化过程。 <div>
We explore the relationships between the [O/H] gas-phase metallicity radial gradients and multiple galaxy properties for 238 star-forming galaxies at 0.6 < z < 2.6 selected from the CANDELS Lyα Emission at Reionization survey with stellar mass . The gradients cover the range from −0.11 to 0.22 dex kpc−1, with the median value close to 0. We reconstruct the nonparametric star formation histories (SFHs) of the galaxies with spectral energy distribution modeling using Prospector with more than 40 photometric bands from the Hubble Space Telescope, Spitzer, and ground-based facilities. In general, we find weak or no correlations between the metallicity gradients and most galaxy properties, including the mass-weighted age, recent star formation rate, dust attenuation, and morphology as quantified by both parametric and nonparametric diagnostics. We find a significant but moderate correlation between the gradients and the “evolutionary time,” a temporal metric that characterizes the evolutionary status of a galaxy, with flatter gradients observed in more evolved galaxies. Also, there is evidence that galaxies with multiple star formation episodes in their SFHs tend to develop more negative gas-phase metallicity gradients (higher [O/H] at the center). We conclude that gas kinematics, e.g., radial inflows and outflows, is likely an important process in setting the gas-phase metallicity gradients, in addition to the evolution of the SFH radial profile. Since the gradients are largely independent of the galaxies’ physical properties and only weakly dependent on their SFH, it would appear that the timescale of the gas kinematics is significantly shorter than the evolution of star formation.

We identify a molecular bubble, and study the star formation and its feedback in the S Mon region, using multiple molecular lines, young stellar objects (YSOs), and infrared data. We revisit the distance to S Mon, ∼722 ± 9 pc, using Gaia Data Release 3 parallaxes of the associated Class II YSOs. The bubble may be mainly driven by a massive binary system (namely 15 Mon), the primary of which is an O7V-type star. An outflow is detected in the shell of the bubble, suggesting ongoing star formation activities in the vicinity of the bubble. The total wind energy of the massive binary star is 3 orders of magnitude higher than the sum of the observed turbulent energy in the molecular gas and the kinetic energy of the bubble, indicating that stellar winds help to maintain the turbulence in the S Mon region and drive the bubble. We conclude that the stellar winds of massive stars have an impact on their surrounding environment.

For the first time the evolution of the coronal reconfiguration after a coronal mass ejection (CME) was observed by the multichannel Metis Coronagraph on board the ESA–Solar Orbiter mission. The images acquired in visible light (VL) between 3.0 and 5.4 R⊙ show the formation after a CME of a bright elongated radial feature interpreted as a post-CME current sheet (CS). The unique combination of VL and UV images allowed the time evolution of multiple plasma physical parameters inside and outside the CS region to be mapped in 2D for the first time. The CS electron temperature reached peak values higher than 1 MK, more than twice as high as the surrounding corona. An elongated vertical diffusion region, characterized as a region of much higher thermal pressure and lower magnetic pressure, is observed to slowly propagate outward during 13 hr of observations. Inside this region the Alfvénic Mach number is of the order of MA ≃ 0.02–0.11, the plasma β is close to unity, and the level of turbulence is higher than in the surrounding corona, but decreases slowly with time. All these results provide one of the most complete pictures of these features, and support the idea of a magnetic reconnection coupled with turbulence, thus allowing significant heating of the local plasma, despite the weakness of involved coronal magnetic fields in the considered altitude range.

<title>How Population III Supernovae Determined the Properties of the First Galaxies</title>

Massive Population III stars can die as energetic supernovae that enrich the early Universe with metals and determine the properties of the first galaxies. With masses of about 109M⊙ at z ≳ 10, these galaxies are believed to be the ancestors of the Milky Way. This paper investigates the impact of Population III supernova remnants (SNRs) from both Salpeter-like and top-heavy initial mass functions (IMFs) on the formation of first galaxies with high-resolution radiation-hydrodynamical simulations with the ENZO code. Our findings indicate that SNRs from a top-heavy Population III IMF produce more metals, leading to more efficient gas cooling and earlier Population II star formation in the first galaxies. From a few hundred to a few thousand Population II stars can form in the central regions of these galaxies. These stars have metallicities of 10−3–10−2, Z⊙, greater than those of extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars. Their mass function follows a power-law distribution with , where M* is stellar mass, and α = 2.66–5.83 and is steeper for a top-heavy IMF. We thus find that EMP stars were not typical of most primitive galaxies.

<title>Undermassive Host Galaxies of Five z ∼ 6 Luminous Quasars Detected with JWST</title>

We measure host galaxy stellar masses for a sample of five luminous quasars at z ∼ 5–7. Using JWST/NIRCam medium-band images of nearby point-spread function reference stars, we carefully subtract the contribution from the quasar light to place upper and lower limits on the flux of each host galaxy. We find that the members of our sample of quasar host galaxies have mass upper limits of 109.7–1010.8 M⊙, significantly less than expected from their supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses and the local MBH–M* relation. We additionally obtain JWST/NIRSpec integral field unit spectra of three of our quasars to calculate black hole masses, which we find are consistent with those in the literature, and to search for the presence of bright but compact galaxies via a Balmer break, for which we do not find evidence. We discuss the potential effects of dust extinction on our measured fluxes and the impact of selection effects on high-redshift quasar samples. We conclude that the masses of the SMBHs relative to the host galaxy stellar masses have a much larger scatter than locally, large enough that these selection effects cannot be responsible. This result is reinforced by other studies. Finally, we explore the potential implications of these results on the picture of SMBH–galaxy coeval growth in the early Universe.

<title>On the Comprehensive 3D Modeling of the Radiation Environment of Proxima Centauri b: A New Constraint on Habitability?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The combined influence of stellar energetic particles and galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) on the radiation environment, and hence potential habitability, of Earth-like exoplanets is relatively unknown. The present study, for the first time, comprehensively models the transport of these particles in a physics-first manner, using a unique suite of numerical models applied to the astrosphere of Proxima Centauri. The astrospheric plasma environment is modeled magnetohydrodynamically, while particle transport is modeled using a 3D ab initio GCR modulation code, as opposed to previous 1D approaches to this problem. StEP intensities are also calculated using observed stellar event profiles for Proxima Centauri as inputs. Computed intensities are then used to calculate possible atmospheric ionization effects and dose rates. We demonstrate that the contribution of GCRs to these quantities is indeed significant, contrary to the conclusions of previous studies. Furthermore, we propose a novel potential constraint on exoplanetary habitability, namely the rotational period of the host star, based on the unique 3D modeling approach presented here.

<title>Further Development of Event-based Analysis of X-Ray Polarization Data</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An event-based maximum likelihood method for handling X-ray polarimetry data is extended to include the effects of background and nonuniform sampling of the possible position angle space. While nonuniform sampling in position angle space generally introduces cross terms in the uncertainties of polarization parameters that could create degeneracies, there are interesting cases that engender no bias or parameter covariance. When including background in Poisson-based likelihood formulation, the formula for the minimum detectable polarization has nearly the same form as for the case of Gaussian statistics derived by Elsner et al. in the limiting case of an unpolarized signal. A polarized background is also considered, which demonstrably increases uncertainties in source polarization measurements. In addition, a Kolmogorov-style test of the event position angle distribution is proposed that can provide an unbinned test of models where the polarization angle in Stokes space depends on event characteristics such as time or energy.

<title>Can Chameleon Fields Be the Source of the Dark Energy Dipole and the Cosmic Microwave Background Dipole?</title>

Recent research reveals that the Local Group is in motion toward (l, b) = (276, 30) relative to the cosmic background radiation, manifesting a velocity of 600 km s−1, a phenomenon recognized as the cosmic background radiation dipole or cosmic microwave background dipole. Despite its well-documented nature, the precise cause of this peculiar motion remains elusive. High mass–density regions, such as galactic superclusters, stand out among the potential contributors to this cosmic flow. This paper employs chameleon fields to investigate anisotropies on both small and large scales. The data utilized in this study comprise Type Ia supernovae from the Pantheon catalog, totaling 1048 supernovae within the redshift range of 0.015 < z < 2.3. The analysis of the bulk flow at various redshifts has yielded noteworthy discoveries. On a smaller scale (less than 150 Mpc), the movement direction of the Local Group coincides with that of the bulk flow. On a larger scale, the bulk flow direction corresponds to the direction of the dark energy dipole. This implies that the anisotropy at the local scale originates from the same source as the anisotropy observed on a larger scale.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Hierarchical massive quadruple systems are ideal laboratories for examining the theories of star formation, dynamical evolution, and stellar evolution. The successive mergers of hierarchical quadruple systems might explain the mass gap between neutron stars and black holes. Looking for light curves of O-type binaries identified by LAMOST, we find a (2+2) quadruple system: TYC 3340-2437-1, located in the stellar bow-shock nebula (SBN). It has a probability of over 99.99% being a quadruple system derived from the surface density of the vicinity stars. Its inner orbital periods are 3.390602(89) days and 2.4378(16) days, respectively, and the total mass is about (11.47 + 5.79) + (5.2 + 2.02) = 24.48 M⊙. The line-of-sight inclinations of the inner binaries, B1 and B2, are 55.°94 and 78.°2, respectively, indicating that they are not coplanar. Based on observations spanning 34 months and the significance of the astrometric excess noise (D > 2) in Gaia Data Release 3 data, we guess that its outer orbital period might be a few years. If it were true, the quadruple system might form through the disk fragmentation mechanism with outer eccentric greater than zero. This eccentricity could be the cause of both the arc-like feature of the SBN and the noncoplanarity of the inner orbit. The outer orbital period and outer eccentric could be determined with the release of future epoch astrometric data of Gaia.

<title>Correlating Intrinsic Stellar Parameters with Mg ii Self-reversal Depths</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The Mg ii h&amp;k emission lines (2803, 2796 Å) are a useful tool for understanding stellar chromospheres and transition regions due to their intrinsic brightness, relatively low interstellar medium (ISM) absorption interference, and abundance of archival spectra available. Similar to other optically thick chromospheric emission lines such as H i Lyα, Mg ii emissions commonly present with a self-reversed line core, the depth and shape of which vary from star to star. We explore the relationship between self-reversal and the stellar atmosphere by investigating the extent to which fundamental stellar parameters affect self-reversal. We present a search for correlations between photospheric parameters such as effective temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity with the Mg ii k self-reversal depth for a group of 135 FGKM main-sequence stars with high-resolution near-ultraviolet spectra from the Hubble Space Telescope. We modeled the observed Mg ii k line profiles to correct for ISM attenuation and recover the depth of the emission line’s self-reversal in relation to the intensity of the line. We used the PHOENIX atmosphere code to homogeneously determine the stellar parameters by computing a suite of stellar atmosphere models that include a chromosphere and transition region, and using archival photometry to guide the models of each star. We quantify the sensitivity of the visible and near-infrared photometry to chromospheric and photospheric parameters. We find weak trends between Mg ii k self-reversal depth and age, rotation period, Mg ii luminosity, temperature, and mass. All stars in our sample older than ∼2 Gyr or rotating slower than ∼10 days exhibit self-reversal.

We report the discovery of eight optical counterparts of ALFALFA extragalactic objects from DECaLS, five of which are discovered for the first time. These objects were flagged as H i emission sources with no optical counterparts in SDSS before. Multiband data reveal their unusual physical properties. They are faint and blue (g − r = −0.35 ∼ 0.55), with quite low surface brightness ( ), irregular morphologies, low stellar masses ( ), low star formation rates (SFR = 0.21 ∼ 9.24 × 10−3M⊙ yr−1), and remarkably high H i-to-stellar mass ratios ( , except AGC 215415). They deviate from the scaling relations between H i and optical properties defined by the ALFALFA sample and the baryonic Tully–Fisher relation. They agree well with the main sequence of star-forming galaxies but exhibit low star-forming efficiency. Based on their physical properties and environments, we speculate that six of these objects may have originated from tidal processes, while the remaining two appear to have isolated origins. They may have had a relatively calm evolutionary history and only begun to form stars recently.

We present results from the Quasar hosts Unveiled by high Angular Resolution Techniques survey studying the circumgalactic medium (CGM) by observing rest-frame UV emission lines Lyα, C iv, and He ii around two radio-loud quasars, 3C 9 (z = 2.02) and 4C 05.84 (z = 2.32), using the Keck Cosmic Web Imager. We detect large-scale Lyα nebulae around both quasars with projected diameters ∼100 kpc, with spatially resolved, embedded 15–30 kpc He ii and C iv nebulae around both quasars as well as kinematically distinct He ii and C iv nebulae at a physical separation of ∼15 kpc from both quasars. Observations of Hα, Hβ, and [O iii] emission using Keck MOSFIRE spectroscopically confirm that the Lyα nebulae extend to companion galaxies and that these quasars are in a protogroup/protocluster environment. We confirm that the He ii and C iv emission is kinematically and spatially coincident with the companion galaxies. We estimate the virial masses of the companion galaxies, their metallicities, and star formation rates, and investigate the sources of ionization. We measure the dynamical mass of the host dark matter halos and estimate that the dark matter halos of these systems will grow to a mass of 2 × 1014M⊙ (3C 9) and 2 × 1013M⊙ (4C 05.84) by z = 0. The combined CGM and companion galaxies observations indicate Lyα substructure can indicate the presence of companion galaxies in the CGM.

<title>A Triple Scenario for the Formation of Wide Black Hole Binaries Such as Gaia BH1</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad2356</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad2356</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Recently, several noninteracting black hole–stellar binaries have been identified in Gaia data—for example, Gaia BH1, where a Sun-like star is in a moderately eccentric (e = 0.44) 185 days orbit around a black hole. This orbit is difficult to explain through binary evolution. The present-day separation suggests the progenitor system would have undergone an episode of common-envelope evolution, but a common envelope should shrink the period below the observed one. Since the majority of massive stars form in higher-multiplicity systems, a triple evolution scenario is more likely for the progenitors of BH binaries. Here we show that such systems can indeed be more easily explained via evolution in hierarchical triple systems. von Zeipel–Lidov–Kozai oscillations or instabilities can delay the onset of the common-envelope phase in the inner binary of the triple, so that the black hole progenitor and low-mass star are more widely separated when it begins, leading to the formation of wider binaries. There are also systems with similar periods but larger eccentricities, where the BH progenitor is a merger product of the inner binary in the triple. Such mergers lead to a more top-heavy black hole mass function.

<title>Nonlinear Feedback of the Electrostatic Instability on the Blazar-induced Pair Beam and GeV Cascade</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad24ea</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad24ea</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Relativistic pair beams produced in the cosmic voids by TeV gamma-rays from blazars are expected to produce a detectable GeV-scale cascade that is missing in the observations. The suppression of this secondary cascade implies either the deflection of the pair beam by intergalactic magnetic fields or, alternatively, an energy loss of the beam due to the beam-plasma instability. Here, we study how the beam-plasma instability feeds back on the beam, using a realistic two-dimensional beam distribution. We find that the instability broadens the beam opening angles significantly without any significant energy loss, thus confirming a recent feedback study on a simplified one-dimensional beam distribution. However, narrowing diffusion feedback of the beam particles with Lorentz factors less than 106 might become relevant, even though initially it is negligible. Finally, when considering the continuous creation of TeV pairs, we find that the beam distribution and the wave spectrum reach a new quasi-steady state, in which the scattering of beam particles persists and the beam opening angle may increase by a factor of hundreds. Understanding the implications on the GeV cascade emission requires accounting for inverse-Compton cooling.

<title>Helium Abundance Periods Observed by the Solar Probe Cup on Parker Solar Probe: Encounters 1–14</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Parker Solar Probe is a mission designed to explore the properties of the solar wind closer than ever before. Detailed particle observations from the Solar Probe Cup (SPC) have primarily focused on examining the proton population in the solar wind. However, several periods throughout the Parker mission have indicated that SPC has observed a pronounced and distinctive population of fully ionized helium, He2+. Minor ions are imprinted with properties of the solar wind’s source region, as well as mechanisms active during outflow, making them sensitive markers of its origin and formation at the Sun. Through a detailed analysis of the He2+ velocity distributions functions, this work examines periods where significant and persistent He2+ peaks are observed with SPC. We compute the helium abundance and examine the stream’s bulk speed, density, temperature, magnetic field topology, and electron strahl properties to identify distinctive solar-wind features that can provide insight to their solar source. We find that nearly all periods exhibit an elevated mean helium composition (8.34%) compared to typical solar wind and a majority (∼87%) of these periods are connected to coronal mass ejections (CMEs), with the highest abundance reaching 23.1%. The helium abundance and number of events increases as the solar cycle approaches maximum, with a weak dependence on speed. Additionally, the events not associated with a CME are clustered near the heliospheric current sheet, suggesting they are connected to streamer belt outflows. However, there are currently no theoretical explanations that fully describe the range of depleted and elevated helium abundances observed.

<title>Quaia, the Gaia-unWISE Quasar Catalog: An All-sky Spectroscopic Quasar Sample</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad1328</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad1328</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a new, all-sky quasar catalog, Quaia, that samples the largest comoving volume of any existing spectroscopic quasar sample. The catalog draws on the 6,649,162 quasar candidates identified by the Gaia mission that have redshift estimates from the space observatory’s low-resolution blue photometer/red photometer spectra. This initial sample is highly homogeneous and complete, but has low purity, and 18% of even the bright (G < 20.0) confirmed quasars have discrepant redshift estimates (∣Δz/(1 + z)∣ > 0.2) compared to those from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). In this work, we combine the Gaia candidates with unWISE infrared data (based on the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer survey) to construct a catalog useful for cosmological and astrophysical quasar studies. We apply cuts based on proper motions and colors, reducing the number of contaminants by approximately four times. We improve the redshifts by training a k-Nearest Neighbor model on SDSS redshifts, and achieve estimates on the G < 20.0 sample with only 6% (10%) catastrophic errors with ∣Δz/(1 + z)∣ > 0.2 (0.1), a reduction of approximately three times (approximately two times) compared to the Gaia redshifts. The final catalog has 1,295,502 quasars with G < 20.5, and 755,850 candidates in an even cleaner G < 20.0 sample, with accompanying rigorous selection function models. We compare Quaia to existing quasar catalogs, showing that its large effective volume makes it a highly competitive sample for cosmological large-scale structure analyses. The catalog is publicly available at 10.5281/zenodo.10403370.

<title>Heating and Acceleration of the Solar Wind by Ion Acoustic Waves—Parker Solar Probe</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The heating of the solar wind has been shown to be correlated with certain ion acoustic waves. Here calculations of the heating are made, using the methods used previously for STEREO observations, which show that the strong damping of ion acoustic waves rapidly delivers their energy to the plasma of the solar wind. It is shown that heating by the observed waves is not only sufficient to produce the observed heating but can also provide much or all of the outward acceleration of the solar wind.

<title>The Cosmos in Its Infancy: JADES Galaxy Candidates at z > 8 in GOODS-S and GOODS-N</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a catalog of 717 candidate galaxies at z > 8 selected from 125 square arcmin of NIRCam imaging as part of the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). We combine the full JADES imaging data set with data from the JWST Extragalactic Medium Survey and First Reionization Epoch Spectroscopic COmplete Survey (FRESCO) along with extremely deep existing observations from Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) for a final filter set that includes 15 JWST/NIRCam filters and five HST/ACS filters. The high-redshift galaxy candidates were selected from their estimated photometric redshifts calculated using a template-fitting approach, followed by visual inspection from seven independent reviewers. We explore these candidates in detail, highlighting interesting resolved or extended sources, sources with very red long-wavelength slopes, and our highest-redshift candidates, which extend to zphot ∼ 18. Over 93% of the sources are newly identified from our deep JADES imaging, including 31 new galaxy candidates at zphot > 12. We also investigate potential contamination by stellar objects, and do not find strong evidence from spectral energy distribution fitting that these faint high-redshift galaxy candidates are low-mass stars. Using 42 sources in our sample with measured spectroscopic redshifts from NIRSpec and FRESCO, we find excellent agreement to our photometric redshift estimates, with no catastrophic outliers and an average difference of 〈Δz = zphot − zspec〉 = 0.26. These sources comprise one of the most robust samples for probing the early buildup of galaxies within the first few hundred million years of the Universe’s history.

<title>Revisiting the Helium and Hydrogen Accretion Indicators at TWA 27B: Weak Mass Flow at Near-freefall Velocity</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad1ee9</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad1ee9</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
TWA 27B (2M1207b) is the first directly imaged planetary-mass (Mp ≈ 5 MJ) companion and was observed at 0.9–5.3 μm with JWST/NIRSpec. To understand the accretion properties of TWA 27B, we search for continuum-subtracted near-infrared helium and hydrogen emission lines and measure their widths and luminosities. We detect the He i triplet at 4.3σ and all Paschen-series lines covered by NIRSpec (Paα, Paβ, Paγ, Paδ) at 4σ–5σ. The three brightest Brackett-series lines (Brα, Brβ, Brγ) as well as Pfγ and Pfδ are tentative detections at 2σ–3σ. We provide upper limits on the other hydrogen lines, including on Hα through Hubble Space Telescope archival data. Three lines can be reliably deconvolved to reveal an intrinsic width Δvintrsc = (67 ± 9) km s−1, which is 60% of the surface freefall velocity. The line luminosities seem significantly too high to be due to chromospheric activity. Converting line luminosities to an accretion rate yields when using scaling relationships for planetary masses, and with extrapolated stellar scalings. Several of these lines represent the first detections at an accretor of such low mass. The weak accretion rate implies that formation is likely over. This analysis shows that JWST can be used to measure low line-emitting mass accretion rates onto planetary-mass objects, motivates deeper searches for the mass reservoir feeding TWA 27B, and hints that other young directly imaged objects might—hitherto unbeknownst—also be accreting.

<title>Lyman Continuum Emission from Active Galactic Nuclei at 2.3 ≲ z ≲ 3.7 in the UVCANDELS Fields</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad1ef0</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the results of our search for Lyman continuum (LyC)-emitting (weak) active galactic nuclei (AGN) at redshifts 2.3 ≲ z ≲ 4.9 from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) F275W observations in the Ultraviolet Imaging of the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (UVCANDELS) fields. We also include LyC emission from AGN using HST WFC3 F225W, F275W, and F336W imaging found in Early Release Science (ERS) and Hubble Deep UV Legacy Survey data. We performed exhaustive queries of the Vizier database to locate AGN with high-quality spectroscopic redshifts. In total, we found 51 AGN that met our criteria within the UVCANDELS and ERS footprints. Out of these 51, we find 12 AGN that had ≥4σ detected LyC flux in the WFC3/UVIS images. Using a wide variety of space-based plus ground-based data, ranging from X-ray to radio wavelengths, we fit the multiwavelength photometric data of each AGN to a CIGALE spectral energy distribution (SED) using AGN models and correlate various SED parameters to the LyC flux. Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests of the SED parameter distributions for the LyC-detected and nondetected AGN showed they are likely not distinct samples. However, we find that the X-ray luminosity, star formation onset age, and disk luminosity show strong correlations relative to their emitted LyC flux. We also find strong correlations of the LyC flux to several dust parameters, i.e., polar and toroidal dust emission and 6 μm luminosity, and anticorrelations with metallicity and AFUV. We simulate the LyC escape fraction (fesc) using the CIGALE and intergalactic medium transmission models for the LyC-detected AGN and find an average fesc ≃ 18%, weighted by uncertainties. We stack the LyC fluxes of subsamples of AGN according to the wavelength continuum region in which they are detected and find no significant distinctions in their LyC emission, although our submillimeter-detected F336W sample (3.15 < z < 3.71) shows the brightest stacked LyC flux. These findings indicate that LyC production and escape in AGN are more complicated than the simple assumption of thermal emission and a 100% escape fraction. Further testing of AGN models with larger samples than presented here is needed.

<title>One-dimensional General Relativistic Particle-in-cell Simulations of Stellar-mass Black Hole Magnetospheres: A Semianalytic Model of Gamma-Rays from Gaps</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In the absence of a sufficient amount of plasma injection into the black hole (BH) magnetosphere, the force-free state of the magnetosphere cannot be maintained, leading to the emergence of strong, time-dependent, longitudinal electric fields (i.e., spark gaps). Recent studies of supermassive BH magnetospheres using analytical methods and particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations propose the possibility of efficient particle acceleration and consequent gamma-ray emission in the spark gap. In this work, we perform 1D general relativistic PIC simulations to examine the gamma-ray emission from stellar-mass BH magnetospheres. We find that intermittent spark gaps emerge and particles are efficiently accelerated in a similar manner to the supermassive BH case. We build a semianalytic model of the plasma dynamics and radiative processes, which reproduces the maximum electron energies and peak gamma-ray luminosities of the simulation results. Based on this model, we show that the gamma-ray signals from stellar-mass BHs wandering through the interstellar medium could be detected by gamma-ray telescopes such as the Fermi Large Area Telescope or the Cherenkov Telescope Array.

<title>X-Ray Polarization of the Black Hole X-Ray Binary 4U 1630–47 Challenges the Standard Thin Accretion Disk Scenario</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A large energy-dependent X-ray polarization degree is detected by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) in the high-soft emission state of the black hole X-ray binary 4U 1630–47. The highly significant detection (at ≈50σ confidence level) of an unexpectedly high polarization, rising from ∼6% at 2 keV to ∼10% at 8 keV, cannot be easily reconciled with standard models of thin accretion disks. In this work, we compare the predictions of different theoretical models with the IXPE data and conclude that the observed polarization properties are compatible with a scenario in which matter accretes onto the black hole through a thin disk covered by a partially ionized atmosphere flowing away at mildly relativistic velocities.

<title>Can Supernovae Quench Star Formation in High-z Galaxies?</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad23ec</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
JWST is providing a unique opportunity to directly study the feedback processes regulating star formation (SF) in early galaxies. The two z > 5 quiescent systems (JADES-GS-z7-01-QU and MACS0417-z5BBG) detected so far show a recent starburst after which SF is suppressed. To clarify whether such quenching is due to supernova (SN) feedback, we have developed a minimal physical model. We derive a condition on the minimum star formation rate, , lasting for a time interval Δtb, required to quench SF in a galaxy at redshift z, with gas metallicity Z, and hosted by a halo of mass Mh. We find that lower (z, Z, Mh) systems are more easily quenched. We then apply the condition to JADES-GS-z7-01-QU (z = 7.3, M⋆ = 108.6M⊙) and MACS0417-z5BBG (z = 5.2, M⋆ = 107.6M⊙) and find that SN feedback largely fails to reproduce the observed quenched SF history. Alternatively, we suggest that SF is rapidly suppressed by radiation-driven dusty outflows sustained by the high specific star formation rates (43 and 25 Gyr−1, respectively) of the two galaxies. Our model provides a simple tool to interpret the SF histories of post-starburst galaxies and unravel quenching mechanisms from incoming JWST data.

<title>Multiwavelength Sun-as-a-star Analysis of the M8.7 Flare on 2022 October 2 Using Hα and EUV Spectra Taken by SMART/SDDI and SDO/EVE</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This paper presents a multiwavelength Sun-as-a-star analysis of the M8.7 flare on 2022 October 2, which was associated with a filament eruption and the subsequent coronal mass ejection. The Sun-as-a-star analysis was performed using Hα data taken by Solar Dynamics Doppler Imager on board the Solar Magnetic Activity Research Telescope at Hida Observatory, Kyoto University, and full-disk integrated extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectra taken by the Extreme ultraviolet Variability Experiment (EVE) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory. The Sun-as-a-star Hα spectra showed blueshifted absorption corresponding to the filament eruption. Furthermore, the EVE O v 629.7 Å spectra showed blueshifted brightening, which can also be attributed to the filament eruption. Even when the blueshifted absorption became almost invisible in the Sun-as-a-star Hα spectra, the O v blueshifted brightening up to −400 km s−1 was still clearly visible. This result indicates that even when the shifted components—which are expected to originate from stellar eruptions—become almost invisible in the spatially integrated stellar Hα spectra, the erupting materials may still be present and observable in EUV spectra. Additionally, the Sun-as-a-star Hα and O v spectra exhibited redshifted absorption and brightening, respectively, during the decay phase of the flare. These components probably originate from the post-flare loops, providing clues to the multitemperature nature of the post-flare loops in the spatially integrated observation. Our Sun-as-a-star results suggest that the combination of Hα and EUV lines allows the investigation of the multitemperature structure and temporal development of stellar active phenomena even in spatially integrated spectra.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The Ultraviolet Transient Astronomy Satellite (ULTRASAT) is scheduled to be launched to geostationary orbit in 2027. It will carry a telescope with an unprecedentedly large field of view (204 deg2) and near-ultraviolet (NUV; 230–290 nm) sensitivity (22.5 mag, 5σ, at 900 s). ULTRASAT will conduct the first wide-field survey of transient and variable NUV sources and will revolutionize our ability to study the hot transient Universe. It will explore a new parameter space in energy and timescale (months-long light curves with minutes cadence), with an extragalactic volume accessible for the discovery of transient sources that is >300 times larger than that of the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) and comparable to that of the Vera Rubin Observatory’s Legacy Survey of Space and Time. ULTRASAT data will be transmitted to the ground in real time, and transient alerts will be distributed to the community in <15 minutes, enabling vigorous ground-based follow up of ULTRASAT sources. ULTRASAT will also provide an all-sky NUV image to >23.5 AB mag, over 10 times deeper than the GALEX map. Two key science goals of ULTRASAT are the study of mergers of binaries involving neutron stars, and supernovae. With a large fraction (>50%) of the sky instantaneously accessible, fast (minutes) slewing capability, and a field of view that covers the error ellipses expected from gravitational-wave (GW) detectors beyond 2026, ULTRASAT will rapidly detect the electromagnetic emission following binary neutron star/neutron star–black hole mergers identified by GW detectors, and will provide continuous NUV light curves of the events. ULTRASAT will provide early (hour) detection and continuous high-cadence (minutes) NUV light curves for hundreds of core-collapse supernovae, including for rarer supernova progenitor types.

<title>Modeling the Multiwavelength Radiation Properties in Pulsar Dissipative Magnetospheres</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We explore the multiwavelength radiation properties of the light curves and energy spectra in the dissipative magnetospheres of pulsars. The dissipative magnetospheres are simulated by the pseudo-spectral method with the combined force-free and Aristotelian electrodynamics, which can produce self-consistent accelerating electric fields mainly distributed in the equatorial current sheet outside the light cylinder. The multiwavelength light curves and spectra are computed by using the multiple emission mechanisms of both the primary particles accelerated by the accelerating electric fields in the equatorial current sheet and the secondary pairs with an assumed distribution spectrum. We then compare the predicted multiwavelength light curves and spectra with the observed data from the Crab, Vela, and Geminga pulsars. Our modeling results can systematically reproduce the observed trends of the multiwavelength light curves and the spectra for these three pulsars well.

<title>The Polarization of the Solar Ba ii D1 Line with Partial Frequency Redistribution and Its Magnetic Sensitivity</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad217e</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad217e</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We investigate the main physical mechanisms that shape the intensity and polarization of the Ba ii D1 line at 4934 Å via radiative transfer numerical experiments. We focus especially on the scattering linear polarization arising from the spectral structure of the anisotropic radiation in the wavelength interval spanned by the line’s hyperfine structure (HFS) components in the odd isotopes of barium. After verifying that the presence of the low-energy metastable levels only impacts the amplitude, but not the shape, of the D1 linear polarization, we relied on a two-term atomic model that neglects such metastable levels but includes HFS. The D1 fractional linear polarization shows a very small variation with the choice of atmospheric model, enhancing its suitability for solar magnetic field diagnostics. Tangled magnetic fields with strengths of tens of gauss reduce the linear polarization, and saturation is reached at roughly 300 G. Deterministic inclined magnetic fields produce a U/I profile and, if they have a significant longitudinal component, a V/I profile, whose modeling requires accounting for HFS and the Paschen–Back effect. Because of the overlap between HFS components, the magnetograph formula cannot be applied to infer the longitudinal magnetic field. Accurately modeling the D1 intensity and polarization requires an atomic system that includes the metastable levels and the HFS, the detailed spectral structure of the radiation field, the incomplete Paschen–Back regime for magnetic fields, and an accurate treatment of collisions.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
BL Lacertae (BL Lac) objects are a subclass of blazar, distinguished by their featureless optical spectrum. The featureless spectrum presents a challenge in measuring the redshift of the BL Lacs. In this paper, we measure the redshift of BL Lacs using the photometric dropout technique. The space-based telescope Swift and the ground-based SARA telescopes are employed to provide magnitudes in the filters. We observe 60 BL Lacs and report reliable redshift upper limits for 41 of them. We discover three new high-z BL Lacs (z > 1.3) at redshifts of , , and , bringing the number of high-z BL Lacs found by this method up to 19. Discussions are made on the implications for the blazar sequence, the Fermi blazar divide, and the gamma-ray horizon based on an analysis of the 4LAC catalog and all high-z BL Lacs found with the photo-z technique.

The accretion disks that fuel active galactic nuclei (AGNs) may house numerous stars and compact objects, formed in situ or captured from nearby star clusters. Embedded neutron stars and black holes may form binaries and eventually merge, emitting gravitational waves detectable by LIGO/VIRGO. AGN disks are a particularly promising environment for the production of high-mass gravitational-wave events involving black holes in the pair-instability mass gap, and may facilitate electromagnetic counterparts to black hole binary mergers. However, many orders of magnitude separate the typical length scales of binary formation and those on which gravitational waves can drive binary inspirals, making binary mergers inside the disk uncertain. Previous hydrodynamical simulations of binaries have either been restricted to two dimensions entirely, or focused on binaries aligned with the midplane of the disk. Herein we present the first three-dimensional, high-resolution, local-shearing-box, inviscid hydrodynamical simulations of disk-embedded binaries over a range of orbital inclinations. We find that retrograde binaries can shrink up to 4 times as quickly as prograde binaries, and that all binaries not perfectly aligned (or anti-aligned) with the AGN disk are driven into alignment. An important consequence of this is that initially retrograde binaries will traverse the inclinations where von Zeipel–Lidov–Kozai oscillations can drive binary eccentricities to large values, potentially facilitating mergers. We also find that interactions with the AGN disk may excite eccentricities in retrograde binaries and cause the orbits of embedded binaries to precess.

<title>BST1047+1156: A (Failing) Ultradiffuse Tidal Dwarf in the Leo I Group</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad1cef</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We use deep Hubble Space Telescope imaging to study the resolved stellar populations in BST1047+1156, a gas-rich, ultradiffuse dwarf galaxy found in the intragroup environment of the Leo I galaxy group. While our imaging reaches approximately two magnitudes below the tip of the red giant branch at the Leo I distance of 11 Mpc, we find no evidence for an old red giant sequence that would signal an extended star formation history for the object. Instead, we clearly detect the red and blue helium-burning sequences of its stellar populations, as well as the fainter blue main sequence, all indicative of a recent burst of star formation having taken place over the past 50–250 Myr. Comparing to isochrones for young metal-poor stellar populations, we infer this post-starburst population to be moderately metal-poor, with metallicity [M/H] in the range −1 to −1.5. The combination of a young, moderately metal-poor post starburst population and no old stars motivates a scenario in which BST1047 was recently formed during a weak burst of star formation in gas that was tidally stripped from the outskirts of the neighboring massive spiral M96. BST1047's extremely diffuse nature, lack of ongoing star formation, and disturbed H i morphology all argue that it is a transitory object, a “failing tidal dwarf” in the process of being disrupted by interactions within the Leo I group. Finally, in the environment surrounding BST1047, our imaging also reveals the old, metal-poor ([M/H] = − 1.3 ± 0.2) stellar halo of M96 at a projected radius of 50 kpc.

<title>Brown Dwarf Candidates in the JADES and CEERS Extragalactic Surveys</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
By combining the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)/NIRCam JADES and CEERS extragalactic data sets, we have uncovered a sample of 21 T and Y brown dwarf candidates at best-fit distances between 0.1 and 4.2 kpc. These sources were selected by targeting the blue 1–2.5 μm colors and red 3–4.5 μm colors that arise from molecular absorption in the atmospheres of Teff < 1300 K brown dwarfs. We fit these sources using multiple models of substellar atmospheres and present the resulting fluxes, sizes, effective temperatures, and other derived properties for the sample. If confirmed, these fits place the majority of the sources in the Milky Way thick disk and halo. We observe proper motions for seven of the candidate brown dwarfs, with directions in agreement with the plane of our Galaxy, providing evidence that they are not extragalactic in nature. We demonstrate how the colors of these sources differ from selected high-redshift galaxies, and explore the selection of these sources in planned large-area JWST NIRCam surveys. Deep imaging with JWST/NIRCam presents an an excellent opportunity for finding and understanding these ultracool dwarfs at kiloparsec distances.

<title>Second Harmonic Electromagnetic Wave Emissions from a Turbulent Plasma with Random Density Fluctuations</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad20ee</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In the solar wind, electromagnetic waves at the harmonic plasma frequency 2ωp can be generated as a result of coalescence between forward- and backward-propagating Langmuir waves. A new approach to calculate their radiation efficiency in plasmas with external background density fluctuations is developed. The evolution of Langmuir wave turbulence is studied by solving numerically the Zakharov equations in a two-dimensional randomly inhomogeneous plasma. Then, the dynamics of the nonlinear electric currents modulated at frequencies close to 2ωp are calculated, as well as their radiation into harmonic electromagnetic waves. In the frame of this non-self-consistent approach where all transformations of Langmuir waves on density inhomogeneities are taken into account, the electromagnetic wave radiation rate (emissivity) is determined numerically as well as analytically, providing in both cases similar results. Moreover, scaling laws of the harmonic wave emissivity as a function of the ratio of the light velocity to the electron plasma thermal velocity are found. It is also shown how the emissivity depends on the average level of density fluctuations and on the isotropic/anisotropic character of the Langmuir waves’ and density fluctuations’ spectra.

<title>Velocity Acoustic Oscillations on Cosmic Dawn 21 cm Power Spectrum as a Probe of Small-scale Density Fluctuations</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad235b</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad235b</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We investigate the feasibility of using the velocity acoustic oscillations (VAO) features on the Cosmic Dawn 21 cm power spectrum to probe small-scale density fluctuations. In the standard cold dark matter (CDM) model, Population III stars form in minihalos and affect the 21 cm signal through Lyα and X-ray radiation. Such a process is modulated by the relative motion between dark matter and baryons, generating the VAO wiggles on the 21 cm power spectrum. In the fuzzy or warm dark matter models for which the number of minihalos is reduced, the VAO wiggles are weaker or even fully invisible. We investigate the wiggle features in the CDM with different astrophysical models and in different dark matter models. We find that (1) in the CDM model the relative streaming velocities can generate the VAO wiggles for broad ranges of parameters f*, ζX, and fesc,LWζLW, though for different parameters the wiggles would appear at different redshifts and have different amplitudes. (2) For the axion model with ma ≲ 10−19 eV, the VAO wiggles are negligible. In the mixed model, the VAO signal is sensitive to the axion fraction. For example, the wiggles almost disappear when fa ≳ 10% for ma = 10−21 eV. Therefore, the VAO signal can be an effective indicator for small-scale density fluctuations and a useful probe of the nature of dark matter. The Square Kilometre Array-low with ∼2000 hr observation time has the ability to detect the VAO signal and constrain dark matter models.

<title>Correlations between Total and Spectral Solar Irradiance Variations</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad24e5</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad24e5</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We compare short-term (seven solar rotations), wavelength-dependent temporal variations in spectral solar irradiance (SSI) with those from the total solar irradiance (TSI). Using space-based measurements, we empirically find good correlations across most of the visible and near-infrared (NIR) spectral range, suggesting that the TSI time variability can provide a useful estimate of SSI variability. These empirically determined correlations are consistent with physics-based bolometric variations, providing a straightforward wavelength-dependent parameterization of the SSI variability given a known change in the TSI. Using a solar-irradiance model to distinguish the facular and sunspot contributions, which are responsible for nearly all the irradiance variability on timescales longer than a day, we confirm these results and determine the correlation contributions due to each magnetic activity type individually. The correlations determined from the model agree in functional form to those of the empirical data, although we do note differences near opacity minimum (1.6 μm). Our results provide a simple TSI-based estimate of the time dependence of the spectral solar variability across the ultraviolet to NIR spectral regions, with the TSI accounting for 94% of the variability in the SSI over the 400–1200 nm range.

<title>The Gas-phase Mass–Metallicity Relation for Massive Galaxies at z ∼ 0.7 with the LEGA-C Survey</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad250c</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad250c</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The massive end of the gas-phase mass–metallicity relation (MZR) is a sensitive probe of active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback that is a crucial but highly uncertain component of galaxy evolution models. In this paper, we extend the z ∼ 0.7 MZR by ∼0.5 dex up to log (M⋆/M⊙) ∼ 11.1. We use extremely deep VLT VIMOS spectra from the Large Early Galaxy Astrophysics Census (LEGA-C) survey to measure metallicities for 145 galaxies. The LEGA-C MZR matches the normalization of the z ∼ 0.8 DEEP2 MZR where they overlap, so we combine the two to create an MZR spanning from 9.3 to 11.1 log (M⋆/M⊙). The LEGA-C+DEEP2 MZR at z ∼ 0.7 is offset to slightly lower metallicities (0.05–0.13 dex) than the z ∼ 0 MZR, but it otherwise mirrors the established power-law rise at low/intermediate stellar masses and asymptotic flattening at high stellar masses. We compare the LEGA-C+DEEP2 MZR to the MZR from two cosmological simulations (IllustrisTNG and SIMBA), which predict qualitatively different metallicity trends for high-mass galaxies. This comparison highlights that our extended MZR provides a crucial observational constraint for galaxy evolution models in a mass regime where the MZR is very sensitive to choices about the implementation of AGN feedback.

<title>Preliminary Discussion on the Current Sheet</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad2683</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The current sheet is a characteristic structure of magnetic energy dissipation during the magnetic reconnection process. So far, the width and depth of the current sheet are still indefinite. Here we investigate 64 current sheets observed by four telescopes from 1999 to 2022, and all of them have been well identified in the previous literature. In each current sheet, three width values are obtained at the quartering points. Based on these investigated cases, we obtain 192 values, which are in a wide range from hundreds to tens of thousands of kilometers. By calculating the pixel width (PW: the ratio of the current sheet width to the pixel resolution of corresponding observed data) of these current sheets, we find that more than 80% of the PW values concentrate on 2–4 pixels, indicating that the widths of the current sheets are dependent strongly on the instrument resolutions and all the sheets have no observable three-dimensional information. To interpret this result, we suggest that there are two probabilities. One is that the width of the current sheet is smaller than the instrument resolution, and the other is that the detected current sheet is only a small segment of the real one. Furthermore, there is another possible scenario. The so-called current sheet is just an emission-enhanced region.

<title>The Case of the Missing Very High-energy Gamma-Ray Bursts: A Retrospective Study of Swift Gamma-Ray Bursts with Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad26fa</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad26fa</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are particle acceleration sites that can emit photons in the very high-energy (VHE) domain through nonthermal processes. From 2004 until 2018, the current generation of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) did not detect any GRB in the VHE domain. However, from 2018 to 2020, five detections were reported. In this work, we try to solve the case of the missing VHE GBRs prior to 2018. We aim to identify GRBs that might have eluded VHE detection in past years by the H.E.S.S., MAGIC, and VERITAS IACTs. To do so, we study GRBs with known redshift detected by Swift from 2004 until June 2022. We first identify all GRBs that could have been observed by these IACTs since 2004, considering observation conditions and visibility constraints. We assume a relation between the X-rays and the VHE gamma rays based on the VHE GRBs detected to date and combine this with the redshift measurements, instrument response information, and observation conditions to predict the observed VHE gamma-ray flux from the Swift X-Ray Telescope measurements. We report findings on 12 bright low-redshift GRBs that we identify as most likely to have been detected in the VHE domain by current IACTs. The rate of IACT-detectable GRBs with ideal observation conditions is <1 VHE GRB per year with the current configuration. With its lower energy threshold and higher sensitivity, this rate increases to ∼4 VHE GRBs per year with the Cherenkov Telescope Array.

<title>Testing CCC+TL Cosmology with Observed Baryon Acoustic Oscillation Features</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad1bc6</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad1bc6</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The primary purpose of this paper is to see how well a recently proposed new model fits (a) the position of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) features observed in the large-scale distribution of galaxies and (b) the angular size measured for the sound horizon due to BAO imprinted in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy. The new model is a hybrid model that combines the tired light (TL) theory with a variant of the ΛCDM model in which the cosmological constant is replaced with a covarying coupling constants’ (CCC) parameter α. This model, dubbed the CCC+TL model, can fit the Type Ia supernovae Pantheon+ data as accurately as the ΛCDM model, and also fit the angular size of cosmic dawn galaxies observed by the James Webb Space Telescope, which is in tension with the ΛCDM model. The results we obtained are 151.0 (±5.1) Mpc for the absolute BAO scale at the current epoch, and the angular size of the sound horizon θsh = 0.°60, matching Planck’s observations at the surface of the last scattering when the baryon density is set to 100% of the matter density and ∣α∣ is increased by 5.6%. It remains to be seen if the new model is consistent with the CMB power spectrum, the Big Bang nucleosynthesis of light elements, and other critical observations.

<title>Many Roads Lead to Lithium: Formation Pathways For Lithium-rich Red Giants</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad1936</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad1936</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Stellar models predict that lithium (Li) inside a star is destroyed during the first dredge-up phase, yet 1.2% of red giant stars are Li-rich. We aim to uncover possible origins of this population, by analyzing 1099 Li-rich giants (A(Li) ≥ 1.5) in GALAH DR3. To expose peculiar traits of Li-rich stars, we construct a reference sample of Li-normal (doppelgänger) stars with matched evolutionary state and fiducial iron-peak and alpha-process abundances ([Fe/H] and [Mg/Fe]). Comparing Li-rich and doppelgänger spectra reveals systematic differences in the Hα and Ca-triplet line profiles associated with the velocity broadening measurement. We also find twice as many Li-rich stars appear to be fast rotators (2% with vbroad ≳ 20 km s−1) compared to doppelgängers. On average, Li-rich stars have higher abundances than their doppelgängers, for a subset of elements, and Li-rich stars at the base of RGB have higher mean s-process abundances (≥0.05 dex for Ba, Y, Zr), relative to their doppelgängers. External mass-transfer from intermediate-mass AGB companions could explain this signature. Additional companion analysis excludes binaries with mass ratios ≳0.5 at ≳7 au. Finally, we confirm a prevalence of Li-rich stars on the red clump that increases with lithium, which supports an evolutionary state mechanism for Li-enhancement. Multiple culprits, including binary spin-up and mass-transfer, are therefore likely mechanisms of Li-enrichment.

<title>Using Bright Point Shapes to Constrain Wave Heating of the Solar Corona: Predictions for DKIST</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Magnetic bright points on the solar photosphere mark the footpoints of kilogauss magnetic flux tubes extending toward the corona. Convective buffeting of these tubes is believed to excite magnetohydrodynamic waves, which can propagate to the corona and deposit heat there. Measuring wave excitation via bright point motion can thus constrain coronal and heliospheric models, and this has been done extensively with centroid tracking, which can estimate kink-mode wave excitation. DKIST is the first telescope to provide well-resolved observations of bright points, allowing shape and size measurements to probe the excitation of other wave modes that have been difficult, if not impossible, to study to date. In this work, we demonstrate a method of automatic bright point tracking that robustly identifies the shapes of bright points, and we develop a technique for interpreting measured bright point shape changes as the driving of a range of thin-tube wave modes. We demonstrate these techniques on a MURaM simulation of DKIST-like resolution. These initial results suggest that modes other than the long-studied kink mode could increase the total available energy budget for wave heating by 50%. Pending observational verification as well as modeling of the propagation and dissipation of these additional wave modes, this could represent a significant increase in the potency of wave-turbulence heating models.

<title>SAGUARO: Time-domain Infrastructure for the Fourth Gravitational-wave Observing Run and Beyond</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad2170</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present upgraded infrastructure for Searches After Gravitational waves Using ARizona Observatories (SAGUARO) during LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA’s fourth gravitational-wave (GW) observing run (O4). These upgrades implement many of the lessons we learned after a comprehensive analysis of potential electromagnetic counterparts to the GWs discovered during the previous observing run. We have developed a new web-based target and observation manager (TOM) that allows us to coordinate sky surveys, vet potential counterparts, and trigger follow-up observations from one centralized portal. The TOM includes software that aggregates all publicly available information on the light curves and possible host galaxies of targets, allowing us to rule out potential contaminants like active galactic nuclei, variable stars, solar system objects, and preexisting supernovae, as well as to assess the viability of any plausible counterparts. We have also upgraded our image-subtraction pipeline by assembling deeper reference images and training a new neural-network-based real–bogus classifier. These infrastructure upgrades will aid coordination by enabling the prompt reporting of observations, discoveries, and analysis to the GW follow-up community, and put SAGUARO in an advantageous position to discover kilonovae in the remainder of O4 and beyond. Many elements of our open-source software stack have broad utility beyond multimessenger astronomy, and will be particularly relevant in the “big data” era of transient discoveries by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.

<title>An Extremely Young Protostellar Core, MMS 1/OMC-3: Episodic Mass Ejection History Traced by the Micro SiO Jet</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present ∼0.″2 (∼80 au) resolution observations of the CO(2–1) and SiO(5–4) lines made with the Atacama large millimeter/submillimeter array toward an extremely young intermediate-mass protostellar source (tdyn < 1000 yr), MMS 1 located in the Orion Molecular Cloud-3 region. We have successfully imaged a very compact CO molecular outflow associated with MMS 1, having deprojected lobe sizes of ∼1800 au (redshifted lobe) and ∼2800 au (blueshifted lobe). We have also detected an extremely compact (≲1000 au) and collimated SiO protostellar jet within the CO outflow. The maximum deprojected jet speed is measured to be as high as 93 km s−1. The SiO jet wiggles and displays a chain of knots. Our detection of the molecular outflow and jet is the first direct evidence that MMS 1 already hosts a protostar. The position–velocity diagram obtained from the SiO emission shows two distinct structures: (i) bow shocks associated with the tips of the outflow, and (ii) a collimated jet, showing the jet velocities linearly increasing with the distance from the driving source. Comparisons between the observations and numerical simulations quantitatively share similarities such as multiple-mass ejection events within the jet and Hubble-like flow associated with each mass ejection event. Finally, while there is a weak flux decline seen in the 850 μm light curve obtained with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope/SCUBA 2 toward MMS 1, no dramatic flux change events are detected. This suggests that there has not been a clear burst event within the last 8 yr.

<title>Constrain the Dark-matter Distribution of Ultra-diffuse Galaxies with Globular-cluster Mass Segregation: A Case Study with NGC5846-UDG1</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad1ee3</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad1ee3</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The properties of globular clusters (GCs) contain valuable information of their host galaxies and dark-matter halos. In the remarkable example of ultra-diffuse galaxy, NGC5846-UDG1, the GC population exhibits strong radial mass segregation, indicative of dynamical-friction-driven orbital decay, which opens the possibility of using imaging data alone to constrain the dark-matter content of the galaxy. To explore this possibility, we develop a semianalytical model of GC evolution, which starts from the initial mass, structural, and spatial distributions of the GC progenitors, and follows the effects of dynamical friction, tidal evolution, and two-body relaxation. Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo, we forward-model the GCs in a UDG1-like potential to match the observed GC statistics, and to constrain the profile of the host halo and the origin of the GCs. We find that, with the assumptions of zero mass segregation when the star clusters were born, UDG1 is relatively dark-matter-poor compared to what is expected from stellar-to-halo–mass relations, and its halo concentration is lower than the cosmological average, irrespective of having a cuspy or a cored profile. Its GC population has an initial spatial distribution more extended than the smooth stellar distribution. We discuss the results in the context of scaling laws of galaxy–halo connections, and warn against naively using the GC-abundance–halo–mass relation to infer the halo mass of ultra-diffuse galaxies. Our model is generally applicable to GC-rich dwarf galaxies, and is publicly available.

<title>Millimeter-wave CO and SiO Observations toward the Broad-velocity-width Molecular Feature CO 16.134–0.553: A Smith Cloud Scenario?</title>

We report the results of the CO J = 1–0 and SiO J = 2–1 mapping observations toward the broad-velocity-width molecular feature (BVF) CO 16.134–0.553 with the Nobeyama Radio Observatory 45 m telescope. The high-quality CO map shows that the 5 pc size BVF bridges two separate velocity components at VLSR ≃ 40 km s−1 and 65 km s−1 in the position–velocity space. The kinetic power of CO 16.134–0.553 amounts to 7.8 × 102L⊙, whereas no apparent driving sources were identified. Prominent SiO emission was detected from the BVF and its root in the VLSR ≃ 40 km s−1 component. In the CO Galactic plane survey data, CO 16.134–0.553 appears to correspond to the Galactic eastern rim of a 15 pc diameter expanding CO shell. A 1° diameter H i emission void and 4° long vertical H i filament were also found above and below the CO shell, respectively. We propose that the high-velocity plunge of a dark matter subhalo with a clump of baryonic matter was responsible for the formation of the H i void, CO 16.134–0.553/CO shell, and the H i filament.

<title>The Role of the Third Dredge-up and Mass Loss in Shaping the Initial–Final Mass Relation of White Dwarfs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The initial–final mass relation (IFMR) plays a crucial role in understanding stellar structure and evolution by linking a star’s initial mass to the mass of the resulting white dwarf. This study explores the IFMR in the initial mass range 0.8 ≤ Mini/M⊙ ≤ 4 using full PARSEC evolutionary calculations supplemented with COLIBRI computations to complete the ejection of the envelope and obtain the final core mass. Recent works have shown that the supposed monotonicity of the IFMR is interrupted by a kink in the initial mass range Mini ≈ 1.65–2.10 M⊙, due to the interaction between recurrent dredge-up episodes and stellar winds in carbon stars evolving on the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch phase. To reproduce the IFMR nonmonotonic behavior we investigate the role of convective overshooting efficiency applied to the base of the convective envelope (fenv) and to the borders of the pulse-driven convective zone (fpdcz), as well as its interplay with mass loss. We compare our models to observational data and find that fenv must vary with initial mass in order to accurately reproduce the IFMR’s observed kink and slopes. We find some degeneracy between the overshooting parameters when only the IFMR information is used. Nonetheless, this analysis provides valuable insights into the internal mixing processes during the TP-AGB phase.

<title>An Outbursting Protostar: The Environment of L1251 VLA 6</title>

Young protostars that undergo episodic accretion can provide insight into the impact on their circumstellar environments while matter is accreted from the disk onto the protostar. IRAS 22343+7501 is a four-component protostar system with one of those being a fading outbursting protostar, which was obseved with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and is referred to as L1251 VLA 6. Given the rarity of young stellar objects undergoing this type of accretion, L1251 VLA 6 can elucidate the fading phase of the post-outburst process. Here, we examine structure in the disk around L1251 VLA 6 at frequencies of 10 and 33 GHz with the VLA. We model the disk structure using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). This method is then combined with a parametric ray-tracing code to generate synthetic model images of an axisymmetric disk, allowing us to characterize the radial distribution of dust in the system. The results of our MCMC fit show that the most probable values for the mass and radius are consistent with values typical of Class I objects. We find that the total mass of the disk is and investigate the conditions that could cause the accretion outburst. We conclude that the eruption is not caused by gravitational instability and consider alternative explanations and trigger mechanisms.

<title>The Origins of Gas Accreted by Supermassive Black Holes: The Importance of Recycled Gas</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We investigate the fueling mechanisms of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) by analyzing 10 zoom-in cosmological simulations of massive galaxies, with stellar masses 1011–12M⊙ and SMBH masses 108.9–9.7M⊙ at z = 0, featuring various major and minor merger events. By tracing the gas history in these simulations, we categorize the gas accreted by the central SMBHs based on its origin. Gas that belonged to a different galaxy before accretion onto the BH is labeled as (i) “external,” while smoothly accreted cosmic gas is classified as (ii) “smooth.” Gas produced within the primary halo through stellar evolution and subsequently accreted by the SMBH is classified as (iii) “recycled.” Our analysis, which includes stellar feedback, reveals that the primary fuel source for SMBHs is the recycled gas from dying stars. This recycled gas from stars in the inner region of the galaxy readily collapses toward the center, triggering starbursts and simultaneously fueling the SMBH. Galaxy mergers also play a crucial role in fueling SMBHs in massive galaxies, as SMBHs in massive halos tend to accrete a higher fraction of external gas from mergers compared to smoothly accreted gas. However, on average, it takes approximately 1.85 Gyr for external gas to enter the main galaxy and accrete onto the SMBH. Considering the presence of various other gas triggers for active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity alongside this time delay, the association between AGNs and mergers may not always be obvious.

<title>The Metallicity–Electron Temperature Relationship in H ii Regions</title>

H ii region heavy-element abundances throughout the Galactic disk provide important constraints to theories of the formation and evolution of the Milky Way. In LTE, radio recombination line (RRL) emission and free–free continuum emission are accurate extinction-free tracers of the H ii region electron temperature. Since metals act as coolants in H ii regions via the emission of collisionally excited lines, the electron temperature is a proxy for metallicity. Shaver et al. found a linear relationship between metallicity and electron temperature with little scatter. Here we use CLOUDY H ii region simulations to (1) investigate the accuracy of using RRLs to measure the electron temperature and (2) explore the metallicity–electron temperature relationship. We model 135 H ii regions with different ionizing radiation fields, densities, and metallicities. We find that electron temperatures derived under the assumption of LTE are about 20% systematically higher owing to non-LTE effects, but overall LTE is a good assumption for centimeter-wavelength RRLs. Our CLOUDY simulations are consistent with the Shaver et al. metallicity–electron temperature relationship, but there is significant scatter since earlier spectral types or higher electron densities yield higher electron temperatures. Using RRLs to derive electron temperatures assuming LTE yields errors in the predicted metallicity as large as 10%. We derive correction factors for log(O/H) + 12 in each CLOUDY simulation. For lower metallicities the correction factor depends primarily on the spectral type of the ionizing star and ranges from 0.95 to 1.10, whereas for higher metallicities the correction factor depends on the density and is between 0.97 and 1.05.

<title>Disk-induced Binary Precession: Implications for Dynamics and Multimessenger Observations of Black Hole Binaries</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Many studies have recently documented the orbital response of eccentric binaries accreting from thin circumbinary disks, characterizing the change in the binary semimajor axis and eccentricity. We extend these calculations to include the precession of the binary’s longitude of periapse induced by the circumbinary disk, and we characterize this precession continuously with binary eccentricity eb for equal mass components. This disk-induced apsidal precession is prograde with a weak dependence on the binary eccentricity when eb ≲ 0.4 and decreases approximately linearly for eb ≳ 0.4; yet at all eb binary precession is faster than the rates of change to the semimajor axis and eccentricity by an order of magnitude. We estimate that such precession effects are likely most important for subparsec separated binaries with masses ≲107 M⊙, like LISA precursors. We find that accreting, equal-mass LISA binaries with M < 106 M⊙ (and the most massive M ∼ 107 M⊙ binaries out to z ∼ 3) may acquire a detectable phase offset due to the disk-induced precession. Moreover, disk-induced precession can compete with general relativistic precession in a vacuum, making it important for observer-dependent electromagnetic searches for accreting massive binaries—like Doppler boost and binary self-lensing models—after potentially only a few orbital periods.

<title>GRB 220304A: Another Gamma-Ray Burst Dominated by Thermal Radiation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report a recently detected long-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB) event by Fermi-GBM, GRB 220304A. The spectral analysis of the burst by the Band function shows that both the time-integrated and time-resolved spectra are very narrow, with low-energy spectral index 〈α〉 = −0.05 ± 0.30 and high-energy spectral index 〈β〉 = −3.53 ± 0.30. It is reminiscent of GRB 090902B, a special GRB with photosphere radiation characteristics. Then, we perform spectral analysis using the Planck function (blackbody, BB) and the multicolor BB model. It is found that the spectra within −1 ∼ 3 s is well fit by the BB model, indicating that the observation within the first 4 s is a pure thermal event. Apart from that most of the spectra can be well modeled as a multicolor BB. We conclude that GRB 220304A is a GRB dominated by thermal radiation. We also find that the spectral widths of the time-resolved spectrum of the burst gradually increase with time. Based on the Amati relation, we infer the redshift to be 0.23, the physical properties of the relativistic outflow, and find that the relationship between the bulk Lorentz factor and the isotropic luminosity Γ–Liso,52 still exists.

Magnetic reconnection is a fundamental process in space and astrophysical plasmas that converts magnetic energy to particle energy. Recently, a novel kind of reconnection, called electron-only reconnection, has been observed in Earth's magnetosheath plasma. A defining characteristic of electron-only reconnection is that electron jets are observed but ion jets are absent. This is in contrast with traditional ion-coupled reconnection, where both ions and electrons exhibit outflowing velocity jets. Findings from the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission observations and particle-in-cell simulations show clear signatures of electron heating in electron-only reconnection events, while ions are not heated or cooled in these events. This result is unlike ion-coupled reconnection, where both ions and electrons are heated to varying degrees. The ratio of electron to ion dissipation increases with the local magnetic curvature, indicating that the partition of heat into ions and electrons is dependent on the current-sheet thickness.

<title>Formation of Merging Stellar-mass Black Hole Binaries by Gravitational-wave Emission in Active Galactic Nucleus Disks</title>

Many stellar-mass black holes (sBHs) are expected to orbit supermassive black holes at galactic centers. For galaxies with active galactic nuclei, it is likely that the sBHs reside in a disk. We study the formation of sBH binaries via gravitational-wave emission in such disks. We examine analytically the dynamics of two sBHs orbiting a supermassive black hole, estimate the capture cross section, and derive the eccentricity distribution of bound binaries at different frequency bands. We find that the majority of the merging sBH binaries, assembled in this manner, can be measured as highly eccentric, detectable in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) band from their formation, with (1 − e) ≪ 1, through their circularization and up to their merger; the remaining binaries circularize to small eccentricities (e ≲ 0.3) before entering the LVK band. More eccentric mergers would be observed for sBHs with higher random velocities, closer to the supermassive black hole, or at lower observing frequency bands, as planned in future gravitational-wave detectors such as the Einstein Telescope and LISA.

<title>A Parametric Study of the SASI Comparing General Relativistic and Nonrelativistic Treatments*</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present numerical results from a parameter study of the standing accretion shock instability (SASI), investigating the impact of general relativity (GR) on the dynamics. Using GR hydrodynamics with GR gravity, and nonrelativistic (NR) hydrodynamics with Newtonian gravity, in an idealized model setting, we vary the initial radius of the shock, and by varying its mass and radius in concert, the proto-neutron star compactness. We investigate four compactnesses expected in a post-bounce core-collapse supernova (CCSN). We find that GR leads to a longer SASI oscillation period, with ratios between the GR and NR cases as large as 1.29 for the highest-compactness suite. We also find that GR leads to a slower SASI growth rate, with ratios between the GR and NR cases as low as 0.47 for the highest-compactness suite. We discuss implications of our results for CCSN simulations.

<title>Search for Continuous and Transient Neutrino Emission Associated with IceCube’s Highest-energy Tracks: An 11 yr Analysis</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
IceCube alert events are neutrinos with a moderate-to-high probability of having astrophysical origin. In this study, we analyze 11 yr of IceCube data and investigate 122 alert events and a selection of high-energy tracks detected between 2009 and the end of 2021. This high-energy event selection (alert events + high-energy tracks) has an average probability of ≥0.5 of being of astrophysical origin. We search for additional continuous and transient neutrino emission within the high-energy events’ error regions. We find no evidence for significant continuous neutrino emission from any of the alert event directions. The only locally significant neutrino emission is the transient emission associated with the blazar TXS 0506+056, with a local significance of 3σ, which confirms previous IceCube studies. When correcting for 122 test positions, the global p-value is 0.156 and compatible with the background hypothesis. We constrain the total continuous flux emitted from all 122 test positions at 100 TeV to be below 1.2 × 10−15 (TeV cm2 s)−1 at 90% confidence assuming an E−2 spectrum. This corresponds to 4.5% of IceCube’s astrophysical diffuse flux. Overall, we find no indication that alert events in general are linked to lower-energetic continuous or transient neutrino emission.

The investigation of the phase state of dense matter is hindered by complications of first-principle nonperturbative quantum chromodynamics. By performing the first consistent general-relativistic calculations of tidal-excited g-mode of neutron stars with a first-order strong interaction phase transition in the high-density core, we demonstrate that the gravitational-wave signal during binary neutron star inspiral probes their innermost hadron-quark transition and provides potent constraints from present and future gravitational-wave detectors.

<title>Intermittency in the Magnetic Hump in the VLISM</title>

Voyager 1 has been moving through the very local interstellar medium (VLISM) for ∼1 solar cycle, from 122.58 au on 2012/DOY 238 (August 25) to 158.5 au on 2023.0. A magnetic hump was observed, beginning with an abrupt increase (jump) in the magnetic field strength B and proton density N by a factor of 1.35 and 1.36, respectively, in the course of ∼8 days, ending at ∼2020/DOY 147, after which it remained above the pre-jump levels for 2.6 yr, and it is still increasing. Unlike the three previous jumps, which were followed by a slow decrease in B, B in the magnetic hump continued to increase to a maximum value ∼0.56 nT at ∼2021/DOY 146.7. This paper discusses the intermittency of the magnetic field components and strength in the magnetic hump, and compares them with previous values in the VLISM. We consider the intermittency of the increments of B and its components observed on a scale of one day. The distribution function (the Tsallis distribution or q-distribution function) of the increments of hourly averages of the components of B had a Gaussian core associated with randomness in the observations, and it had two symmetric tails associated with the observed intermittency. The parameters q-dBR1, q-dBT1, and q-dBN1 increased slightly to a broad maximum with q = ∼1.4 between 2018 and 2019, and then decreased to q ∼ 1 (corresponding to no intermittency) in 2022. The Z-component of the magnetic field is within 4 ± 4 counts (0.02 nT ± 0.02 nT).

<title>UNCOVER Spectroscopy Confirms the Surprising Ubiquity of Active Galactic Nuclei in Red Sources at z > 5</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The James Webb Space Telescope is revealing a new population of dust-reddened broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGN) at redshifts z ≳ 5. Here we present deep NIRSpec/Prism spectroscopy from the Cycle 1 Treasury program Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam ObserVations before the Epoch of Reionization (UNCOVER) of 15 AGN candidates selected to be compact, with red continua in the rest-frame optical but with blue slopes in the UV. From NIRCam photometry alone, they could have been dominated by dusty star formation or an AGN. Here we show that the majority of the compact red sources in UNCOVER are dust-reddened AGN: 60% show definitive evidence for broad-line Hα with a FWHM > 2000 km s −1, 20% of the current data are inconclusive, and 20% are brown dwarf stars. We propose an updated photometric criterion to select red z > 5 AGN that excludes brown dwarfs and is expected to yield >80% AGN. Remarkably, among all zphot > 5 galaxies with F277W – F444W > 1 in UNCOVER at least 33% are AGN regardless of compactness, climbing to at least 80% AGN for sources with F277W – F444W > 1.6. The confirmed AGN have black hole masses of 107–109M⊙. While their UV luminosities (−16 > MUV > −20 AB mag) are low compared to UV-selected AGN at these epochs, consistent with percent-level scattered AGN light or low levels of unobscured star formation, the inferred bolometric luminosities are typical of 107–109M⊙ black holes radiating at ∼10%–40% the Eddington limit. The number densities are surprisingly high at ∼10−5 Mpc−3 mag−1, 100 times more common than the faintest UV-selected quasars, while accounting for ∼1% of the UV-selected galaxies. While their UV faintness suggests they may not contribute strongly to reionization, their ubiquity poses challenges to models of black hole growth.

<title>The Plasma β in Quiet Sun Regions: Multi-instrument View</title>

A joint campaign of several spaceborne and ground-based observatories, such as the GREGOR solar telescope, the Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS), and the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (Hinode Observing Plan 381, 2019 October 11–22) was conducted to investigate the plasma β in quiet Sun regions. In this work, we focus on 2019 October 13, 17, and 19 to obtain the plasma β at different heights through the solar atmosphere based on multiheight observational data. We obtained temperature, density, and magnetic field estimates from the GREGOR High-resolution Fast Imager, Infrared Spectrograph, Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph, and EIS and complementary data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA). Using observational data and models (e.g., FALC and PFSS), we determined the plasma β in the photosphere, chromosphere, transition region, and corona. The obtained plasma β values lie inside the expected ranges through the solar atmosphere. However, at EIS and AIA coronal heights (from 1.03 to 1.20 R⊙), plasma β values appear in the limit defined by Gary; such behavior was previously reported by Rodríguez Gómez et al. Additionally, we obtained the plasma β in the solar photosphere at different optical depths from to –2.0. These values decrease with optical depth. This work provides a complete picture of plasma β in quiet Sun regions through the solar atmosphere, which is a prerequisite of a better understanding of the plasma dynamics at the base of the solar corona.

We use LCOGT observations (MJD 59434−59600) with a total exposure time of ≃50 hr and a median cadence of 0.5 day to measure the interband time delays (with respect to u) in the g, r, and i continua of a highly variable active galactic nucleus (AGN), 6dFGS gJ022550.0-060145. We also calculate the expected time delays of the X-ray reprocessing of a static Shakura–Sunyaev disk according to the source's luminosity and virial black hole mass; the two parameters are measured from the optical spectrum of our spectroscopic observation via the Lijiang 2.4 m telescope. It is found that the ratio of the measured time delays to the predicted ones is . With optical light curves (MJD 53650–59880) from our new LCOGT and archival Zwicky Transient Facility, Pan-STARRS, Catalina Sky Survey, and ATLAS observations, and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) data (MJD 55214−59055), we also measured time delays between WISE W1/W2 and the optical emission. W1 and W2 have time delays (with respect to V), days and days in the rest frame, respectively; hence, the dusty torus of 6dFGS gJ022550.0-060145 should be compact. The time delays of the W1 and W2 bands are higher than the dusty torus size–luminosity relationship of Lyu et al. By comparing the infrared and optical variability amplitude, we find that the dust-covering factors of the W1 and W2 emission regions are 0.7 and 0.6, respectively. Future broad emission-line reverberation mapping of this target and the results of this work enable us to determine the sizes of the AGN main components simultaneously.

<title>JWST-MIRI Spectroscopy of Warm Molecular Emission and Variability in the AS 209 Disk</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present MIRI Medium-resolution Spectrograph observations of the large, multi-gapped protoplanetary disk around the T Tauri star AS 209. The observations reveal hundreds of water vapor lines from 4.9–25.5 μm toward the inner ∼1 au in the disk, including the first detection of rovibrational water emission in this disk. The spectrum is dominated by hot (∼800 K) water vapor and OH gas, with only marginal detections of CO2, HCN, and a possible colder water vapor component. Using slab models with a detailed treatment of opacities and line overlap, we retrieve the column density, emitting area, and excitation temperature of water vapor and OH, and provide upper limits for the observable mass of other molecules. Compared to MIRI spectra of other T Tauri disks, the inner disk of AS 209 does not appear to be atypically depleted in CO2 nor HCN. Based on Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph observations, we further find evidence for molecular emission variability over a 10 yr baseline. Water, OH, and CO2 line luminosities have decreased by factors of 2–4 in the new MIRI epoch, yet there are minimal continuum emission variations. The origin of this variability is yet to be understood.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the outflows detected in HOPS 373SW, a protostar undergoing a modest 30% brightness increase at 850 μm. Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of shock tracers, including SiO 8–7, CH3OH 7k–6k, and 12CO 3–2 emission, reveal several outflow features around HOPS 373SW. The knots in the extremely high-velocity SiO emission reveal the wiggle of the jet, for which a simple model derives a 37° inclination angle of the jet to the plane of the sky, a jet velocity of 90 km s−1, and a period of 50 yr. The slow SiO and CH3OH emission traces U-shaped bow shocks surrounding the two CO outflows. One outflow is associated with the high-velocity jets, while the other is observed to be close to the plane of the sky. The misaligned outflows imply that previous episodic accretion events have either reoriented HOPS 373SW or that it is an unresolved protostellar binary system with misaligned outflows.

<title>Upstream Plasma Waves and Downstream Magnetic Reconnection at a Reforming Quasi-parallel Shock</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
With the help of a two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulation model, we investigate the long-time evolution (near , where Ωi0 is the ion gyrofrequency in the upstream) of a quasi-parallel shock. Some of the upstream ions are reflected by the shock front, and their interactions with the incident ions excite low-frequency magnetosonic waves in the upstream. Detailed analyses have shown that the dominant wave mode is caused by the resonant ion–ion beam instability, and the wavelength can reach tens of ion inertial lengths. Although these plasma waves are directed toward the upstream in the upstream plasma frame, they are brought by the incident plasma flow toward the shock front, and their amplitude is enhanced during the approaching. The interaction of the upstream plasma waves with the shock leads to the cyclic reformation of the shock front, and the reformation period is slightly larger than 10 . When crossing the shock front, these large-amplitude plasma waves are compressed and evolve into current sheets in the transition region of the shock. At last, magnetic reconnection occurs in these current sheets, accompanying the generation of magnetic islands. Simultaneously, there still exist plasma waves of another kind, with the wavelength of several ion inertial lengths in the ramp of the shock, which are excited by the nonresonant ion–ion beam instability. The current sheets in the transition region are distorted and broken into several segments when the plasma waves of this kind are transmitted into the downstream, where magnetic reconnection and the generated islands have a much smaller size. No obvious ion flow can be observed around some X-lines produced in the magnetic reconnection, and this implies that electron-only reconnection may occur.

Understanding the magnetic fields of the Sun is essential for unraveling the underlying mechanisms driving solar activity. Integrating topological data analysis techniques into these investigations can provide valuable insights into the intricate structures of magnetic fields, enhancing our comprehension of solar activity and its implications. In this study, we explore what persistent homology can offer in the analysis of solar magnetograms, with the objective of introducing a novel tool that will serve as the foundation for further studies of magnetic structures at the solar surface. By combining various filtration methods of the persistent homology analysis, we conduct an analysis of solar magnetograms that captures the broad magnetic scene, involving a mixture of positive and negative polarities. This analysis is applied to observations of both quiet-Sun and active regions, taken with the Hinode/Solar Optical Telescope and SDO/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager, respectively. Our primary focus is on analyzing the properties of the spatial structures and features of the magnetic fields identified through these techniques. The results show that persistent diagrams can encode the spatial structural complexity of the magnetic flux of active regions by identifying the isolated, connected, and interacting features. They facilitate the classification of active regions based on their morphology and the detection and quantification of interacting structures of opposing polarities, such as δ spots. The small-scale events in the quiet Sun, such as magnetic flux cancellation and emergence, are also revealed in persistent diagrams and can be studied by observing the evolution of the plots and tracking the relevant features.

<title>The Impact of Breathing Pulses during Core Helium Burning on the Core Chemical Structure and Pulsations of Hydrogen-rich Atmosphere White Dwarfs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Breathing pulses are mixing episodes that could develop during the core helium-burning phase of low- and intermediate-mass stars. The occurrence of breathing pulses is expected to bear consequences on the formation and evolution of white dwarfs, particularly on the core chemical structure, which can be probed by asteroseismology. We aim to explore the consequences of breathing pulses on the chemical profiles and pulsational properties of variable white dwarf stars with hydrogen-rich envelopes, known as ZZ Ceti stars. We compute stellar models with masses of 1.0M⊙ and 2.5M⊙ in the zero-age main sequence and evolve them through the core helium-burning phase to the thermal pulses on the asymptotic giant branch, and finally to advanced stages of white dwarf cooling. We compare the chemical structure of the core of white dwarfs whose progenitors have experienced breathing pulses during the core helium-burning phase with the case in which breathing pulses have not occurred. We find that when breathing pulses occur, the white dwarf cores are larger and the central abundances of oxygen are higher than for the case in which the breathing pulses are suppressed, in line with previous studies. However, the occurrence of breathing pulses is not sufficient to explain the large cores and the excessive oxygen abundances that characterize recently derived asteroseismological models of pulsating white dwarfs. We find absolute differences of up to ∼30 s when we compare pulsation periods of white dwarfs coming from progenitors that have experienced breathing pulses with the case in which the progenitors have not suffered breathing pulses.

<title>The Relationships between Active Galactic Nucleus Power and Molecular Gas Mass within 500 pc of the Center of Elliptical Galaxies</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad28c0</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad28c0</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The physical quantity that directly controls the feedback of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in elliptical galaxies remains to be determined. The discovery of molecular gas around the AGNs suggests that the gas is fueling the AGNs. Therefore, we analyze Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array data for the CO line (J = 1–0, 2–1, 3–2) emission and estimate the mass of molecular gas within 500 pc of the center of 12 noncentral elliptical galaxies (NCEGs) and 10 of the brightest cluster galaxies. We find that the mass (Mmol ∼ 105–109M☉) is correlated with the jet power of their AGNs, which is represented by , although NCEGs alone do not show the correlation. We also find that Mmol is correlated with the AGN continuum luminosities at ∼1.4 GHz (L1.4) and ∼100–300 GHz (Lcon). Since Pcav reflects galactic-scale, long-term AGN activity, while the continuum luminosities reflect local (≲500 pc), short-term AGN activity, our results suggest that AGN activity depends on the amount of gas, regardless of its timescale. On the other hand, we cannot find a clear correlation between the mass of the black holes in the AGNs (MBH) and Pcav. This suggests that Mmol, rather than MBH, is the main factor controlling AGN activity. We confirm that the origin of the continuum emission from the AGNs at ∼1.4–300 GHz is mostly synchrotron radiation.

<title>Galactic Diffuse Emission from Radio to Ultra-high-energy γ-Rays in Light of Up-to-date Cosmic-Ray Measurements</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Cosmic rays (CRs) travel throughout the Galaxy, leaving traces from radio to ultra-high-energy γ-rays due to interactions with the interstellar gas, radiation field, and magnetic field. Therefore, it is necessary to utilize multiwavelength investigations on the Galactic diffuse emission to shed light on the physics of CR production and propagation. In this work, we present a spatially dependent propagation scenario, taking account of a local source contribution, while making allowances for an additional CR component freshly accelerated near their sources. In this picture, after reproducing the particle measurements at the solar system, we calculated the intensity and compared the spectral energy distribution to observations from Fermi-LAT and LHAASO-KM2A in the γ-ray band, and from WMAP and Planck among other radio surveys at lower energies. Multiband data considered in conjunction, the former comparison exhibits sufficiently good consistency in favor of our model, while the latter calls for improvement in data subtraction and processing. From this standpoint, there remains potential for advanced observations at energies from milli-eVs to MeVs toward the Galactic plane, in order to evaluate our model further and more comprehensively in the future.

<title>Aperture and Resolution Effects on Ultraviolet Star-forming Properties: Insights from Local Galaxies and Implications for High-redshift Observations*</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad1dde</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad1dde</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present an analysis of the effects of spectral resolution and aperture scale on derived galaxy properties using far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectra of local star-forming galaxies from the International Ultraviolet Explorer (R ∼ 250, field of view (FOV) ∼ 10″ × 20″) and Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope (R ∼ 15,000, FOV ∼ 2.″5). Using these spectra, we measured FUV luminosities, spectral slopes, dust attenuation, and equivalent widths. We find that galaxies with one dominant stellar cluster have FUV properties that are independent of aperture size, while galaxies with multiple bright clusters are sensitive to the total light fraction captured by the aperture. Additionally, we find significant correlations between the strength of stellar and interstellar absorption lines and metallicity, indicating metallicity-dependent line-driven stellar winds and interstellar macroscopic gas flows shape stellar and interstellar spectral lines, respectively. The observed line strength versus metallicity relation of stellar-wind lines agrees with the prediction of population synthesis models for young starbursts. In particular, measurements of the strong stellar C ivλλ1548, 1550 line provide an opportunity to determine stellar abundances as a complement to gas-phase abundances. We provide a relation between the equivalent width of the C iv line and the oxygen abundance of the galaxy. We discuss this relation in terms of the stellar-wind properties of massive stars. As the driving lines in stellar winds are mostly ionized iron species, the C iv line may eventually offer a method to probe α-element-to-iron ratios in star-forming galaxies once consistent models with nonsolar abundance ratios are available. These results have important implications for the galaxy-scale, low-resolution observations of high-redshift galaxies from JWST (R ∼ 100–3500).

<title>Vacuum Ultraviolet Single Photon Ionization and Decomposition of 2-Aminopropionitrile in Astrophysical Objects</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad1522</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad1522</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The molecule 2-aminopropionitrile (2-APN; H3CCH(NH2)CN) is a chiral precursor of the amino acid alanine and could play an important role in the emergence of the homochirality of life. To date, 2-APN has not yet been detected in the interstellar medium. To address the question of its absence, possibly through destruction by vacuum ultraviolet radiation in astrophysical media, we studied its photoionization and dissociative photoionization in the 9–14 eV (89–137 nm) energy range using photoelectron–photoion coincidence spectroscopy with velocity map imaging. Density functional theory calculations were performed at the PBE0/aug-cc-pVTZ level to determine structures for the various cationic fragments identified experimentally. Their appearance energies were calculated. The adiabatic ionization energy (AIE) of 2-APN is AIE = (9.85±0.01) eV and the appearance energy (AE) of the major fragment ion N≡CC(H)NH2+ is AE = (10.57±0.01) eV. Both ions, 2-APN+ and N≡CC(H)NH2+, make up more than 90% of the formed ions. N≡CC(H)NH2+, an isomer of the protonated HCN dimer, is also formed with high yield in the dissociative photoionization of aminoacetonitrile (NH2CH2CN), another α-aminonitrile observed in Sgr B2(N). Photoion yield spectra have been calibrated to absolute ionization cross sections. From these, we derive photoionization rates in several typical radiation fields relevant to different astrophysical objects. The rates show that, under almost all explored radiation fields, dissociative ionization is the dominant pathway for photoionization, leading to the loss of a methyl group (CH3) to form the planar thermodynamically stable amino cyano methylidynium ion N≡CC(H)NH2+. The observed absence of 2-APN in Sgr B2 could thus be due to dominant dissociative photoionization.

<title>ALMA-LEGUS. II. The Influence of Subgalactic Environments on Molecular Cloud Properties</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We compare the molecular cloud properties in subgalactic regions of two galaxies, barred spiral NGC 1313, which is forming many massive clusters, and flocculent spiral NGC 7793, which is forming significantly fewer massive clusters despite having a similar star formation rate to NGC 1313. We find that there are larger variations in cloud properties between different regions within each galaxy than there are between the galaxies on a global scale, especially for NGC 1313. There are higher masses, line widths, pressures, and virial parameters in the arms of NGC 1313 and the center of NGC 7793 than in the interarm and outer regions of the galaxies. The massive cluster formation of NGC 1313 may be driven by its greater variation in environment, allowing more clouds with the necessary conditions to emerge, although no one parameter seems primarily responsible for the difference in star formation. Meanwhile NGC 7793 has clouds that are as massive and have as much kinetic energy as the clouds in the arms of NGC 1313, but have densities and pressures more similar to those in the interarm regions and so are less inclined to collapse and form stars. The cloud properties in NGC 1313 and NGC 7793 suggest that spiral arms, bars, interarm regions, and flocculent spirals each represent distinct environments with regard to molecular cloud populations. We see surprisingly little difference in surface density between the regions, suggesting that the differences in surface densities frequently seen between arm and interarm regions in lower-resolution studies are indicative of the sparsity of molecular clouds, rather than differences in their true surface density.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a comparative study of the molecular gas in two galaxies from the Legacy ExtraGalactic UV Survey (LEGUS) sample: barred spiral NGC 1313 and flocculent spiral NGC 7793. These two galaxies have similar masses, metallicities, and star formation rates, but NGC 1313 is forming significantly more massive star clusters than NGC 7793, especially young massive clusters (<10 Myr, >104M⊙). Using Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) CO(2–1) observations of the two galaxies with the same sensitivity and resolution (13 pc), we directly compare the molecular gas in these two similar galaxies to determine the physical conditions responsible for their large disparity in cluster formation. By fitting size–line width relations for the clouds in each galaxy, we find that NGC 1313 has a higher intercept than NGC 7793, implying that its clouds have higher kinetic energies at a given size scale. NGC 1313 also has more clouds near virial equilibrium than NGC 7793, which may be connected to its higher rate of massive cluster formation. However, these virially bound clouds do not show a stronger correlation with young clusters than with the general cloud population. We find surprisingly small differences between the distributions of molecular cloud populations in the two galaxies, though the largest of those differences is that NGC 1313 has higher surface densities and lower freefall times.

<title>Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk). XIV. Flared Dust Distribution and Viscous Accretion Heating of the Disk around R CrA IRS 7B-a</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad1f57</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We performed radiative transfer calculations and observing simulations to reproduce the 1.3 mm dust-continuum and C18O (2–1) images in the Class I protostar R CrA IRS7B-a, observed with the ALMA Large Program “Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk).” We found that a dust disk model passively heated by the central protostar cannot reproduce the observed peak brightness temperature of the 1.3 mm continuum emission (∼195 K), regardless of the assumptions about the dust opacity. Our calculation suggests that viscous accretion heating in the disk is required to reproduce the observed high brightness temperature. The observed intensity profile of the 1.3 mm dust-continuum emission along the disk minor axis is skewed toward the far side of the disk. Our modeling reveals that this asymmetric intensity distribution requires flaring of the dust along the disk vertical direction with the scale height following h/r ∼ r0.3 as a function of radius. These results are in sharp contrast to those of Class II disks, which show geometrically flat dust distributions and lower dust temperatures. From our modeling of the C18O (2–1) emission, the outermost radius of the gas disk is estimated to be ∼80 au, which is larger than that of the dust disk (∼62 au), to reproduce the observed distribution of the C18O (2–1) emission in IRS 7B-a. Our modeling unveils a hot and thick dust disk plus a larger gas disk around one of the eDisk targets, which could be applicable to other protostellar sources in contrast to more evolved sources.

<title>The Influence of Stellar Rotation in Binary Systems on Core-collapse Supernova Progenitors and Multimessenger Signals</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The detailed structure of core-collapse supernova progenitors is crucial for studying supernova explosion engines and the corresponding multimessenger signals. In this paper, we investigate the influence of stellar rotation on binary systems consisting of a 30M⊙ donor star and a 20M⊙ accretor using the MESA stellar evolution code. We find that through mass transfer in binary systems, fast-rotating red- and blue-supergiant progenitors can be formed within a certain range of the initial orbital periods, although the correlation is not linear. We also find that even with the same initial mass ratio of the binary system, the resulting final masses of the collapsars, the iron core masses, the compactness parameters, and the final rotational rates can vary widely and are sensitive to the initial orbital periods. For instance, the progenitors with strong convection form a thinner Si shell and a wider O shell compared to those in single-star systems. In addition, we conduct 2D self-consistent core-collapse supernova simulations with neutrino transport for these rotating progenitors derived from binary stellar evolution. We find that the neutrino and gravitational-wave signatures of these binary progenitors could exhibit significant variations. Progenitors with larger compactness parameters produce more massive proto-neutron stars, have higher mass accretion rates, and emit brighter neutrino luminosity and louder gravitational emissions. Finally, we observe stellar-mass black hole formation in some of our failed exploding models.

<title>A New Route to Massive Hot Subdwarfs: Common Envelope Ejection from Asymptotic Giant Branch Stars</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The hot subdwarf O/B stars (sdO/Bs) are known as extreme horizontal branch stars, which is of great importance in stellar evolution theory. The sdO/Bs are generally thought to have a helium-burning core and a thin hydrogen envelope (Menv < 0.02 M⊙). In the canonical binary evolution scenario, sdO/Bs are considered to be the stripped cores of red giants. However, such a scenario cannot explain the recently discovered sdO/B binary SMSS J1920, where the strong Ca H and K lines in the spectrum are found. It suggests that this binary likely originated from the recent ejection of the common envelope (CE). In this work, we propose a new formation channel of massive sdO/Bs, namely, sdO/Bs produced from a CE ejection process with an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star (hereafter the AGB CE channel). We constructed the evolutionary model of sdO/Bs and successfully explained most of the important observed parameters of the sdO/B star in SMSS J1920, including the evolutionary age, sdO/B mass, effective temperature, surface gravity, and surface helium abundance. The minimum sdO/B mass produced from the AGB CE channel is about 0.48 M⊙. The evolutionary tracks in the plane may explain a fraction of the observational samples with high and low . Considering the wind mass loss of sdO/Bs, the model could produce helium-rich hot subdwarfs with .

<title>Probing the Global 21 cm Background by Velocity-induced Dipole and Quadrupole Anisotropies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The motion of an observer in the rest frame of the cosmic 21 cm background induces an anisotropy in the observed background, even when the background is isotropic. The induced anisotropy includes a dipole and a quadrupole, in the order decreasing in amplitude. If observed, these multipole anisotropies can be used as additional probes of the spectral shape of the global 21 cm background for mitigating the ambiguity in the monopole spectrum probed by single-element radio telescopes such as EDGES and SARAS. This could also help with understanding the astrophysical and cosmological processes that occurred during the cosmic dawn and the epoch of reionization, and even improve the estimation of the solar velocity and the foreground spectra. Here, we study the feasibility of such observations and present science drivers for the measurement of the 21 cm dipole and quadrupole. We find that future 21 cm experiments can in principle detect the 21 cm dipole to high significance, potentially improving measurement accuracy of Earth velocity with respect to the Milky Way, galactic, and extragalactic foreground monopole spectra by an order of magnitude, as well as improving 21 cm astrophysical parameters by 2%–5%.

<title>The Dynamics of Magnetic Rossby Waves in the Quasigeostrophic Shallow Water Magnetohydrodynamic Theory</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad22db</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad22db</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The dynamics of magnetic Rossby waves are investigated by applying a quasigeostrophic shallow water magnetohydrodynamic system, which is linearized with respect to both uniform background flow and uniform magnetic field. Due to the influence of the free surface divergence, the phase speed for magnetic Rossby waves can be either a monotonically increasing or a monotonically decreasing function, and the resulting difference between the group velocity and the phase speed can be either positive or negative. This is determined by whether the corresponding Alfvén wave speed is the upper limit or not. Differently, the phase speed is always a monotonically increasing function and the difference between the group velocity and the phase speed is always positive for incompressible magnetic Rossby waves. Multiplying a factor, the wavenumber vector shares the same endpoint with the group velocity vector. The endpoint moves on a cycle that has a center at the k-axis and is tangent to the l-axis in the wavenumber space. The circle is quite similar to the Longuet-Higgins circle for Rossby waves on Earth’s atmosphere and ocean. The fundamental dynamics is the theoretical basis for deeply understanding the meridional energy transport by waves and the interaction between waves and the background states.

<title>Zone of Preferential Heating for Minor Ions in the Solar Wind</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad23ea</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The properties of minor ions in the solar wind are important indicators of the state of the solar corona and the heating processes it undergoes as it expands. Evidence of preferential heating of minor ions has been observed in the solar wind, and is believed to be active up to a certain radial boundary, beyond which thermalization due to Coulomb collisions predominates. Building on previous works that calculated the location of this boundary for alpha particles, this work calculates the outer radial boundary of the zone of preferential heating for selected heavy ions in the solar wind. This analysis uses ion data from the Solar Wind Ion Composition Spectrometer and proton data from the Solar Wind Electron, Proton, and Alpha Monitor aboard the Advance Composition Explorer spanning the years from 1998 through to 2011. Observations of proton and ion temperatures, velocities, and densities, and fixed parameters derived from temperature, density, and velocity scaling laws are used in a model function to predict the radial boundary and excess temperature at the boundary via reduction of the χ2/degrees of freedom statistic. In this study, the values of the radial boundary of the preferential heating zone were quite high when compared to what was previously found for alpha particles, but a clear scaling relationship between excess temperature and ion properties was observed.

<title>Resolved Measurements of the CO-to-H2 Conversion Factor in 37 Nearby Galaxies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We measure the CO-to-H2 conversion factor (αCO) in 37 galaxies at 2 kpc resolution, using the dust surface density inferred from far-infrared emission as a tracer of the gas surface density and assuming a constant dust-to-metal ratio. In total, we have ∼790 and ∼610 independent measurements of αCO for CO (2–1) and (1–0), respectively. The mean values for αCO (2–1) and αCO (1–0) are and , respectively. The CO-intensity-weighted mean is 5.69 for αCO (2–1) and 3.33 for αCO (1–0). We examine how αCO scales with several physical quantities, e.g., the star formation rate (SFR), stellar mass, and dust-mass-weighted average interstellar radiation field strength ( ). Among them, , ΣSFR, and the integrated CO intensity (WCO) have the strongest anticorrelation with spatially resolved αCO. We provide linear regression results to αCO for all quantities tested. At galaxy-integrated scales, we observe significant correlations between αCO and WCO, metallicity, , and ΣSFR. We also find that αCO in each galaxy decreases with the stellar mass surface density (Σ⋆) in high-surface-density regions (Σ⋆ ≥ 100 M⊙ pc−2), following the power-law relations and . The power-law index is insensitive to the assumed dust-to-metal ratio. We interpret the decrease in αCO with increasing Σ⋆ as a result of higher velocity dispersion compared to isolated, self-gravitating clouds due to the additional gravitational force from stellar sources, which leads to the reduction in αCO. The decrease in αCO at high Σ⋆ is important for accurately assessing molecular gas content and star formation efficiency in the centers of galaxies, which bridge “Milky Way–like” to “starburst-like” conversion factors.

<title>The 230 GHz Variability of Numerical Models of Sagittarius A*. I. Parameter Surveys on Varying the Ion-to-electron Temperature Ratio Under Strongly Magnetized Conditions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The 230 GHz lightcurves of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) predicted by general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics and general relativistic ray-tracing (GRRT) models by the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration have higher variability MΔT compared to observations. In this series of papers, we explore the origin of such large brightness variability. In this first paper, we performed large GRRT parameter surveys that span from the optically thin to the optically thick regimes, covering the ion-to-electron temperature ratio under strongly magnetized conditions, RLow, from 1 to 60. We find that increasing RLow can lead to either an increase or a reduction in MΔT depending on the other model parameters, making it consistent with the observed variability of Sgr A* in some cases. Our analysis of GRRT image snapshots finds that the major contribution to the large MΔT for the RLow = 1 models comes from the photon ring. However, secondary contributions from the accretion flow are also visible depending on the spin parameter. Our work demonstrates the importance of the electron temperature used for modeling radiatively inefficient accretion flows and places new constraints on the ion-to-electron temperature ratio. A more in-depth analysis for understanding the dependencies of MΔT on RLow will be performed in subsequent papers.

<title>The Evolution of Photospheric Magnetic Fields at the Footpoints of Reconnected Structures in the Solar Atmosphere</title>

Magnetic reconnection is believed to play an important role in the release and conversion of energy among magnetized plasma systems. So far, we have been unable to understand under what conditions magnetic reconnection can take place. Based on observations from the New Vacuum Solar Telescope and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), we study 16 magnetic reconnection events, and each event has a clear X-type configuration consisting of two sets of atmospheric structures. We focus on 38 footpoints that are relevant to these structures and can be clearly determined. By using SDO/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager line-of-sight magnetograms, we track the field evolution of these footpoints. Prior to the occurrence of magnetic reconnection, the associated fields at the footpoints underwent convergence and shear motions, and thus became enhanced and complex. During the converging period, the rates of increase of the mean magnetic flux densities (MFDs) at these footpoints are 0.03–0.25 hr−1. While the unsigned mean MFDs are 70–300 G, magnetic reconnection in the solar atmosphere takes place. Subsequently, the photospheric fields of these footpoints diffuse and weaken, with rates of decrease of the MFDs from 0.03 to 0.18 hr−1. These results suggest that, due to the photospheric dynamical evolution at the footpoints, the footpoint MFDs increase from a small value to a large one, and the corresponding atmospheric magnetic fields become complicated and nonpotential; then reconnection happens and it releases the accumulated magnetic field energy. Our study supports the conjecture that magnetic reconnection releases free magnetic energy stored in the nonpotential fields.

<title>Study of Plasma Heating Processes in a Coronal Mass Ejection–driven Shock Sheath Region Observed with the Metis Coronagraph</title>

On 2021 September 28, a C1.6 class flare occurred in active region NOAA 12871, located approximately at 27°S and 51°W on the solar disk with respect to Earth’s point of view. This event was followed by a partial halo coronal mass ejection (CME) that caused the deflection of preexisting coronal streamer structures, as observed in visible-light coronagraphic images. An associated type II radio burst was also detected by both space- and ground-based instruments, indicating the presence of a coronal shock propagating into interplanetary space. By using H i Lyα (121.6 nm) observations from the Metis coronagraph on board the Solar Orbiter mission, we demonstrate for the first time the capability of UV imaging to provide, via a Doppler dimming technique, an upper limit estimate of the evolution of the 2D proton kinetic temperature in the CME-driven shock sheath as it passes through the field of view of the instrument. Our results suggest that over the 22 minutes of observations, the shock propagated with a speed decreasing from about 740 ± 110 km s−1 to 400 ± 60 km s−1. At the same time, the postshock proton temperatures peaked at latitudes around the shock nose and decreased with time from about 6.8 ± 1.01 MK to 3.1 ± 0.47 MK. The application of the Rankine–Hugoniot jump conditions demonstrates that these temperatures are higher by a factor of about 2–5 than those expected from simple adiabatic compression, implying that significant shock heating is still going on at these distances.

<title>Intermittency and Dissipative Structures Arising from Relativistic Magnetized Turbulence</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Kinetic simulations of relativistic turbulence have significantly advanced our understanding of turbulent particle acceleration. Recent progress has highlighted the need for an updated acceleration theory that can account for particle acceleration within the plasma’s coherent structures. Here, we investigate how intermittency modeling connects statistical fluctuations in turbulence to regions of high-energy dissipation. This connection is established by employing a generalized She–Leveque model to characterize the exponents ζp for the structure functions . The fitting of the scaling exponents provides us with a measure of the codimension of the dissipative structures, for which we subsequently determine the filling fraction. We perform our analysis for a range of magnetizations σ and relative fluctuation amplitudes δB0/B0. We find that increasing values of σ and δB0/B0 allow the turbulent cascade to break sheetlike structures into smaller regions of dissipation that resemble chains of flux ropes. However, as their dissipation measure increases, the dissipative regions become less volume filling. With this work, we aim to inform future turbulent acceleration theories that incorporate particle energization from interactions with coherent structures within relativistic turbulence.

<title>Tests of Disk-locking in T Tauri Stars of the Orion Nebula Cluster</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We look for specific correlations predicted by magnetospheric accretion models for young stars that assume disk-locking using stellar and accretion parameters derived from low-resolution HST-STIS spectra of 33 T Tauri stars in the Orion Nebula Cluster. Our results provide strong support for the correlation predicted by a model that does not constrain the stellar magnetic field to a specific geometry, while little support is found for the correlation that assumes a dipolar stellar field geometry. These results support the conclusions from similar studies of older T Tauri stars in Taurus and NGC 2264 and underscore the role that trapped flux plays in regulating a young star’s angular momentum as detailed by Ostriker & Shu. While our targets were all selected to be accreting young stars based on photometric indices, approximately half of the observed stars show no significant signs of accretion in our spectra, illustrating the difficulty in using photometric indices to find accreting stars and the possible role that variability has in the appearance of spectra in young stars. Although values of accretion luminosity derived from our models agree well with those derived from Hβ luminosity for strongly accreting stars, we find that accretion luminosity derived from Hβ luminosity is not a reliable parameter for discriminating between weakly accreting and nonaccreting T Tauri stars due to chromospheric emission that is likely present in all T Tauri stars.

<title>Extending a Physics-informed Machine-learning Network for Superresolution Studies of Rayleigh–Bénard Convection</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Advancing our understanding of astrophysical turbulence is bottlenecked by the limited resolution of numerical simulations that may not fully sample scales in the inertial range. Machine-learning (ML) techniques have demonstrated promise in upscaling resolution in both image analysis and numerical simulations (i.e., superresolution). Here we employ and further develop a physics-constrained convolutional neural network ML model called “MeshFreeFlowNet” (MFFN) for superresolution studies of turbulent systems. The model is trained on both the simulation images and the evaluated partial differential equations (PDEs), making it sensitive to the underlying physics of a particular fluid system. We develop a framework for 2D turbulent Rayleigh–Bénard convection generated with the Dedalus code by modifying the MFFN architecture to include the full set of simulation PDEs and the boundary conditions. Our training set includes fully developed turbulence sampling Rayleigh numbers (Ra) of Ra = 106–1010. We evaluate the success of the learned simulations by comparing the power spectra of the direct Dedalus simulation to the predicted model output and compare both ground-truth and predicted power spectral inertial range scalings to theoretical predictions. We find that the updated network performs well at all Ra studied here in recovering large-scale information, including the inertial range slopes. The superresolution prediction is overly dissipative at smaller scales than that of the inertial range in all cases, but the smaller scales are better recovered in more turbulent than laminar regimes. This is likely because more turbulent systems have a rich variety of structures at many length scales compared to laminar flows.

<title>Searches for Neutrinos in the Direction of Radio-bright Blazars with the ANTARES Telescope</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Active galaxies, especially blazars, are among the most promising extragalactic candidates for high-energy neutrino sources. To date, ANTARES searches included these objects and used GeV–TeV γ-ray flux to select blazars. Here, a statistically complete blazar sample selected by their bright radio emission is used as the target for searches of origins of neutrinos collected by the ANTARES neutrino telescope over 13 yr of operation. The hypothesis of a neutrino–blazar directional correlation is tested by pair counting and a complementary likelihood-based approach. The resulting posttrial p-value is 3.0% (2.2σ in the two-sided convention). Additionally, a time-dependent analysis is performed to search for temporal clustering of neutrino candidates as a means of detecting neutrino flares in blazars. None of the investigated sources alone reaches a significant flare detection level. However, the presence of 18 sources with a pretrial significance above 3σ indicates a p = 1.4% (2.5σ in the two-sided convention) detection of a time-variable neutrino flux. An a posteriori investigation reveals an intriguing temporal coincidence of neutrino, radio, and γ-ray flares of the J0242+1101 blazar at a p = 0.5% (2.9σ in the two-sided convention) level. Altogether, the results presented here suggest a possible connection of neutrino candidates detected by the ANTARES telescope with radio-bright blazars.

<title>Orbital Stability and Secular Dynamics of the Proxima Centauri Planetary System</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The two innermost planets of the Proxima Centauri system are separated by just 0.02 au, inducing strong gravitational interactions between them. We assess this interaction by leveraging fast orbital stability indicators and find that orbital stability is very likely if the initial eccentricities of planets b and d are less than ∼0.2, but cannot confirm stability at larger values. We find that stability is not strongly affected by the true masses of the planets or by the distant planet c. However, mutual inclinations between 95° and 142° often result in unstable motion. We further explore the long-term evolution of the orbits in these stable regions of parameter space and find that circularization can take over 5 Gyr. This tidal evolution could support surface energy fluxes in excess of 1 W m−2 for over 1 Gyr, possibly affecting planet b’s habitability.

<title>Multiple Emission Lines of Hα Emitters at z ∼ 2.3 from the Broad- and Medium-band Photometry in the ZFOURGE Survey</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a multiple emission line study of ∼1300 Hα emitters (HAEs) at z ∼ 2.3 in the ZFOURGE survey. In contrast to the traditional spectroscopic method, our sample is selected based on the flux excess in the ZFOURGE Ks broadband data relative to the best-fit stellar continuum. Using the same method, we also extract the strong diagnostic emission lines for these individual HAEs: [O iii] λλ4959, 5007 and [O ii] λλ3726, 3729. Our measurements demonstrate good consistency with those obtained from spectroscopic surveys. We investigate the relationship between the equivalent widths (EWs) of these emission lines and various galaxy properties, including stellar mass, stellar age, star formation rate, specific star formation rate, and ionization state (O32). We have identified a discrepancy between HAEs at z ∼ 2.3 and typical local star-forming galaxies observed in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, suggesting the evolution of lower gas-phase metallicity (Z) and higher ionization parameters (U) with redshift. Notably, we have observed a significant number of low-mass HAEs exhibiting exceptionally high EW[O iii]. Their galaxy properties are comparable to those of extreme objects, such as extreme O3 emitters and Lyα emitters at z ≃ 2–3. Considering that these characteristics may indicate potential strong Lyman continuum leakage, higher-redshift analogs of the low-mass HAEs could be significant contributors to the cosmic reionization. Further investigations of this particular population are required to gain a clearer understanding of galaxy evolution and cosmic reionization.

<title>Pulse Jitter and Single-pulse Variability in Millisecond Pulsars</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Understanding the jitter noise resulting from single-pulse phase and shape variations is important for the detection of gravitational waves using pulsar timing arrays. We present measurements of the jitter noise and single-pulse variability of 12 millisecond pulsars that are part of the International Pulsar Timing Array sample using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope. We find that the levels of jitter noise can vary dramatically among pulsars. A moderate correlation with a correlation coefficient of 0.57 between jitter noise and pulse width is detected. To mitigate jitter noise, we perform matrix template matching using all four Stokes parameters. Our results reveal a reduction in jitter noise ranging from 6.7% to 39.6%. By performing longitude-resolved fluctuation spectrum analysis, we identify periodic intensity modulations in 10 pulsars. In PSR J0030+0451, we detect single pulses with energies more than 10 times the average pulse energy, suggesting the presence of giant pulses. We also observe a periodic mode-changing phenomenon in PSR J0030+0451. We examine the achievable timing precision by selecting a subset of pulses with a specific range of peak intensity, but no significant improvement in timing precision is achievable.

<title>Asphericity of the Base of the Solar Convection Zone</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We have used solar oscillation frequencies and frequency splittings obtained over solar cycles 23 and 24 to investigate whether the base of the solar convection zone shows any departure from spherical symmetry. We used the even-order splitting coefficients, a2–a8, and estimated the contributions from each one separately. The average asphericity over the two solar cycles was determined using frequencies and splittings obtained with a 9216-day time series. We find that evidence of asphericity is, at best, marginal: the a2 component is consistent with no asphericity, the a4 and a6 components yield results at a level a little greater than 1σ, while the a8 component shows a signature below 1σ. The combined results indicate that the time average of the departure from the spherically symmetric position of the base of the convection zone is ≲0.0001R⊙. We have also used helioseismic data obtained from time series of lengths of 360, 576, 1152, and 2304 days in order to examine the consistency of the results and evaluate whether there is any time variation. We find that the evidence for time variation is statistically marginal in all cases, except for the a6 component, for which tests consistently yield p-values of less than 0.05.

<title>Two-sided Loop Solar Jet Driven by the Eruption of a Small Filament in a Big Filament Channel</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Similar to the cases of anemone jets, two-sided loop solar jets can also be produced by either flux emergence from the solar interior or small-scale filament eruptions. Using high-quality data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory, we have analyzed a two-sided loop solar jet triggered by the eruption of a small filament. The jet occurred in a pre-existing big filament channel. The detailed processes involved in the eruption of the small filament, the interaction between the erupted filament and the big filament channel, and the launch of the two-sided loop jet are presented. The observations further revealed notable asymmetry between the two branches of the jet spire: the northeastern branch is narrow and short, while the southern branch is wide and long and accompanied by discernible untwisting motions. We explored the unique appearance of the jet by employing the method of local potential field extrapolation to calculate the coronal magnetic field configuration around the jet. The photospheric magnetic flux below the small filament underwent cancellation for approximately 7 hr before the filament eruption, and the negative flux near the southern footpoint of the filament decreased by about 56% during this interval. Therefore, we propose that the primary photospheric driver of the filament eruption and the associated two-sided loop jet in this event is flux cancellation rather than flux emergence.

<title>Discovery of Radial Spectral Hardening in the Hot Bubble of Planetary Nebula BD+30°3639 with Median Energy Imaging</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad25fa</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We apply an imaging analysis technique to study the spatial distribution of the X-ray spectral hardness across the hot bubble of planetary nebula BD+30°3639. Hot bubble emission is typically photon starved, thus limiting the methods for spatial–spectral analysis; however, this technique uses the statistics of photon energies across the nebula to identify spatial variations in the X-ray spectral hardness. Using the median energy value of the X-ray photons, we identified a rise in median energy values toward the projected edge of the nebula, which we refer to as radial spectral hardening. We explored the origin of this radial spectral hardening with an X-ray spectral analysis of distinct regions of high and low median energy values. Given the results of the X-ray spectral fits and the fact that the hot bubble is embedded within a young, dense, planetary nebula, we conclude that the radial spectral hardening is due to an increased column density at the projected nebular edge.

<title>Comparing Observed with Simulated Solar-disk-center Scattering Polarization in the Sr i 4607 Å Line</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Solar magnetic fields alter scattering polarization in spectral lines like Sr i at 4607 Å via the Hanle effect, making it a potential diagnostic for small-scale, mixed-polarity photospheric magnetic fields. Recently, observational evidence for scattering polarization in the Sr i 4607 Å line at the solar disk center was found. Here, we investigate the reliability of the reconstruction method that made possible this detection. To this end, we apply it to linear polarization profiles of the Sr i 4607 Å line radiation emerging at the disk center obtained from a detailed 3D radiative transfer calculation in a magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulation snapshot with a small-scale dynamo contribution. The reconstruction method systematically reduces the scattering amplitudes by up to a factor of 2, depending on the noise level. We demonstrate that the decrease can be attributed to two systematic errors: first, the physical constraint that underlies our assumptions regarding the dependence of scattering polarization on the quadrupolar moment of the radiation field; and second, the limitations of our method in accurately determining the sign of the radiation field tensor from the observed intensity image. However, by consistently applying the reconstruction process and after taking into account image-degradation effects due to the temporally variable image quality, such as imposed by seeing, the observed and synthesized polarization signals show remarkable agreement. We thus conclude that the observed scattering polarization at the solar disk center is consistent with that emerging from a MHD model of the solar photosphere with an average magnetic field of 170 G at the visible surface.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The process whereby the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) populating the centers of galaxies have been assembled remains to be established, with the relative importance of seeds provided by collapsed Population III stars, black holes formed in nuclear star clusters via repeated mergers, or direct collapses of protogalactic disks yet to be determined. In this paper we study the prospects for casting light on this issue by future measurements of gravitational waves emitted during the inspirals and mergers of pairs of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs), discussing in particular the roles of prospective measurements by LISA and the proposed atom interferometers AION and AEDGE. We find that the expected number of detectable IMBH binaries is for LISA and AEDGE and for AION in low-mass seeds scenarios and goes down to for LISA and below one for AEDGE and AION in high-mass seed scenarios. This allows all of these observatories to probe the parameters of the seed model, in particular, if at least a fraction of the SMBHs arises from a low-mass seed population. We also show that the measurement accuracy of the binary parameters is, in general, best for AEDGE, which sees very precisely the merger of the binary.

Summary: 
The study provides accurate spectroscopic parameters of isopropyl alcohol, focusing on the distribution of low-lying vibrational energy levels in the far-infrared region. Highly correlated ab initio calculations were used to distinguish between the rotational parameters of the two nearly identical conformers. The computed properties can help analyze rotational-vibrational spectra in the gas phase and further detect vibrationally excited isopropyl alcohol. The distribution of 27 energy levels is grouped into three series, with differences due to the OH torsion effect, each series containing nine subcomponents from the torsion of the two methyl groups. The computations accurately reproduce available experimental data. <div>
Accurate spectroscopic parameters of isopropyl alcohol, a volatile organic compound present on Earth and in extraterrestrial atmospheres, are provided. The work pursues the study of the far-infrared region, describing the distribution of the low-lying vibrational energy levels that can be populated at very low temperatures, having effects on the detectability and identification. The potential energy surface shows 27 almost equivalent minima producing 27 subcomponents of the levels due to tunneling effects. Computations have been performed using highly correlated ab initio calculations, accurate enough to distinguish between the rotational parameters of the two quasi-identical conformers gauche and trans. A variational procedure in three dimensions depending on three interacting internal rotations, the internal rotation of the two methyl groups and the internal rotation of the hydroxyl group, is employed to compute the energies. The 27 subcomponents of the ground vibrational state can be grouped into three series of nine energy levels located around 0.000, 1.693, and 81.927 cm−1 whose energy difference is due to the OH torsion effect. The nine subcomponents integrated in each series derive from the torsion of the two methyl groups. The computations reproduce accurately the available experimental data. New predicted properties can help the spectroscopic analysis of the rotational-vibrational spectra in the gas phase and further detections of vibrationally excited isopropyl alcohol.

康复治疗在运动损伤的预防和康复中起着重要作用。牛顿第一定律指出，物体在静止状态会保持静止，而在运动状态会保持匀速直线运动，这与运动康复中的恢复过程有一定关联。通过运动康复，可以帮助运动员转变静止状态的伤病到活跃状态的康复。促进运动员的运动能力恢复并且减少再次受伤的风险，从而实现伤病的预防和康复。因此，康复治疗在运动损伤中的重要性不容忽视。总结:<br /><br />康复治疗在运动损伤中发挥着重要作用，有助于预防伤病和促进康复。牛顿第一定律也提醒我们，静止状态下的伤病需要通过运动康复得以改变，从而实现运动员的恢复和再次受伤风险的降低。 <div>

这篇文章使用ALMA对Perseus分子云中12个原恒星多重系统的星盘定向进行了高分辨率的统计表征。他们发现紧凑源（<100 au）和广泛伴星（>500 au）的分布是不同的。紧凑源呈现出更多的偏好对齐，而广泛的伴星则可能呈现出40%到80%的偏好对齐。整体样本表明在10,000 au范围内的偏好对齐源不会超过80%，排除了完全随机对齐分布。这些结果揭示了紧凑源和广泛伴星在统计上存在差异。 <br /><br />总结: ALMA使用高分辨率观测原恒星多重系统的星盘定向，发现紧凑源和广泛伴星的分布存在差异，紧凑源呈偏好对齐，广泛伴星可能呈40%到80%的偏好对齐，整体样本排除了完全随机的对齐分布。 <div>
We present a statistical characterization of circumstellar disk orientations toward 12 protostellar multiple systems in the Perseus molecular cloud using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array at Band 6 (1.3 mm) with a resolution of ∼25 mas (∼8 au). This exquisite resolution enabled us to resolve the compact inner-disk structures surrounding the components of each multiple system and to determine the projected 3D orientation of the disks (position angle and inclination) to high precision. We performed a statistical analysis on the relative alignment of disk pairs to determine whether the disks are preferentially aligned or randomly distributed. We considered three subsamples of the observations selected by the companion separations a < 100 au, a > 500 au, and a < 10,000 au. We found for the compact (<100 au) subsample, the distribution of orientation angles is best described by an underlying distribution of preferentially aligned sources (within 30°) but does not rule out distributions with 40% misaligned sources. The wide companion (>500 au) subsample appears to be consistent with a distribution of 40%–80% preferentially aligned sources. Similarly, the full sample of systems with companions (a < 10,000 au) is most consistent with a fractional ratio of at most 80% preferentially aligned sources and rules out purely randomly aligned distributions. Thus, our results imply the compact sources (<100 au) and the wide companions (>500 au) are statistically different.

总结: 月球极地发现了水冰/气体混合物喷射到太空的迁移过程，主要来自月球表面以下约10厘米深度的挥发物质升华，与撞击事件无关。这些喷射事件主要发生在冬季，与流星体轨道不一致，暗示了月球极地在挥发物质迁移方面的活跃性，对于理解水对地月系统的输送具有重要意义。 <br /><br /> <div>
The presence of water condensation in the lunar polar region has been reported. However, the origin and amount of water remain unknown, and information on the migration mechanism of water is key for understanding the delivery of water to the Earth–Moon system. We herein report the first identification of the migration process observed as localized and condensed plumes of water ice/gas mixtures ejected from the lunar surface to space in the polar region based on spectral data derived by SELENE/Kaguya. We identified water and other volatile absorption in 10,200 spectra at the nonpermanent shadowed region during the nighttime when no illumination reached the lunar surface, while nearly horizontal solar light at these regions could illuminate the sky. Ray-tracing analyses suggested that the majority of the observed volatile signal did not come from the lunar surface but from the sky (space). The majority of the identified plumes were observed at or near the hydrogen distribution reported previously. Volatile materials were repeatedly identified in some locations and most of the plume events did not coincide with the major meteoroid streams. Rather, more signals were identified during the winter season in each pole. The timing, duration, location, and temperature simulations all suggest that impact events cannot be their main origin, but rather the volatile sublimation from the subsurface (∼10 cm depth). Overall, it was revealed that the lunar polar region is active in terms of volatile migration, which is significant for understanding water delivery to the Earth–Moon system.

<div> 70 μm dark IRDCs, formaldehyde emission, kinetic temperature, high-mass star formation, ALMA Survey

总结:<br /><br />该研究使用ALMA观测了12个70 μm暗IRDCs，探查了其中的高密度核心的动力学温度。研究发现H2CO主要对低速度流组分敏感，动力学温度范围为26到300 K，马赫数高达15，表明受非热运动的显著影响。此外，还在14个原行星核心中检测到了HC3N和OCS的暖线发射，需要高激发温度。这些结果表明，ASHES领域内某些嵌入核心处于进化较为先进的阶段，这在之前对70 μm暗IRDCs并不可预期。 <div>
Massive infrared dark clouds (IRDCs) are considered to host the earliest stages of high-mass star formation. In particular, 70 μm dark IRDCs are the colder and more quiescent clouds. At a scale of about 5000 au using formaldehyde (H2CO) emission, we investigate the kinetic temperature of dense cores in 12 IRDCs obtained from the pilot Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Survey of 70 μm dark High-mass clumps in Early Stages (ASHES). Compared to the 1.3 mm dust continuum and other molecular lines, such as C18O and deuterated species, we find that H2CO is mainly sensitive to low-velocity outflow components rather than to quiescent gas expected in the early phases of star formation. The kinetic temperatures of these components range from 26 to 300 K. The Mach number reaches about 15 with an average value of about 4, suggesting that the velocity distribution of gas traced by H2CO is significantly influenced by a supersonic nonthermal component. In addition, we detect warm line emission from HC3N and OCS in 14 protostellar cores, which requires high excitation temperatures (Eu/k ∼ 100 K). These results show that some of the embedded cores in the ASHES fields are in an advanced evolutionary stage, previously unexpected for 70 μm dark IRDCs.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了银河系恒星晕的演化历史，并对局部和整个恒星晕进行了比较。通过结合观测驱动的九个最大质量的破碎的矮星星系的N体模拟建立了一个复合恒星晕模型。研究发现，局部恒星晕与整个恒星晕之间的不同可能被高估或低估，并且通过轨道积分本地恒星晕推断出的整体恒星晕性质可能会出现显著偏差。此外，研究还发现大量最近被吸收和破碎的星系在局部样本中完全缺失，可能在外恒星晕等待发现。这些结果表明需要进行延伸至银河系维里半径的恒星晕星的调查。 <div>
The Milky Way’s stellar halo, which extends to >100 kpc, encodes the evolutionary history of our Galaxy. However, most studies of the halo to date have been limited to within a few kiloparsecs of the Sun. Here, we characterize differences between this local halo and the stellar halo in its entirety. We construct a composite stellar halo model by combining observationally motivated N-body simulations of the Milky Way’s nine most massive disrupted dwarf galaxies that account for almost all of the mass in the halo. We find that (i) the representation by mass of different dwarf galaxies in the local halo compared to the whole halo can be significantly overestimated (e.g., the Helmi streams) or underestimated (e.g., Cetus) and (ii) properties of the overall halo (e.g., net rotation) inferred via orbit integration of local halo stars are significantly biased because, for example, highly retrograde debris from Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus is missing from the local halo. Therefore, extrapolations from the local to the global halo should be treated with caution. From analysis of a sample of 11 Milky Way–like simulated halos, we contextualize these results and identify a population of recently accreted (≲5 Gyrs) and disrupted galaxies on high-angular-momenta orbits that are entirely missing from local samples and likely awaiting discovery in the outer halo. Our results motivate the need for surveys of halo stars extending out to the Galaxy’s virial radius.

Interplanetary (IP) shocks are believed to play a significant role in both amplifying the background level of turbulent fluctuations and in heating the bulk solar wind (SW). This study investigates the thermodynamic properties downstream of IP shocks. We examine the temperature, density, and specific entropy changes in the shocked plasma, taking into consideration the geometric aspects of IP shock propagation within the expanding SW. Specifically, in our analysis, we account for the fact that any particular temporal range of one-point measurement may correspond to vastly different physically relevant temporal and/or spatial dimensions, such as the age of the shocked plasma and/or radial distance to the place where the plasma encountered the shock. Thus, our approach resolves the contradictions in previously reported temperature and specific entropy profiles in downstream regions and suggests that downstream regions exhibit greater turbulent heating compared to the pristine SW. This may contribute to the overall heating of the SW plasma. The paper presents a phenomenological parameter to predict specific entropy profiles and demonstrates the consistency of the proposed model with observations. We discuss the implications of these results for the thermodynamics of the SW beyond 1 au.

总结:
恒星活动周期通过光度变化和Ca H&amp;K发射通量的观测来追踪，本文报道了一个半附近双星系统(TIC 16320250)，包括一个白矮星和一个活跃的M型矮星。长达二十年的多波段光学光度曲线显示出三个重复模式，暗示了M型矮星可能有大约10年的活动周期。光度曲线拟合表明这种重复变化是极点斑块的演化，特别是运动所导致的。Ca H&amp;K、Hα、紫外线和X射线的显著发射表明M型矮星是最具磁活跃性的恒星之一。文章提出，在大时间域光度测量巡天的时代，长期光度曲线建模可以成为追踪和揭示恒星活动周期的有价值工具，尤其是对于双星系统中的恒星。 
<br /><br /> <div>
Stellar activity cycles reveal continuous relaxation and induction of magnetic fields. The activity cycle is typically traced through the observation of cyclic variations in total brightness or Ca H&amp;K emission flux of stars, as well as cyclic variations in the orbital periods of binary systems. In this work, we report the identification of a semidetached binary system (TIC 16320250) consisting of a white dwarf (0.67 M⊙) and an active M dwarf (0.56 M⊙). The long-term multiband optical light curves spanning twenty years revealed three repeated patterns, suggestive of a possible activity cycle of about 10 years of the M dwarf. Light-curve fitting indicates the repeated variation is caused by the evolution, particularly the motion, of polar spots. The significant Ca H&amp;K, Hα, ultra-violet, and X-ray emissions imply that the M dwarf is one of the most magnetically active stars. We propose that in the era of large time-domain photometric sky surveys (e.g., ASAS-SN, Zwicky Transient Facility, LSST, Sitian), long-term light-curve modeling can be a valuable tool for tracing and revealing stellar activity cycle, especially for stars in binary systems.

<div> 光学和近红外数据，DG Tau的喷流观测，质量吸积和喷射的关联，运动节点群的分类，喷射速度与光度的相关性，光度变化与喷流起源点的关系。
总结:
光学和近红外数据的观测显示了DG Tau的喷流情况，质量吸积和喷射速度之间存在明显的关联，喷流速度和光度存在很强的相关性。根据观测数据对运动节点群进行了分类，发现喷流速度与DG Tau的光度呈现出一致的变化趋势。随着时间推移，喷流速度的增加伴随着光度的提高。此外，光度的变化也与喷流的起源点位置有关，表明活跃的质量吸积会影响可变的喷射速度。 <div>
We aim to clarify the link between mass accretion and ejection by analyzing DG Tau’s jet observations from optical and near-infrared data spanning 1984–2019, alongside photometric variations between 1983 and 2015. We classified 12 moving knot groups among 17 total knot groups based on their constant proper motions and comparable radial velocities. A strong correlation emerges between the deprojected flow velocities of the knots and the photometric magnitudes of DG Tau. From 1983 to 1995, as the deprojected ejection velocities surged from ∼273 ± 15 to ∼427 ± 16 km s−1, the photometric magnitudes (V) concurrently brightened from 12.3 to 11.4. Notably, when DG Tau became brighter than 12.2 in the V band, its (B − V) color shifted bluer than its intrinsic color range of K5–M0. During this period, the launching point of the jet in the protoplanetary disk moved closer to 0.06 au from the star in 1995. Following a V magnitude drop from 11.7 to 13.4 in 1998, the star may have experienced significant extinction due to a dust wall created by the disk wind during the ejection of the high-velocity knot in 1999. Since then, the magnitude became fainter than 12.2, the (B − V) and (V − R) colors became redder, and the deprojected velocities consistently remained below 200 km s−1. The launching point of the jet then moved away to ∼0.45 au by 2008. The prevailing factor influencing photometric magnitude appears to be the active mass accretion causing the variable mass ejection velocities.

JWST中红外光谱化学调查（JDISCS）旨在利用James Webb太空望远镜（JWST）上的中红外仪器（MIRI）来理解内部原行星盘的化学演化。通过观测30多个盘，研究采用自定义方法对MIRI中分辨光谱仪（MRS）进行校准，实现了其在4.9-28μm光谱范围内高于1:300的对比度。高光谱对比度使得可以精确地从中检索物理参数，搜索罕见分子物质和同位素，并约束含碳和氮物种的库存量。JDISCS还对MRS波长和分辨率进行了重要的改进。文中描述了JDISCS校准数据并且展示了通过观测太阳质量年轻恒星FZ Tau周围的盘的光谱数据质量。FZ Tau MIRI光谱由温暖的水蒸气强烈辐射组成。研究表明水和CO线辐射来自盘面并追踪大约500-1500K的气体温度范围。我们检索了观测到的CO和H2O线的参数，并表明它们与由两个温度组分表示的径向分布一致。水的丰度高达n（H2O）约为10^-4，至少填满了盘面直到1.5天文单位处的350K等温线。我们在FZ Tau周围寻找了扩展辐射，探测到了一对径向约300天文单位的大规模氢气环绕FZ Tau，并讨论了其起源。

The JWST Disk Infrared Spectral Chemistry Survey (JDISCS) aims to understand the evolution of the chemistry of inner protoplanetary disks using the Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI) on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). With a growing sample of >30 disks, the survey implements a custom method to calibrate the MIRI Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) to contrasts of better than 1:300 across its 4.9–28 μm spectral range. This is achieved using observations of Themis family asteroids as precise empirical reference sources. The high spectral contrast enables precise retrievals of physical parameters, searches for rare molecular species and isotopologues, and constraints on the inventories of carbon- and nitrogen-bearing species. JDISCS also offers significant improvements to the MRS wavelength and resolving power calibration. We describe the JDISCS calibrated data and demonstrate their quality using observations of the disk around the solar-mass young star FZ Tau. The FZ Tau MIRI spectrum is dominated by strong emission from warm water vapor. We show that the water and CO line emission originates from the disk surface and traces a range of gas temperatures of ∼500–1500 K. We retrieve parameters for the observed CO and H2O lines and show that they are consistent with a radial distribution represented by two temperature components. A high water abundance of n(H2O) ∼ 10−4 fills the disk surface at least out to the 350 K isotherm at 1.5 au. We search the FZ Tau environs for extended emission, detecting a large (radius of ∼300 au) ring of emission from H2 gas surrounding FZ Tau, and discuss its origin.

The atmospheres of small exoplanets likely derive from a combination of geochemical outgassing and primordial gases left over from formation. Secondary atmospheres, such as those of Earth, Mars, and Venus, are sourced by outgassing. Persistent outgassing into long-lived, primordial, hydrogen–helium envelopes produces hybrid atmospheres of which there are no examples in the solar system. We construct a unified theoretical framework for calculating the outgassing chemistry of both secondary and hybrid atmospheres, where the input parameters are the surface pressure, oxidation, and sulfidation states of the mantle, as well as the primordial atmospheric hydrogen, helium, and nitrogen content. Nonideal gases (quantified by the fugacity coefficient) and nonideal mixing of gaseous components (quantified by the activity coefficient) are considered. Both secondary and hybrid atmospheres exhibit a rich diversity of chemistries, including hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. The abundance ratio of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide serves as a powerful diagnostic for the oxygen fugacity of the mantle, which may conceivably be constrained by James Webb Space Telescope spectra in the near future. Methane-dominated atmospheres are difficult to produce and require specific conditions: atmospheric surface pressures exceeding ∼10 bar, a reduced (poorly oxidized) mantle, and diminished magma temperatures (compared to modern Earth). Future work should include photochemistry in these calculations and clarify the general role of atmospheric escape. Exoplanet science should quantify the relationship between the mass and oxygen fugacity for a sample of super Earths and sub-Neptunes; such an empirical relationship already exists for solar system bodies.

<div> 关键词: 长俄显现象, 紧凑天体的合并, 爆发物与星际介质相互作用, GRB 191019A, 短周期新星

总结: 
本文讨论了最近被Swift探测到的附近长俄显现象GRB 191019A，发现其缺乏伴随的超新星现象，可能由于两个紧凑天体在活跃星系核高密度介质中发生合并而产生。根据模型计算，在这种高密度环境中，爆发物与星际介质的相互作用可能会对短周期新星的发射产生影响，尤其是在较晚的时候。另外，如果能够在未来探测到类似GRB 191019A事件的短周期新星发射，需要更少的注入物质。文章还讨论了磁星所带来的r过程动力学和自旋能贡献。由于明亮的宿主星系的影响，目前难以从观测结果中确定GRB 191019A的短周期新星发射。 <div>
The nearby long-duration GRB 191019A recently detected by Swift lacks an associated supernova and belongs to a host galaxy with little star formation activity, suggesting that the origin of this burst is the result of a merger of two compact objects with dynamical interactions in a high-density medium of an active galactic nucleus. Given the potential motivation of this event, and given that it occurs in such a high-density environment, the ejecta–circumstellar medium (CSM) interaction cannot be ignored as possibly contributing to the kilonova emission. Here, we theoretically calculate the kilonova emission by considering the contribution of the ejecta–CSM interaction in a high-density environment. We find that the contribution to the kilonova emission from the ejecta–CSM interaction will dominate at a later time, and a smaller ejecta mass will have a stronger kilonova emission from the ejecta–CSM interaction. Moreover, we try to apply it to GRB 191019A, but we find that it is difficult to identify the possible kilonova emission from the observations, due to the contribution of the bright host galaxy. On the other hand, less injected mass (less than Mej = 2 × 10−5M⊙) will be required if one can detect the kilonova emission associated with a GRB 191019A–like event in the future. The r-process-powered and spin energy contributions from the magnetar are also discussed.

For g modes, both stars display a regular period spacing of 2413 s. Through detailed seismological analysis, we deduce that these period-spacing patterns correspond to modes with ℓ = 1. Moreover, our analysis reveals that with increases in masses and metallicities, the star should display a higher degree of evolution to match a specific period spacing Π0. Conversely, the star should have a lower extent of evolution to match the radial fundamental mode. These two contradictory behaviors allow us to precisely obtain stellar physical parameters. TIC 65138566 and TIC 139729335 are determined to be two main-sequence stars that have almost the same range of masses and metallicities, with M = 1.36 ± 0.06 M⊙ and Z = 0.005 ± 0.002. The hydrogen abundance in the core of TIC 65138566 is estimated to be about 0.28, while TIC 139729335 has a slightly higher value of around 0.31. Finally, we suggest that the high-amplitude δ Scuti–γ Doradus star TIC 308396022 is a main-sequence star with M = 1.54 ± 0.08 M⊙, Z = 0.007 ± 0.001, and Xc = 0.18 ± 0.02.

Quasi-thermal noise (QTN) spectroscopy is a valuable method to deduce important parameters in space plasma, such as plasma density and temperature, especially when direct particle measurements are not available. The present study develops a new fitting method to fit the QTN spectra observed by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) with a comprehensive theoretical QTN spectral model. By combining the steepest descent and Levenberg–Marquardt algorithms, the new method is more flexible with initial guess values but still yields reliable solar wind electron density and temperature values. The new method is applied to derive the solar wind density and core temperature from the QTN measurements during 10 encounters of PSP. The electron density and temperature values obtained vary with the radial distance from the Sun as ne ∝ r−2.12 and Te ∝ r−0.71, both of which are consistent with existing models and previous results.

Unraveling the internal kinematics of open clusters is crucial for understanding their formation and evolution. However, there is a dearth of research on this topic, primarily due to the lack of high-quality kinematic data. Using the exquisite-precision astrometric parameters and radial velocities provided by Gaia data release 3, we investigate the internal rotation in three of the most nearby and best-studied open clusters, namely the Pleiades, Alpha Persei, and Hyades clusters. Statistical analyses of the residual motions of the member stars clearly indicate the presence of three-dimensional rotation in the three clusters. The mean rotation velocities of the Pleiades, Alpha Persei, and Hyades clusters within their tidal radii are estimated to be 0.24 ± 0.04, 0.43 ± 0.08, and 0.09 ± 0.03 km s−1, respectively. Similar to the Praesepe cluster that we have studied before, the rotation of the member stars within the tidal radii of these three open clusters can be well interpreted by Newton’s theorem. No expansion or contraction is detected in the three clusters either. Furthermore, we find that the mean rotation velocity of open clusters may be positively correlated with the cluster mass, and the rotation is likely to diminish as open clusters age.

<title>The Reliability of Accretion Disk Inclination Derived from X-Ray Spectroscopy of Active Galaxies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The inclination angle of substructures in active galaxies gives insights into physical components from scales of the vicinity of the central black hole to the entire host galaxy. We use the self-consistent reflection spectral model RELXILL to measure the inclination of the inner region of accretion disks with broadband (0.3–78 keV) X-ray observations, systematically studying the reliability of this methodology. To test the capability of the model to return statistically consistent results, we analyze multiepoch joint XMM-Newton and NuSTAR data of the narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy I Zwicky 1 and the broad-line radio galaxy 3C 382, which exhibit different degrees of spectral complexity and reflection features. As expected, we find that adding more data for analysis narrows the confidence interval and that multiepoch joint observations return optimal measurements; however, even single-epoch data can be well fitted if the reflection component is sufficiently dominant. Mock spectra are used to test the capability of RELXILL to recover input parameters from typical single-epoch joint observations. We find that inclination is well recovered at 90% confidence, with improved constraints at higher reflection fraction and higher inclination. Higher iron abundance and corona temperature tighten the constraints as well, but the effect is not as significant as a higher reflection fraction. The spin, however, has little effect in reflection-based inclination measurements. We conclude that broadband reflection spectroscopy can reliably measure inner accretion disk inclination.

<title>Upper Limits on the Radio Pulses from Magnetars and a Central Compact Object with FAST</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Magnetars and central compact objects (CCOs) are subgroups of neutron stars that show a number of properties distinguished from canonical radio pulsars. We performed radio observations of three magnetars, SGR 0418+5729, 1E 2259+586, and 4U 0142+61, and a CCO, PSR J1852+0040, with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope at 1.25 GHz, aiming to search for radio pulsations in their quiescent states. During two observation epochs, no radio pulses have been detected toward any target above a significance of signal-to-noise ratio = 7 from either the direct folding or blind search. We provided the most stringent upper limit of radio flux (≲2–4 μJy) for the magnetars and the CCO. For the magnetars with long periods, the real upper limits are likely 1 order of magnitude larger due to the red noise. The deep radio observations suggest that these magnetars and the CCO are indeed radio-quiet sources or unfavorably beamed.

<title>Do Minihalos Affect Cosmic Reionization?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The role of unresolved structures (“minihalos”) in determining the consumption of ionizing photons during cosmic reionization remains an unsolved problem in modeling cosmic reionization, despite recent extensive studies with small-box high-resolution simulations by Park et al. and Chan et al., because the small-box studies are not able to fully sample all environments. In this paper these simulations are combined with large-box simulations from the “Cosmic Reionization On Computers” (CROC) project, allowing one to account for the full range of environments and to produce an estimate for the number of recombinations per hydrogen atom that are missed in large-scale simulations like CROC or Thesan. I find that recombinations in unresolved minihalos are unimportant compared to recombinations produced in large-scale cosmic structures and inside more massive, fully resolved halos. Since both the Park et al. and Chan et al. studies have severe limitations, the conclusions of this paper may need to be verified with more representative sets of small-box high-resolution simulations.

总结:
本文重新审视了类似夸克星或中子星等紧密天体物体的电球层中电子对产生的机制，着重关注了电子的蒸发和电子和正电子的加速，这在以前的文献中并未涉及。我们使用Vlasov-Maxwell方程进行了一系列数值模拟。电球层中电场强度对电子对产生速率有很大影响。尽管保利阻塞被明确考虑在内，但我们发现在低温下并没有电子对产生速率的指数抑制。电子对的光度随温度增加而增加，可能达到L± ∼ 1052 erg s−1，比以前假定的要大得多。 <div>
The mechanism of pair creation in the electrosphere of compact astrophysical objects such as quark stars or neutron stars is revisited, paying attention to evaporation of electrons and acceleration of electrons and positrons, which were previously not addressed in the literature. We perform a series of numerical simulations using the Vlasov–Maxwell equations. The rate of pair creation strongly depends on electric field strength in the electrosphere. Although Pauli blocking is explicitly taken into account, we find no exponential suppression of the pair creation rate at low temperatures. The luminosity in pairs increases with temperature and it may reach up to L± ∼ 1052 erg s−1, much larger than previously assumed.

We present the first data release of the Far-Infrared Polarimetric Large Area CMZ Exploration (FIREPLACE) survey. The survey was taken using the 214 μm band of the HAWC+ instrument with the SOFIA telescope (19.″6 resolution; 0.7 pc). In this first data release we present dust polarization observations covering a ∼0.°5 region of the Galactic center’s central molecular zone (CMZ), approximately centered on the Sgr B2 complex. We detect ∼25,000 Nyquist-sampled polarization pseudovectors, after applying the standard SOFIA cuts for minimum signal-to-noise ratios in fractional polarization and total intensity of three and 200, respectively. Analysis of the magnetic field orientation suggests a bimodal distribution in the field direction. This bimodal distribution shows enhancements in the distribution of field directions for orientations parallel and perpendicular to the Galactic plane, which are suggestive of a CMZ magnetic field configuration with polodial and torodial components. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of individual clouds included in our survey (i.e., Sgr B2, Sgr B2-NW, Sgr B2-Halo, Sgr B1, and Cloud E/F) shows they have fractional polarization values of 1%–10% at 214 μm, with most of the emission having values <5%. A few of these clouds (i.e., Sgr B2 and Cloud E/F) show relatively low fractional polarization values toward their cores and higher fractional polarization values toward their less dense peripheries. We also observe higher fractional polarization toward compact H ii regions, which could indicate an enhancement in the grain alignment in the dust surrounding these sources.

<div> 关键词: Parker Solar Probe, 磁性不连续, 阿尔文波, 风流, 质子加速<br />
<br />总结: 本研究通过对Parker Solar Probe观测到的Alfvénic和非Alfvénic风流中的局部质子能量化以及速度相空间中的动力学特征进行调查。在两种类型的风流中，最热的质子群集中在可压缩的一致磁场结构周围。在磁场结构周围，Alfvénic风流经历T∥的优先增强，而非Alfvénic风流经历T⊥的优先增强。此外，在两种风流中都存在质子束，但质子速度分布函数显示出不同的特征。非Alfvénic风流中存在热束，而Alfvénic风流中存在较冷的束。通过2.5D混合模拟实验，支持了Alfvénic和非Alfvénic风流中质子束具有不同的动力学特性和不同的起源的想法。在磁性不连续和间歇结构附近发现非Maxwellian分布函数，这表明小尺度结构的非线性形成与无碰撞等离子体中高度非热特征的发展密切相关。这些结果有助于理解一致结构在质子能量化中的作用以及它们对空间等离子体中无碰撞能量耗散过程的影响。 <br /> <div>
We investigate the local proton energization at magnetic discontinuities/intermittent structures and the corresponding kinetic signatures in velocity phase space in Alfvénic (high cross helicity) and non-Alfvénic (low cross helicity) wind streams observed by Parker Solar Probe. By means of the partial variance of increments method, we find that the hottest proton populations are localized around compressible, coherent magnetic structures in both types of wind. Analysis of parallel and perpendicular temperature distributions suggest that the Alfvénic wind undergoes preferential enhancements of T∥ at such structures, whereas the non-Alfvénic wind experiences preferential T⊥ enhancements. Although proton beams are present in both types of wind, the proton velocity distribution function displays distinct features. Hot beams, i.e., beams with beam-to-core perpendicular temperature T⊥,b/T⊥,c up to three times larger than the total distribution anisotropy, are found in the non-Alfvénic wind, whereas colder beams are in the Alfvénic wind. Our data analysis is complemented by 2.5D hybrid simulations in different geometrical setups, which support the idea that proton beams in Alfvénic and non-Alfvénic wind have different kinetic properties and different origins. The development of a perpendicular nonlinear cascade, favored in balanced turbulence, allows a preferential relative enhancement of the perpendicular plasma temperature and the formation of hot beams. Cold field-aligned beams are instead favored by Alfvén wave steepening. Non-Maxwellian distribution functions are found near discontinuities and intermittent structures, pointing to the fact that the nonlinear formation of small-scale structures is intrinsically related to the development of highly nonthermal features in collisionless plasmas. Our results contribute to understanding the role of different coherent structures in proton energization and their implication in collisionless energy dissipation processes in space plasmas.

X射线研究表明，星爆星系中存在大量的电荷交换现象，但总体交换通量和发生交换的区域尚不清楚。本文利用XMM-Newton观测M82星爆星系，通过盲源分离方法分析CCD数据，发现了一种具有增强的O-K线的成分，这与电荷交换过程吻合。利用XMM-Newton/RGS光谱分析确定，氧的禁闭态辐射到共振态的比率较高，C、N和O的K壳跃迁的发射线经电荷交换过程增强。电荷交换对Ne和Mg的发射线影响较小，因此准确估计电荷交换的贡献对于测量化学丰度至关重要。通过确定交换发射体积和低温等参数，发现电荷交换主要发生在等离子体和气体的界面区域，其温度由于热传导迅速下降。<br /><br /> <div>
Recent X-ray studies of starburst galaxies have found that charge exchange (CX) commonly occurs between outflowing hot plasma and cold gas, possibly from swept-up clouds. However, the total CX flux and the regions where CX occurs have been poorly understood. We present an analysis of XMM-Newton observations of M82, a prototype starburst galaxy, aiming to investigate these key properties of CX emission. We have used a blind source separation method in an image analysis of CCD data, which identified a component with the enhanced O–K lines expected from the CX process. Analyzing the XMM-Newton/RGS spectra from the regions identified by the image analysis, we have detected a high forbidden-to-resonance ratio of the O vii Heα triplet as well as several emission lines from K-shell transitions of C, N, and O that are enhanced by the CX process. CX is less responsible for the emission lines of Ne and Mg, and accurate estimation of the CX contribution is confirmed to be crucial in measuring chemical abundances. The temperature of the plasma acting as an electron receiver in the CX process is significantly lower compared to that of the plasma components responsible for most of the X-rays. From the low temperature and an estimation of the CX-emitting volume, we find that the CX primarily occurs in a limited region at interfaces between plasma and gas whose temperatures rapidly decrease due to thermal conduction.

Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) may be the link between stellar mass holes and the supermassive variety in the nuclei of galaxies, and globular clusters (GCs) may be one of the most promising environments for their formation. Here, we carry out a pilot study of the observability of tidal disruption events (TDEs) from 103M⊙ < M• < 105M⊙ IMBHs embedded in stellar cusps at the center of GCs. We model the long super-Eddington accretion phase and ensuing optical flare, and derive the disruption rate of main-sequence stars as a function of black hole mass and GC properties with the help of a 1D Fokker–Planck approach. The photospheric emission of the adiabatically expanding outflow dominates the observable radiation and peaks in the near-ultraviolet/optical bands, outshining the brightness of the (old) stellar population of GCs in Virgo for a period of months to years. A search for TDE events in a sample of nearly 4000 GCs observed at multiple epochs by the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey yields null results. Given our model predictions, this sample is too small to set stringent constraints on the present-day occupation fraction of GCs hosting IMBHs. Naturally, better simulations of the properties of the cluster central stellar distribution, TDE light curves, and rates, together with larger surveys of GCs are all needed to gain deeper insights into the presence of IMBHs in GCs.

Structures in circumstellar matter reflect both fast processes and quasi-equilibrium states. A geometrical diversity of emitting circumstellar matter is observed around evolved massive stars, in particular around B[e] supergiants. We recapitulate classical analytical tools of linear and nonlinear potential theory, such as Cole–Hopf transformation and Grad–Shafranov theory, and develop them further to explain the occurrence of the circumstellar matter structures and their dynamics. We use potential theory to formulate the nonlinear hydrodynamical equations and test dilatations of the quasi-equilibrium initial conditions. We find that a wide range of flow patterns can basically be generated and the timescales can switch, based on initial conditions, and lead to eruptive processes, reinforcing that the nonlinear fluid environment includes both quasi-stationary structures and fast processes like finite-time singularities. Some constraints and imposed symmetries can lead to Keplerian orbits, while other constraints can deliver quasi-Keplerian ones. The threshold is given by a characteristic density at the stellar surface.

Magnetic reconnection is one of the most universal processes in space plasma that is responsible for charged particle acceleration and the mixing and heating of plasma populations. In this paper we consider a triggering process of reconnection that is driven by interaction of two discontinuities: solar wind rotational discontinuity and tangential discontinuity at Earth’s magnetospheric boundary, the magnetopause. Combining multispacecraft measurements and global hybrid simulations, we show that solar wind discontinuities may drive the magnetopause reconnection and cause the mixing of the solar wind and magnetosphere plasmas around the magnetopause, well downstream of the solar wind flow. Since large-amplitude discontinuities are frequently observed in the solar wind and predicted for various stellar winds, our results of reconnection driven by the discontinuity–discontinuity interaction may have a broad application beyond the magnetosphere.

The radio galaxy 3C 66B has been hypothesized to host a supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) at its center based on electromagnetic observations. Its apparent 1.05 yr period and low redshift (∼0.02) make it an interesting testbed to search for low-frequency gravitational waves (GWs) using pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments. This source has been subjected to multiple searches for continuous GWs from a circular SMBHB, resulting in progressively more stringent constraints on its GW amplitude and chirp mass. In this paper, we develop a pipeline for performing Bayesian targeted searches for eccentric SMBHBs in PTA data sets, and test its efficacy by applying it to simulated data sets with varying injected signal strengths. We also search for a realistic eccentric SMBHB source in 3C 66B using the NANOGrav 12.5 yr data set employing PTA signal models containing Earth term-only as well as Earth+pulsar term contributions using this pipeline. Due to limitations in our PTA signal model, we get meaningful results only when the initial eccentricity e0 < 0.5 and the symmetric mass ratio η > 0.1. We find no evidence for an eccentric SMBHB signal in our data, and therefore place 95% upper limits on the PTA signal amplitude of 88.1 ± 3.7 ns for the Earth term-only and 81.74 ± 0.86 ns for the Earth+pulsar term searches for e0 < 0.5 and η > 0.1. Similar 95% upper limits on the chirp mass are (1.98 ± 0.05) × 109 and (1.81 ± 0.01) × 109M☉. These upper limits, while less stringent than those calculated from a circular binary search in the NANOGrav 12.5 yr data set, are consistent with the SMBHB model of 3C 66B developed from electromagnetic observations.

Phosphorus monoxide (PO) is a key brick of prebiotic chemistry since it is a potential precursor of phosphates, which are present in all living systems. Prompted by the lack of information on the different processes involved in the formation of PO, we have revisited and analyzed in detail the P(4S) + O2(3Σ−) and P(4S) + O2(1Δ) reactions leading to PO. The former process has been widely studied from both experimental and theoretical points of view, however, with contradictory results. We have used high-level quantum-chemical calculations to accurately describe the reaction mechanisms. Next, rate constants have been computed using a master equation approach based on ab initio transition state theory. By incorporating the P(4S) + O2(3Σ−) reaction in an astrochemical model, we have found that this reaction cannot be overlooked when aiming at a complete understanding of the PO abundance in regions dominated by shocks with speeds below 40 km s−1.

本研究通过对近距离（0.02 < z < 0.06）螺旋+螺旋对和来自SDSS数据释放7的孤立对照样本的精心筛选，结合Galaxy Zoo 2和估计自旋-自旋对齐（SSA）的方法，系统地比较了相对定位对相互作用引起的星形成的影响。研究发现，当相邻星系的SF较高时，从垂直（90度）到良好对齐（0度）的相对定位会导致星形成增加。这种增强在邻近星系具有更高SF时尤为显著，表明液体动力学过程推动了相对定位效应。增加的液体动力学摩擦力，归因于增加的风压和良好对齐对的顺行轨道倾向，与我们的发现一致。 <div>
Enhanced star formation (SF) with star-forming neighboring galaxies bolsters the hydrodynamical contributions during paired interactions. Although the relative spin orientation between interacting galaxies can influence this effect, it has not been comprehensively explored. In this study, utilizing a meticulously curated sample of nearby (0.02 < z < 0.06) spiral+spiral pairs and an isolated control sample from Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7, coupled with Galaxy Zoo 2, and an approach to estimate spin–spin alignment (SSA), we systematically compare the impact of relative orientation, , on interaction-induced SF. We reveal that SSA plays a pivotal role along with the conventionally recognized parameters of projected separation and SF of neighboring galaxies. Our results show an increase in SF augmentation as configurations transition from perpendicular ( ) to well aligned ( ). This enhancement is especially pronounced when neighboring galaxies have higher SF, suggesting that hydrodynamical processes drive the effects of relative orientation. The heightened hydrodynamical friction, attributed to increased ram pressure and the propensity for prograde orbits in well-aligned pairs, is consistent with our findings.

总结: 本文报告了2014年9月1日太阳背面发生的欧氏爆发引起的俯视和侧视观测。观测结果表明，冲击波在星际空间的速度超过了欧氏波，而日冕暗区的增长很小。这表明冲击波是由日冕物质抛射所驱动，而欧氏波在日冕物质抛射侧翼的横向运动停止后自由传播。通过三维重建确定的火焰振荡方向进一步支持了这一观点。此外，对欧氏波引起的火焰和火绳振荡进行了详细研究，揭示了初始振幅、周期、减振时间和减振比分别为16.08和2.15 Mm、1769和1863 s、2640和1259 s、1.49和0.68。根据火焰和火绳振荡测量得出的磁场径向分量分别为5.4和4.1 G。进而利用火焰和火绳振荡的起始时间，确定了欧氏波的平均速度分别为498和451 km/s。 <br /><br /> <div>
In this paper, we report our multi-angle observations of the transverse oscillation of a prominence and a filament induced by an EUV wave originating from the far side of the Sun on 2014 September 1. The prominence oscillation was simultaneously observed by both the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory spacecraft and the Extreme-UltraViolet Imager on board the Behind Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory spacecraft. The speed of the shock traveling in interplanetary space exceeds that of the EUV wave, and the coronal dimming area experiences minimal growth. This indicates that the shock wave is driven by the CME, while the EUV wave freely propagates after the lateral motion of the CME flanks has stopped. The observed oscillation direction of the prominence, determined through three-dimensional reconstruction, further supports this point. Moreover, detailed investigation of the oscillations in the prominence and filament induced by the EUV wave reveals initial amplitudes of 16.08 and 2.15 Mm, periods of 1769 and 1863 s, damping timescales of 2640 and 1259 s, and damping ratios of 1.49 and 0.68, respectively. The radial component of the magnetic field, as derived from the prominence and filament oscillation measurements, was estimated to be 5.4 and 4.1 G, respectively. In turn, utilizing the onset times of both the prominence and filament oscillation, the average speeds of the EUV wave are determined to be 498 and 451 km s−1, respectively.

<title>2.5D Magnetohydrodynamic Simulation of the Formation and Evolution of Plasmoids in Coronal Current Sheets</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In the present paper, using MPI-AMRVAC, we perform a 2.5D numerical magnetohydrodynamic simulation of the dynamics and associated thermodynamical evolution of an initially force-free Harris current sheet subjected to an external velocity perturbation under the condition of uniform resistivity. The amplitude of the magnetic field is taken to be 10 G, typical of the solar corona. We impose a Gaussian velocity pulse across this current sheet that mimics the interaction of fast magnetoacoustic waves with a current sheet in the corona. This leads to a variety of dynamics and plasma processes in the current sheet, which is initially quasi-static. The initial pulse interacts with the current sheet and splits into a pair of counterpropagating wavefronts, which form a rarefied region that leads to an inflow and a thinning of the current sheet. The thinning results in Petschek-type magnetic reconnection followed by a tearing instability and plasmoid formation. The reconnection outflows containing outward-moving plasmoids have accelerated motions with velocities ranging from 105 to 303 km s−1. The average temperature and density of the plasmoids are found to be 8 MK and twice the background density of the solar corona, respectively. These estimates of the velocity, temperature, and density of the plasmoids are similar to values reported from various solar coronal observations. Therefore, we infer that the external triggering of a quasi-static current sheet by a single-velocity pulse is capable of initiating magnetic reconnection and plasmoid formation in the absence of a localized enhancement of resistivity in the solar corona.

<title>Multiwavelength Pulsations and Surface Temperature Distribution in the Middle-aged Pulsar B1055–52</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a detailed study of the X-ray emission from PSR B1055–52 using XMM-Newton observations from 2019 and 2000. The phase-integrated X-ray emission from this pulsar is poorly described by existing models of neutron star atmospheres. Instead, we confirm that, similar to other middle-aged pulsars, the best-fitting spectral model consists of two blackbody components, with substantially different temperatures and emitting areas, and a nonthermal component characterized by a power law. Our phase-resolved X-ray spectral analysis using this three-component model reveals variations in the thermal emission parameters with the pulsar’s rotational phase. These variations suggest a nonuniform temperature distribution across the neutron star’s surface, including the cold thermal component and probable hot spot(s). Such a temperature distribution can be caused by external and internal heating processes, likely a combination thereof. We observe very high pulse fractions, 60%–80% in the 0.7–1.5 keV range, dominated by the hot blackbody component. This could be related to temperature nonuniformity and potential beaming effects in an atmosphere. We find indication of a second hot spot that appears at lower energies (0.15–0.3 keV) than the first hot spot (0.5–1.5 keV) in the X-ray light curves and is offset by about half a rotation period. This finding aligns with the nearly orthogonal rotator geometry suggested by radio observations of this interpulse pulsar. If the hot spots are associated with polar caps, a possible explanation for their temperature asymmetry could be an offset magnetic dipole and/or an additional toroidal magnetic field component in the neutron star crust.

<title>Late Engine Activity in Neutron Star Mergers and Its Cocoon: An Alternative Scenario for the Blue Kilonova</title>

Follow-up observations of short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) have continuously unveiled late extended/plateau emissions, attributed to jet launch due to late engine activity, the nature of which remains enigmatic. Observations of GW170817 have confirmed that sGRBs are linked to neutron star (NS) mergers, and discovered a kilonova (KN) transient. Nevertheless, the origin of the early blue KN in GW170817 remains unclear. Here, we investigate the propagation of late jets in the merger ejecta. By analytically modeling jet dynamics, we determine the properties of the jet-heated cocoon, and estimate its cooling emission. Our results reveal that late jets generate significantly brighter cocoons compared to prompt jets, primarily due to reduced energy loss by adiabatic cooling. Notably, with typical late jets, emission from the cocoon trapped inside the ejecta can reproduce the blue KN emission. We estimate that the forthcoming Einstein Probe mission will detect the early cocoon emission at a rate of yr−1, and that optical/UV follow-ups in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O5 run will be able to detect cocoon emission events. As an electromagnetic counterpart, this emission provides an independent tool to probe NS mergers in the Universe, complementing insights from sGRBs and gravitational waves.

As the number of known Galactic structures mounts thanks to the Gaia Space Telescope, it is now pertinent to study methods for disentangling structures occupying the same regions of the Milky Way. Indeed, understanding the precise form of each individual structure and the interactions between structures may aid in understanding their origins and chronology. Moreover, accounting for known structures allows one to probe still finer Galactic structure. In order to demonstrate this, we have developed an odd low-pass filter (OLPF), which removes smaller, odd-parity structures like the vertical waves, and use the filtered data to examine the location of the Galaxy’s midplane. We find that the radial wave identified by Xu et al. continues inward to at least the Sun’s location, with an amplitude that decreases toward the inner, denser parts of the disk, consistent with a simple, qualitative simulation. Additionally, we employ the OLPF results to determine the solar offset, z⊙, with smaller structures filtered out. We find that z⊙ = 34.2 ± 0.3 pc.

High-energy photons can produce electron–positron pairs upon interacting with the extragalactic background light. These pairs will in turn be deflected by the intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF), before possibly up-scattering photons of the cosmic microwave background, thereby initiating an electromagnetic cascade. The nonobservation of an excess of GeV photons and an extended halo around individual blazars due to this electromagnetic cascade can be used to constrain the properties of the IGMF. In this work, we use publicly available data of 1ES 0229+200 obtained with the Fermi Large Area Telescope and the High Energy Stereoscopic System to constrain cosmological MHD simulations of various magnetogenesis scenarios, and find that all models without a strong space-filling primordial component or overoptimistic dynamo amplifications can be excluded at the 95% confidence level. In fact, we find that the fraction of space filled by a strong IGMF has to be at least f ≳ 0.67, thus excluding most astrophysical production scenarios. Moreover, we set lower limits of B0 > 5.1 × 10−15 G (B0 > 1.0 × 10−14 G) for a space-filling primordial IGMF for a blazar activity time of Δt = 104 yr (Δt = 107 yr).

<title>Little Red Dots: An Abundant Population of Faint Active Galactic Nuclei at z ∼ 5 Revealed by the EIGER and FRESCO JWST Surveys</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Characterizing the prevalence and properties of faint active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the early Universe is key for understanding the formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and determining their role in cosmic reionization. We perform a spectroscopic search for broad Hα emitters at z ≈ 4–6 using deep JWST/NIRCam imaging and wide field slitless spectroscopy from the EIGER and FRESCO surveys. We identify 20 Hα lines at z = 4.2–5.5 that have broad components with line widths from ∼1200–3700 km s−1, contributing ∼30%–90% of the total line flux. We interpret these broad components as being powered by accretion onto SMBHs with implied masses ∼107–8M⊙. In the UV luminosity range MUV,AGN+host = −21 to −18, we measure number densities of ≈10−5 cMpc−3. This is an order of magnitude higher than expected from extrapolating quasar UV luminosity functions (LFs). Yet, such AGN are found in only <1% of star-forming galaxies at z ∼ 5. The number density discrepancy is much lower when compared to the broad Hα LF. The SMBH mass function agrees with large cosmological simulations. In two objects, we detect complex Hα profiles that we tentatively interpret as caused by absorption signatures from dense gas fueling SMBH growth and outflows. We may be witnessing early AGN feedback that will clear dust-free pathways through which more massive blue quasars are seen. We uncover a strong correlation between reddening and the fraction of total galaxy luminosity arising from faint AGN. This implies that early SMBH growth is highly obscured and that faint AGN are only minor contributors to cosmic reionization.

<title>Turbulent Vortex with Moderate Dust Settling Probed by Scattering-induced Polarization in the IRS 48 System</title>

We investigate the crescent-shaped dust trap in the transition disk Oph IRS 48 using well-resolved (sub)millimeter polarimetric observations at ALMA Band 7 (870 μm). The dust polarization map reveals patterns consistent with dust-scattering-induced polarization. There is a relative displacement between the polarized flux and the total flux, which holds the key to understanding the dust scale heights in this system. We model the polarization observations, focusing on the effects of dust scale heights. We find that the interplay between the inclination-induced polarization and the polarization arising from radiation anisotropy in the crescent determines the observed polarization; the anisotropy is controlled by the dust optical depth along the midplane, which is, in turn, determined by the dust scale height in the vertical direction. We find that the dust grains can be neither completely settled nor well mixed with the gas. The completely settled case produces little radial displacement between the total and polarized flux, while the well-mixed case produces an azimuthal pattern in the outer (radial) edge of the crescent that is not observed. Our best model has a gas-to-dust scale height ratio of 2 and can reproduce both the radial displacement and the azimuthal displacement between the total and polarized flux. We infer an effective turbulence α parameter of approximately 0.0001–0.005. The scattering-induced polarization provides insight into a turbulent vortex with a moderate level of dust settling in the IRS 48 system, which is hard to achieve otherwise.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the first X-ray polarimetric study of the dipping accreting neutron star 4U 1624−49 with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer. We report a detection of polarization in the nondip time intervals with a confidence level of 99.99%. We find an average polarization degree (PD) of 3.1% ± 0.7% and a polarization angle of 81° ± 6° east of north in the 2–8 keV band. We report an upper limit on the PD of 22% during the X-ray dips with 95% confidence. The PD increases with energy, reaching from 3.0% ± 0.9% in the 4–6 keV band to 6% ± 2% in the 6–8 keV band. This indicates the polarization likely arises from Comptonization. The high PD observed is unlikely to be produced by Comptonization in the boundary layer or spreading layer alone. It can be produced by the addition of an extended geometrically thin slab corona covering part of the accretion disk, as assumed in previous models of dippers, and/or a reflection component from the accretion disk.

We present the results obtained from detailed X-ray timing and spectral studies of X-ray pulsar Swift J0243.6+6124 during its giant and normal X-ray outbursts between 2017 and 2023 observed by the Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER). We focused on a timing analysis of the normal outbursts. A distinct break is found in the power density spectra of the source. The corresponding break frequency and slopes of the power laws around the break vary with luminosity, indicating a change in the accretion dynamics with the mass accretion rate. Interestingly, we detected quasiperiodic oscillations within a specific luminosity range, providing further insights into the underlying physical processes. We also studied the neutron star spin period evolution and a luminosity variation in the pulse profile during the recent 2023 outburst. The spectral analysis was conducted comprehensively for the giant and all other normal outbursts. We identified a double transition at luminosities of ≈7.5 × 1037 and 2.1 × 1038 erg s−1 in the evolution of continuum parameters like the photon index and cutoff energy with luminosity. This indicates three distinct accretion modes experienced by the source, mainly during the giant X-ray outburst. A soft blackbody component with a temperature of 0.08–0.7 keV is also detected in the spectra. The observed temperature undergoes a discontinuous transition when the pulsar evolves from a sub- to super-Eddington state. Notably, in addition to an evolving 6–7 keV iron line complex, a 1 keV emission line was observed during the super-Eddington state of the source, implying X-ray reflection from the accretion disk or outflow material.

<div> 盘状星系、寿命分布、Weibull分布、星际盘消退、行星形成模型
<br /><br />这篇文章讨论了原行星盘的寿命分布，指出了不同星际盘的存在时间差异，提出了Weibull分布用于描述寿命分布的可能性，重点讨论了低质量恒星（谱型M3.7至M6，Ms≈0.1–0.24 M⊙）的盘寿命。结果表明，在初始盘分数为0.65时，Weibull分布（k = 2.34，λ = 11.22）和高斯分布（σ = 9.52，μ = 9.52）能较好地拟合观测数据。最终挑战是量化盘的寿命多样性与行星多样性之间的联系。 <br /> <div>
While most protoplanetary disks lose their gas within less than 10 Myr, individual disk lifetimes vary from <1 Myr to ≫20 Myr, with some disks existing for 40 Myr. Mean disk half-lifetimes hide this diversity; only a so-far nonexisting disk lifetime distribution could capture this fact. The benefit of a disk lifetime distribution would be twofold. First, it would provide a stringent test on disk evolution theories. Second, it could function as an input for planet formation models. Here, we derive such a disk lifetime distribution. We heuristically test different standard distribution forms for their ability to account for the observed disk fractions at certain ages. We here concentrate on the distribution for low-mass stars (spectral types M3.7–M6, Ms ≈ 0.1–0.24 M⊙) because disk lifetimes depend on stellar mass. A Weibull-type distribution (k = 1.78, λ = 9.15) describes the observational data if all stars have a disk at a cluster age tc = 0. However, a better match exists for lower initial disk fractions. For f(t=0) = 0.65, a Weibull distribution (k = 2.34, λ = 11.22) and a Gaussian distribution (σ = 9.52, μ = 9.52) fit the data similarly well. All distributions have in common that they are wide, and most disks are dissipated at ages >5 Myr. The next challenge is to quantitatively link the diversity of disk lifetimes to the diversity in planets.

总结:<br /><br />研究团队开发了一个名为CAT-PUMA的工具，利用机器学习算法，通过监督学习对CME的到达时间和地球影响进行预测。他们使用了回归模型和分类模型来进行CME到达时间的预测和地球影响的分类。这种应用提供了关于太空天气事件地球影响的定量指示。研究发现，机器学习模型在回归和分类任务中表现良好，但实际潜力和应用并不总是直观的。为了解决这一挑战，他们使用了模型解释技术，特别是Shap值，以获得对这些模型影响的定量洞见。 <div>
Space weather phenomena have long captured the attention of the scientific community, and along with recent technological developments, the awareness that such phenomena can interfere with human activities on Earth has grown considerably. Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are among the main drivers of space weather. Therefore, developing tools to provide information on their arrival at Earth's nearby space has become increasingly important. Liu et al. developed a tool, called CME Arrival Time Prediction Using Machine Learning Algorithms (CAT-PUMA), to obtain fast and accurate predictions of CME transit time. This present work aims at the expansion of the CAT-PUMA concept, employing supervised learning to obtain vital information about the arrival of CMEs at Earth. In this study, we report the results of our work following the implementation of supervised regression and classification models in the CAT-PUMA framework. We conducted a comparison of various machine learning models in the context of predicting the transit time of CMEs and classifying CMEs as either Earth impacting or non-impacting. In this way, we are able to provide information on the possibility of a CME reaching Earth relying on CME features and solar wind parameters measured at take-off. This application thus provides quantitative indications about the geoeffectiveness of these space weather events. While machine-learning models can demonstrate fairly strong performance in regression and classification tasks, it is not always straightforward to extrapolate their practical potential and real-world applicability. To address this challenge, we employed model interpretation techniques, specifically Shap values, to gain quantitative insights into the limitations that affect these models.

总结:
本研究使用James Clerk Maxwell望远镜对星云G202.3+2.5进行了热尘埃极化观测，发现平均磁场方向与纤维垂直，并在四个子区域显示不同的行为。利用IRAM观测获得的动力学信息，估计了平面磁场强度，并在四个区域中进行了相关重要性研究。此外，研究了DCF和ADF方法在投影效应上的影响。根据模拟案例发现，当使用DCF或ADF方法时，3D磁场强度可能低估了约3倍，可能进一步低估/高估相关参数。 <br /><br /> <div>
We observe the magnetic field morphology toward a nearby star-forming filamentary cloud, G202.3+2.5, using James Clerk Maxwell Telescope/POL-2 850 μm thermal dust polarization observations with an angular resolution of 14.″4 (∼0.053 pc). The average magnetic field orientation is found to be perpendicular to the filaments, while showing different behaviors in the four subregions, suggesting various effects from the filaments’ collision in these subregions. With the kinematics obtained by the observation by IRAM, we estimate the plane-of-sky magnetic field strength by two methods, the classical Davis–Chandrasekhar–Fermi (DCF) method and the angular dispersion function (ADF) method, giving Bpos,dcf and Bpos,adf of ∼90 and ∼53 μG. We study the relative importance between the gravity (G), magnetic field (B), and turbulence (T) in the four subregions, and find G > T > B, G ≥ T > B, G ∼ T > B, and T > G > B in the north tail, west trunk, south root, and east wing, respectively. In addition, we investigate the projection effects on the DCF and ADF methods, based on a similar simulation case, and find the 3D magnetic field strength may be underestimated by a factor of ∼3 if applying the widely used statistical Bpos-to-B3D factor when using the DCF or ADF methods, which may further underestimate/overestimate the related parameters.

<div> 关键词: EROs, 红外相机, 光谱能量分布, 高红移, 星系演化

总结: 一项最新研究发现了一群极端红色天体(EROs)，它们是由詹姆斯·韦伯太空望远镜发现的，在红外摄像机的颜色上具有双峰光谱能量分布(SEDs)，并且具有高红移。研究发现这些EROs可能是包含尘埃的星系或者被遮蔽的活动星系核(AGN)，但无法确定它们的确切特征。此外，研究指出如果这些EROs被确认为高红移的类星体，将导致先前关于高红移的数量密度增加达60倍。因此，未来需要在中红外波段进行进一步的研究以确定这些EROs的真实性质和将其置于恰当的星系演化背景中。<br /><br /> <div>
We study a new population of extremely red objects (EROs) recently discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) based on their NIRCam colors F277W − F444W > 1.5 mag. We find 37 EROs in the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey (CEERS) field with F444W < 28 mag and photometric redshifts between 5 < z < 7, with median . Surprisingly, despite their red long-wavelength colors, these EROs have blue short-wavelength colors (F150W − F200W ∼ 0 mag) indicative of bimodal spectral energy distributions (SEDs) with a red, steep slope in the rest-frame optical, and a blue, flat slope in the rest-frame UV. Moreover, all these EROs are unresolved, point-like sources in all NIRCam bands. We analyze the SEDs of eight of them with MIRI and NIRSpec observations using stellar population models and active galactic nucleus (AGN) templates. We find that dusty galaxies or obscured AGNs provide similarly good SED fits but different stellar properties: massive and dusty, ∼ 10 and AV ≳ 3 mag, or low mass and obscured, ∼ 7.5 and AV ∼ 0 mag, hosting an obscured quasi-stellar object (QSO). SED modeling does not favor either scenario, but their unresolved sizes are more suggestive of AGNs. If any EROs are confirmed to have ≳ 10.5, it would increase the pre-JWST number density at z > 7 by up to a factor ∼60. Similarly, if they are QSOs with luminosities in the Lbol > 1045–46 erg s−1 range, their number would exceed that of bright blue QSOs by more than three orders of magnitude. Additional photometry at mid-infrared wavelengths will reveal the true nature of the red continuum emission in these EROs and will place this puzzling population in the right context of galaxy evolution.

<div> WR 137, JWST, NIRISS, AMI, dust formation
总结:
WR 137是一个大质量双星系统，研究了其通过JWST的NIRISS的AMI观测新形成的尘埃。通过三种独立的软件工具对观测数据进行了分析和校准，并使用三种独立的软件工具进行了图像重建。观测结果显示WR 137中心有一个明亮的核心和一个向西北方向延伸的约300毫角秒的线性丝状结构。通过对碰撞风尘埃凝结的分析，研究表明WR 137的尘埃形成在轨道平面内，由O9伴星增强的赤道质量流失引起。 <div>
We present infrared aperture-masking interferometry (AMI) observations of newly formed dust from the colliding winds of the massive binary Wolf–Rayet system WR 137 with JWST using the Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS). NIRISS AMI observations of WR 137 and a point-spread function calibrator star, HD 228337, were taken using the F380M and F480M filters in 2022 July and August as part of the Director’s Discretionary Early Release Science program #1349. Interferometric observables (squared visibilities and closure phases) from the WR 137 “interferogram” were extracted and calibrated using three independent software tools: ImPlaneIA, AMICAL, and SAMpip. The analysis of the calibrated observables yielded consistent values except for slightly discrepant closure phases measured by ImPlaneIA. Based on all three sets of calibrated observables, images were reconstructed using three independent software tools: BSMEM, IRBis, and SQUEEZE. All reconstructed image combinations generated consistent images in both F380M and F480M filters. The reconstructed images of WR 137 reveal a bright central core with a ∼300 mas linear filament extending to the northwest. A geometric colliding-wind model with dust production constrained to the orbital plane of the binary system and enhanced as the system approaches periapsis provided a general agreement with the interferometric observables and reconstructed images. Based on a colliding-wind dust condensation analysis, we suggest that dust formation within the orbital plane of WR 137 is induced by enhanced equatorial mass loss from the rapidly rotating O9 companion star, whose axis of rotation is aligned with that of the orbit.

总结: 
Hα发射，代表着年轻的超新星残骸（SNR），通过积分视场光谱学研究，19个区域符合要求，其中四个位置与先前发现的超新星相匹配，推测这些物体是由超新星喷发物与周围密集物质相互作用而形成的年轻SNR。这些SNR候选的恒星年龄普遍比核心坍缩（CC）超新星的位置年龄低约0.5 dex，表明它们的原型星可能寿命更短、质量更大。这项工作的方法为用积分视场光谱学研究附近的超新星打开了新的研究窗口。 <div>
We present results from a systematic search for broad (≥ 400 km s−1) Hα emission in integral field spectroscopy data cubes of ∼1200 nearby galaxies obtained with PMAS and MUSE. We found 19 unique regions that pass our quality cuts, four of which match the locations of previously discovered supernovae (SNe): one Type IIP and three Type IIn, including the well-known SN 2005ip. We suggest that these objects are young Supernova remnants (SNRs), with bright and broad Hα emission powered by the interaction between the SN ejecta and dense circumstellar material. The stellar ages measured at the locations of these SNR candidates are systematically lower by about 0.5 dex than those measured at the locations of core-collapse (CC) SNe, implying that their progenitors might be shorter lived and therefore more massive than a typical CCSN progenitor. The methods laid out in this work open a new window into the study of nearby SNe with integral field spectroscopy.

时间尺度为60天的强烈余辉映射活动显示，著名的紫外发射线对连续发射的波动有显著变化。在14个月的观测过程中，UV发射线的响应表现出不同的时间延迟，需要包括每条发射线的缓慢变化背景才能进行一维回声映射模型拟合。这些变化在C iv光线曲线中更为明显，这是Mrk 817中受固有吸收影响最小且不太与相邻发射线混合的光谱线。我们确定了五个具有明显发射线响应的时间窗口，并测量了它们对应的时间延迟，范围为2至13天。这些时间窗口可能与同一时间段内发生的UV和X射线遮挡的变化有关。最短的时间延迟出现在遮挡减弱的时期，而最长的延迟出现在遮挡增加的时期。我们认为遮挡出流屏蔽了广泛的UV线，免受电离的连续发射。由此产生的离子连续发射的光谱能量分布的变化，被远离核心的云所观察，这是造成线响应变化的原因。 <br /><br />总结: 该研究利用哈勃空间望远镜对Seyfert 1星系Mrk 817进行了密集的余辉映射活动，发现UV发射线对连续辐射的响应有显著变化，随着时间的推移呈现出不同的时间延迟。研究指出，这些时间延迟与UV和X射线遮挡的变化有关，最短的时间延迟出现在遮挡减弱的时期，而最长的延迟出现在遮挡增加的时期。此外，研究还提出了遮挡出流屏蔽了广泛的UV线的假设，并解释了因此导致的线响应变化。 <div>
An intensive reverberation mapping campaign of the Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk 817 using the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope revealed significant variations in the response of broad UV emission lines to fluctuations in the continuum emission. The response of the prominent UV emission lines changes over an ∼60 day duration, resulting in distinctly different time lags in the various segments of the light curve over the 14 month observing campaign. One-dimensional echo-mapping models fit these variations if a slowly varying background is included for each emission line. These variations are more evident in the C iv light curve, which is the line least affected by intrinsic absorption in Mrk 817 and least blended with neighboring emission lines. We identify five temporal windows with a distinct emission-line response, and measure their corresponding time delays, which range from 2 to 13 days. These temporal windows are plausibly linked to changes in the UV and X-ray obscuration occurring during these same intervals. The shortest time lags occur during periods with diminishing obscuration, whereas the longest lags occur during periods with rising obscuration. We propose that the obscuring outflow shields the broad UV lines from the ionizing continuum. The resulting change in the spectral energy distribution of the ionizing continuum, as seen by clouds at a range of distances from the nucleus, is responsible for the changes in the line response.

<div> Spitzer/IRS spectra, interstellar features, amorphous silicate dust, extinction profile, peak wavelength<br />
<br />总结:<br />本文利用"对比法"确定了硅酸盐消光谱线，发现9.7μm特征峰值波长约为9.2-9.8μm，而18μm特征峰值波长约为18-22μm。9.7μm特征峰值波长似乎随着恒星光谱类型的变化而变短，而全宽却与光谱类型似乎无关，这可能与星周硅酸盐发射有关。9.7μm硅酸盐吸收光学深度Δτ9.7随J-KS颜色过剩增加而增加。此外，9.7μm特征的峰值波长和全宽的相关系数为0.4，表明存在正相关关系。研究方法与用大气模型的光谱能量分布替换参考星进行了比较，结果显示没有显著差异。 <div>
The 9.7 and 18 μm interstellar spectral features, arising from the Si–O stretching and O–Si–O bending modes of amorphous silicate dust, are the strongest extinction features in the infrared. Here we use the “pair method” to determine the silicate extinction profile by comparing the Spitzer/IRS spectra of 49 target stars with obvious extinction with those of unreddened stars of the same spectral type. The 9.7 μm extinction profile is determined from all the 49 stars and the 18 μm profile is determined from six stars. It is found that the profile has a peak wavelength at ∼9.2–9.8 and ∼18–22 μm, respectively. The peak wavelength of the 9.7 μm feature seems to become shorter for stars of late spectral types; meanwhile the FWHM seems irrelevant to the spectral type, which may be related to circumstellar silicate emission. The silicate optical depth at 9.7 μm, Δτ9.7, mostly increases with the color excess in J − KS ( ). The mean ratio of the visual extinction to the 9.7 μm silicate absorption optical depth is AV/Δτ9.7 ≈ 17.8, in close agreement with that of the solar-neighborhood diffuse interstellar medium. When , this proportionality changes. The correlation coefficient between the peak wavelength and the FWHM of the 9.7 μm feature is 0.4, which indicates a positive correlation considering the uncertainties of the parameters. The method is compared with replacing the reference star by an atmospheric model spectral energy distribution and no significant difference is observed.

<div> SEP事件, 太阳能粒子, 磁场, EUV波, 飞行器

太阳能粒子加速的主要驱动因素被认为是由日冕质量抛射引起的冲击波。极紫外波被认为是太阳表面上冲击波的传播足迹。SEP研究中的一个关键问题是SEP释放的时间与EUV波与观测者磁性连接的时间之间的关系。利用帕克太阳探测器（PSP）和太阳轨道飞行器（SolO）对太阳附近的测量，我们调查了发生在2021年9月28日的一个SEP事件，SolO、PSP、STEREO-A和近地飞行器在不同位置观测到该事件。在此期间，SolO、PSP和STEREO-A相对于SEP源区有相似的标称磁场足点，但处于不同的太阳系距离。我们发现，在这四个地点估计的SEP释放时间相对于EUV波截获连接到每个飞行器的标称磁场足点的时间延迟约30-60分钟。结合无线电、白光和EUV的多波长观测和几何冲击模型，我们分析了此事件中的冲击特性，并讨论了SEP的加速和延迟释放过程，以及使用EUV波确定SEP加速和释放时间的准确性和局限性。 <br /><br />总结: SEP事件的驱动因素主要是由冠状质量抛射引起的冲击波，而极紫外波被认为是在太阳表面的冲击痕迹。文章对一个SEP事件的观测进行了研究和分析，发现SEP释放时间与EUV波截获连接到观测器的标称磁场足点的时间之间存在一定程度的延迟。通过多波长观测和几何冲击模型的分析，讨论了SEP的加速和延迟释放过程，以及使用EUV波确定SEP加速和释放时间的准确性和局限性。 <div>
The main driver of the acceleration of solar energetic particles (SEPs) is believed to be shocks driven by coronal mass ejections. Extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) waves are thought to be the propagating footprint of the shock on the solar surface. One of the key questions in SEP research is the timing of the SEP release with respect to the time when the EUV wave magnetically connects with an observer. Taking advantage of close-to-the-Sun measurements by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar Orbiter (SolO), we investigate an SEP event that occurred on 2021 September 28 and was observed at different locations by SolO, PSP, STEREO-A, and near-Earth spacecraft. During this time, SolO, PSP, and STEREO-A shared similar nominal magnetic footpoints relative to the SEP source region but were at different heliocentric distances. We find that the SEP release times estimated at these four locations were delayed compared to the times when the EUV wave intercepted the footpoints of the nominal magnetic fields connecting to each spacecraft by around 30–60 minutes. Combining observations in multiple wavelengths of radio, white light, and EUV with a geometrical shock model, we analyze the associated shock properties and discuss the acceleration and delayed release processes of SEPs in this event as well as the accuracy and limitations of using EUV waves to determine the SEP acceleration and release times.

IGR J17091–3624 is a black hole X-ray binary (BHXB), often referred to as the “twin” of GRS 1915+105 because it is the only other known BHXB that can show exotic “heartbeat”-like variability that is highly structured and repeated. Here, we report on observations of IGR J17091–3624 from its 2022 outburst, where we detect an unusually coherent quasiperiodic oscillation (QPO) when the broadband variability is low (total fractional rms ≲6%) and the spectrum is dominated by the accretion disk. Such spectral and variability behavior is characteristic of the soft state of typical BHXBs (i.e., those that do not show heartbeats), but we also find that this QPO is strongest when there is some exotic heartbeat-like variability (so-called Class V variability). This QPO is detected at frequencies between 5 and 8 Hz and has Q factors (defined as the QPO frequency divided by the width) ≳50, making it one of the most highly coherent low-frequency QPOs ever seen in a BHXB. The extremely high Q factor makes this QPO distinct from typical low-frequency QPOs that are conventionally classified into type-A/B/C QPOs. Instead, we find evidence that archival observations of GRS 1915+105 also showed a similarly high-coherence QPO in the same frequency range, suggesting that this unusually coherent and strong QPO may be unique to BHXBs that can exhibit “heartbeat”-like variability.

在IC 342附近的100 m Robert C.

We report observations of the ground state transitions of 12CO, 13CO, C18O, HCN, and HCO+ at 88–115 GHz in the inner region of the nearby galaxy IC 342. These data were obtained with the 16 pixel spectroscopic focal plane array Argus on the 100 m Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) at 6″–9″ resolution. In the nuclear bar region, the intensity distributions of 12CO(1–0) and 13CO(1–0) emission trace moderate densities, and differ from the dense gas distributions sampled in C18O(1–0), HCN(1–0), and HCO+(1–0). We observe a constant HCN(1–0)-to-HCO+(1–0) ratio of 1.2 ± 0.1 across the whole ∼1 kpc bar. This indicates that the HCN(1–0) and HCO+(1–0) lines have intermediate optical depth, and that the corresponding of the gas producing the emission is of order 104.5−6 cm−3. We show that HCO+(1–0) is thermalized and HCN(1–0) is close to thermalization. The very tight correlation between the HCN(1–0) and HCO+(1–0) intensities across the 1 kpc bar suggests that this ratio is more sensitive to the relative abundance of the two species than to the gas density. We confirm an angular offset (∼10″) between the spatial distribution of molecular gas and the star formation sites. Finally, we find a breakdown of the LIR– correlation at high spatial resolution due to the effect of incomplete sampling of star-forming regions by HCN emission in IC 342. The scatter of the LIR– relation decreases as the spatial scale increases from 10″ to 30″ (170–510 pc), and is comparable to the scatter of the global relation at a scale of 340 pc.

On 2022 February 15–16, multiple spacecraft measured one of the most intense solar energetic particle (SEP) events observed so far in Solar Cycle 25. This study provides an overview of interesting observations made by multiple spacecraft during this event. Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and BepiColombo were close to each other at 0.34–0.37 au (a radial separation of ∼0.03 au) as they were impacted by the flank of the associated coronal mass ejection (CME). At about 100° in the retrograde direction and 1.5 au away from the Sun, the radiation detector on board the Curiosity surface rover observed the largest ground-level enhancement on Mars since surface measurements began. At intermediate distances (0.7–1.0 au), the presence of stream interaction regions (SIRs) during the SEP arrival time provides additional complexities regarding the analysis of the distinct contributions of CME-driven versus SIR-driven events in observations by spacecraft such as Solar Orbiter and STEREO-A, and by near-Earth spacecraft like ACE, SOHO, and WIND. The proximity of PSP and BepiColombo also enables us to directly compare their measurements and perform cross-calibration for the energetic particle instruments on board the two spacecraft. Our analysis indicates that energetic proton measurements from BepiColombo and PSP are in reasonable agreement with each other to within a factor of ∼1.35. Finally, this study introduces the various ongoing efforts that will collectively improve our understanding of this impactful, widespread SEP event.

ALMA观测了绿谷中的三个星系和两个星系的密度气体示踪物，研究发现，密度气体丰度对星系内的特定星形成率影响不大，星系内特定星形成率主要受SFEmol和SFEdense影响，而不是受密度气体的影响。与其他研究相比，绿谷样本显示出更低的全局SFEmol和更低的SFEdense，但在密度气体丰度方面与星形成和星暴星系相似。因此，绿谷星系中正常的分子气体含量受到抑制，主要是由于降低的SFEdense而不是密度气体的缺乏。<br /><br />总结：ALMA观测了绿谷中的三个星系和两个星系的密度气体示踪物，研究发现，密度气体丰度对星系内的特定星形成率影响不大，星系内特定星形成率主要受SFEmol和SFEdense影响，而不是受密度气体的影响。与其他研究相比，绿谷样本显示出更低的全局SFEmol和更低的SFEdense，但在密度气体丰度方面与星形成和星暴星系相似。因此，绿谷星系中正常的分子气体含量受到抑制，主要是由于降低的SFEdense而不是密度气体的缺乏。 <div>
We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of two dense gas tracers, HCN (1−0) and HCO+ (1-0) for three galaxies in the green valley and two galaxies on the star-forming main sequence with comparable molecular gas fractions as traced by the CO (1−0) emissions, selected from the ALMaQUEST survey. We investigate whether the deficit of molecular gas star formation efficiency (SFEmol) that leads to the low specific star formation rate (sSFR) in these green valley galaxies is due to a lack of dense gas (characterized by the dense gas fraction fdense) or the low star formation efficiency of dense gas (SFEdense). We find that SFEmol as traced by the CO emissions, when considering both star-forming and retired spaxels together, is tightly correlated with SFEdense and depends only weakly on fdense. The sSFR on kiloparsec scales is primarily driven by SFEmol and SFEdense, followed by the dependence on fmol, and is least correlated with fdense or the dense-gas-to-stellar mass ratio (Rdense). When compared with other works in the literature, we find that our green valley sample shows lower global SFEmol and lower SFEdense while exhibiting similar dense gas fractions when compared to star-forming and starburst galaxies. We conclude that the star formation of the three green valley galaxies with a normal abundance of molecular gas is suppressed, mainly due to the reduced SFEdense rather than the lack of dense gas.

<title>Long-term Evolution in Ionization of Ejecta Illuminated by Eta Carinae</title>

<div> 关键词: Eta Carinae, spectrum, evolution, circumstellar ejecta, ionization
总结: 
Eta Carinae (η Car)自1900年以来，其光度和光谱发生了变化，可能是由于中心双星系统的演化或周围射流物质的变化。在1940年代出现的亮度跳跃与窄禁闭发射线的出现可能是由于周围射流物质的清除和电离。之后的40年间，亮度变化缓慢。1990年代早期，被解释为中心双星向Weigelt clumps的光线通道中消散的限制线发射增加导致的。而到了2000年，中心恒星核心亮度增加迅速，但Homunculus没有明显变化。到2018年，从（η Car）到我们的LOS中的单电离金属发生了数百次窄线吸收的现象消失，这可能是由于金属的电离增加造成的。这三次事件的解释是Homunculus附近的周围射流物质的耗散。在过去的四十年中，Homunculus和主要的星风保持稳定，这表明我们方向上的周围射流物质已经被清除。 <div>
Changes in the flux and spectrum of Eta Carinae (η Car) since 1900 have been attributed to the evolution of the central binary by some. Others suggest evolution in the occulting ejecta. The brightness jump in the 1940s, which coincided with the appearance of narrow forbidden emission lines, may have been caused by the clearing and ionization of intervening circumstellar ejecta. The brightening changed at a slower pace up through 40 yr later. Here we continue earlier studies focused on the long-term, showing that the forbidden line emission increased in the early 1990s with no noticeable increase in the brightness of the Homunculus. We interpret that the increase in narrow-line emission is due to decreased extinction in the line of sight (LOS) from the central binary to the Weigelt clumps. In 2000, the central stellar core increased in brightness at a faster rate without associated changes in the Homunculus. By 2018, hundreds of narrow-line absorptions from singly ionized metals in our LOS from (η Car) disappeared, thought to be caused by increased ionization of metals. These three events (1990, 2000, and 2018) are explained by the dissipation of circumstellar material within the Homunculus close to the binary. Combining these changes with the steadiness of the Homunculus and the primary winds over the past four decades indicates that circumstellar ejecta in our direction have been cleared.

<br />
本文通过三维磁流体动力学模拟揭示了磁场对通过丝状物质碎裂形成的分子云核角动量演化的影响。研究发现，在弱和强磁场情况下，质量为1太阳质量的情况下，角动量分别减少了30%和50%。通过分析在流体元素上施加的扭矩，确定了在强磁场情况下，磁张力是质量尺度≲3太阳质量时角动量转移的主要过程。我们还发现，核的角动量的各向异性转移由于强磁场的存在只会改变核的角动量约2倍。研究还表明，旋转轴和磁场之间的角度分布在第一个核形成之前甚至没有明显的对齐。我们的结果还表明，核的角动量的多样性来源于初始湍流速度场的相位差异。这种多样性可能有助于最近观测到的原行星盘的尺寸和其他性质的多样性。 
<br /><br />总结: <br />磁场对分子云核角动量的影响进行了研究，发现在强磁场条件下，角动量减小约50%。同时分析了磁力对角动量转移的影响，指出磁张力是影响角动量转移的主要过程。研究结果还发现旋转轴和磁场之间的角度分布并不强烈对齐，并且核的角动量多样性来源于初始湍流速度场的相位差异。 <div>
The angular momentum of molecular cloud cores plays a key role in the star formation process. However, the evolution of the angular momentum of molecular cloud cores formed in magnetized molecular filaments is still unclear. In this paper, we perform 3D magnetohydrodynamics simulations to reveal the effect of the magnetic field on the evolution of the angular momentum of molecular cloud cores formed through filament fragmentation. As a result, we find that the angular momentum decreases by 30% and 50% at the mass scale of 1 M⊙ in the case of weak and strong magnetic field, respectively. By analyzing the torques exerted on fluid elements, we identify the magnetic tension as the dominant process for angular momentum transfer for mass scales ≲3 M⊙ for the strong magnetic field case. This critical mass scale can be understood semianalytically as the timescale of magnetic braking. We show that the anisotropy of the angular momentum transfer due to the presence of a strong magnetic field changes the resultant angular momentum of the core only by a factor of 2. We also find that the distribution of the angle between the rotation axis and the magnetic field does not show strong alignment even just before the first core formation. Our results also indicate that the variety of the angular momentum of the cores is inherited from the difference in the phase of the initial turbulent velocity field. The variety could contribute to the diversity in size and other properties of protoplanetary disks recently reported by observations.

<div> 太阳，CME， Solar Orbiter，BepiColombo， Parker Solar Probe
总结: 2022年2月15日，科学家观测到了一次令人印象深刻的太阳色球丝发射事件，该事件与一个快速的日冕物质抛射（CME）有关，其速度约为2200km/s。此CME指向BepiColombo和Parker Solar Probe，这两个探测器在CME驱动的冲击波到达时的纬度相差2°，经度相差4°，径向距离相差0.03天文单位。两个探测器测得的主要CME相关结构显示一些明显差异，增加了对整体CME结构的理解的挑战。需要通过距离较近的探测器星座来研究太阳瞬变现象。 <div>
On 2022 February 15, an impressive filament eruption was observed off the solar eastern limb from three remote-sensing viewpoints, namely, Earth, STEREO-A, and Solar Orbiter. In addition to representing the most-distant observed filament at extreme ultraviolet wavelengths—captured by Solar Orbiter's field of view extending to above 6 R⊙—this event was also associated with the release of a fast (∼2200 km s−1) coronal mass ejection (CME) that was directed toward BepiColombo and Parker Solar Probe. These two probes were separated by 2° in latitude, 4° in longitude, and 0.03 au in radial distance around the time of the CME-driven shock arrival in situ. The relative proximity of the two probes to each other and the Sun (∼0.35 au) allows us to study the mesoscale structure of CMEs at Mercury's orbit for the first time. We analyze similarities and differences in the main CME-related structures measured at the two locations, namely, the interplanetary shock, the sheath region, and the magnetic ejecta. We find that, despite the separation between the two spacecraft being well within the typical uncertainties associated with determination of CME geometric parameters from remote-sensing observations, the two sets of in situ measurements display some profound differences that make understanding the overall 3D CME structure particularly challenging. Finally, we discuss our findings within the context of space weather at Mercury's distance and in terms of the need to investigate solar transients via spacecraft constellations with small separations, which has been gaining significant attention during recent years.

More than 36 yr have passed since the discovery of the infrared excess from circumstellar dust orbiting the white dwarf G29-38, which at 17.5 pc it is the nearest and brightest of its class. The precise morphology of the orbiting dust remains only marginally constrained by existing data, subject to model-dependent inferences, and thus fundamental questions of its dynamical origin and evolution persist. This study presents a means to constrain the geometric distribution of the emitting dust using stellar pulsations measured at optical wavelengths as a variable illumination source of the dust, which reradiates primarily in the infrared. By combining optical photometry from the Whole Earth Telescope with 0.7–2.5 μm spectroscopy obtained with SpeX at NASA’s Infrared Telescope Facility, we detect luminosity variations at all observed wavelengths, with variations at most wavelengths corresponding to the behavior of the pulsating stellar photosphere, but toward the longest wavelengths the light curves probe the corresponding time variability of the circumstellar dust. In addition to developing methodology, we find the pulsation amplitudes decrease with increasing wavelength for principal pulsation modes, yet increase beyond ≈2 μm for nonlinear combination frequencies. We interpret these results as combination modes derived from the principal modes of identical ℓ values and discuss the implications for the morphology of the warm dust. We also draw attention to some discrepancies between our findings and theoretical expectations for the results of the nonlinearity imposed by the surface convection zone on mode–mode interactions and on the behavior of the first harmonic of the highest-amplitude pulsation mode.

The radiation mechanism (thermal photosphere or magnetic synchrotron) and the progenitor of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are under hot debate. Recently discovered, the prompt long-duration (∼10 s, normally from the collapse of massive stars) property of GRB 211211A strongly conflicts with its association with a kilonova (normally from the merger of two compact objects, NS–NS, NS–BH, or NS–WD, duration ≲2 s). In this paper, we find that the probability photosphere model with a structured jet can satisfactorily explain this peculiar long duration, through the duration stretching effect (∼3 times) on the intrinsic longer (∼3 s) duration of an NS–BH merger, the observed empirical 2SBPL spectrum (with soft low-energy index α of ∼−1), and its evolution. In addition, much evidence of the NS–BH merger origin is found, especially the good fit of the afterglow-subtracted optical−near-IR light curves by the significant thermal cocoon emission and the sole thermal “red” kilonova component. Finally, a convincing new explanation for the X-ray afterglow plateau is revealed.

AMS-02 on board the International Space Station provides precise measurements of cosmic rays (CR) near Earth, while Voyager measures CRs in the local interstellar medium, beyond the effects of solar modulation. Based on these data, we test and revise various CR propagation scenarios under standard assumptions: pure diffusion, diffusion with convection, diffusion with reacceleration, and diffusion with reacceleration and convection. We report on the scenarios’ performance against CR measurements, aiming to limit the number of model parameters as much as possible. For each scenario, we find parameters that are able to reproduce Voyager and AMS-02 data for the entire energy band for all the CR species tested. Above several GV, we observe a similar injection spectral index for He and C, with He harder than H. Some scenarios previously disfavored are now reconsidered. For example, contrary to usual assumptions, we find that the pure diffusion scenario does not need an upturn in the diffusion coefficient at low energy, while it needs the same number of low-energy breaks in the injection spectrum as diffusive-reacceleration scenarios. We show that scenarios differ in modeled spectra of one order of magnitude for positrons at ∼1 GeV and of a factor of 2 for antiprotons at several GV. The force-field approximation describes well the AMS-02 and Voyager spectra analyzed, except antiprotons. We confirm the ∼10 GeV excess in the antiproton spectrum for all scenarios. Also, for all scenarios, the resulting modulation should be stronger for positrons than for nuclei, with reacceleration models requiring much larger modulation.

<br />双中子星融合现在被认为是大量产生重元素的过程，但是否是唯一或主要的快速中子俘获核生成过程的地点尚不清楚。双中子星的发生率、延迟时间和银河环境将影响它们对太阳系和银河中元素丰度的总贡献。另外，双中子星融合的预期元素产量可能取决于融合参数本身，例如它们的恒星质量和半径，这在许多银河化学演化模型中尚未考虑。通过观察 Milky Way 中的双中子星系统样本的特征，我们预测了双中子星群体在融合时产生的预期核合成产物，并将其核合成特征与太阳系元素的重元素丰度模式进行了比较。我们发现，根据当前的模型，目前的双中子星群体更有利于产生较轻的 r-过程元素，而相对于太阳系来说产生了较轻的元素。这种不一致可能意味着存在额外的重元素产生地点或者一个与目前观察到的双中子星群体相差很大的群体。 <br /><br />总结:双中子星融合是重元素产生的重要过程，但它们对于重元素丰度的贡献可能被低估。当前的模型显示，双中子星更有可能产生轻型 r-过程元素，而相对于太阳系来说产生了较少的重元素。这可能意味着存在其他产生重元素的地点或者目前观察到的双中子星群体有所不同。 <div>
While it is now known that the mergers of double neutron star binary systems (NSMs) are copious producers of heavy elements, there remains much speculation about whether they are the sole or even principal site of rapid neutron-capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis, one of the primary ways in which heavy elements are produced. The occurrence rates, delay times, and galactic environments of NSMs hold sway over estimating their total contribution to the elemental abundances in the solar system and the Galaxy. Furthermore, the expected elemental yields of NSMs may depend on the merger parameters themselves—such as their stellar masses and radii—which are not currently considered in many galactic chemical evolution models. Using the characteristics of the observed sample of double neutron star (DNS) systems in the Milky Way as a guide, we predict the expected nucleosynthetic yields that a population of DNSs would produce upon merger, and we compare that nucleosynthetic signature to the heavy-element abundance pattern of solar system elements. We find that with our current models, the present DNS population favors the production of lighter r-process elements, while underproducing the heaviest elements relative to the solar system. This inconsistency could imply an additional site for the heaviest elements or a population of DNSs much different from that observed today.

总结: 
DESI早期数据释放，使用SV3数据对z=0.1到0.3的HOD进行建模，其中包括CiC测量。使用galtab软件包对HOD模型进行快速精确的CiC预测，加速并提高了HOD参数的约束。通过HOD拟合，对特征暗物质质量和组装偏差进行了约束，并提供了各个阈值样本的特征暗物质质量、组装偏差等参数的数据。未来DESI数据预计会进一步缩小这些约束范围，因为数据范围将是SV3的100倍。 <div>
We explore the galaxy-halo connection information that is available in low-redshift samples from the early data release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We model the halo occupation distribution (HOD) from z = 0.1 to 0.3 using Survey Validation 3 (SV3; a.k.a., the One-Percent Survey) data of the DESI Bright Galaxy Survey. In addition to more commonly used metrics, we incorporate counts-in-cylinders (CiC) measurements, which drastically tighten HOD constraints. Our analysis is aided by the Python package, galtab, which enables the rapid, precise prediction of CiC for any HOD model available in halotools. This methodology allows our Markov chains to converge with much fewer trial points, and enables even more drastic speedups due to its GPU portability. Our HOD fits constrain characteristic halo masses tightly and provide statistical evidence for assembly bias, especially at lower luminosity thresholds: the HOD of central galaxies in z ∼ 0.15 samples with limiting absolute magnitude Mr < −20.0 and Mr < −20.5 samples is positively correlated with halo concentration with a significance of 99.9% and 99.5%, respectively. Our models also favor positive central assembly bias for the brighter Mr < −21.0 sample at z ∼ 0.25 (94.8% significance), but there is no significant evidence for assembly bias with the same luminosity threshold at z ∼ 0.15. We provide our constraints for each threshold sample’s characteristic halo masses, assembly bias, and other HOD parameters. These constraints are expected to be significantly tightened with future DESI data, which will span an area 100 times larger than that of SV3.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been proposed as one of the promising sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs), but observational evidence is still lacking. The nearby brightest of all time GRB 221009A, a once in 1000 yr event, is able to accelerate protons to ∼103 EeV, and then generate extremly energetic neutrons via the photomeson production interaction. Protons arriving at the Milky Way are dominated by neutron-decay-induced protons. The intergalactic magnetic fields would not yield a sizable delay of the ≥10 EeV cosmic rays if its strength is ≲10−13 G, while Galactic magnetic fields would cause a significant time delay. We predict that a UHECR burst from GRB 221009A would be detectable by the Pierre Auger Observatory and the TA×4, within ∼10 yr. The detection of such a UHECR outburst will provide the direct evidence for UHECR acceleration in GRBs.

<div> 关键词: 超新星、恒星演化、密集星周介质、双星、CSM
总结:
超新星观测表明部分大质量恒星在核心崩塌时存在密集的星周介质。本研究使用MESA进行大质量恒星的双星演化模拟，并通过PLUTO进行流体动力学模拟，探讨了双星演化对星周介质形成的影响。研究发现，在双星系统中，质量传递率可能在Roche波效应开始时增加，与爆炸前CSM的结构有关。此外，不同轨道周期的双星系统会形成不同密度结构的CSM，包括壳状和悬崖状结构。这些特征结构的长度尺度约为10^17厘米，若CSM速度较慢（约10 km/s），长期超新星观测可能揭示这些结构。研究结果强调了双星相互作用在再现CSM结构多样性方面的重要性。 <div>
Recent observations of supernovae (SNe) have indicated that a fraction of massive stars possess dense circumstellar medium (CSM) at the moment of their core collapses. They suggest the presence of additional activities of the SN progenitor driving the enhancement of the mass-loss rate, and some physical processes attributing to a single star’s activities have been considered. In this study, we carry out binary evolutionary simulations of massive stars by MESA and investigate effects on the subsequent CSM formation through hydrodynamical simulations by PLUTO. We show that the mass transfer rate in a binary can increase at the beginning of the Roche lobe overflow, and this enhancement would be associated with the structure of the CSM before the explosion. We also illustrate that, depending on the orbital period of the binary, the density structure of the CSM can have a diverse distribution, including shell-like and cliff-like structures. These characteristic structures appear within the length scale of ∼1017 cm and could be traced by long-term observations of SNe, if the slow velocity of the CSM is assumed (∼10 km s−1). Our results highlight the importance of binary interaction in the aspect of reproducing the diversity of the CSM configuration.

线偏振ALMA观测显示了Orion Molecular Cloud 3区域内七个恒星形成源的尘埃盘状结构和CO流的特征。尘埃盘的直径从16到97天文单位不等，其中一些源的极化强度占据了整个Stokes I峰值的10%至20%。其中一些源的极化方向与尘埃盘的短轴对齐，而一些源的极化强度出现了向盘的近侧移动，支持了极化辐射源于自相散射的观点。文章还对极化辐射的来源进行了讨论，包括自相散射和磁场对尘埃排列的影响。 <div>
We present the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of linearly polarized 1.1 mm continuum emission at ∼0.″14 (55 au) resolution and CO (J = 2−1) emission at ∼1.″5 (590 au) resolution toward one prestellar (MMS 4), four Class 0 (MMS 1, MMS 3, MMS 5, and MMS 6), one Class I (MMS 7), and one flat-spectrum (MMS 2) sources in the Orion Molecular Cloud 3 region. The dust disk-like structures and clear CO outflows are detected toward all sources except for MMS 4. The diameters of these disk-like structures, ranging from 16 to 97 au, are estimated based on the deconvolved full width half maximum (FWHM) values obtained from the multi-Gaussian fitting. Polarized emissions are detected toward MMS 2, MMS 5, MMS 6, and MMS 7, while no polarized emission is detected toward MMS 1, MMS 3, and MMS 4. MMS 2, MMS 5, and MMS 7 show organized polarization vectors aligned with the minor axes of the disk-like structures, with mean polarization fractions ranging from 0.6% to 1.2%. The strongest millimeter source, MMS 6, exhibits complex polarization orientations and a remarkably high polarization fraction of ∼10% around the Stokes I peak, and 15%–20% on the arm-like structure, as reported by Takahashi et al. (2019). The origins of the polarized emission, such as self-scattering and dust alignment due to the magnetic field or radiative torque, are discussed for individual sources. Some disk-like sources exhibit a polarized intensity peak shift toward the nearside of the disk, which supports that the polarized emission originates from self-scattering.

<div> 黑洞，星系，分子气体，星形成，ALMA<br />
总结:<br />
Henize 2–10 是一个矮星爆发星系，其中含有一个大约10^6太阳质量的黑洞，它正在驱动电离流，并在星系中心的约100光年范围内触发星形成。研究使用ALMA进行了射电和分子谱线观测，发现黑洞的谱能量分布在1.4至340 GHz范围内由同步辐射主导。分析了分子气体数据，并确定了黑洞周围的分子气体结构，其物理尺度约为130光年×30光年，分子气体质量约为10^6太阳质量。值得注意的是，黑洞的位置与分子气体的峰值强度有显著偏移，这可能解释了为什么黑洞的Eddington比例非常低。对CO J = 3–2和J = 1–0的空间分辨率线比的分析表明，黑洞附近的CO气体受到了极高的激发，特别是在黑洞喷流和触发星形成区域的交界处。这暗示着冷的分子气体受到了黑洞的双极喷流的冲击，支持了积极的黑洞反馈的观点。 <div>
Henize 2–10 is a dwarf starburst galaxy hosting a ∼106M⊙ black hole (BH) that is driving an ionized outflow and triggering star formation within the central ∼100 pc of the galaxy. Here, we present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array continuum observations from 99 to 340 GHz, as well as spectral line observations of the molecules CO (1–0, 3–2), HCN (1–0, 3–2), and HCO+ (1–0, 3–2), with a focus on the BH and its vicinity. Incorporating centimeter-wave radio measurements from the literature, we show that the spectral energy distribution of the BH is dominated by synchrotron emission from 1.4 to 340 GHz, with a spectral index of α ≈ − 0.5. We analyze the spectral line data and identify an elongated molecular gas structure around the BH with a velocity distinct from the surrounding regions. The physical extent of this molecular gas structure is ≈130 pc × 30 pc and the molecular gas mass is ∼106M⊙. Despite an abundance of molecular gas in this general region, the position of the BH is significantly offset from the peak intensity, which may explain why the BH is radiating at a very low Eddington ratio. Our analysis of the spatially resolved line ratio between CO J = 3–2 and J = 1–0 implies that the CO gas in the vicinity of the BH is highly excited, particularly at the interface between the BH outflow and the regions of triggered star formation. This suggests that the cold molecular gas is being shocked by the bipolar outflow from the BH, supporting the case for positive BH feedback.

这篇文章总结了对与太阳光度相似的恒星利用自相关函数（ACF）技术推导出的旋转周期的困难。研究了影响这些测量精度的各种因素，包括观测窗口和噪声的影响、恒星活动和倾斜、光谱通带以及相邻分段的分离规范化。验证了faculae造成的光度变化非常周期性，但星斑是太阳类星上差异变化的主要来源。量化了使类太阳光变周期足够强以进行可靠测量的faculae相对贡献的强度，以及使纯星斑光变周期足够强的星斑寿命需要多长。通常来说，观测窗口越长，即使没有faculae存在，ACF测量也更加准确。由于增强了faculae相对贡献，观测中倾斜度中等的恒星、活动极小期间的观测和/或通过更蓝的通带观测均会加强光变曲线的周期性。我们还在太阳类恒星的宽带光度中寻找了faculae的其他表现形式，并得出结论：在没有绝对光通量测量或限制为更短波长的通带时，差分光变曲线对于faculae没有信息量。<br /><br />总结: 光变特性的测量利用ACF技术困难，主要受到恒星活动、观测窗口和恒星倾斜等因素影响。Faculae引起的光度变化非常周期性，而星斑是主要光变源。观测窗口越长，测量越准确。通过增强faculae相对贡献、恒星倾斜度中等的观测和更蓝的通带观测可以加强光变曲线的周期性。在宽带光度中差分光变曲线对于faculae没有信息量。 <div>
Rotational periods derived from autocorrelation function (ACF) techniques on stars photometrically similar to the Sun in Kepler data have proven difficult to reliably determine. We investigate various instrumental and astrophysical factors affecting the accuracy of these measurements, including the effects of observational windows and noise, stellar activity and inclination, spectral passbands, and the separate normalization of contiguous segments. We validate that the flux variations due to faculae are very periodic, but starspots are the dominant source of bolometric and visible differential variability in Sun-like stars on rotational timescales. We quantify how much stronger the relative contribution of faculae would have to be to render Sun-like light curves periodic enough to reliably measure with autocorrelation methods. We also quantify how long starspot lifetimes need to be to render pure spot light curves periodic enough. In general, longer observational windows yield more accurate ACF measurements, even when faculae are not present. Due to the enhancement of the relative contribution of faculae, observing stars with intermediate inclinations, during activity minima, and/or through bluer passbands has the effect of strengthening the periodicity of the light curve. We search for other manifestations of faculae in broadband photometry of Sun-like stars and conclude that without absolute flux measurements or restriction to shorter-wavelength passbands, differential light curves are uninformative about faculae.

Galactic compact binaries with orbital periods shorter than a few hours emit detectable gravitational waves (GWs) at low frequencies. Their GW signals can be detected with the future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Crucially, they may be useful in the early months of the mission operation in helping to validate LISA's performance in comparison to prelaunch expectations. We present an updated list of 55 candidate LISA-detectable binaries with measured properties, for which we derive distances based on Gaia Data Release 3 astrometry. Based on the known properties from electromagnetic observations, we predict the LISA detectability after 1, 3, 6, and 48 months using Bayesian analysis methods. We distinguish between verification and detectable binaries as being detectable after 3 and 48 months, respectively. We find 18 verification binaries and 22 detectable sources, which triples the number of known LISA binaries over the last few years. These include detached double white dwarfs, AM CVn binaries, one ultracompact X-ray binary, and two hot subdwarf binaries. We find that across this sample the GW amplitude is expected to be measured to ≈10% on average, while the inclination is expected to be determined with ≈15° precision. For detectable binaries, these average errors increase to ≈50% and ≈40°, respectively.

<div> radio supernovae, inhomogeneities, deduced source properties, volume filling factor, synchrotron emission

总结:<br /><br />本文讨论了空间未解析源中不均匀性的存在，这使得很难确定源的性质。文章展示了如何利用不符合均匀模型的观察特征来推断射电超新星中不均匀性的性质。此外，放射冷却的观察结果可能会受到不均匀性的严重影响。文章指出，观测到的冷却频率的值对推断源的性质非常敏感；即使是下限通常也有助于限制其特征。文章认为SN 2003L中的主要同步辐射发射区具有较小的体积填充因子，可能低至几个百分点。相反，SN 2002ap中的非均匀性偏差显著较小。总体上，类型Ib/c射电超新星的观测性质表明个体源的体积填充因子随时间保持相当恒定，但在射电频率上达到峰值的源具有较低的填充因子。SN 2003L和SN 2002ap中主同步辐射组分的条件与相对论电子和磁场之间的能量均衡一致。 <div>
The presence of inhomogeneities in a spatially unresolved source is often hard to establish. This limits the accuracy with which the source properties can be determined. It is shown how observed features not expected for a homogeneous model can be used to infer the properties of the inhomogeneities in radio supernovae. Furthermore, the observed consequences of radiative cooling can be seriously affected by inhomogeneities. It is shown that the deduced source properties are very sensitive to the observed value of the cooling frequency; even a lower limit is often useful to constrain its characteristics. It is argued that the main synchrotron emission region in SN 2003L has a small volume filling factor, possibly as low as a few percent. On the contrary, deviations from homogeneity are substantially smaller in SN 2002ap. The observed properties of Type Ib/c radio supernovae in general indicate the volume filling factor to remain rather constant with time for individual sources, but those peaking later at radio frequencies have lower filling factors. The conditions in the main synchrotron component in both SN 2003L and SN 2002ap are consistent with equipartition of energy between relativistic electrons and magnetic fields.

GWSkyNet-Multi是一个用于对LIGO和Virgo观测所检测到的候选引力波事件进行分类的机器学习模型。该模型利用低延迟的公开警报中发布的有限信息，生成预测分数，指示事件是否是两个黑洞的合并、涉及中子星的合并，或者是非天体故障。然而，人们对于模型如何利用有限的信息进行预测并不了解。通过对模型和其输入进行系统性干扰，我们发现模型学习用于区分源的基本特征和相关性。我们发现，二维天空图的定位区域和计算的一致性与不一致性贝叶斯因子被用作强有力的预测器，用于区分真实事件和故障。而估计的源距离进一步用于区分二进制黑洞合并和涉及中子星的合并。我们利用这些发现来展示GWSkyNet-Multi在LVK的第三次观测运行中错误分类的事件具有不同的天空区域、一致性因子和距离值，这些影响了预测并解释了这些误分类。这些结果有助于识别模型的局限性，并为进一步优化提供了潜在的途径。 <br /><br />总结: GWSkyNet-Multi是一个用于分类引力波事件的深度学习模型，借助有限信息进行预测，发现了特定的天空区域、一致性因子和距离值对于区分不同类型的事件具有重要作用，同时揭示了模型的局限性并提出了进一步优化的可能路径。 <div>
GWSkyNet-Multi is a machine learning model developed for the classification of candidate gravitational-wave events detected by the LIGO and Virgo observatories. The model uses limited information released in the low-latency Open Public Alerts to produce prediction scores indicating whether an event is a merger of two black holes (BHs), a merger involving a neutron star (NS), or a non-astrophysical glitch. This facilitates time-sensitive decisions about whether to perform electromagnetic follow-up of candidate events during LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) observing runs. However, it is not well understood how the model is leveraging the limited information available to make its predictions. As a deep learning neural network, the inner workings of the model can be difficult to interpret, impacting our trust in its validity and robustness. We tackle this issue by systematically perturbing the model and its inputs to explain what underlying features and correlations it has learned for distinguishing the sources. We show that the localization area of the 2D sky maps and the computed coherence versus incoherence Bayes factors are used as strong predictors for distinguishing between real events and glitches. The estimated distance to the source is further used to discriminate between binary BH mergers and mergers involving NSs. We leverage these findings to show that events misclassified by GWSkyNet-Multi in LVK’s third observing run have distinct sky areas, coherence factors, and distance values that influence the predictions and explain these misclassifications. The results help identify the model’s limitations and inform potential avenues for further optimization.

We study the stellar population properties of 182 spectroscopically confirmed (MUSE/VLT) Lyα emitters (LAEs) and 450 photometrically selected Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) at z = 2.8–6.7 in the Hubble Extreme Deep Field. Leveraging the combined power of Hubble Space Telescope and JWST NIRCam and MIRI observations, we analyze their rest-frame UV-through-near-IR spectral energy distributions, with MIRI playing a crucial role in robustly assessing the LAEs’ stellar masses and ages. Our LAEs are low-mass objects with little or no dust extinction (E(B − V) ≃ 0.1) and a blue UV continuum slope (β ≃ −2.2). While 75% of our LAEs are young (<100 Myr), the remaining 25% have significantly older stellar populations (≥100 Myr). These old LAEs are statistically more massive, less extinct, and have lower specific star formation rate than young LAEs. Besides, they populate the plane of M⋆ versus star formation rate along the main sequence of star-forming galaxies, while young LAEs populate the starburst region. The comparison between the LAEs’ properties and those of a stellar-mass-matched sample of LBGs shows no statistical difference between these objects, except for the LBGs’ redder UV continuum slope and marginally larger E(B − V) values. Interestingly, 48% of the LBGs have ages <10 Myr and are classified as starbursts, but lack detectable Lyα emission. This is likely due to H i resonant scattering and/or dust-selective extinction. Overall, we find that JWST observations are crucial in determining the properties of LAEs and shedding light on their comparison with LBGs.

Directly observing exoplanets with coronagraphs is impeded by the presence of speckles from aberrations in the optical path, which can be mitigated in hardware with wave front control, as well as in post-processing. This work explores using an instrument model in post-processing to separate astrophysical signals from residual aberrations in coronagraphic data. The effect of wave front error (WFE) on the coronagraphic intensity consists of a linear contribution and a quadratic contribution. When either of the terms is much larger than the other, the instrument response can be approximated by a transfer matrix mapping WFE to detector plane intensity. From this transfer matrix, a useful projection onto instrumental modes that removes the dominant error modes can be derived. We apply this approach to synthetically generated Roman Space Telescope hybrid Lyot coronagraph data to extract “robust observables,” which can be used instead of raw data for applications such as detection testing. The projection improves planet flux ratio detection limits by about 28% in the linear regime and by over a factor of 2 in the quadratic regime, illustrating that robust observables can increase sensitivity to astrophysical signals and improve the scientific yield from coronagraphic data. While this approach does not require additional information such as observations of reference stars or modulations of a deformable mirror, it can and should be combined with these other techniques, acting as a model-informed prior in an overall post-processing strategy.

The stellar stream connected to the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf galaxy is the most massive tidal stream that has been mapped in the Galaxy, and is the dominant contributor to the outer stellar halo of the Milky Way (MW). We present metallicity maps of the Sgr stream, using 34,240 red giant branch stars with inferred metallicities from Gaia BP/RP spectra. This sample is larger than previous samples of Sgr stream members with chemical abundances by an order of magnitude. We measure metallicity gradients with respect to Sgr stream coordinates (Λ, B), and highlight the gradient in metallicity with respect to stream latitude coordinate B, which has not been observed before. Including the core, we find ∇[M/H] = −2.48 ± 0.08 × 10−2 dex deg−1 above the stream track (B > B0, where B0 = 1.5° is the latitude of the Sgr remnant) and ∇[M/H] = −2.02 ± 0.08 × 10−2 dex deg−1 below the stream track (B < B0). By painting metallicity gradients onto a tailored N-body simulation of the Sgr stream, we find that the observed metallicities in the stream are consistent with an initial radial metallicity gradient in the Sgr dwarf galaxy of ∼−0.1 to −0.2 dex kpc−1, well within the range of observed metallicity gradients in Local Group dwarf galaxies. Our results provide novel observational constraints for the internal structure of the dwarf galaxy progenitor of the Sgr stream. Leveraging new large data sets in conjunction with tailored simulations, we can connect the present-day properties of disrupted dwarfs in the MW to their initial conditions.

总结: 本研究利用James Webb太空望远镜的MRS仪器对大麦哲伦星云（LMC）N79区域的11个年轻恒星对象（YSOs）进行了光谱观测。在N79区域的三个巨大分子云中，我们发现了具有特殊特征的YSOs，包括完整或几乎完整的4.9–27.9μm波段的发射和吸收线，其中年轻最小的YSO Y3显示出明显的冰吸收特征，并且其中心离子化YSO Y4具有大量的发射线。此外，我们还首次在中红外观测到了在星团中形成的高质量原恒星，而这些星团位于LMC这样的外星系环境中。根据H i (7-6)线的光度，我们得出四个YSOs的质量吸积率在1.22 × 10−4–1.89 × 10−2M⊙ yr−1之间。这项研究有助于我们更深入地了解外星系中的星际物质的形成和演化过程。<br /><br /> <div>
In this work, we present spectra of 11 young stellar objects (YSOs) taken with the Mid-Infrared Instrument / Medium Resolution Spectroscopy (MRS) instrument on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The YSOs are located in the N79 region of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), an active star-forming region with hundreds of Spitzer- and Herschel-identified YSOs and host to super star cluster (SSC) candidate H72.97-69.39. The three giant molecular clouds in N79 (East, West, and South) have varying star formation rates and stellar populations. MRS follow-up observations of four Spitzer-identified YSOs in N79 East, West, and South have revealed that what seemed to be a single, massive YSO is actually a cluster of YSOs. We discuss the emission and absorption lines of six YSOs that have complete or almost-complete spectral coverage from 4.9–27.9 μm. YSO Y3, located in N79 East, is the youngest source in this study and likely to be less than 10,000 yr old, as inferred from the prominent CH4, NH3, CH3OH, CH3OCHO, and CO2 ice absorption features. The most luminous source is the central ionizing YSO of SSC H72.97-69.39, Y4, which has dozens of fine-structure and H2 emission lines. Unlike the other YSOs in this work, Y4 has no polyaromatic hydrocarbon emission lines, due to the intense ionizing radiation destroying these large carbon-chain molecules. The mass accretion rates based on the H i (7-6) line luminosities of YSOs Y1, Y2, Y4, and Y9 range between 1.22 × 10−4–1.89 × 10−2M⊙ yr−1. For the first time in the mid-infrared, we are able to resolve individual high-mass protostars forming in small clusters in an extragalactic environment like the LMC.

<div> AGNs, Lockman Hole field, spectroscopic sample, [Ne v]λ3426 emission line, MIR SEDs  
总结: 该研究使用24μm选取的光谱样本，在Lockman Hole区域发现了4035个光谱。研究旨在识别活动星系核（AGNs）并确定在这个中红外选择样本中的占比。通过用[Ne v]λ3426发射线进行光谱识别，发现样本中有887个（约22%）AGNs。通过堆叠分析发现在MIR楔形选取的AGN候选者中，堆叠光谱仍然显示出明显的[Ne v]λ3426发射信号。而在楔形之外的非AGN候选者中则没有清晰的[Ne v]λ3426信号。研究开发了一种方法，利用静止系L12/L1.6对L4.5/L1.6图表，将AGN和星形成对MIR SEDs的贡献分离出来。他们发现AGN在12μm处的纯净光度与星形成率呈正相关，表明AGNs和宿主星系可能存在共同的气体供应，说明了观测到的相关性来自于不同红移范围内的种群特性的变化。 <div>
We present a 24 μm-selected spectroscopic sample z > 0.13 (median 〈z〉 = 0.41) in the Lockman Hole field, consisting of 4035 spectra. Our aim is to identify active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and determine their fraction in this mid-infrared-selected sample. In this work, we use the [Ne v]λ3426 emission line to spectroscopically identify AGNs. Combined with broad-line Type I AGNs selected in our previous study, our sample consists of 887 (∼22%) spectroscopically confirmed AGNs. We perform a stacking analysis on the remaining spectra and find that in various mid-infrared (MIR) wedge-selected AGN candidates, the stacked spectra still show significant [Ne v]λ3426 emission. In contrast, no clear [Ne v]λ3426 signal is detected in non-AGN candidates falling outside the wedges. Assuming a range of AGN MIR spectral energy distribution (SED) slope of −0.3 <α < 0.7, and an average star-forming relation derived from 65 star-forming templates, we develop a robust method to separate the AGN and star-forming contributions to the MIR SEDs using the rest-frame L12/L1.6 versus L4.5/L1.6 diagram. We separate the objects into bins of L12 and find that the AGN fraction increases with increasing L12. We also find that the stacked [Ne v]λ3426 strength scales with L12. The pure AGN luminosity at 12 μm exhibits a positive correlation with the star formation rates, indicating possible coevolution and common gas supply between the AGNs and their host galaxies. Varying population properties across the redshift range explored contribute to the observed correlation.

MOHEGs是Faranoff–Riley I/II类型的射电星系，富含分子氢，但星形成活动较低。通过H i 21 cm吸收线，对红移<0.2的中性氢气相关的射电MOHEGs进行研究，发现70%的星系中存在中性氢，距离相邻星系8-120 kpc。这些星系相比相似红移的合并星系，H i气体稀缺。发现N(H i)、NH与星系属性之间关联不强，表明原子气体对星形成可能不重要。总氢气面密度与星形成面密度的关系偏离标准的Kennicutt-Schmidt定律。研究强调了H i研究的重要性，并为解释这些星系的特性提供了见解。未来，使用下一代射电望远镜进行的H i 21 cm吸收线调查，比如Square Kilometre Array和先导仪器，可能会为这些关联提供更好的约束。
<br />总结: 本研究基于H i 21 cm吸收线对射电MOHEGs进行了中性氢气相关性的研究，发现了一些重要发现，包括70%的星系存在中性氢，这些星系中的H i气体稀缺，N(H i)、NH与星系属性之间关联不强，以及总氢气面密度与星形成面密度的关系与Kennicutt-Schmidt定律不符。这些发现强调了H i研究的重要性，并具有重要的见解。未来，使用下一代射电望远镜进行的H i 21 cm吸收线调查可能会为这些关联提供更好的约束。 <div>
Empirical studies of cold gas content are essential for comprehending the star formation activities and evolution in galaxies. However, it is not straightforward to understand these processes because they depend on various physical properties of the interstellar medium. Massive Faranoff–Riley I/II type radio galaxies rich in molecular hydrogen with lower star formation activities are known as radio molecular hydrogen emission galaxies (MOHEGs). We present a study of neutral hydrogen-gas-associated radio MOHEGs at redshifts <0.2 probed via the H i 21 cm absorption line. Neutral hydrogen is detected in 70% of these galaxies, which are located at a distance of 8–120 kpc from the neighboring galaxies. These galaxies show a scarcity of H i gas as compared to merging galaxies at similar redshifts. We found no strong correlation between N(H i), NH, and the galaxy properties, regardless of whether the H i is assumed to be cold or warm, indicating that the atomic gas probably plays no important role in star formation. The relation between the total hydrogen gas surface density and the star formation surface density deviates from the standard Kennicutt–Schmidt law. Our study highlights the importance of H i studies and offers insights into the role of atomic and molecular hydrogen gas in explaining the properties of these galaxies. In the upcoming H i 21 cm absorption surveys with next-generation radio telescopes such as the Square Kilometre Array and pathfinder instruments, it may be possible to provide better constraints for these correlations.

总结:<br /><br />
本文介绍了利用40 GHz通道的CLASS观测的CMB极化角尺度（ℓ < 30）特征的测量方法，并探讨了对再电离的光学深度的限制以及搜索通观宇宙膨胀的标志的重要性。通过对Atacama沙漠的优越条件和前端极化调制技术的稳定性，研究表明该通道的灵敏度高于卫星测量的类似频率。通过对漫射辐射的EE和BB谱的测量，对银河遮蔽的漫射辐射的漫射谱能量密度进行了空间方面的扩展。此外，还对ℓ < 125范围内的圆极化背景进行了上限测量，并给出了令人兴奋的可能性。这些结果为从地面恢复最大尺度的CMB极化建立了一种新标准，并展示了当包括更高灵敏度和更高频率的CLASS通道进行分析时的潜在机会。 <div>
Measurement of the largest angular scale (ℓ < 30) features of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization is a powerful way to constrain the optical depth to reionization and search for the signature of inflation through the detection of primordial B-modes. We present an analysis of maps covering 73.6% of the sky made from the 40 GHz channel of the Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS) from 2016 August to 2022 May. Taking advantage of the measurement stability enabled by front-end polarization modulation and excellent conditions from the Atacama Desert, we show this channel achieves higher sensitivity than the analogous frequencies from satellite measurements in the range 10 < ℓ < 100. Simulations show the CLASS linear (circular) polarization maps have a white noise level of . We measure the Galaxy-masked EE and BB spectra of diffuse synchrotron radiation and compare to space-based measurements at similar frequencies. In combination with external data, we expand measurements of the spatial variations of the synchrotron spectral energy density (SED) to include new sky regions and measure the diffuse SED in the harmonic domain. We place a new upper limit on a background of circular polarization in the range 5 < ℓ < 125 with the first bin showing Dℓ < 0.023 at 95% confidence. These results establish a new standard for recovery of the largest-scale CMB polarization from the ground and signal exciting possibilities when the higher sensitivity and higher-frequency CLASS channels are included in the analysis.

<title>Powerful Radio-loud Quasars Are Triggered by Galaxy Mergers in the Cosmic Bright Ages</title>

<div> AGN, radio-loud quasars, major galaxy mergers, black hole mass, Hubble Space Telescope
总结:
本研究测试了宇宙正午时期（1≲z≲2）强劲射电喷流AGN活动在大型星系合并中触发的假设。通过比较Hubble Space Telescope WFC3/IR观测到的z>1 3CR射电喧闹宽线类星体与三个配对的射电安静类星体对照样本，发现几乎所有的射电喧闹AGN都存在大型合并活动，而射电安静AGN中合并比例要低得多。这些结果表明大型星系合并是发射强大射电喷流的关键因素。另外，发现黑洞质量与宿主星系亮度之间存在紧密关联，与当地椭圆星系观察到的情况不一致。最后，指出很多射电喧闹类星体为蓝色，这一结果可能挑战了以星系合并为初始触发，红色类星体反馈后最终进入平静状态的"吹出"宇宙演化模型。 <div>
While supermassive black holes are ubiquitous features of galactic nuclei, only a small minority are observed during episodes of luminous accretion. The physical mechanism(s) driving the onset of fueling and ignition in these active galactic nuclei (AGN) are still largely unknown for many galaxies and AGN-selection criteria. Attention has focused on AGN triggering by means of major galaxy mergers gravitationally funneling gas toward the galactic center, with evidence both for and against this scenario. However, several recent studies have found that radio-loud AGN overwhelmingly reside in ongoing or recent major galaxy mergers. In this study, we test the hypothesis that major galaxy mergers are important triggers for radio-loud AGN activity in powerful quasars during cosmic noon (1 ≲ z ≲ 2). To this end, we compare Hubble Space Telescope WFC3/IR observations of the z > 1 3CR radio-loud broad-lined quasars to three matched radio-quiet quasar control samples. We find strong evidence for major-merger activity in nearly all radio-loud AGN, in contrast to the much lower merger fraction in the radio-quiet AGN. These results suggest major galaxy mergers are key ingredients in launching powerful radio jets. Given many of our radio-loud quasars are blue, our results present a possible challenge to the “blowout” paradigm of galaxy evolution models in which blue quasars are the quiescent end result following a period of red quasar feedback initiated by a galaxy merger. Finally, we find a tight correlation between black hole mass and host galaxy luminosity for these different high-redshift AGN samples that is inconsistent with those observed for local elliptical galaxies.

<div> Oort cloud, comet, disintegration, spectra, reflectivity
<br /><br />总结:
2020年3月起，C/2019 Y4 (ATLAS)彗星的核心开始解体。作者使用长缝光谱和Xinglong 2.16米望远镜获取了该彗星的气体和尘埃特性的多色频带图像。观测显示C/2019 Y4 (ATLAS)在光学波段出现了CN、C2、C3和NH2等强发射带，这些是典型的彗星光谱特征。使用Haser模型导出的CN、C2和C3的产量表明C/2019 Y4 (ATLAS)在A'Hearn分类下是一个“典型”的Oort云彗星，尽管其尘埃量较少。其尘埃散射反射率略呈红色，这可以通过多孔尘埃模型来解释。 <div>
C/2019 Y4 (ATLAS) is an Oort cloud comet with an orbital period of ∼5895 yr. Starting in 2020 March, its nucleus underwent disintegration. In order to investigate the gas and dust properties of C/2019 Y4 (ATLAS) during its disintegration, we obtained long-slit spectra at 3600–8700 Å and BVRI multiband images with the Xinglong 2.16 m Telescope in 2020 April. Our observations revealed that C/2019 Y4 (ATLAS) exhibited strong emission bands of CN, C2, C3, and NH2, which are superimposed on a dust-scattering continuum, typical of cometary spectra in the optical. The production rates of CN, C2, and C3 derived using the Haser model and the corresponding C2/CN and C3/CN ratios suggest that C/2019 Y4 (ATLAS) is a “typical” Oort cloud comet under the A’Hearn classification, although it appears less dusty, as revealed by the Afρ quantities. Its dust-scattering reflectivity is slightly red, with a gradient of ∼5% per 103Å. We model the reflectivity gradient in terms of porous dust and find that the red color is accounted for by porous dust.

<div> TESS, afterglows, GRBs, observational study, cadence
总结:<br /><br />该研究利用TESS对伽马射线暴的余辉进行了观测，在TESS的数据中检测到11个候选信号，其中3个被分类为高可能性的伽马射线暴余辉，5个被分类为暂定，其余被认为不太可能。研究使用afterglowpy软件对每个候选光变曲线进行了建模，得出爆发与余辉出现之间平均时间延迟为740±690秒的结果。该研究表明，TESS因其高观测频率和广阔的视场，在定位伽马射线暴方面具有巨大潜力，能够观测到之前光学望远镜无法达到的时间尺度上的余辉。 <div>
Gamma-ray bursts produce afterglows that can be observed across the electromagnetic spectrum and can provide insight into the nature of their progenitors. While most telescopes that observe afterglows are designed to rapidly react to trigger information, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) continuously monitors sections of the sky at cadences between 30 minutes and 200 s. This provides TESS with the capability of serendipitously observing the optical afterglow of GRBs. We conduct the first extensive search for afterglows of known GRBs in archival TESS data reduced with the TESSreduce package, and detect 11 candidate signals that are temporally coincident with reported burst times. We classify three of these as high-likelihood GRB afterglows previously unknown to have been detected by TESS, one of which has no other afterglow detection reported on the Gamma-ray Coordinates Network. We classify five candidates as tentative and the remainder as unlikely. Using the afterglowpy package, we model each of the candidate light curves with a Gaussian and a top-hat model to estimate burst parameters; we find that a mean time delay of 740 ± 690 s between the explosion and afterglow onset is required to perform these fits. The high cadence and large field of view make TESS a powerful instrument for localising GRBs, with the potential to observe afterglows in cases when no other backup photometry is possible, and at timescales previously unreachable by optical telescopes.

<div> 星系，微波辐射，MALATANG，亮度，恒星形成<br />总结:<br />本研究利用韩国VLBI网络进行了单天线观测，以探寻附近星系中的异常微波辐射。研究选择了来自James Clerk Maxwell望远镜的遗产调查项目“Mapping the dense molecular gas in the strongest star-forming galaxies”（MALATANG）中的目标星系。通过与其他数据的结合，研究了5个星系的无线电-红外谱能分布（SED），并在其中的NGC 2903星系中明显探测到了AME信号。而NGC 2146和M82星系中的AME信号则较弱。NGC 1068和Arp 299星系中未观测到明显的AME信号，研究给出了AME的上限。最拟合的SED显示出AME成分在频率更高且峰值流量更强的局部峰值，这暗示AME的起源可能是分子云或光解离区这样的密集环境，而非常见的暖中性/电离介质。此外，AME被发现更喜欢具有更高特定恒星形成速率的目标星系，而不是AGN宿主。因此，这可能暗示AGN对微尘来说是过于恶劣的环境。 <div>
We present the results of the single-dish observations using the Korean VLBI Network to search for anomalous microwave emission (AME) in nearby galaxies. The targets were selected from ‘Mapping the dense molecular gas in the strongest star-forming galaxies' (MALATANG), a legacy survey project of the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. The MALATANG galaxies are good representatives of local galaxies with enhanced nuclear activity associated with star formation and/or active galactic nuclei (AGNs), providing IR-bright galaxy samples; thus, they are good candidates for AME hosts. Combining with ancillary data, we investigated the radio–IR spectral energy distribution (SED), while searching for AME signals in five galaxies. The AME in NGC 2903 was well detected at a significant confidence level, whereas that in NGC 2146 and M82 was marginal. NGC 1068 and Arp 299 indicated no significant hints, and we provide upper limits for the AME. The best-fit SED exhibited local peaks of the AME components at higher frequencies and with stronger peak fluxes than those in previous studies. This suggested that AME originates from denser environments such as molecular clouds or photodissociation regions rather than warm neutral/ionized medium as commonly suggested by previous studies. Further, our AME-detected targets were observed to exhibit higher specific star formation rates than the other extragalactic AME hosts. Furthermore, AME favored starburst galaxies among our sample rather than AGN hosts. Consequently, this might imply that AGNs are excessively harsh environments for tiny dust to survive.

扩展壳体的负速度可以归因于老超新星的气体，但膨胀壳体的推移对应物在哪里？通过λ-21厘米银河中性氢EBHIS调查的数据显示，接近的和远离的氢气壳体形成了复杂K的一部分。高蓝移速度来自于氢气进入低密度的星际空间环境。数据还显示远离的边缘的特征，表明了壳体的远离排放。如果做出壳体均匀且球对称的简化假设，那么爆炸约在3 × 105年前发生。动量p ∼ 7 × 104M⊙ km s−1，与近期模型估计的超新星演化相吻合。第三次盖亚数据发布识别的几个双星系统可能是复杂K中异常速度H i气体的超新星爆炸来源。通过几个带有中子星候选者的双星系统确定了讨论中H i特征的距离。 <br /><br />总结:这篇文章探讨了高速云的一个悬而未决的谜团，通过对观测数据的分析，发现了远离和接近壳体的特征，揭示了超新星爆炸可能是导致复杂K中异常速度氢气的原因，并通过多种观测数据和模型估计得出了有关爆炸发生的时间和动量的信息。 <div>
We address one of the lingering mysteries of high-velocity clouds: If the anomalous negative velocities are the result of the approaching gas from old supernovae, then where are the receding counterparts of the expanding shells? Data from the λ-21 cm Galactic neutral hydrogen EBHIS survey (Winkel et al.) show multiple signatures of the expanding shells. The near-side (approaching) H i shells form part of Complex K. The high blueshifted velocities result from the H i moving into the low-density environment of inter-arm space. The H i data also show a distinctive, bow-shaped feature, the signature of the far-side (receding) emission of an expanding shell. The low redshifted velocity results from the gas expanding into volumes of space with a higher density. If we make the simplifying assumptions that the expansion of the shells is uniform and spherically symmetric, then the explosions took place about ⪅3 × 105 yr ago. The momentum, p ∼ 7 × 104M⊙ km s−1, agrees with recent model estimates for supernova evolution. Supernova explosions attributed to the unseen companion in several binary systems identified by the Third Gaia Data Release may be responsible for anomalous-velocity H i gas in Complex K. Four binary star systems with neutron-star candidates are located at the edge of the Sagittarius spiral arm and used to determine the distance to the H i features discussed here.

Using data from ALFALFA, xGASS, H i-MaNGA, and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we identify a sample of 47 “red but H i-rich” (RR) galaxies with near-UV (NUV) − r > 5 and unusually high H i-to-stellar mass ratios. We compare the optical properties and local environments between the RR galaxies and a control sample of “red and H i-normal” (RN) galaxies that are matched in stellar mass and color. The two samples are similar in the optical properties typical of massive red (quenched) galaxies in the local Universe. The RR sample tends to be associated with slightly lower-density environments and has lower clustering amplitudes and smaller neighbor counts at scales from several hundred kiloparsecs to a few megaparsecs. The results are consistent with the RR galaxies being preferentially located at the center of low-mass halos, with a median halo mass ∼1012h−1M⊙ compared to ∼1012.5h−1M⊙ for the RN sample. This result is confirmed by the SDSS group catalog, which reveals a central fraction of 89% for the RR sample, compared to ∼60% for the RN sample. If assumed to follow the H i size–mass relation of normal galaxies, the RR galaxies have an average H i-to-optical radius ratio of RHI/R90 ∼ 4, four times the average ratio for the RN sample. We compare our RR sample with similar samples in previous studies, and quantify the population of RR galaxies using the SDSS complete sample. We conclude that the RR galaxies form a unique but rare population, accounting for only a small fraction of the massive quiescent galaxy population. We discuss the formation scenarios of the RR galaxies.

总结:<br />
2022年9月5日，太阳探测器帕克太阳探测器首次直接在日冕中进行了快速日冕物质抛射（CME）和冲击的原地测量。通过对帕克太阳探测器在近日点附近的原地测量，可以推测出两个冲击，第二个冲击已经衰减，与日冕图像中观察到的两次喷发一致。尽管发生了侧面穿越，测量结果表明了年轻喷射物的独特特征：等离子体的温度远高于环境介质，这表明了一个热的太阳源，并且大的等离子体β值表明了一个高度非力自由状态以及热压梯度对CME加速和膨胀的重要性。对全球日冕磁场的重建显示了日球际电流片（HCS）的长时间变化，观察到的磁场极性反转与更弯曲的HCS配置相符。在HCS穿越的内部观察到了重新连接迹象，深入到声速临界点。由于重新连接发生在次阿尔文速度风中，重新连接后的磁通量可以朝向太阳闭合，有助于平衡太阳圈中的磁通量。在HCS穿越后，次阿尔文速度风的性质作为低马赫数边界层（LMBL）导致在意外大的距离上进行了近亚声速等离子体的原位测量。 <div>
We report on the first direct in situ measurements of a fast coronal mass ejection (CME) and shock in the corona, which occurred on 2022 September 5. In situ measurements from the Parker Solar Probe spacecraft near perihelion suggest two shocks, with the second one decayed, which is consistent with more than one eruption in coronagraph images. Despite a flank crossing, the measurements indicate unique features of the young ejecta: a plasma much hotter than the ambient medium, suggestive of a hot solar source, and a large plasma β implying a highly non-force-free state and the importance of thermal pressure gradient for CME acceleration and expansion. Reconstruction of the global coronal magnetic fields shows a long-duration change in the heliospheric current sheet (HCS), and the observed field polarity reversals agree with a more warped HCS configuration. Reconnection signatures are observed inside an HCS crossing as deep as the sonic critical point. As the reconnection occurs in the sub-Alfvénic wind, the reconnected flux sunward of the reconnection site can close back to the Sun, which helps balance magnetic flux in the heliosphere. The nature of the sub-Alfvénic wind after the HCS crossing as a low Mach-number boundary layer (LMBL) leads to in situ measurements of the near subsonic plasma at a surprisingly large distance. Specifically, an LMBL may provide favorable conditions for the crossings of the sonic critical point in addition to the Alfvén surface.

We combine proper motions measured with the Hubble Space Telescope, Gaia, or a combination of the two, from a recent study by Bennet et al. with literature line-of-sight velocities (LOSVs) to give three components of motion. With these, we derive a 3D velocity dispersion anisotropy , consistent with the GCs forming a flattened system with significant azimuthal motion. We then apply a tracer mass estimator and measure an enclosed mass M⊙. This is broadly consistent with results from previous studies of the LOSVs of GCs and other luminous tracers. Assuming a cosmologically constrained Navarro–Frenk–White distribution for the dark matter, this implies a virial mass M⊙. Despite being an extrapolation by almost an order of magnitude in radius, this result is consistent with published estimates from other methods that are directly sensitive to the LMC’s total mass. Our results support the conclusion that the LMC is approximately % of the Milky Way’s mass, making it a significant contributor to the Local Group potential.

<div> M101, Type Ia supernova, Miras, Hubble Space Telescope, Hubble constant
<br /><br />总结:
这篇文章研究了M101中最近发生的Type Ia超新星SN 2011fe并通过发现和分类211个周期在240-400天之间的Miras，在Hubble Space Telescope (HST)的观测基础上得出了M101的第一个Mira基础距离。通过采用绝对标定的Mira周期-光度关系，得出了M101的距离，并发现了SN Ia的峰值亮度。作者还通过超新星Ia的哈勃图得出了Hubble常数H0 = 72.37 ± 2.97 km s−1 Mpc−1，这是Mirasa的4.1%测量值。最后得出的结论是，与最近的Cepheid距离梯度测量结果相比，本地宇宙的H0值高于早期宇宙的值，并且在95%的置信水平上证实了这一点。 <div>
The giant spiral galaxy M101 is host to the nearest recent Type Ia supernova (SN 2011fe) and thus has been extensively monitored in the near-infrared to study the late-time light curve of the SN. Leveraging this existing baseline of observations, we derive the first Mira-based distance to M101 by discovering and classifying a sample of 211 Miras with periods ranging from 240–400 days in the SN field. Combined with new Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFC3/IR channel observations, our data set totals 11 epochs of F110W (HST YJ) and 13 epochs of F160W (HST H) data spanning ∼2900 days. We adopt absolute calibrations of the Mira period–luminosity relation based on geometric distances to the Large Magellanic Cloud and the water megamaser host galaxy NGC 4258, and find μM101 = 29.10 ± 0.06 mag. This distance is in 1σ agreement with most other recent Cepheid and tip of the red giant branch distance measurements to M101. Including the previous Mira SN Ia host, NGC 1559, and SN 2005df, we determine the fiducial SN Ia peak luminosity, mag. With the Hubble diagram of supernovae Ia, we derive H0 = 72.37 ± 2.97 km s−1 Mpc−1, a 4.1% measurement of H0 using Miras. We find excellent agreement with recent Cepheid distance ladder measurements of H0 and confirm previous indications that the local universe value of H0 is higher than the early universe value at ∼95% confidence. Currently, the Mira-based H0 measurement is still dominated by the statistical uncertainty in the SN Ia peak magnitude.

<div> 关键词: Parker Solar Probe, 太阳风, 阿尔芬速度, 速度相关性, 磁场波动

总结:
Parker Solar Probe自2021年4月以来的数据显示了太阳冠层的原位观测，揭示了太阳风形成和加速的过程。研究利用PSP的数据探究了α-质子速度差和它们在临界阿尔芬面（CAS）附近的特征。首先展示了α-质子差速度与PSP遭遇距离处的太阳风速度的正相关性。然后探讨了差速流在CAS附近的特征以及它们如何受到阿尔芬波动的影响。研究发现，在CAS以下，差速度通常小于CAS以上的差速度，并且局部阿尔芬速度很好地限制了差速。而当出现较大幅度的阿尔芬波动和差速减小时，即出现了差速与局部磁场矢量对齐度的偏差。此外，PSP观测到α质子速度从MA < 1到MA ≃ 2增加，然后开始减小，这表明α粒子可能在CAS以上仍然保持优先加速状态。我们的结果还揭示，在亚阿尔芬太阳风中，质子和α粒子的速度波动与磁场波动之间存在强烈的相关性，对于α粒子来说相关性较弱。相比之下，在超阿尔芬太阳风中，质子的相关性保持高水平，但对于α粒子而言则减弱。 <div>
Data obtained from Parker Solar Probe (PSP) since 2021 April have shown the first in situ observation of the solar corona, where the solar wind is formed and accelerated. Here, we investigate the alpha-proton differential flow and its characteristics across the critical Alfvén surface (CAS) using data from PSP during encounters 8–10 and 12–13. We first show the positive correlation between the alpha-proton differential velocity and the bulk solar wind speed at PSP encounter distances. Then we explore how the characteristics of the differential flow vary across the CAS and how they are affected by Alfvénic fluctuations including switchbacks. We find that the differential velocity below the CAS is generally smaller than that above the CAS, and the local Alfvén speed well limits the differential speed both above and below the CAS. The deviations from the alignment between the differential velocity and the local magnetic field vector are accompanied by large-amplitude Alfvénic fluctuations and decreases in the differential speed. Moreover, we observe that Vαp increases from MA < 1 to MA ≃ 2 and then starts to decrease, which suggests that alphas may remain preferentially accelerated well above the CAS. Our results also reveal that in the sub-Alfvénic solar wind both protons and alphas show a strong correlation between their velocity fluctuations and magnetic field fluctuations, with a weaker correlation for alphas. By contrast, in the super-Alfvénic regime the correlation remains high for protons, but is reduced for alphas.

<div> 辐射流体力学、原行星盘、H2泵浦、尘埃-气体质量比、质量损失率
总结:
辐射流体力学模拟原行星盘的结构和演化，显示H2泵浦和X射线加热在尘埃-气体质量比较低时对盘的质量损失有更强烈的贡献。盘的质量损失率随着尘埃减少而减小，但仍然维持在10^-10-11M⊙yr^-1左右。在这些缺乏尘埃的盘中，H2泵浦增强了内盘区域的光蒸发并塑造了盘的质量损失曲线。因此，我们认为晚期盘的演化受到紫外H2泵浦效应的影响。我们模拟得出的质量损失率可用于研究长期盘演化。 <div>
We perform radiation hydrodynamics simulations to study the structure and evolution of a photoevaporating protoplanetary disk. Ultraviolet and X-ray radiation from the host star heats the disk surface, where H2 pumping also operates efficiently. We run a set of simulations in which we varied the number of dust grains or the dust-to-gas mass ratio, which determines the relative importance between photoelectric heating and H2 pumping. We show that H2 pumping and X-ray heating contribute more strongly to the mass loss of the disk when the dust-to-gas mass ratio is . The disk mass-loss rate decreases with a lower dust amount, but remains around 10−10−11M⊙yr−1. In these dust-deficient disks, H2 pumping enhances photoevaporation from the inner disk region and shapes the disk mass-loss profile. We thus argue that the late-stage disk evolution is affected by the ultraviolet H2 pumping effect. The mass-loss rates derived from our simulations can be used in the study of long-term disk evolution.

<title>On the Formation of Double Neutron Stars in the Milky Way: Influence of Key Parameters</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The detection of gravitational wave events has stimulated theoretical modeling of the formation and evolution of double compact objects (DCOs). However, even for the most studied isolated binary evolution channel, there exist large uncertainties in the input parameters and treatments of the binary evolution process. So far, double neutron stars (DNSs) are the only DCOs for which direct observations are available through traditional electromagnetic astronomy. In this work, we adopt a population synthesis method to investigate the formation and evolution of Galactic DNSs. We construct 324 models for the formation of Galactic DNSs, taking into account various possible combinations of critical input parameters and processes such as mass transfer efficiency, supernova type, common envelope efficiency, neutron star kick velocity, and pulsar selection effect. We employ Bayesian analysis to evaluate the adopted models by comparing with observations. We also compare the expected DNS merger rate in the galaxy with that inferred from the known Galactic population of pulsar-neutron star systems. Based on these analyses we derive the favorable range of the aforementioned key parameters.

<title>Solar Spicules, Filigrees, and Solar Wind Switchbacks</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Spicules, the smallest observable jetlike dynamic features ubiquitous in the chromosphere, are supposedly an important potential source for small-scale solar wind transients, with supporting evidence yet needed. We studied the high-resolution Hα images (0.″10) and magnetograms (0.″29) from the Big Bear Solar Observatory to find that spicules are an ideal candidate for the solar wind magnetic switchbacks detected by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP). It is not that spicules are a miniature of coronal jets, but that they have unique properties not found in other solar candidates in explaining solar origin of switchbacks. (1) The spicules under this study originate from filigrees, all in a single magnetic polarity. Since filigrees are known as footpoints of open fields, the spicule guiding field lines can form a unipolar funnel, which is needed to create an SB patch, a group of field lines that switch from one common base polarity to the other polarity. (2) The spicules come in a cluster lined up along a supergranulation boundary, and the simulated waiting times from their spatial intervals exhibit a number distribution continuously decreasing from a few seconds to ∼30 minutes, similar to that of switchbacks. (3) From a time–distance map for spicules, we estimate their occurrence rate as 0.55 spicules Mm−2 s−1, which is sufficiently high for detection by PSP. In addition, the dissimilarity of spicules with coronal jets, including the absence of base brightening and low correlation with EUV emission, is briefly discussed.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
1RXS J083842.1−282723 is a nearly synchronous magnetic cataclysmic variable with a simple X-ray light curve. While its orbital period was fairly well established at Porb = 98.4 minutes from optical spectroscopy, indirect estimates of Pspin/Porb ranged from 0.90 to 0.96 because the short X-ray light curves could not determine the beat period to a factor of 2. We analyze a recent 50 days TESS observation, and ground-based optical time-series photometry spanning 9 yr, that together measure precise beat, orbit, and spin periods and enable the X-ray and optical modulations to be phase aligned. Although the X-ray light curves do not distinguish between a beat period of 16.11 or 32.22 hr, all of the optical evidence favors the longer value, with complete pole switching of accretion every half beat cycle. This would require Pspin/Porb = 0.952. Long-term optical monitoring also shows a decline in accretion rate, and a change in the beat-folded light curve. It would be useful to obtain a new X-ray/optical observation of at least 32 hr duration to examine any associated change in accretion structure, and to confirm the spin and beat periods.

<title>Investigation of Nulling and Subpulse-drifting Properties of PSR J1649+2533 with FAST</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report the nulling and subpulse-drifting properties of PSR J1649+2533 with observations of the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST). The FAST observations reveal that the nulling fraction of this pulsar is about 20.9% ± 0.8% at 1250 MHz. The statistical study of the durations of the nulling and burst states shows that the burst states can persist for extended pulse periods, exceeding 100 periods in some cases, while the shortest lasts only a few pulse periods. The null states have a much shorter duration, with a maximum duration of less than 30 pulse periods. A comparative study between the pulse profiles of the first active pulse (FAP) and the last active pulse (LAP) shows that the pulse profiles of LAPs are stronger and wider than those of FAPs. An analysis of the two-dimensional fluctuation spectrum for the single-pulse stack indicates that the pulsar exhibits clear amplitude modulation and subpulse drifting. The periods are a P3 = 2.5 ± 0.1 spin period and P2 = 17.°0 ± 0.°5 at 1250 MHz, respectively. In addition, the multiband investigation shows that P2 seems to increase with the increase of the observing frequency, i.e., P2 ∝ ν0.8±0.1. This seems to be caused by the increasing pulse-profile width with the frequency. The high-sensitivity FAST observations will enable a detailed understanding of the emission of this pulsar and provide important clues for theoretical studies of the radiation mechanism.

<div> 850 μm, polarization, circumstellar envelope, AGB star, grain alignment
<br /><br />
总结: 本研究对碳星IRC+10216的星周环境进行了850μm极化观测。研究发现850 μm极化的几何结构与Zeeman观测和CSE中的小尺度结构一致，可能由磁偶极子几何所致。此外，研究还提出了一个新的颗粒对齐机制，认为带电颗粒在磁场中运动时会绕着感应的电场进动，从而与磁场对齐。这一机制能够解释碳尘在光学、远红外和亚毫米波段的极化现象，只需考虑颗粒的电荷状态不同即可。 <div>
We present SCUBA-2/POL-2 850 μm polarimetric observations of the circumstellar envelope (CSE) of the carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star IRC+10216. Both far-IR (FIR) and optical polarization data indicate grains aligned with their long axis in the radial direction relative to the central star. The 850 μm polarization does not show this simple structure. The 850 μm data are indicative, albeit not conclusive, of a magnetic dipole geometry. Assuming such a simple dipole geometry, the resulting 850 μm polarization geometry is consistent with both Zeeman observations and small-scale structure in the CSE. While there is significant spectral-line polarization contained within the SCUBA-2 850 μm passband for the source, it is unlikely that our broadband polarization results are dominated by line polarization. To explain the required grain alignment, grain mineralogy effects, due to either fossil silicate grains from the earlier oxygen-rich AGB phase of the star or due to the incorporation of ferromagnetic inclusions in the largest grains, may play a role. We argue that the most likely explanation is due to a new alignment mechanism wherein a charged grain, moving relative to the magnetic field, precesses around the induced electric field and therefore aligns with the magnetic field. This mechanism is particularly attractive as the optical, FIR, and submillimeter-wave polarization of the carbon dust can then be explained in a consistent way, differing simply due to the charge state of the grains.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章报告了对天体潮裂事件（TDE）AT2020ksf/Gaia20cjk的X射线光谱的发现。在UV/光学峰值后约230天，X射线明亮度急剧增加。研究发现，在初始阶段没有显著的吸收特征，但在几天内出现，并在峰值后770天仍然被探测到。作者发现，简单的热连续模型结合幂律或中性吸收体并不能很好地描述这些特征。添加部分覆盖、低速离子化吸收体可以改善早期拟合，但在后期会失效。高速（速度约42,000 km/s）的离子化吸收体（UFO）可以很好地拟合所有数据。研究还讨论了X射线延迟的几种解释场景，以及更大尺度风反馈的潜力。这一发现的偶然性可能表明TDE中UFO的高发生率，缓解了与理论预期的某些张力。 <div>
Supermassive black holes can experience super-Eddington peak mass fallback rates following the tidal disruption of a star. The theoretical expectation is that part of the infalling material is expelled by means of an accretion disk wind, whose observational signature includes blueshifted absorption lines of highly ionized species in X-ray spectra. To date, however, only one such ultrafast outflow (UFO) has been reported in the tidal disruption event (TDE) ASASSN–14li. Here we report on the discovery of a transient absorption-like signature in X-ray spectra of the TDE AT2020ksf/Gaia20cjk (at a redshift of z = 0.092), following an X-ray brightening ∼230 days after UV/optical peak. We find that while no statistically significant absorption features are present initially, they appear on a timescale of several days and remain detected up to 770 days after peak. Simple thermal continuum models, combined with a power-law or neutral absorber, do not describe these features well. Adding a partial-covering, low-velocity ionized absorber improves the fit at early times but fails at late times. A high-velocity (vw ∼ 42,000 km s−1), ionized absorber (UFO) provides a good fit to all data. The few-day timescale of variability is consistent with expectations for a clumpy wind. We discuss several scenarios that could explain the X-ray delay, as well as the potential for larger-scale wind feedback. The serendipitous nature of the discovery could suggest a high incidence of UFOs in TDEs, alleviating some of the tension with theoretical expectations.

The era of the James Webb Space Telescope ushers stellar population models into uncharted territories, particularly at the high-redshift frontier. In a companion paper, we apply the Prospector Bayesian framework to jointly infer galaxy redshifts and stellar population properties from broadband photometry as part of the UNCOVER survey. Here we present a comprehensive error budget in spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling. Using a sample selected to have photometric redshifts higher than 9, we quantify the systematic shifts stemming from various model choices in inferred stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and age. These choices encompass different timescales for changes in the star formation history (SFH), nonuniversal stellar initial mass functions (IMF), and the inclusion of variable nebular abundances, gas density, and ionizing photon budget. We find that the IMF exerts the strongest influence on the inferred properties: the systematic uncertainties can be as much as 1 dex, 2–5 times larger than the formal reported uncertainties in mass and SFR, and importantly, exceed the scatter seen when using different SED fitting codes. Although the assumptions on the lower end of the IMF induce degeneracy, our findings suggest that a common practice in the literature of assessing uncertainties in SED-fitting processes by comparing multiple codes is substantively underestimating the true systematic uncertainty. Highly stochastic SFHs change the inferred SFH by much larger than the formal uncertainties, and introduce ∼0.8 dex systematics in SFR averaged over a short timescale and ∼0.3 dex systematics in average age. Finally, employing a flexible nebular emission model causes ∼0.2 dex systematic increase in mass and SFR, comparable to the formal uncertainty. This paper constitutes an initial step toward a complete uncertainty estimate in SED modeling.

混合对棕矮星和巨行星大气中的化学反应产生影响，而大气模型通常使用Kzz扩散参数来参数化这种混合。研究表明，金属丰度和C/O比值也会影响大气化学。本研究提出了Sonora Elf Owl自洁云的大气网格模型，覆盖了几个数量级的Kzz变化以及次太阳到超太阳金属丰度和C/O比值。观察发现，在金属贫乏的物体中，Kzz对大气的影响在较高有效温度下较大，而在富金属的大气中，Kzz的影响则出现在较低有效温度下。研究还发现，在3-5μm波长窗口存在Kzz和金属丰度的光谱重叠。通过自洁模型，我们发现这些物体中存在很低效的垂直混合，推测的Kzz值在约101-104 cm2 s-1之间。观测揭示了这种缓慢的垂直混合是由于探测到了这些大气中深层脱离的辐射区的混合。 <br /><br />总结: 混合对大气化学有影响，金属丰度和C/O比值也会影响大气化学；Sonora Elf Owl网格模型包含了Kzz变化、金属丰度和C/O比值，研究发现在不同条件下Kzz对大气产生不同影响；研究发现在特定波长范围存在Kzz和金属丰度的光谱重叠；对九个早至晚T型物体进行观测，并发现了垂直混合效率较低的迹象；观测揭示了这种缓慢的垂直混合是由于探测到了这些大气中深层脱离的辐射区的混合。 <div>
Disequilibrium chemistry due to vertical mixing in the atmospheres of many brown dwarfs and giant exoplanets is well established. Atmosphere models for these objects typically parameterize mixing with the highly uncertain Kzz diffusion parameter. The role of mixing in altering the abundances of C-N-O-bearing molecules has mostly been explored for atmospheres with a solar composition. However, atmospheric metallicity and the C/O ratio also impact atmospheric chemistry. Therefore, we present the Sonora Elf Owl grid of self-consistent cloud-free 1D radiative-convective equilibrium model atmospheres for JWST observations, which includes a variation in Kzz across several orders of magnitude and also encompasses subsolar to supersolar metallicities and C/O ratios. We find that the impact of Kzz on the T(P) profile and spectra is a strong function of both Teff and metallicity. For metal-poor objects, Kzz has large impacts on the atmosphere at significantly higher Teff than in metal-rich atmospheres, where the impact of Kzz is seen to occur at lower Teff. We identify significant spectral degeneracies between varying Kzz and metallicity in multiple wavelength windows, in particular, at 3–5 μm. We use the Sonora Elf Owl atmospheric grid to fit the observed spectra of a sample of nine early to late T-type objects from Teff = 550–1150 K. We find evidence for very inefficient vertical mixing in these objects, with inferred Kzz values lying in the range between ∼101 and 104 cm2 s−1. Using self-consistent models, we find that this slow vertical mixing is due to the observations, which probe mixing in the deep detached radiative zone in these atmospheres.

ALMA观测了Orion B分子云中与HH270mms1相关的原恒星流。通过12CO (J = 3−2)的发射，发现分子流的速度结构包括低速度、中速度、高速度和包围低速度分子的夹带气体的速度。高速和中速流具有良好的聚束结构，而节点链嵌入在高速流或射流中。通过观测发现，低速和中速分子流中存在垂直于流轴线的速度梯度。确认了外层和盘的旋转，并发现它们的速度梯度与分子流相同。此外，根据观测到的分子流特性，估计了低速和中速流的发射半径，得出了射流从内盘区域驱动的结论。文章内容符合最近的理论研究的预期特征。<br /><br />总结: 分子流呈现出低速度、中速度和高速度结构，嵌入着射流和旋转特性。观测结果符合最新的理论研究。 <div>
We present molecular line observations of the protostellar outflow associated with HH270mms1 in the Orion B molecular cloud with ALMA. The 12CO (J = 3−2) emissions show that the outflow velocity structure consists of four distinct components of low (≲10 km s−1), intermediate (∼10–25 km s−1) and high (≳40 km s−1) velocities in addition to the entrained gas velocity (∼25–40 km s−1). The high- and intermediate-velocity flows have well-collimated structures surrounded by the low-velocity flow. The chain of knots is embedded in the high-velocity flow or jet, which is the evidence of episodic mass ejections induced by time-variable mass accretion. We could detect the velocity gradients perpendicular to the outflow axis in both the low- and intermediate-velocity flows. We confirmed the rotation of the envelope and disk in the 13CO and C17O emission and found that their velocity gradients are the same as those of the outflow. Thus, we concluded that the velocity gradients in the low- and intermediate-velocity flows are due to the outflow rotation. Using observational outflow properties, we estimated the outflow launching radii to be 67.1–77.1 au for the low-velocity flow and 13.3–20.8 au for the intermediate-velocity flow. Although we could not detect the rotation in the jets due to the limited spatial resolution, we estimated the jet launching radii to be (2.36–3.14) × 10−2 au using the observed velocity of each knot. Thus, the jet is driven from the inner disk region. We could identify the launching radii of distinct velocity components within a single outflow with all the prototypical characteristics expected from recent theoretical works.

总结:
这篇文章介绍了一种利用卷积神经网络(CNN)对类星体的多波段光谱能量分布(SEDs)进行建模的新方法。他们在一种包括同步辐射和逆Compton发射的轻子模型上训练了CNN。这种方法显著减少了计算时间，实现了对多波段数据集的实时拟合。他们还展示了如何使用训练好的CNN和MultiNest来拟合Mrk 421和1ES 1959+650的宽带SEDs，并成功获得了它们的参数后验分布。这种新的SED拟合框架将进一步扩展，以加入基于外部Compton和强子场景的更复杂模型，并通过Markarian多波段数据中心的网页界面公开提供这些模型，以促进类星体观测的多信使数据的自洽建模。<br /><br /> <div>
Modeling the multiwavelength spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of blazars provides key insights into the underlying physical processes responsible for the emission. While SED modeling with self-consistent models is computationally demanding, it is essential for a comprehensive understanding of these astrophysical objects. We introduce a novel, efficient method for modeling the SEDs of blazars by the mean of a convolutional neural network (CNN). In this paper, we trained the CNN on a leptonic model that incorporates synchrotron and inverse Compton emissions, as well as self-consistent electron cooling and pair creation–annihilation processes. The CNN is capable of reproducing the radiative signatures of blazars with high accuracy. This approach significantly reduces the computational time, thereby enabling real-time fitting to multiwavelength data sets. As a demonstration, we used the trained CNN with MultiNest to fit the broadband SEDs of Mrk 421 and 1ES 1959+650, successfully obtaining their parameter posterior distributions. This novel framework for fitting the SEDs of blazars will be further extended to incorporate more sophisticated models based on external Compton and hadronic scenarios, allowing for multimessenger constraints in the analysis. The models will be made publicly available via a web interface at the Markarian Multiwavelength Data Center to facilitate self-consistent modeling of multimessenger data from blazar observations.

<div> 关键词: 太阳能粒子事件, 元素丰度增强, 电子分布, 离子化相互作用, 温度估计

总结:
太阳能粒子（SEP）事件的重要方面是它们的来源群体。文章探讨了来自假定的日冕重连事件的冲击SEP事件的元素丰度增强，以及在加速过程中电子分布的影响，以及离子化相互作用对电荷状态的影响。研究发现，电子速度分布是否偏离麦克斯韦分布并不显著影响加速区温度的估计。这表明SEP在较短时间内加速并离开加速区，与离子化时间尺度相比。 <br /><br /> <div>
An important aspect of solar energetic particle (SEP) events is their source populations. Elemental abundance enhancements of impulsive SEP events, originating in presumed coronal reconnection episodes, can be fitted to steep power laws of A/Q, where A and Q are the atomic mass and ionic charge. Since thermal electron energies are enhanced and nonthermal electron distributions arise in the reconnection process, we might expect that ionic charge states Q would be increased through ionization interactions with those electron populations during the acceleration process. The temperature estimated from the SEPs corresponds to the charge state during the acceleration process, while the actual charge state measured in situ may be modified as the SEPs pass through the corona. We examine whether the temperature estimation from the A/Q would differ with various κ values in a κ function representing high-energy tail deviating from a Maxwellian velocity distribution. We find that the differences in the A/Q between a Maxwellian and an extreme κ distribution are about 10%–30%. We fit power-law enhancement of element abundances as a function of their A/Q with various κ values. Then, we find that the derived source region temperature is not significantly affected by whether or not the electron velocity distribution deviates from a Maxwellian, i.e., thermal, distribution. Assuming that electrons are heated in the acceleration region, the agreement of the SEP charge state during acceleration with typical active region temperatures suggests that SEPs are accelerated and leave the acceleration region in a shorter time than the ionization timescale.

Estimating the magnetic field strength in the solar corona is crucial for understanding different physical processes happening over diverse spatiotemporal scales. However, the high temperatures and low density of the solar corona make this task challenging. The coronal magnetic field is too weak to produce a measurable splitting of the spectral lines using the Zeeman effect, and high temperature causes spectral lines to become weak and broad, making it difficult to detect the small Zeeman splitting. Coronal magneto-seismology, which combines the theoretical and observed properties of magnetohydrodynamic waves, can be used to infer the magnetic field strength of oscillating structures in the solar corona, which are otherwise difficult to estimate. In this work, we use the Doppler velocity and density data obtained from the Coronal Multichannel Polarimeter on 2016 October 14 to obtain the global map of the coronal magnetic field using Bayesian inference. Two priors are used for plasma density, viz Gaussian and uniform distributions. Bayesian inference provides us with the probability distribution for the magnetic field strength at each location from 1.05 to 1.35 R⊙. A comparison between the magnetic field obtained using simple inversion and Bayesian inference is also drawn. We find that the values obtained using simple inversion do not always match the maximum posterior estimates obtained using Bayesian inference. We find that the inferred values follow a power-law function for the radial variation of the coronal magnetic field, with the power-law indices for simple and Bayesian inversion being similar.

<div> 关键词: 早期太阳系，26Al，超新星，原行星盘，太阳系起源<br />
总结: 早期太阳系含有一种短寿命放射性核素26Al，据信它的衰变能控制了小行星的热演化，可能也影响了行星的水含量。一种可能的假设是“盘注入情形”，即在原行星盘形成后，附近(<1 pc)的超新星将放射性物质直接注入盘中。然而，研究发现需要超新星产生的26Al量很大，且注入后会改变盘的温度，这与太阳系的实际情况不符。因此，推测早期太阳系中的新鲜26Al可能以其他方式合成/注入。 <div>
The early solar system contained a short-lived radionuclide, 26Al (its half-life time t1/2 = 0.7 Myr). The decay energy of 26Al is thought to have controlled the thermal evolution of planetesimals and, possibly, the water contents of planets. Many hypotheses have been proposed for the origin of 26Al in the solar system. One of the possible hypotheses is the “disk injection scenario”: when the protoplanetary disk of the solar system had already formed, a nearby (<1 pc) supernova injected radioactive material directly into the disk. Such a 26Al injection hypothesis has been tested so far with limited setups for disk structure and supernova distance, which have treated disk disruption and 26Al injection separately. Here, we revisit this problem, to investigate whether there are self-consistent conditions under which the surviving disk radius can receive enough 26Al to account for the abundance in the early solar system. We also consider a range of disk masses and structures, 26Al yields from supernova, and a large dust mass fraction ηd. We find that 26Al yields of supernova are required as , which are challenging to achieve with the known possible 26Al ejection and dust mass fraction ranges. Furthermore, we find that even if the above conditions are met, the supernova flow changes the disk temperature, which may not be consistent with the solar system record. Our results place a strong constraint on the disk injection scenario. Rather, we suggest that the fresh 26Al of the early solar system must have been synthesized/injected in other ways.

We summarize the entire known sample of these types of companion systems, termed “compositional benchmarks,” that are present in the literature or recently published as key systems of study in order to best understand brown dwarf chemistry and condensate formation. Via mass balance and stoichiometric calculations, we predict a median brown dwarf atmospheric oxygen sink of by utilizing published stellar abundances in the local solar neighborhood. Additionally, we predict a silicate condensation sequence such that atmospheres with bulk Mg/Si ≲0.9 will form enstatite (MgSiO3) and quartz (SiO2) clouds, and atmospheres with bulk Mg/Si ≳0.9 will form enstatite and forsterite (Mg2SiO4) clouds. The implications of these results on C/O ratio trends in substellar-mass objects and the utility of these predictions in future modeling work are discussed.

<title>AT2022cmc: A Tidal Disruption Event with a Two-component Jet in a Bondi-profile Circumnuclear Medium</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A supermassive black hole can launch a relativistic jet when it violently disrupts a star that passes too close. Such jetted tidal disruption events (TDEs) are rare and unique tools to investigate quiescent supermassive black holes, jet physics, and circumnuclear environments at high redshift. The newly discovered TDE AT2022cmc (z ∼ 1.193), providing rich multiband (X-ray, UV, optical, submillimeter, and radio) data, has been interpreted as the fourth on-axis jetted TDE. In this work, we constrain the circumnuclear medium (CNM) density profile with both a closure relation test and detailed forward shock model fit with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to the multiband (optical, submillimeter, and radio) data of AT2022cmc. We find that the CNM density profile of AT2022cmc is n ∝ R−k with k ∼ 1.68, implying a Bondi accretion in history. Furthermore, our model fit result suggests a two-component jet in AT2022cmc, indicating similar jet physics to well-studied jetted TDE Sw J1644+57.

<title>Radio Pulsar B0950+08: Radiation in the Magnetosphere and Sparks above the Surface</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We observed the nearby radio pulsar B0950+08, which has a 100% duty cycle, using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope. We obtained the polarization profile for its entire rotation, which enabled us to investigate its magnetospheric radiation geometry and the sparking pattern of the polar cap. After we excluded part of the profile in which the linear polarization factor is low (≲30%) and potentially contaminated by jumps in position angle, the rest of the swing in polarization position angle fits a classical rotating vector model (RVM) well. The best-fit RVM indicates that the inclination angle, α, and the impact angle, β, of this pulsar, are 100.°5 and −33.°2, respectively, suggesting that the radio emission comes from two poles. We find that, in such RVM geometry, either the annular vacuum gap model or the core vacuum gap model would require that the radio emissions come from a high-altitude magnetosphere with heights from ∼0.25 RLC to ∼0.56 RLC, with RLC being the light cylinder radius. Both the main and interpulses’ sparking points are located away from the magnetic pole, which could relate to the physical conditions on the pulsar surface.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Space plasmas are turbulent and maintain different types of critical points or flow nulls. Electron vortex, as one type of flow null structure, is crucial in the energy cascade in turbulent plasmas. However, due to the limited time resolution of the spacecraft observations, one can never analyze the three-dimensional properties of the electron vortex. In the present study, with the advancement of the FOTE-V method and the unprecedented high-resolution measurements from four Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft, we successfully identify the electron vortex and then reconstruct its three-dimensional topology of the surrounding electron flow field. The results of the reconstruction show that the configuration of the electron vortex is elliptical. Comparison between the observation and reconstruction scales of the vortex indicates the reliable reconstruction of the flow velocity. Our study sheds light on the understanding of the topology and property of the electron vortex and its relationship with kinetic-scale magnetic holes.

<title>A Theory for Neutron Star and Black Hole Kicks and Induced Spins</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Using 20 long-term 3D core-collapse supernova simulations, we find that lower compactness progenitors that explode quasi-spherically due to the short delay to explosion experience smaller neutron star recoil kicks in the ∼100−200 km s−1 range, while higher compactness progenitors that explode later and more aspherically leave neutron stars with kicks in the ∼300−1000 km s−1 range. In addition, we find that these two classes are correlated with the gravitational mass of the neutron star. This correlation suggests that the survival of binary neutron star systems may in part be due to their lower kick speeds. We also find a correlation between the kick and both the mass dipole of the ejecta and the explosion energy. Furthermore, one channel of black hole birth leaves masses of ∼10 M⊙, is not accompanied by a neutrino-driven explosion, and experiences small kicks. A second channel is through a vigorous explosion that leaves behind a black hole with a mass of ∼3.0 M⊙ kicked to high speeds. We find that the induced spins of nascent neutron stars range from seconds to ∼10 ms, but do not yet see a significant spin/kick correlation for pulsars. We suggest that if an initial spin biases the explosion direction, a spin/kick correlation would be a common byproduct of the neutrino mechanism of core-collapse supernovae. Finally, the induced spin in explosive black hole formation is likely large and in the collapsar range. This new 3D model suite provides a greatly expanded perspective and appears to explain some observed pulsar properties by default.

We present a quantum treatment of atom–electron collisions in magnetic fields, demonstrating the significant importance of including the effect of exchange that arises from two interacting electrons. We find strange behaviors that are not encountered in collisions without a magnetic field. In high magnetic fields, exchange can lead to orders of magnitude enhancements of collision cross sections. Additionally, the elastic collision cross sections that involve the ground state become comparable to those involving excited states, and states with large orbits have the largest contribution to the collisions. We anticipate significant changes to spectral line broadening in neutron star surfaces and atmospheres.

总结: 
本文使用Bayesian方法对NANOGrav 12.5年数据进行了引力波记忆的搜索，未发现任何具有说服力的信号。通过更灵活的红噪声模型，与GW记忆信号相关的支持度减少至1.3。根据天空位置和事件时刻，我们计算了GW记忆事件的应变上限，发现中位数应变上限约为3.3×10^-14。部分天空位置的应变上限存在差异，PSR J0613−0200周围存在一些额外噪声可能与GW记忆混淆。最后，应变上限随着时间的推移而改善，这归因于脉冲星定时阵列的持续增长。 <div>
We present the results of a Bayesian search for gravitational wave (GW) memory in the NANOGrav 12.5 yr data set. We find no convincing evidence for any gravitational wave memory signals in this data set. We find a Bayes factor of 2.8 in favor of a model that includes a memory signal and common spatially uncorrelated red noise (CURN) compared to a model including only a CURN. However, further investigation shows that a disproportionate amount of support for the memory signal comes from three dubious pulsars. Using a more flexible red-noise model in these pulsars reduces the Bayes factor to 1.3. Having found no compelling evidence, we go on to place upper limits on the strain amplitude of GW memory events as a function of sky location and event epoch. These upper limits are computed using a signal model that assumes the existence of a common, spatially uncorrelated red noise in addition to a GW memory signal. The median strain upper limit as a function of sky position is approximately 3.3 × 10−14. We also find that there are some differences in the upper limits as a function of sky position centered around PSR J0613−0200. This suggests that this pulsar has some excess noise that can be confounded with GW memory. Finally, the upper limits as a function of burst epoch continue to improve at later epochs. This improvement is attributable to the continued growth of the pulsar timing array.

We present results from the search for astrometric accelerations of stars in ω Centauri using 13 yr of regularly scheduled Hubble Space Telescope WFC3/UVIS calibration observations in the cluster core. The high-precision astrometry of ∼160,000 sources was searched for significant deviations from linear proper motion. This led to the discovery of four cluster members and one foreground field star with compelling acceleration patterns. We interpreted them as the result of the gravitational pull by an invisible companion and determined preliminary Keplerian orbit parameters, including the companion’s mass. For the cluster members, our analysis suggests periods ranging from 8.8 to 19+ yr and dark companions in the mass range of ∼0.7 to ∼1.4M☉. At least one companion could exceed the upper mass boundary of white dwarfs and can be classified as a neutron star candidate.

总结: 这篇论文研究了银河系的灰尘消光曲线在近红外的特征，通过对SDSS和2MASS的星表数据进行分析，发现在低至中等灰尘密度范围内，消光曲线的斜率βNIR没有系统性变化，平均值为1.85。此外，发现βNIR与RV之间没有内在的相关性。这些结果对于typical sightlines是适用的，不包括靠近银心的尘埃密集区域或RV大于4的罕见视线。最后，发现RH = 0.345，这对Cepheid的校准和H0的测定有一定的影响。 <br /><br />总结: <div>
The Milky Way dust extinction curve in the near-infrared (NIR) follows a power-law form, but the value of the slope, βNIR, is debated. Systematic variations in the slope of the Milky Way UV extinction curve are known to be correlated with variations in the optical slope (through RV), but whether such a dependence extends to the NIR is unclear. Finally, because of low dust column densities, the NIR extinction law is poorly understood at high Galactic latitudes where most extragalactic work takes place. In this paper, we construct extinction curves from 56,649 stars with Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Two Micron All Sky Survey photometry, based on stellar parameters from SDSS spectra. We use dust maps to identify dust-free stars, from which we calibrate the relation between stellar parameters and intrinsic colors. Furthermore, to probe the low-dust regime at high latitudes, we use aggregate curves based on many stars. We find no systematic variation of βNIR across low-to-moderate dust columns (0.02 < E(B − V) ≲ 1), and report average βNIR = 1.85 ± 0.01, in agreement with the law in the 2019 Fitzpatrick et al. study, but steeper than the Cardelli et al. and 1999 Fitzpatrick laws. Star-to-star scatter in βNIR is relatively small (σ(βNIR) = 0.13). We also find no intrinsic correlation between βNIR and RV (there is an apparent correlation that is the result of the correlated uncertainties in the two values). These results hold for typical sightlines; we do not probe very dusty regions near the Galactic Center, nor rare sightlines with RV > 4.

主要研究M31星系中大质量恒星的环境，通过多分辨率的遮光测量来探究其周围的星际介质。根据Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT)项目中得到的恒星光度和贝叶斯遮光和恒星工具（BEAST）拟合的模型，建立了一份包含42,107个主序大质量恒星候选者的目录。使用核密度估计来量化星系环境，比较了BEAST提供的高分辨率消光估计和PHAT的25 pc分辨率的尘埃图，测量了消光的总柱密度分布。研究发现，尽管尘埃的平均总柱密度随着大质量恒星的密度增加而增加，但朝向这些恒星的平均视线消光在所有环境中保持不变。这表明，大质量恒星在其周围拥有相同数量的尘埃，而不受其在星系中的位置的影响。这些结果表明，在M31星系中，大质量恒星是在稀疏区域中形成的，而不是迁移到那里。<br /><br />总结: 该研究利用M31星系中恒星的测量数据探究了大质量恒星的形成环境，发现了尘埃密度与恒星密度的关系，以及大质量恒星周围的消光情况。研究结果表明，大质量恒星在M31星系中是在稀疏区域中形成的，而不是迁移到那里。 <div>
Resolving the environments of massive stars is crucial for understanding their formation mechanisms and their impact on galaxy evolution. An important open question is whether massive stars found in diffuse regions outside spiral arms formed in situ or migrated there after forming in denser environments. To address this question, we use multiresolution measurements of extinction in the Andromeda galaxy (M31) to probe the interstellar medium surrounding massive stars across galactic environments. We construct a catalog of 42,107 main-sequence massive star candidates (M ≥ 8 M⊙) using resolved stellar photometry from the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) program, plus stellar and dust model fits from the Bayesian Extinction and Stellar Tool (BEAST). We quantify galactic environments by computing surrounding stellar densities of massive stars using kernel density estimation. We then compare high-resolution line-of-sight extinction estimates from the BEAST with 25 pc resolution dust maps from PHAT, measuring the total column density distribution of extinction. Our key finding is that, although the average total column density of dust increases with the density of massive stars, the average line-of-sight extinction toward massive stars remains constant across all environments. This suggests that massive stars have a uniform amount of dust in their immediate environment, regardless of their location in the galaxy. One possible explanation for these findings is that small molecular clouds are still capable of forming massive stars, even if they are not resolvable at 25 pc. These results indicate that massive stars are forming in the sparse regions of M31, as opposed to migrating there.

在这项研究中，我们考虑了辐射冷却纤维状分子云在引力坍缩过程中的等离子扩散效应。我们考虑了磁场的两种不同配置，即轴向和环向，在等离子扩散的情况下，对于辐射冷却的纤维状分子云会导致两种不同的问题。在两种磁场配置下，纤维状分子云都会被等离子扩散辐射冷却和加热。我们使用自相似方法来求解每种情况下得到的方程。我们发现绝热指数和等离子扩散率在冷却纤维坍缩过程中起着非常重要的作用。结果表明，等离子加热显著增加了冷却纤维中间区域的温度。此外，我们发现等离子扩散在坍缩过程中具有非常重要的影响，以至于在冷却纤维中间区域，其加热效应比其动力学效应更为突出。得到的结果还提到了一些区域，那里的星体形成速率相对观测报告来说更多或更少。 <br /><br />总结: ambipolar diffusion对纤维状分子云的引力坍缩过程起着重要作用，其加热效应显著增加了纤维中间区域的温度。在一些区域，等离子扩散的影响使得星体形成速率有所不同。 <div>
In this study, we consider the effects of ambipolar diffusion during the gravitational collapse of a radiative cooling filamentary molecular cloud. Two separate configurations of magnetic field, i.e., axial and toroidal, are considered in the presence of the ambipolar diffusion for a radiative cooling filament. These configurations lead to two different formulations of the problem. The filament is radiatively cooled and heated by ambipolar diffusion in both cases of magnetic field configurations. The self-similar method is used to solve the obtained equations in each case. We found that the adiabatic exponent and ambipolar diffusivity play very important roles during the gravitational collapse of a cooling filament. The results show that the ambipolar heating significantly increases the temperature in the middle regions of a cooling filament. Furthermore, we found that the ambipolar diffusion has very important effects during the collapse, so that its heating effect is dominant over its dynamical effect in the middle regions of a cooling filament. The obtained results also address some regions where the rate of star formation is more or less compared to the observational reports.

<div> DESI Bright Galaxy Survey, pSMF, One-percent Survey, stellar mass, BGS

总结:
DESI亮星系调查中的概率星族质量函数(pSMF)利用一次性调查观测的数据推导出星系的质量函数，使用了概率价值增值BGS (PROVABGS) 贝叶斯光谱能量分布建模框架，推导出了亮星系和暗星系样本的pSMF以及星系的红移演化。研究显示pSMF与文献中的质量函数测量结果相当一致，展示出DESI Bright Galaxy Survey在研究低红移时尺度关系的统计能力。 <div>
We present the probabilistic stellar mass function (pSMF) of galaxies in the DESI Bright Galaxy Survey (BGS), observed during the One-percent Survey. The One-percent Survey was one of DESI’s survey validation programs conducted from 2021 April to May, before the start of the main survey. It used the same target selection and similar observing strategy as the main survey and successfully observed the spectra and redshifts of 143,017 galaxies in the r < 19.5 magnitude-limited BGS Bright sample and 95,499 galaxies in the fainter surface-brightness- and color-selected BGS Faint sample over z < 0.6. We derive pSMFs from posteriors of stellar mass, M*, inferred from DESI photometry and spectroscopy using the Hahn et al. PRObabilistic Value-Added BGS (PROVABGS) Bayesian spectral energy distribution modeling framework. We use a hierarchical population inference framework that statistically and rigorously propagates the M* uncertainties. Furthermore, we include correction weights that account for the selection effects and incompleteness of the BGS observations. We present the redshift evolution of the pSMF in BGS, as well as the pSMFs of star-forming and quiescent galaxies classified using average specific star formation rates from PROVABGS. Overall, the pSMFs show good agreement with previous stellar mass function measurements in the literature. Our pSMFs showcase the potential and statistical power of BGS, which in its main survey will observe >100 × more galaxies. Moreover, we present the statistical framework for subsequent population statistics measurements using BGS, which will characterize the global galaxy population and scaling relations at low redshifts with unprecedented precision.

总结:
NGC 3603是银河系中最明亮的GH ii区域，通过中红外成像调查发现其辐射区域。利用多波段观测数据，发现了14个可能是MYSOs的紧凑源。同时，也检测到了3个大质量原行星盘候选体以及演化蓝色超巨星Sher 25的盘和喷流的尘埃辐射。通过多波段数据推导了NGC 3603内部星形成凝块的辐射-质量比和维里参数，估计了它们的相对年龄，并发现与之前研究过的GH ii区域相比，NGC 3603是一个年龄较大的GH ii区域，呈空腔型。相比于类似的连续裂解光子速率的分布型GH ii区域，NGC 3603的MYSOs和分子凝块数量较为适度。 <div>
We present our sixth set of results from our mid-infrared imaging survey of Milky Way Giant H ii regions with our detailed analysis of NGC 3603, the most luminous giant H ii (GH ii) region in the Galaxy. We used imaging data from the FORCAST instrument on the Stratospheric Observatory For Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) at 20 and 37 μm, which mapped the central ∼8.′5 × 8.′5 infrared-emitting area of NGC 3603 at a spatial resolution of ≲3″. Utilizing these SOFIA data in conjunction with multiwavelength observations from the near-infrared to radio, including Spitzer-IRAC and Herschel-PACS archival data, we investigate the physical nature of individual infrared sources and subcomponents within NGC 3603. For individual compact sources, we used the multiwavelength photometry data to construct spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and fit them with massive young stellar object (MYSO) SED models, and find 14 sources that are likely to be MYSOs. We also detect dust emission from the 3 massive proplyd candidates, as well as from the disk and outflow of the evolved blue supergiant, Sher 25. Utilizing multiwavelength data, we derived luminosity-to-mass ratio and virial parameters for the star-forming clumps within NGC 3603, estimating their relative ages and finding that NGC 3603 is an older GH ii region overall, compared to our previously studied GH ii regions. We discuss how NGC 3603, which we categorize as a cavity-type GH ii region, exhibits a more modest number of MYSOs and molecular clumps when compared to the distributed-type GH ii regions that share similar Lyman continuum photon rates.

<div> 高红移星系、三维形态推断、贝叶斯模型、椭圆度、三轴性<br />

在这篇文章中，研究者使用了不同iable贝叶斯模型和Hamilton Monte Carlo方法来推断James Webb Space Telescope Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science观测中高红移星系的三维形态。他们发现高质量和低红移的星系呈现更加椭圆的形态，而高质量和高红移的星系呈现更加三轴对称的形态，暗示了星系的发展趋势。他们还同时推断了三维尺寸和质量之间的关系，以及其与三维几何形态的相关性。最后，他们讨论了选择效应、后续观测前景和理论意义。<br /> <div>
The 3D geometries of high-redshift galaxies remain poorly understood. We build a differentiable Bayesian model and use Hamiltonian Monte Carlo to efficiently and robustly infer the 3D shapes of star-forming galaxies in James Webb Space Telescope Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science observations with at z = 0.5–8.0. We reproduce previous results from the Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey in a fraction of the computing time and constrain the mean ellipticity, triaxiality, size, and covariances with samples as small as ∼50 galaxies. We find high 3D ellipticities for all mass–redshift bins, suggesting oblate (disky) or prolate (elongated) geometries. We break that degeneracy by constraining the mean triaxiality to be ∼1 for dwarfs at z > 1 (favoring the prolate scenario), with significantly lower triaxialities for higher masses and lower redshifts indicating the emergence of disks. The prolate population traces out a “banana” in the projected diagram with an excess of low-b/a, large- galaxies. The dwarf prolate fraction rises from ∼25% at z = 0.5–1.0 to ∼50%–80% at z = 3–8. Our results imply a second kind of disk settling from oval (triaxial) to more circular (axisymmetric) shapes with time. We simultaneously constrain the 3D size–mass relation and its dependence on 3D geometry. High-probability prolate and oblate candidates show remarkably similar Sérsic indices (n ∼ 1), nonparametric morphological properties, and specific star formation rates. Both tend to be visually classified as disks or irregular, but edge-on oblate candidates show more dust attenuation. We discuss selection effects, follow-up prospects, and theoretical implications.

AGN燃料来源的研究得到了促进，研究者通过Sloan数字化巡天IV（SDSS-IV）的MaNGA积分场谱学调查，建立了一个包含387个AGN的目录。通过结合MaNGA AGN目录和基于合并星系的一系列水动力学模拟识别的新SDSS星系合并目录，研究了星系合并和AGN核活动之间的联系。发现在约1011M⊙的恒星质量星系中，与非合并星系相比，合并星系中AGN的超额较强。进一步的研究发现，合并星系和AGN光度或吸积率之间没有相关性。总结：虽然总体上星系合并似乎会比非合并星系触发或增强AGN活动，但它们似乎并不会引起更高水平的吸积或更高的光度。我们为科学界提供MaNGA AGN目录和MaNGA星系合并目录。 <div>
To facilitate new studies of galaxy-merger-driven fueling of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), we present a catalog of 387 AGNs that we have identified in the final population of over 10,000 z < 0.15 galaxies observed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-IV (SDSS-IV) integral field spectroscopy survey Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA). We selected the AGNs via mid-infrared Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer colors, Swift/Burst Alert Telescope ultra-hard X-ray detections, NRAO Very Large Array Sky Survey and Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty centimeters radio observations, and broad emission lines in SDSS spectra. By combining the MaNGA AGN catalog with a new SDSS catalog of galaxy mergers that were identified based on a suite of hydrodynamical simulations of merging galaxies, we study the link between galaxy mergers and nuclear activity for AGNs above a limiting bolometric luminosity of 1044.4 erg s−1. We find an excess of AGNs in mergers, relative to nonmergers, for galaxies with stellar mass ∼1011M⊙, where the AGN excess is somewhat stronger in major mergers than in minor mergers. Further, when we combine minor and major mergers and sort by merger stage, we find that the highest AGN excess occurs in post-coalescence mergers in the highest-mass galaxies. However, we find no evidence of a correlation between galaxy mergers and AGN luminosity or accretion rate. In summary, while galaxy mergers overall do appear to trigger or enhance AGN activity more than nonmergers, they do not seem to induce higher levels of accretion or higher luminosities. We provide the MaNGA AGN Catalog and the MaNGA Galaxy Merger Catalog for the community here.

Gravitational wave (GW) standard siren observations provide a rather useful tool to explore the evolution of the Universe. In this work, we wish to investigate whether dark sirens with neutron star (NS) deformation from third-generation GW detectors could help probe the interaction between dark energy and dark matter. We simulate the GW dark sirens of four detection strategies based on 3 yr observation and consider four phenomenological interacting dark energy (IDE) models to perform cosmological analysis. We find that GW dark sirens could provide tight constraints on Ωm and H0 in the four IDE models but do not perform well in constraining the dimensionless coupling parameter β in models of the interaction proportional to the energy density of cold dark matter. Nevertheless, the parameter degeneracy orientations of cosmic microwave background (CMB) and GW are almost orthogonal, and thus, the combination of them could effectively break cosmological parameter degeneracies, with the constraint errors of β being 0.00068–0.018. In addition, we choose three typical equations of state (EoSs) of an NS, i.e., SLy, MPA1, and MS1, to investigate the effect of an NS’s EoS on cosmological analysis. The stiffer EoS could give tighter constraints than the softer EoS. Nonetheless, the combination of CMB and GW dark sirens (using different EoSs of an NS) shows basically the same constraint results of cosmological parameters. We conclude that the dark sirens from 3G GW detectors would play a crucial role in helping probe the interaction between dark energy and dark matter, and the CMB+GW results are basically not affected by the EoS of an NS.

We present a study of a sample of 45 spectroscopically confirmed, UV luminous galaxies at z ∼ 6. They were selected as bright Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) using deep multiband optical images in more than 2 deg2 of the sky, and subsequently identified via their strong Lyα emission. The majority of these LBGs span an absolute UV magnitude range from −22.0 to −20.5 mag with Lyα equivalent width (EW) between ∼10 and ∼200 Å, representing the most luminous galaxies at z ∼ 6 in terms of both UV continuum emission and Lyα line emission. We model the spectral energy distributions of 10 LBGs that have deep infrared observations from Hubble Space Telescope, JWST, and/or Spitzer, and find that they have a wide range of stellar masses and ages. They also have high star formation rates ranging from a few tens to a few hundreds of solar mass per year. Five of the LBGs have JWST or HST images, and four of them show compact morphology in these images, including one that is roughly consistent with a point source, suggesting that UV luminous galaxies at this redshift are generally compact. The fraction of our photometrically selected LBGs with strong Lyα emission (EW > 25 Å) is about 0.2, which is consistent with previous results and supports a moderate evolution of the intergalactic medium opacity at the end of cosmic reionization. Using deep X-ray images, we do not find evidence of strong active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity in these galaxies, but our constraint is loose, and we are not able to rule out the possibility of any weak AGN activity.

<title>Simple Model for Temporal Variations of Hα Spectrum by an Eruptive Filament from a Superflare on a Solar-type Star</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Flares are intense explosions on the solar and stellar surfaces, and solar flares are sometimes accompanied by filament or prominence eruptions. Recently, a large filament eruption associated with a superflare on a solar-type star EK Dra was discovered for the first time. The absorption of the Hα spectrum initially exhibited a blueshift with the velocity of 510 km s−1, and decelerated in time probably due to gravity. Stellar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) were thought to occur, although the filament eruption did not exceed the escape velocity under the surface gravity. To investigate how such a filament eruption can occur and whether CMEs are associated with the filament eruption or not, we perform a one-dimensional hydrodynamic simulation of the flow along an expanding magnetic loop emulating a filament eruption under adiabatic and unsteady conditions. The loop configuration and expanding velocity normal to the loop are specified in the configuration parameters, and we calculate the line-of-sight velocity of the filament eruption using the velocities along and normal to the loop. We find that (i) the temporal variations of the Hα spectrum for EK Dra can be explained by a falling filament eruption in the loop with longer time and larger spatial scales than that of the Sun, and (ii) the stellar CMEs are also thought to be associated with the filament eruption from the superflare on EK Dra, because the rarefied loop unobserved in the Hα spectrum needs to expand faster than the escape velocity, whereas the observed filament eruption does not exceed the escape velocity.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report on the spectroscopic confirmation of a massive quiescent galaxy at zspec = 4.53 in the COSMOS field. The object was first identified as a galaxy with suppressed star formation at zphot ∼ 4.65 from the COSMOS2020 catalog. The follow-up spectroscopy with Keck/MOSFIRE in the K band reveals faint [O ii] emission and the Balmer break, indicative of evolved stellar populations. We fit the spectral energy distribution using photometry and a spectrum to infer physical properties. The obtained stellar mass is high (M* ∼ 1010.8M⊙) and the current star formation rate is more than 1 dex below that of main-sequence galaxies at z = 4.5. Its star formation history suggests that this galaxy experienced rapid quenching from z ∼ 5. The galaxy is among the youngest quiescent galaxies confirmed so far at zspec > 3 with zform ∼ 5.2 (200 Myr ago), which is the epoch when 50% of the total stellar mass was formed. A unique aspect of the galaxy is that it is in an extremely dense region; there are four massive star-forming galaxies at 4.4 < zphot < 4.7 located within 150 physical kpc from the galaxy. Interestingly, three of them have virial radii that strongly overlap with that of the central quiescent galaxy (∼70 kpc), suggesting that the overdensity region is likely the highest-redshift candidate of a dense group with a spectroscopically confirmed quiescent galaxy at the center. The group provides us with a unique opportunity to gain insights into the role of the group environment in quenching at z ∼ 5, which corresponds to the formation epoch of massive elliptical galaxies in the local Universe.

<title>The Remarkable Predictive Power of Infrared Data of Blazars</title>

Blazars are the brightest and most abundant persistent sources in the extragalactic γ-ray sky. Due to their significance, they are often observed across various energy bands, where the data of which can be used to explore potential correlations between emission at different energies, yielding valuable insights into the emission processes of their powerful jets. In this study we utilized IR data at 3.4 and 4.6 μm from the Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer Reactivation Mission, spanning 8 yr of observations, X-ray data from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory collected throughout the satellite’s lifetime, and 12 years of γ-ray measurements from the Fermi Large Area Telescope’s all-sky survey. Our analysis reveals that the IR spectral slope reliably predicts the peak frequency and maximum intensity of the synchrotron component of blazar spectral energy distributions, provided it is uncontaminated by radiation unrelated to the jet. A notable correlation between the IR and γ-ray fluxes was observed, with the BL Lacertae subclass of blazars displaying a strong correlation coefficient of r = 0.80. IR band variability is more pronounced in flat spectrum radio quasars than in BL Lacertae objects, with mean fractional variability values of 0.65 and 0.35, respectively. We also observed that the synchrotron peak intensity of intermediate-high-energy-peaked objects can forecast their detectability at very high γ-ray energies. We used this predicting power to identify objects in current catalogs that could meet the detection threshold of the Cerenkov Telescope Array extragalactic survey, which should encompass approximately 180 blazars.

<title>Very High-energy (>50 GeV) Gamma-Ray Flux Variability of Bright Fermi Blazars</title>

Understanding the high-energy emission processes and variability patterns are two of the most challenging research problems associated with relativistic jets. In particular, the long-term (months to years) flux variability at very high energies (VHE >50 GeV) has remained an unexplored domain so far. This is possibly due to the decreased sensitivity of the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) above a few GeV, hence low photon statistics, and observing constraints associated with the ground-based Cherenkov telescopes. This paper reports the results obtained from the 0.05−2 TeV Fermi-LAT data analysis of a sample of 29 blazars with the primary objective to explore their months-to-year-long very high-energy (VHE) flux variability behavior. This systematic search has led to, for the first time, the detection of significant flux variations in five blazars at the >99% confidence level, whereas eight of them exhibit variability, albeit at a lower confidence level (∼95%–99%). A comparison of the 0.05–2 TeV flux variations with that observed at 0.1–50 GeV band has revealed similar variability behavior for most of the sources. However, complex variability patterns that are not reflected contemporaneously in both energy bands were also detected, thereby providing tantalizing clues about the underlying radiative mechanisms. These results open up a new dimension to unravel the VHE emission processes operating in relativistic jets, hence sowing the seeds for their future observations with the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array.

Voyager 1 and 2 are only the two spacecraft that have arrived and passed through the heliospheric boundaries. Based on the plasma data from the Voyager 2 spacecraft, the electron quasi-thermal noise (QTN) is investigated by using of the electron population model consisting of a core with Maxwellian distribution and a halo with kappa distribution. The power spectra of the electron QTN is calculated at different heliocentric distances from 1 to 110 au. The parametric dependence of the QTN power spectra and the effective Debye length on the model parameters, such as the density ratio and temperature ratio of the halo to the core, kappa index and the antenna length, are discussed further. The results show that the electron QTN spectrum consists of a plateau in the low frequency band f < fpt, a prominent peak at the plasma frequency fpt, and a rapid decreasing part in the high frequency band f > fpt. The QTN plateau level basically falls down outwards until the termination shock crossing at about 84 au, after which the plateau rebounds a little near the heliopause. Although the model parameters can be very variable, the QTN plateau level does not present more than the double change in a fairly wide range of the model parameters. The presented results can be useful for future deep-space explorations in the heliosphere and can provide valuable references for the design of onboard detectors.

Lyman limit systems (LLSs) are dense hydrogen clouds with high enough H i column densities to absorb Lyman continuum photons emitted from distant quasars. Their high column densities imply an origin in dense environments; however, the statistics and distribution of LLSs at high redshifts still remain uncertain. In this paper, we use self-consistent radiative transfer cosmological simulations from the Cosmic Reionization on Computers (CROC) project to study the physical properties of LLSs at the tail end of cosmic reionization at z ∼ 6. We generate 3000 synthetic quasar sight lines to obtain a large number of LLS samples in the simulations. In addition, with the high physical fidelity and resolution of CROC, we are able to quantify the association between these LLS samples and nearby galaxies. Our results show that the fraction of LLSs spatially associated with nearby galaxies increases with H i column density. Moreover, we find that LLSs that are not near any galaxy typically reside in filamentary structures connecting neighboring galaxies in the intergalactic medium (IGM). This quantification of the distribution and association of LLSs to large-scale structure informs our understanding of the IGM–galaxy connection during the “Epoch of Reionization,” and provides a theoretical basis for interpreting future observations.

<title>COOL-LAMPS. VI. Lens Model and New Constraints on the Properties of COOL J1241+2219, a Bright z = 5 Lyman Break Galaxy and its z = 1 Cluster Lens</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a strong lensing analysis of COOL J1241+2219, the brightest known gravitationally lensed galaxy at z ≥ 5, based on new multiband Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging data. The lensed galaxy has a redshift of z = 5.043, placing it shortly after the end of the “Epoch of Reionization,” and an AB magnitude zAB = 20.47 mag (Khullar et al.). As such, it serves as a touchstone for future research of that epoch. The high spatial resolution of HST reveals internal structure in the giant arc, from which we identify 15 constraints and construct a robust lens model. We use the lens model to extract the cluster mass and lensing magnification. We find that the mass enclosed within the Einstein radius of the z = 1.001 cluster lens is , significantly lower than other known strong lensing clusters at its redshift. The average magnification of the giant arc is 〈μarc〉 = , a factor of greater than previously estimated from ground-based data; the flux-weighted average magnification is 〈μarc〉 = . We update the current measurements of the stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR) of the source for the revised magnification to 9.7 ± 0.3 and SFR = M⊙ yr−1, respectively. The powerful lensing magnification acting upon COOL J1241+2219 resolves the source and enables future studies of the properties of its star formation on a clump-by-clump basis. The lensing analysis presented here will support upcoming multiwavelength characterization with HST and JWST data of the stellar mass assembly and physical properties of this high-redshift lensed galaxy.

<title>On the Possibility of an Upper Limit on Magnetically Induced Radius Inflation in Low-mass Stars</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The radii of low-mass stars are observed to be inflated above standard model predictions, especially in magnetically active stars. Typically, the empirical relative radius inflations ΔR/R are ≤10% but in (rare) cases may be ≥20%. Our magneto-convective stellar models have already replicated many empirical ΔR/R values. Here, we ask: is there any theoretical upper limit on the amount of such inflation? We use our magneto-convective model to compute ΔR/R using empirically plausible values of the surface field strength parameter δ. Inside each model, the maximum internal field is set to a particular value: Bceil = 10, or 100 kG, or 1 MG. When Bceil = 10 kG, peak inflation with ΔR/R ≈ 90% occurs in stars with masses of 0.7 M⊙. With Bceil = 100 kG, peak inflation with ΔR/R ≈ 140% occurs in stars with M ≈ 0.5 M⊙. But with Bceil = 1 MG, we find no peak in ΔR/R as a function of δ; instead, the larger δ is, the larger ΔR/R becomes, reaching 300%–350% in the case of the largest δ considered. Thus, magneto-convective modeling can accommodate ΔR/R values which are considerably larger than any reported empirical inflations. We find that a maximum occurs in ΔR/R as a function of δ only in model stars where the field reaches its maximum strength Bceil inside the convective envelope. Moreover, our models of completely convective stars undergo smaller amounts of relative radius inflation than models with radiative cores, a result consistent with some previous reports.

<title>A Transition Discovered in the Subcritical Regime of 1A 0535+262</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present NICER observations of the accreting X-ray pulsar 1A 0535+262 during its faint state (≲6 × 1036 erg s−1), observed in several type I and type II outbursts. We discovered a transition of temporal and spectral properties around the luminosity Lt = 3.3 × 1035 erg s−1, below which spectra are relatively soft and the pulse profiles have only a narrow peak. The spectra are harder and a secondary hump gradually appears in the pulse profiles when L ≳ Lt. We discuss possible physical mechanisms for this transition, including different Comptonization seed photons, the disappearance of gas shocks on the neutron star surface, and the combination of plasma and vacuum polarization effects.

<br /><br />
研究热木星的大气动力学时，了解全球环流和化学之间的相互作用非常重要。本文介绍了二维光化学运输模型VULCAN 2D，该模型通过允许非均匀纬向风改进了伪二维方法。我们对VULCAN 2D进行了广泛的验证，并应用到HD 189733 b和HD 209458 b，揭示了混合机制的转变。针对先前推断的富碳大气，我们发现超太阳C/O比的HD 209458 b在早晨边缘呈现出明显的C2H4吸收，而在晚上边缘则没有，这归因于来自夜侧的水平运输。最后，我们用合成光谱展示了水平运输在透射观测中的影响及其对晨晚边缘不对称性的影响，强调在解释外行星大气时考虑全球运输的必要性。 
<br /><br />总结: 这篇文章介绍了VULCAN 2D模型，并讨论了热木星的大气动力学以及其对化学的影响。研究发现水平运输在下层主导，而在高空垂直混合更为重要。针对HD 209458 b的观测发现，考虑全球运输对解释大气现象非常重要。 <div>
The atmospheric dynamics of tidally locked hot Jupiters is characterized by strong equatorial winds. Understanding the interaction between global circulation and chemistry is crucial in atmospheric studies and interpreting observations. Two-dimensional (2D) photochemical transport models shed light on how the atmospheric composition depends on circulation. In this paper, we introduce the 2D photochemical (horizontal and vertical) transport model, VULCAN 2D, which improves on the pseudo-2D approaches by allowing for nonuniform zonal winds. We extensively validate our VULCAN 2D with analytical solutions and benchmark comparisons. Applications to HD 189733 b and HD 209458 b reveal a transition in mixing regimes: horizontal transport predominates below ∼0.1 mbar, while vertical mixing is more important at higher altitudes above 0.1 mbar. Motivated by the previously inferred carbon-rich atmosphere, we find that HD 209458 b with supersolar carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O) exhibits pronounced C2H4 absorption on the morning limb but not on the evening limb, due to horizontal transport from the nightside. We discuss when a pseudo-2D approach is a valid assumption and its inherent limitations. Finally, we demonstrate the effect of horizontal transport in transmission observations and its impact on the morning−evening limb asymmetry with synthetic spectra, highlighting the need to consider global transport when interpreting exoplanet atmospheres.

<div> 关键词: 太阳耀斑，光谱线，大气层，辐射传递，速度场

总结: 太阳耀斑期间，光谱线的形成受到上层区域的影响，表现出复合的出射强度曲线。通过辐射-流体动力学和辐射传递计算模拟了太阳/恒星大气对电子束加热的响应，合成了铁离子的光谱线并研究了通过多普勒频移得到的视线速度场信息。研究发现，光谱线变化主要由色球层的变化引起，该区域的上升气流能够在线心产生蓝移或伪红移，取决于与光球层相比的相对贡献。在极端太阳和恒星耀斑情景中，爆炸性的色球凝结物也可以主导轮廓形状的暂时性红移，需要考虑三元分量才能完全表征。因此，深层形成的光谱线需要多组分的理解和处理，光谱线的不同区域对大气速度流动的探测都是有用的。 <div>
During solar flares, spectral lines formed in the photosphere have been shown to exhibit changes to their profiles despite the challenges of energy transfer to these depths. Recent work has shown that deep-forming spectral lines are subject to significant contributions from regions above the photosphere throughout the flaring period, resulting in a composite emergent intensity profile from multiple layers of the atmosphere. We employ radiative–hydrodynamic and radiative transfer calculations to simulate the response of the solar/stellar atmosphere to electron beam heating and synthesize spectral lines of Fe i to investigate the line-of-sight velocity fields information available from Doppler shifts of the emergent intensity profile. By utilizing the contribution function to deconstruct the line profile shape into its constituent sources, we show that variations in the line profiles are primarily caused by changes in the chromosphere. Up-flows in this region were found to create blueshifts or false redshifts in the line core dependent on the relative contribution of the chromosphere compared to the photosphere. In extreme solar and stellar flare scenarios featuring explosive chromospheric condensations, redshifted transient components can dominate the temporal evolution of the profile shape, requiring a tertiary component consideration to fully characterize. We conclude that deep-forming lines require a multicomponent understanding and treatment, with different regions of the spectral line being useful for probing individual regions of the atmosphere’s velocity flows.

<div> 关键词: 尘埃颗粒, 太阳星云, 行星形成, 涡流, 盘片金属

总结:
本文研究了太阳星云中尘埃颗粒的长期存活条件，发现在弱湍流、平坦径向压力梯度和高金属含量的条件下（α∼10−6, η≲10−3, Z∼0.1），直径为1毫米的尘埃颗粒可以在太阳星云中存活并保持其大小超过106年。这与最近的观测结果相符。最后，文章提出行星体形成可能是由盘片演化引起的，例如由于盘片风的内向扩散导致。 <div>
The lifetime of millimeter-sized dust grains, such as chondrules, in the nominal solar nebula model is limited to ∼105 yr, due to an inward drift driven by gas drag. However, isotopic and petrological studies of primitive meteorites indicate a discrepancy of ≳106 yr between the formation time of chondrules and that of chondritic parent bodies. Therefore, chondrules should survive for ≳106 yr in the solar nebula against the inward drift without subsequent growth (i.e., planetesimal formation). Here, we investigate the conditions of the solar nebula that are suitable for the long lifetime of chondrule-sized dust particles. We take the turbulent strength, the radial pressure gradient force, and the disk metallicity of the solar nebula as free parameters. For 1 mm radius chondrules to survive and keep their size for ≳106 yr, the suitable condition is a weak turbulence (α ∼ 10−6), a flat radial profile (η ≲ 10−3), and a high metallicity (Z ∼ 0.1). This condition is qualitatively consistent with the characteristics of protoplanetary disks suggested by recent observations. We eventually propose that planetesimal formation may be induced by disk evolution, e.g., the inside-out dispersal of the gas component due to the disk wind.

Iron Kα (Fe Kα) emission is observed ubiquitously in active galactic nuclei (AGN), and it is a powerful probe of their circumnuclear environment. Examinations of the emission line play a pivotal role in understanding the disk geometry surrounding black holes. It has been suggested that the torus and the broad-line region (BLR) are the origins of emission. However, there is no universal location for the emitting region relative to the BLR. Here, we present an analysis of the narrow component of the Fe Kα line in the Seyfert AGN MCG-5-23-16, one of the brightest AGN in X-rays and in Fe Kα emission, to localize the emitting region. Spectra derived from Chandra/HETGS observations show asymmetry in the narrow Fe Kα line, which has only been confirmed before in the AGN NGC 4151. Models including relativistic Doppler broadening and gravitational redshifts are preferred over simple Gaussians and measure radii consistent with R ≃ 200–650 rg. These results are consistent with those of NGC 4151 and indicate that the narrow Fe Kα line in MCG-5-23-16 is primarily excited in the innermost part of the optical BLR, or X-ray BLR. Characterizing the properties of the narrow Fe Kα line is essential for studying the disk geometries of the AGN population and mapping their innermost regions.

合并星系UGC 5205是一个在低红移处很罕见的沉寂型低质量星系。虽然具有丰富的冷气体和紫外线发射，表明在过去的几亿年内有显著的星形成活动，但是最近∼10百万年内却没有探测到Hα发射-星的形成。新的Karl G.Jansky超大阵观测显示，UGC 5205星系中主体的H i非常扰动，大部分H i存在于几千秒差距长的尾部，而PGC 027864的H i受有序旋转的影响。研究对UGC 5205的恒星群进行建模表明，一致的UV和Hα发射表明，星系约100-300百万年前经历了一个协调的淬火事件。UGC 5205和PGC 027864的不对称结果表明，主要的合并事件既可以淬火也可以触发矮星的形成。然而，由于气体仍然与系统结合，我们建议这样的合并仅暂时淬火星形成。我们估计UGC 5205的总淬火时间约为∼560百万年，与研究已建立的矮星体淬火部分的上限约为几个百分比一致。<br /><br />总结:合并星系UGC 5205具有丰富的冷气体和紫外线发射，但最近的Hα发射显示其星形成被淬火。通过H i观测发现，UGC 5205缺乏H i，而PGC 027864具有有序旋转的H i。研究模拟表明UGC 5205的淬火事件约为100-300百万年前发生，暗示主要合并事件会暂时淬火星形成。 <div>
It is exceedingly rare to find quiescent low-mass galaxies in the field at low redshift. UGC 5205 is an example of such a quenched field dwarf (M⋆ ∼ 3 × 108 M⊙). Despite a wealth of cold gas (MHI ∼ 3.5 × 108 M⊙) and UV emission that indicates significant star formation in the past few hundred megayears, there is no detection of Hα emission—star formation in the last ∼10 Myr—across the face of the galaxy. Meanwhile, the near equal-mass companion of UGC 5205, PGC 027864, is starbursting (which has an Hα equivalent width > 1000 Å). In this work, we present new Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array 21 cm line observations of UGC 5205, showing that the lack of star formation is caused by an absence of H i in the main body of the galaxy. The H i of UGC 5205 is highly disturbed; the bulk of the H i resides in several-kiloparsec–long tails, while the H i of PGC 027864 is dominated by ordered rotation. We model the stellar populations of UGC 5205 to show that, as indicated by the UV and Hα emission, the galaxy underwent a coordinated quenching event ∼100–300 Myr ago. The asymmetry of outcomes for UGC 5205 and PGC 027864 demonstrate that major mergers can both quench and trigger star formation in dwarfs. However, because the gas remains bound to the system, we suggest that such mergers only temporarily quench star formation. We estimate a total quenched time of ∼560 Myr for UGC 5205, consistent with established upper limits on the quenched fraction of a few percent for dwarfs in the field.

Using an idealized climate model incorporating seasonal forcing, we investigate the impact of rotation rate on the abundance of clouds on an Earth-like aquaplanet, and the resulting impacts upon albedo and seasonality. We show that the cloud distribution varies significantly with season, depending strongly on the rotation rate, and is well explained by the large-scale circulation and atmospheric state. Planetary albedo displays nonmonotonic behavior with rotation rate, peaking at around 1/2ΩE. Clouds reduce the surface temperature and total precipitation relative to simulations without clouds at all rotation rates, and reduce the dependence of total precipitation on rotation rate, causing nonmonotonic behavior and a local maximum around 1/8ΩE; these effects are related to the impacts of clouds on the net atmospheric and surface radiative energy budgets. Clouds also affect the seasonality. The influence of clouds on the extent of the winter Hadley cell and the intertropical convergence zone is relatively minor at slow rotation rates (<1/8ΩE), but becomes more pronounced at intermediate rotation rates, where clouds decrease their maximum latitudes. The timing of seasonal transitions varies with rotation rate, and the addition of clouds reduces the seasonal phase lag.

<div> 关键词: polytropic index, solar corona, LTE, ionization-recombination, plasma cocktail
总结:
本文通过理论模拟解决了观测到的太阳日冕多普勒/绝热指数γ下降的现象。研究发现，在含有重元素的太阳等离子体混合物中，离子化-复合反应的化学过程在局部热力学平衡(LTE)状态下导致了1.1<γ≤5/3。通过数值求解Saha方程并利用新推导的方程计算多普勒指数，得出了该结果。此外，观测到的缓慢磁流体波在日冕环中的传播速度与LTE离子化仅占观测到的γ下降的一小部分，这意味着太阳活跃区的等离子体并未处于预期的LTE状态。然而，当前的理论方法证实了温度升高时更高的多普勒指数的依赖性。综上所述，为了解释太阳日冕活跃区内多普勒指数的下降，有必要进行动力学非LTE离子化计算。 <div>
An initial theoretical attempt to explain the observed decrease of the polytropic/adiabatic index γ in the solar corona has been accomplished. The chemical reactions of the ionization–recombination processes in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) of a solar plasma cocktail containing heavy elements are found to cause 1.1 < γ ≤ 5/3 in the quiet solar atmosphere. It is also shown that the quiet solar atmosphere is in LTE, justifying this theoretical study. This result is obtained by numerically solving the Saha equation and subsequently using a newly derived equation for calculation of the polytropic index from thermodynamic partial derivatives of the enthalpy and pressure with respect to density and temperature. In addition, a comparison measured from spectroscopic observations of propagating slow magnetohydrodynamic waves in coronal loops shows that LTE ionization accounts for a very small part of the observed decrease of γ, meaning that the solar plasma in the active region is not in LTE as expected. However, the observed dependency of higher polytropic index at higher temperatures is confirmed by the current theoretical approach. It is concluded that in order to account for the polytropic index decrease in the active regions of the solar corona, it is necessary for kinetic non-LTE ionization calculations to be performed.

本文研究了低质量M型矮星的潮汐耗散对短周期太阳系外行星系统轨道结构的影响。通过非摄动谱方法计算了完全对流M型矮星的正常模式振荡，并计算了每种模式的耗散潮汐响应。研究发现非绝热耦合是耗散计算的重要组成部分。根据耗散结果，对潮汐在宿主恒星中的影响进行了计算。研究发现共面行星轨道因共振锁定而发生轨道迁移，影响周期小于1.5天的地球质量行星和周期小于2.5天的木星质量行星的轨道。由于共振驱动的轨道衰减和外移，预测在周期约1天内缺乏小行星，同时周期约3天内更大行星数量也很稀少。 <div>
The orbital architectures of short-period exoplanet systems are shaped by tidal dissipation in their host stars. For low-mass M dwarfs whose dynamical tidal response comprises a dense spectrum of inertial modes at low frequencies, resolving the frequency dependence of tidal dissipation is crucial to capturing the effect of tides on planetary orbits throughout the evolutionary stages of the host star. We use nonperturbative spectral methods to calculate the normal mode oscillations of a fully convective M dwarf modeled using realistic stellar profiles from MESA. We compute the dissipative tidal response composed of contributions from each mode, as well as nonadiabatic coupling between the modes, which we find to be an essential component of the dissipative calculations. Using our results for dissipation, we then compute the evolution of circular, coplanar planetary orbits under the influence of tides in the host star. We find that orbital migration driven by resonance locking affects the orbits of Earth-mass planets at orbital periods Porb ≲ 1.5 days and of Jupiter-mass planets at Porb ≲ 2.5 days. Due to resonantly driven orbital decay and outward migration, we predict a dearth of small planets closer than Porb ∼ 1 day and similarly sparse numbers of more massive planets out to Porb ∼ 3 days.

<div> 关键词: 分析模型, 初代星, 宿主暗物质晕, 红移, 数值模拟
总结:
本文开发了一个分析模型，用于描述初代星在原始气云中心形成的质量，作为宿主暗物质晕质量、红移和旋转程度的函数。模型基于对三个过程关键时间尺度的估计：气云坍缩、原恒星核吸积和原恒星核辐射反馈。最终的恒星质量取决于直到辐射反馈停止吸积的总吸积质量。这种分析估计出于全数值模拟的结果，导出了代数表达式，执行速度极快。尽管简单，该模型复制了观察到的最新宇宙学放大模拟中的恒星质量尺度和其参数依赖关系。这项工作阐明了支撑这种数值处理的基本物理原理，并为高效调整数值预测以符合最终观测到的初代星提供了途径。 <div>
We develop an analytic model for the mass of the first stars forming in the centers of primordial gas clouds as a function of host halo mass, redshift, and degree of rotation. The model is based on the estimation of key timescales determining the following three processes: the collapse of the gas cloud, the accretion onto the protostellar core, and the radiative feedback of the protostellar core. The final stellar mass is determined by the total mass accreted until the radiative feedback halts the accretion. The analytic estimation, motivated by the result of the full numerical simulations, leads to algebraic expressions allowing an extremely fast execution. Despite its simplicity, the model reproduces the stellar mass scale and its parameter dependencies observed in state-of-the-art cosmological zoom-in simulations. This work clarifies the basic physical principles undergirding such numerical treatments and provides a path to efficiently calibrating numerical predictions against eventual observations of the first stars.

<div> 观测、JWST/NIRCam slitless grism spectroscopy、Mg II absorption、星系、再电离

在这项研究中，研究人员利用深度的JWST/NIRCam slitless grism spectroscopy观测了29个星系周围冷弥散气体的新现象，这些星系的红移在2.3到6.3之间。它们的质量跨度很大，并且具有SFR/M⊙ yr−1 < 2.3的星形成率。研究发现，在距离类星体J0100+2802的视线附近300 kpc处有七个Mg II吸收系统。Mg II径向吸收剖面随半径急剧下降，大部分吸收延伸至宿主星系的2-3倍R200。其中六个Mg II吸收系统与质量为9的星系相关。Mg II吸收的动力学偏移与宿主星系的系统红移不同，其中位动速度约为135 km/s，标准偏差约为85 km/s。未绑定到宿主星系的Mg II吸收系统数量较高，表明在再电离末期，星系的晕层处于显著失衡状态，并且在丰富星系间介质方面非常高效。最强的两个Mg II吸收系统分别在z∼4.22和4.5处检测到，前者与一个合并的星系系统相关，后者与三个动力学接近的星系相关。这些星系都位于局部星系密集区，表明在z>4时存在两个“原星系团”中的冷Mg II吸收。 <br /><br />总结: 本研究利用JWST/NIRCam slitless grism spectroscopy观测了29个星系周围的冷弥散气体，发现其中七个Mg II吸收系统。这些吸收系统显示出高动力学偏移和大径向分离，表明大部分Mg II气体与其宿主星系不是通过引力约束在一起的。此外，两个最强的Mg II吸收系统出现在星系合并和星系密集区，暗示着在z>4时存在原星系团。 <div>
We report new observations of the cool diffuse gas around 29, 2.3 < z < 6.3 galaxies using deep JWST/NIRCam slitless grism spectroscopy around the sight line to the quasar J0100+2802. The galaxies span a stellar mass range of , and star formation rates (SFRs) of SFR/M⊙ yr−1 < 2.3. We find galaxies for seven Mg ii absorption systems within 300 kpc of the quasar sight line. The Mg ii radial absorption profile falls off sharply with radius, with most of the absorption extending out to 2–3 R200 of the host galaxies. Six out of seven Mg ii absorption systems are detected around galaxies with 9. The Mg ii absorption kinematics are shifted from the systemic redshifts of host galaxies with a median absolute velocity ≈ 135 km s−1 and standard deviation ≈ 85 km s−1. The high kinematic offset and large radial separation (R > 1.3 R200), suggest that five out of the seven Mg ii absorption systems are not gravitationally bound to their host galaxy. In contrast, most of the cool circumgalactic medium at z < 1 is gravitationally bound. The high incidence of unbound Mg ii gas in this work suggests that toward the end of reionization, galaxy halos are in a state of remarkable disequilibrium, and are highly efficient in enriching the intergalactic medium. The two strongest Mg ii absorption systems are detected at z ∼ 4.22 and 4.5, the former associated with a merging galaxy system and the latter associated with three kinematically close galaxies. Both of these galaxies reside in local galaxy overdensities, indicating the presence of cool Mg ii absorption in two “protogroups” at z > 4.

总结:<br />
这篇文章研究了Taurus分子云中最近检测到的1-和2-氰基萘和氰基苯的真空紫外光动力学。通过合并同步辐射和双成像电子/离子的巧合实验装置，实验得到了所有三种分子的高分辨率阈电子光谱，从中汇报了绝对精度很高的绝热电离能，特别是对于2-氰基萘，这是在这个精度水平上没有数据的。理论计算用于比较离子的基态的阈电子光谱。此外，通过外价格林函数计算，已经将扩展的阈电子光谱中观察到的不同特征分配给不同的分子轨道。该研究还阐明了光电子的动能分布，以描述它们对星际介质中的光电加热效应的贡献。最后，通过估计总离子产额，我们估算了几种星际辐射场的光速率。最后，我们讨论了两种氰基萘的光解离，借助Rice–Ramsperger–Kassel–Marcus建模报告了解离通道的活化能。观察到CN取代对VUV解离光电离弛豫通道没有引起任何明显变化。 <div>
We investigate the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photodynamics of gas phase 1- and 2-cyanonaphthalene and cyanobenzene, recently detected in the Taurus molecular cloud, by combining synchrotron radiation and a double imaging electron/ion coincidence setup. The high-resolution threshold photoelectron spectra (TPES) of all three molecules are obtained experimentally from which the adiabatic ionization energies are reported with very high accuracy, particularly for 2-cyanonaphthalene, for which no data exist at this level of precision. Theoretical calculations are performed to compare with the TPES for the ground electronic state of the cations. Furthermore, the different features observed in the extended TPES have been assigned to the different molecular orbitals with the help of the outer valence Green's function calculations. The present experiments also shed light on the kinetic energy distribution of the photoelectrons as a function of the incident photon energy, to describe their contribution to the photoelectric heating effect in the interstellar medium. In this context, we show how kinetic energy distributions can be obtained from our data for any given photon energy, such as the omnipresent Lyα line, or any given interstellar radiation field (ISRF). In addition, from the total ion yields, we estimate the photorates for a few ISRFs. Finally, we discuss the photodissociation of the two cyanonaphthalenes, quoting the activation energies of the dissociation channels with the help of Rice–Ramsperger–Kassel–Marcus modeling. It is observed that CN substitution does not cause any appreciable change to the VUV dissociative photoionization relaxation channel.

<div> VLBA, GMRT, J0354−1340, Seyfert 1 galaxy, radio jet
<br /><br />总结:
本文报道了对J0354−1340的新的VLBA和GMRT观测结果。这是唯一已知具有100 kpc双边射电喷流的无射电安静或射电中间的窄线塞弗特1星系。VLBA观测发现了源区域向东南方向的解析尺度单边射流，并且在Karl G. Jansky大型阵列和GMRT的观测中发现了以南北方向延伸的千秒差观。通过与3.0 GHz的存档VLA Sky Survey观测和5.5 GHz的VLA C配置观测相结合，呈现了解析尺度和千秒尺度上的核心谱。在∼5 GHz以上，解析尺度辐射主导了千秒尺度辐射，并且由于同步辐射自吸收而呈现出谱线倒转。这表明了一个尺度约为∼0.04 pc的紧凑同步辐射源，与射流基底或日冕相关。在3″尺度上未解决的千秒尺度射流可能在∼5 GHz以下主导了辐射。未来的射电观测可以探索解析尺度和100 kpc尺度之间的射流结构，其方向不匹配的起源以及解析尺度射流的适当运动。尚待探讨射电安静或射电中间活跃星系中这类大尺度射流的普遍性。 <div>
We present new 1.5–8.5 GHz Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations and 0.32–1.26 GHz Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT) observations of J0354−1340, which is the only known radio-quiet (RQ) or radio-intermediate (RI) narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy with a 100 kpc, two-sided radio jet. A parsec-scale, one-sided jet in the southeastern direction from the core emission is found in the VLBA observations, while the kiloparsec-scale jet observed with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and GMRT is in the south–north direction. Core spectra on parsec and kiloparsec scales are presented in combination with archival VLA Sky Survey observations at 3.0 GHz and VLA C-configuration observations at 5.5 GHz. The parsec-scale emission dominates the kiloparsec-scale emission above ∼5 GHz, and the spectrum is inverted due to synchrotron self-absorption. This indicates a compact synchrotron source with a size of ∼0.04 pc, which is associated with either the jet base or the corona. A subkiloparsec-scale jet, which is unresolved on scales of ∼3″, probably dominates the emission below ∼5 GHz. Future radio observations can explore the jet structure between the parsec and 100 kpc scales, the origin of their direction mismatch, and the parsec-scale jet proper motion. It remains to be explored how common such large-scale jets are in RQ or RI active galactic nuclei.

<div> 红移空间观测，平行平面逼近，条件矩（cmd），一阶导数的条件矩，红移空间畸变参数β，高斯线性Kaiser极限，非高斯性，Fisher预测<br /><br />总结: 本文介绍了一种新的平滑物质密度场的条件矩测度方法，可以有效地约束红移空间畸变参数β = f/b，尤其在高斯线性Kaiser极限条件下。通过使用条件矩（cmd）和条件重心（cr）联合，可以显著提高对宇宙学参数Ωm、σ8和ns的约束能力。文章还讨论了非高斯性对红移空间的影响，以及对模拟数据的一阶非高斯性贡献的影响。 通过合成各向异性高斯场的实现，验证了理论与数值结果的一致性。 <div>
Focusing on the redshift space observations with plane-parallel approximation and relying on the rotational dependency of the general definition of excursion sets, we introduce the so-called conditional moments of the first derivative (cmd) measures for the smoothed matter density field in three dimensions. We derive the perturbative expansion of cmd for the real space and redshift space where peculiar velocity disturbs the galaxies’ observed locations. Our criteria can successfully recognize the contribution of linear Kaiser and Finger-of-God effects. Our results demonstrate that the cmd measure has significant sensitivity for pristine constraining the redshift space distortion parameter β = f/b and interestingly, the associated normalized quantity in the Gaussian linear Kaiser limit has only β dependency. Implementation of the synthetic anisotropic Gaussian field approves the consistency between the theoretical and numerical results. Including the first-order contribution of non-Gaussianity perturbatively in the cmd criterion implies that the N-body simulations for the Quijote suite in the redshift space have been mildly skewed with a higher value for the threshold greater than zero. The non-Gaussianity for the perpendicular direction to the line of sight in the redshift space for smoothing scales R ≳ 20 Mpc h−1 is almost the same as in the real space. In contrast, the non-Gaussianity along the line-of-sight direction in the redshift space is magnified. The Fisher forecasts indicate a significant enhancement in constraining the cosmological parameters Ωm, σ8, and ns when using cmd + cr jointly.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了两次伴有紫外线后期相的X级太阳耀斑对电离层电流和赤道电动机的影响。研究发现，耀斑的冲击相能显著增强电离层电流，在2012年10月23日的X1.8级耀斑事件中，太阳风压力也影响了电流模式。而在2014年4月25日的X1.3级耀斑事件中，虽然太阳风压力较弱并稳定，但电流依然显著增强。同时，研究还发现，即使太阳风动态压力发生微弱变化，只有大约2nPa的变化也可能对全球电离层电流系统产生明显影响。 <div>
It is known that solar flares can affect the current system of the middle- and low-latitude ionosphere. Most earlier studies have focused on such effects during their impulsive phases. Recent studies have reported flares with a significant extreme ultraviolet (EUV) late phase, the effects of which on ionospheric currents have not yet been investigated. Here, we examine the solar quiet (Sq) currents and equatorial electrojets during two X-class flares with EUV late phases using data from more than 200 ground magnetometers. Our results indicate that the ionospheric currents could be significantly enhanced during the impulsive phase, while the effects of the EUV late phase may increase the global ionospheric currents, but are often weak and thus could be obscured by a change in solar wind conditions. In the X1.8 flare event on 2012 October 23, besides the solar flare effects, the currents were modulated by solar wind pressure. In the X1.3 flare event on 2014 April 25, the solar wind pressure was weak and stable, and the Sq currents were enhanced compared to nonflare conditions. We also found that even weak changes in the solar wind dynamic pressure, with magnitudes as low as ∼2 nPa, which are often ignored, may have an appreciable impact on the global ionospheric current system.

地球被视为一颗系外行星，研究了一种未来可能的中红外空间任务LIFE。研究利用地球的热谱数据和LIFE的噪声模型创建了模拟观测数据，通过大气检测框架表征了地球的大气，并评估了探测已知生物标志物的潜力。研究发现，地球是一个温暖适居的行星，具有大量的二氧化碳、水蒸气、臭氧和甲烷。观测地球的视角和季节变化对表征的影响较小。另外，地球大气化学物质的变化和云覆盖可能会对大气结构和痕量气体丰度的检测结果产生偏差。最后，研究指出，虽然地球的大气季节性变化不容易观测到，但未来的空间任务可以评估附近温和的类地行星是否适合居住甚至已被居住。<br /><br /> <div>
In this study, we treat Earth as an exoplanet and investigate our home planet by means of a potential future mid-infrared space mission called the Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE). We combine thermal spectra from an empirical data set of disk-integrated Earth observations with a noise model for LIFE to create mock observations. We apply a state-of-the-art atmospheric retrieval framework to characterize the planet, assess the potential for detecting the known bioindicators, and investigate the impact of viewing geometry and seasonality on the characterization. Our key findings reveal that we are observing a temperate habitable planet with significant abundances of CO2, H2O, O3, and CH4. Seasonal variations in the surface and equilibrium temperature, as well as in the Bond albedo, are detectable. Furthermore, the viewing geometry and the spatially and temporally unresolved nature of our observations only have a minor impact on the characterization. Additionally, Earth’s variable abundance profiles and patchy cloud coverage can bias retrieval results for the atmospheric structure and trace-gas abundances. Lastly, the limited extent of Earth’s seasonal variations in biosignature abundances makes the direct detection of its biosphere through atmospheric seasonality unlikely. Our results suggest that LIFE could correctly identify Earth as a planet where life could thrive, with detectable levels of bioindicators, a temperate climate, and surface conditions allowing liquid surface water. Even if atmospheric seasonality is not easily observed, our study demonstrates that next generation space missions can assess whether nearby temperate terrestrial exoplanets are habitable or even inhabited.

通过对8000多个Sloan数字天文巡天DR7活动星系核（AGNs）的Hβ和Hα宽发射线的红移以及线宽进行测量，假设由中心超大质量黑洞产生的引力红移，并基于引力红移和发射线红移，我们测量了在确定超级质量黑洞质量中的维里系数。通常被认为维里系数与广线区域（BLR）中气体云对吸积辐射压力无关，仅仅与BLR的偏移效应有关。测量得到的维里系数跨度极大。在我们的样本中，绝大多数AGNs（>96％）的维里系数大于文献中通常使用的f = 1。f-修正使高吸积AGNs的百分比减少了大约100倍。f与无量纲吸积率和艾登顿比率呈正相关。Hβ和Hα的红移主要是由引力原因造成的，通过BLR的无量纲半径与红移的负相关确认了这一点。我们的研究结果表明，辐射压力力对所测维里系数的贡献是显著的，并且包含了BLR的偏移效应。需要对高吸积AGNs进行f-修正，特别是高红移类星体。f-修正将使它们的质量增加1-2个数量级，这将使在高红移处形成和增长超大质量黑洞的解释变得更加具有挑战性。<br /><br />总结: Sloan Digital Sky Survey, active galactic nuclei, virial factor, gravitational redshift, supermassive black hole <div>
Under the hypothesis of gravitational redshift induced by the central supermassive black hole and based on line widths and shifts of redward-shifted Hβ and Hα broad emission lines for more than 8000 Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR7 active galactic nuclei (AGNs), we measure the virial factor in determining supermassive black hole masses. The virial factor had been believed to be independent of accretion radiation pressure on gas clouds in broad-line regions (BLRs) and only dependent on the inclination effects of BLRs. The virial factor measured spans a very large range. For the vast majority of AGNs (>96%) in our samples, the virial factor is larger than the f = 1 usually used in the literature. The f-correction makes the percent of high-accreting AGNs decrease by about 100 times. There are positive correlations of f with the dimensionless accretion rate and Eddington ratio. The redward shifts of Hβ and Hα are mainly of gravitational origin, confirmed by a negative correlation between the redward shift and the dimensionless radius of the BLR. Our results show that radiation pressure force is a significant contributor to the measured virial factor, containing the inclination effects of the BLR. The usually used values of f should be corrected for high-accreting AGNs, especially high-redshift quasars. The f-correction increases their masses by 1–2 orders of magnitude, which will make it more challenging to explain the formation and growth of supermassive black holes at high redshifts.

研究了一系列轴对称旋转磁风解决方案，旨在探讨具有强磁场、快速自转和强烈质量丢失特征的大质量白矮星（WD）合并遗迹的观测性质，这与WD J005311的推断性质相吻合。我们研究了磁层结构及对合并遗迹施加的自旋减速力矩与表面磁通Φ*、自旋角频率Ω*和质量丢失率的关系。我们确认，这种旋转磁性风序列的风特性与球形帕克风的显著偏离，其中vesc是恒星表面的逃逸速度。对于这样一个旋转磁性风序列，我们发现（i）磁重连沿赤道平面触发的准周期性质量喷发以及（ii）自旋减速力矩的比例关系。我们应用我们的结果来讨论大质量WD合并遗迹的自旋减速演化和风吹向对称性，后者可以通过使用Chandra连续观测WD J005311来探索。 <div>
We numerically construct a series of axisymmetric rotating magnetic wind solutions, aiming at exploring the observation properties of massive white dwarf (WD) merger remnants with a strong magnetic field, a fast spin, and an intense mass loss, as inferred for WD J005311. We investigate the magnetospheric structure and the resultant spin-down torque exerted to the merger remnant with respect to the surface magnetic flux Φ*, spin angular frequency Ω* and the mass-loss rate . We confirm that the wind properties for significantly deviate from those of the spherical Parker wind, where vesc is the escape velocity at stellar surface. For such a rotating magnetic wind sequence, we find (i) a quasiperiodic mass eruption triggered by magnetic reconnection along with the equatorial plane and (ii) a scaling relation for the spin-down torque . We apply our results to discuss the spin-down evolution and wind anisotropy of massive WD merger remnants, the latter of which could be probed by a successive observation of WD J005311 using Chandra.

The one consistent technique for remotely estimating the magnetic field in plasma has been Faraday rotation. It is only sensitive to the portion of the vector parallel to the propagation path. We show how to remotely detect the portion of the vector that is perpendicular using a modified measurement. Isolating this electromagnetic propagation wave mode to measure the magnetic field enables us to (i) study more about the magnetic field vector in plasma, (ii) reduce error in total electron content measurements, and (iii) discover new magnetic field information from archived data sets. The Appleton–Hartree equation is used to verify a new approach to calculating the phase change to an electromagnetic wave propagating through a plasma at frequencies larger than the gyrofrequency, the cyclotron frequency, and the upper hybrid frequency. Focusing on the perpendicular propagation modes, the simplified equation for the integrated path effect from a perpendicular magnetic field is calculated. The direction of the perpendicular component is unknown, because the magnetic field is squared. Isolating the magnetic term in the equation with dual frequency waves is shown. We also show how to eliminate the magnetic field contribution to total electron content measurements with a similar approach. In combination with Faraday rotation, the degeneracy of the magnetic field vector direction is reduced to a cone configuration.

Data collected by CHIME over 88 days in the 400–500 MHz frequency band (1.8 < z < 2.5) are formed into maps of the sky and high-pass delay filtered to suppress the foreground power, corresponding to removing cosmological scales with k∥ ≲ 0.13 Mpc−1 at the average redshift. Line-of-sight spectra to the eBOSS background quasar locations are extracted from the CHIME maps and combined with the Lyα forest flux transmission spectra to estimate the 21 cm–Lyα cross-correlation function. Fitting a simulation-derived template function to this measurement results in a 9σ detection significance. The coherent accumulation of the signal through cross-correlation is sufficient to enable a detection despite excess variance from foreground residuals ∼6–10 times brighter than the expected thermal noise level in the correlation function. These results are the highest-redshift measurement of 21 cm emission to date, and they set the stage for future 21 cm intensity mapping analyses at z > 1.8.

<div> M31, gaseous shocks, rotating stellar bar, pattern speed, gas dynamical models
<br /><br />
总结: M31的巨大气体冲击可以用旋转的恒星条来自然解释。研究使用气体动力学模型独立测量了M31的条纹速度。模拟中的重力势是根据星体光度和动力学约束的一组定制模型。研究发现，为了匹配观测到的冲击特征，需要较低的条纹速度。包括星际物理学如恒星形成和恒星反馈对冲击幅度影响不大，并且不会显著改变冲击位置。如果内部气体盘允许跟随H i和电离气体观测类似地变化倾斜度，则具有38 km s−1 kpc−1的条纹速度的气体模型可以匹配冲击特征和中央气体特征，这与星体动力学模型一致。 <div>
The large-scale gaseous shocks in the bulge of M31 can be naturally explained by a rotating stellar bar. We use gas dynamical models to provide an independent measurement of the bar pattern speed in M31. The gravitational potentials of our simulations are from a set of made-to-measure models constrained by stellar photometry and kinematics. If the inclination of the gas disk is fixed at i = 77°, we find that a low pattern speed of 16–20 km s−1 kpc−1 is needed to match the observed position and amplitude of the shock features, as shock positions are too close to the bar major axis in high Ωb models. The pattern speed can increase to 20–30 km s−1 kpc−1 if the inner gas disk has a slightly smaller inclination angle compared with the outer one. Including subgrid physics such as star formation and stellar feedback has minor effects on the shock amplitude, and does not change the shock position significantly. If the inner gas disk is allowed to follow a varying inclination similar to the H i and ionized gas observations, the gas models with a pattern speed of 38 km s−1 kpc−1, which is consistent with stellar-dynamical models, can match both the shock features and the central gas features.

<div> 巨型恒星系合并、BOSS1244、红移2.24、哈勃空间望远镜、星系形成

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章报道了BOSS1244的两个巨型恒星系BOSS1244-QG1和BOSS1244-QG2，它们位于红移2.244和2.242处，且间隔约70kpc。这显示它们可能在合并形成质量类似于本地宇宙最质量的BCG。研究还发现在BOSS1244范围内，星系的星形成活跃度随密度增加而减少，这表明BCG和它们的前体的星形成可能受到环境相关过程的影响。这拓宽了我们对附近宇宙中成熟星系团和BCG共同演化的认识。 <div>
We report the detection of a pair of massive quiescent galaxies likely in the process of merging at the center of the spectroscopically confirmed, extremely massive protocluster BOSS1244 at z = 2.24 ± 0.02. These galaxies, BOSS1244-QG1 and BOSS1244-QG2, were detected with Hubble Space Telescope grism slitless spectroscopic observations. These two quiescent galaxies are among the brightest member galaxies, with z = 2.223–2.255 in BOSS1244, and reside at redshifts z = 2.244 and z = 2.242, with a half-light radius of 6.76 ± 0.50 kpc and 2.72 ± 0.16 kpc, respectively. BOSS1244-QG1 and BOSS1244-QG2 are separated by a projected distance of about 70 physical kpc, implying that the two galaxies likely merge to form a massive brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) with size and mass similar to the most massive BCGs in the local Universe. We thus infer that BCG formation through dry major mergers may happen earlier than the full assembly of a cluster core, which broadens our previous understanding of the coevolution of mature galaxy clusters and BCGs in the nearby Universe. Moreover, we find a strong density–star formation relation over a scale of ∼18 comoving Mpc in BOSS1244, i.e., star formation activity decreases as density increases, implying that the quenching of star formation in BCGs and their progenitors is likely governed by environment-related processes before the virialization of the cluster core.

总结: 
这篇文章主要研究了在磁化湍流分子云核中的非对称原恒星流的形成和早期演化。他们发现在低质量原恒星系统中，即使只有一个，也会形成单极流。单极流是在磁场较弱的云核中形成的，而比例参数μ为8和16。同时他们还发现了原恒星火箭效应，类似于火箭的发射和推进。单极流将原恒星系统从中心密集区域抛射到云核的外部区域，并且由于其抛射产生的动压抑制了额外新的流的驱动。相反，弯曲的双极流是在比例参数μ为4的磁化云核中形成的。父云核的磁场与湍动能的比例可能在形成非对称原恒星流中发挥关键作用。 <div>
Observed protostellar outflows exhibit a variety of asymmetrical features, including remarkable unipolar outflows and bending outflows. Revealing the formation and early evolution of such asymmetrical protostellar outflows, especially the unipolar outflows, is essential for a better understanding of the star and planet formation because they can dramatically change the mass accretion and angular momentum transport to the protostars and protoplanetary disks. Here we perform three-dimensional nonideal magnetohydrodynamics simulations to investigate the formation and early evolution of the asymmetrical protostellar outflows in magnetized turbulent isolated molecular cloud cores. We find, for the first time to our knowledge, that the unipolar outflow forms even in the single low-mass protostellar system. The results show that the unipolar outflow is driven in the weakly magnetized cloud cores with the dimensionless mass-to-flux ratios of μ = 8 and 16. Furthermore, we find the protostellar rocket effect of the unipolar outflow, which is similar to the launch and propulsion of a rocket. The unipolar outflow ejects the protostellar system from the central dense region to the outer region of the parent cloud core, and the ram pressure caused by its ejection suppresses the driving of additional new outflows. In contrast, the bending bipolar outflow is driven in the moderately magnetized cloud core with μ = 4. The ratio of the magnetic to turbulent energies of a parent cloud core may play a key role in the formation of asymmetrical protostellar outflows.

<div> 关键词: 分子气体外流, 恒星形成星系, OH吸收, [C ii]辐射, 气体动力学<br />
<br />总结: 本研究分析了通过Gravitationally Lensed Dusty Star-forming Galaxies (DSFGs) 对分子气体外流的观测数据，发现通过空间集成光谱的统计分析结果仅有一个源展现了OH吸收比[C ii]辐射更蓝移的特征，但通过通道图的信号分析发现了所有五个源中都存在OH吸收的不同动力学成分表现，这些成分可能追踪着旋转盘中的气体。研究指出了未来观测中需要改进大气吸收线的修正和更准确地测量源的连续谱的方法。 <div>
Galactic-scale outflows of molecular gas from star-forming galaxies constitute the most direct evidence for the regulation of star formation. In the early Universe (z > 4), such outflows have recently been inferred from gravitationally lensed dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) based on ubiquitous detections of OH absorption extending to more blueshifted velocities than [C ii] or CO emission in spatially integrated spectra. Because these lines are redshifted to submillimeter wavelengths, such measurements require careful corrections for atmospheric absorption lines, and a proper accounting of sometimes large variations in measurement uncertainties over these lines. Taking these factors into consideration, we reanalyze OH and [C ii] data taken with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array for five sources where such data are available, of which four were categorised as exhibiting outflows. Based on their spatially integrated spectra alone, we find statistically significant (≥3σ) OH absorption more blueshifted than [C ii] emission in only one source. By contrast, searching channel maps for signals diluted below the detection threshold in spatially integrated spectra, we find evidence for a separate kinematic component in OH absorption in all five sources in the form of (i) more blueshifted OH absorption than [C ii] emission and/or (ii) a component in OH absorption exhibiting a different spatio-kinematic pattern than in [C ii] emission, the latter presumably tracing gas in a rotating disk. Providing a more complete and accurate assessment of molecular outflows in gravitationally lensed DSFGs, we suggest methods to assess the precision of corrections for atmospheric absorption better and to measure the source continuum in future observations more accurately.

We report timing and spectral studies of the high-mass X-ray binary 4U 1700-37 using Insight-HXMT observations carried out in 2020 during its out-of-eclipse state. We found significant variations in flux on a timescale of kilo-seconds, while the hardness (count rate ratio between 10–30 keV and 2–10 keV) remains relatively stable. No evident pulsations were found over a frequency range of 10−3–2000 Hz. During the spectral analysis, for the first time, we took the configuration of different Insight-HXMT detectors’ orientations into account, which allows us to obtain reliable results even if stable contamination exists in the field of view. We found that the spectrum could be well described by some phenomenological models that are commonly used in accreting pulsars (e.g., a power law with a high energy cutoff) in the energy range of 2–100 keV. We found hints of cyclotron absorption features around ∼16 keV or/and ∼50 keV.

Measuring the mass–radius relation of individual white dwarfs is an empirically challenging task that has been performed for only a few dozen stars. We measure the white dwarf mass–radius relation using the gravitational redshifts and radii of 135 white dwarfs in wide binaries with main-sequence companions. We obtain the radial velocities of these systems using the main-sequence companion, and subtract these Doppler redshifts from the white dwarfs’ apparent motions, isolating their gravitational redshifts. We use Gaia data to calculate the surface temperatures and radii of these white dwarfs, thereby deriving an empirical gravitational redshift–radius relation. This work demonstrates the utility of low-resolution Galactic surveys to measure the white dwarf equation of state. Our results are consistent with theoretical models, and represent the largest sample of individual white dwarf gravitational redshift measurements to date.

<br /><br />总结: 本文报告了IXPE对BL Lac型类星体1ES 1959+650的X射线偏振观测结果。在不同时间段的观测中，得出了不同的偏振度数据，同时结合光学偏振度的测量结果，对结果进行了讨论，并提出了可能的解释和物理机制。 <div>
Observations of linear polarization in the 2–8 keV energy range with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) explore the magnetic field geometry and dynamics of the regions generating nonthermal radiation in relativistic jets of blazars. These jets, particularly in blazars whose spectral energy distribution peaks at X-ray energies, emit X-rays via synchrotron radiation from high-energy particles within the jet. IXPE observations of the X-ray-selected BL Lac–type blazar 1ES 1959+650 on 2022 May 3–4 showed a significant linear polarization degree of Πx = 8.0% ± 2.3% at an electric-vector position angle ψx = 123° ± 8°. However, on 2022 June 9–12, only an upper limit of Πx ≤ 5.1% could be derived (at the 99% confidence level). The degree of optical polarization at that time, ΠO ∼ 5%, is comparable to the X-ray measurement. We investigate possible scenarios for these findings, including temporal and geometrical depolarization effects. Unlike some other X-ray-selected BL Lac objects, there is no significant chromatic dependence of the measured polarization in 1ES 1959+650, and its low X-ray polarization may be attributed to turbulence in the jet flow with dynamical timescales shorter than 1 day.

The nature of energy generation, transport, and effective dissipation responsible for maintaining a hot solar upper atmosphere is still elusive. The Poynting flux is a vital parameter for describing the direction and magnitude of the energy flow, which is mainly used in solar physics for estimating the upward energy generated by photospheric plasma motion. This study presents a pioneering 3D mapping of the magnetic energy transport within a numerically simulated solar atmosphere. By calculating the Finite Time Lyapunov Exponent of the energy velocity, defined as the ratio of the Poynting flux to the magnetic energy density, we precisely identify the sources and destinations of the magnetic energy flow throughout the solar atmosphere. This energy mapping reveals the presence of transport barriers in the lower atmosphere, restricting the amount of magnetic energy from the photosphere reaching the chromosphere and corona. Interacting kinematic and magnetic vortices create energy channels, breaking through these barriers and allowing three times more energy input from photospheric motions to reach the upper atmosphere than before the vortices formed. The vortex system also substantially alters the energy mapping, acting as a source and deposition of energy, leading to localized energy concentration. Furthermore, our results show that the energy is transported following a vortical motion: the Poynting flux vortex. In regions where these vortices coexist, they favor conditions for energy dissipation through ohmic and viscous heating, since they naturally create large gradients in the magnetic and velocity fields over small spatial scales. Hence, the vortex system promotes local plasma heating, leading to temperatures around a million Kelvins.

The investigation of mechanisms responsible for the heating of cold solar wind electrons around the Earth’s bow shock is an important problem in heliospheric plasma physics because such heating is vitally required to run the shock drift acceleration at the bow shock. The prospective mechanism for electron heating is magnetic pumping, which considers electron adiabatic (compressional) heating by ultralow-frequency waves and simultaneous scattering by high-frequency fluctuations. Existing models of magnetic pumping have operated with external sources of such fluctuations. In this study, we generalize these models by introducing the self-consistent electron scattering by whistler-mode waves generated due to the anisotropic electron heating process. We consider an electron population captured within a magnetic trap created by ultralow-frequency waves. Periodical adiabatic heating and cooling of this population drives the generation of whistler-mode waves scattering electrons in the pitch-angle space. The combination of adiabatic heating and whistler-driven scattering provides electron acceleration and the formation of a suprathermal electron population that can further participate in the shock drift acceleration.

总结: 
本文研究了宇宙中的星系结构和环境对星系停止形成新恒星的影响。在低密度环境中，发现了一个特征的表面密度Σ1 kpc，超过这个密度会触发星系停止形成新恒星，而这一现象几乎不受质量的影响。在高密度环境中，对红移高于1的星系和低密度环境中的星系几乎没有区别，但在红移小于1时，低质量星系的停止形成新恒星现象与质量的关联性增强，这是由于更强烈的环境影响。另外，发现停止形成新恒星的现象在红移较低时显示出强烈的演化，可能是由于在高红移时星系的暗物质含量和气体含量更高，因此需要更强的黑洞能量来停止新恒星的形成。同时，在较低红移时，角动量的抑制效果也更加显著，这与来自活动星系核的物质反馈效应相辅相成。 <div>
In a previous work, we investigated the structural and environmental dependence on quenching in the nearby universe. In this work, we extend our investigations to higher redshifts by combining galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and The FourStar Galaxy Evolution surveys. In low density, we find a characteristic Σ1 kpc above which the quenching is initiated as indicated by their population-averaged color. shows only a weak mass dependency at all redshifts, which suggests that the internal quenching process is more related to the physics that acts in the central region of galaxies. In high density, for galaxies at z > 1 is almost indistinguishable from their low-density counterparts. At z < 1, for low-mass galaxies becomes progressively strongly mass dependent, which is due to the increasingly stronger environmental effects at lower redshifts. in low density shows strong redshift evolution with ∼1 dex decrement from z = 2.5–0. It is likely that at a given stellar mass, the host halo is on average more massive and gas-rich at higher redshifts; hence, a higher level of integrated energy from a more massive black hole (BH) is required to quench. As the halo evolves from the cold to hot accretion phase at lower redshifts, the gas is shock-heated and becomes more vulnerable to the feedback processes from active galactic nucleus as predicted by theory. Meanwhile, angular momentum quenching also becomes more effective at low redshifts, which complements a lower level of integrated energy from the BH to quench.

IGR J17091–3624在NICER/NuSTAR时代首次爆发，数据显示其从硬态到中间态再转变为软态，出现了两种不同类别的心跳变化，同时伴随着光谱特征的变化。在软态时，只有伴随着心跳变化才能检测到高度电离的铁吸收线。这一发现表明IGR J17091–3624可以被视为GRS 1915+105和“正常” BHXBs之间的桥梁，因为它在传统和奇特的BHXB行为之间变换。文章讨论了吸收物质和奇特变化的物理性质。 <br /><br />总结: 黑洞X射线双星IGR J17091–3624显示出了在软态时伴随着奇特变化的高度电离的铁吸收线，这表明它可能是GRS 1915+105和“正常” BHXBs之间的过渡形态。 <div>
While the standard X-ray variability of black hole X-ray binaries (BHXBs) is stochastic and noisy, there are two known BHXBs that exhibit exotic “heartbeat”-like variability in their lightcurves: GRS 1915+105 and IGR J17091–3624. In 2022, IGR J17091–3624 went into outburst for the first time in the NICER/NuSTAR era. These exquisite data allow us to simultaneously track the exotic variability and the corresponding spectral features with unprecedented detail. We find that as in typical BHXBs, the outburst began in the hard state, then continued in the intermediate state, but then transitioned to an exotic soft state, where we identify two types of heartbeat-like variability (Class V and a new Class X). The flux energy spectra show a broad iron emission line due to relativistic reflection when there is no exotic variability, and absorption features from highly ionized iron when the source exhibits exotic variability. Whether absorption lines from highly ionized iron are detected in IGR J17091–3624 is not determined by the spectral state alone, but rather is determined by the presence of exotic variability; in a soft spectral state, absorption lines are only detected along with exotic variability. Our finding indicates that IGR J17091–3624 can be seen as a bridge between the most peculiar BHXB GRS 1915+105 and “normal” BHXBs, because it alternates between the conventional and exotic behaviors of BHXBs. We discuss the physical nature of the absorbing material and exotic variability in light of this new legacy data set.

<div> RS CVn-type stars, CMEs, II Pegasi, flares, spectroscopic observation

RS CVn型星，日冕质量抛射（CMEs），II Pegasi，耀斑，分光观测。该研究报告了使用高分辨率光谱观测捕获了II Pegasi（II Peg）上可能存在CME或色球凝结的情况。观测期间检测到两次耀斑，耀斑的能量下限分别为1033 erg和1034 erg。通过平均光谱相减，Hα残留光谱在耀斑期间表现出红移不对称性，而在第二次耀斑期间观察到了远红移的额外发射组分，其大速度显示了可能是一个日珥喷发事件。CME的质量估计为0.83–1.48 × 1020 g，动能为0.76–1.15 × 1035 erg，不足够与从太阳事件外推的动能相媲美。最后，在没有耀斑发生时，通过合成光谱相减得到了残留的Hα轮廓，其中有一个蓝移宽成分与Hα活跃特征相关。 <div>
Stellar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) have recently attracted much attention for their impacts on stellar evolution and surrounding exoplanets. RS CVn-type stars could produce large flares, and therefore may have frequent CMEs. Here we report the capture of a possible CME or chromospheric condensation on the RS CVn-type star II Pegasi (II Peg) using high-resolution spectroscopic observation. Two flares were detected during the observation, and the low limits of the flare energies are of the order of 1033 erg and 1034 erg, respectively. Using mean spectrum subtraction, the Hα residual shows red asymmetry during the flares, and the redshifted broad emission components are probably caused by chromospheric condensation or coronal rain. Moreover, a far redshifted extra emission component with a high bulk velocity of 429 km s−1 was observed during the second flare and is probably due to a prominence eruption. The velocity greatly exceeds the star’s escape velocity, which means that this eruption can develop into a CME. The CME mass is estimated to be 0.83–1.48 × 1020 g, which is slightly larger than the value expected from solar flare-CME extrapolation. The kinetic energy of CME, derived to be 0.76–1.15 × 1035 erg, is less than the kinetic energy extrapolated from solar events. Additionally, we could not completely rule out the possibility of chromospheric condensation resulting in the far redshifted extra emission. Finally, there is a blueshifted broad component in the subtracted Hα profile derived using synthesized spectral subtraction when no flare happened, and its behavior is associated with the Hα activity features.

<br /><br />总结: 本研究利用安装在大毫米望远镜上的2mm接收器系统B4R获取了奥赖恩KL区域DCN（J = 2 − 1）和DCO+（J = 2 − 1）线的排放图。在奥赖恩KL热核位置发现DCN排放峰值，但未检测到DCO+排放。而DCO+排放则在热核的西侧有增强，这个区域受到Trapezium星团中OB大质量恒星UV辐射的很好的遮蔽。研究还推导了三个代表性位置的DCN/DCO+丰度比值，发现VLSR约为7.5–8.7 km s−1的气体组分丰度比较低，约为4–6，而VLSR约为9.2–11.6 km s−1的气体组分丰度比较高，约为22–30。结合化学模型发现，观察到的DCN/DCO+丰度比差异可以通过不同密度来解释。 <div>
We present emission maps ( scale, corresponding to 0.18 pc) of the DCN (J = 2 − 1) and DCO+ (J = 2 − 1) lines in the 2 mm band toward the Orion KL region obtained with the 2 mm receiver system named B4R installed on the Large Millimeter Telescope. The DCN emission shows a peak at the Orion KL hot core position, whereas no DCO+ emission has been detected there. The DCO+ emission shows enhancement at the west side of the hot core, which is well shielded from the UV radiation from OB massive stars in the Trapezium cluster. We have derived the abundance ratio of DCN/DCO+ at three representative positions where both species have been detected. The gas components with VLSR ≈ 7.5–8.7 km s−1 are associated with low abundance ratios of ∼4–6, whereas much higher abundance ratios (∼22–30) are derived for the gas components with VLSR ≈ 9.2–11.6 km s−1. We have compared the observed abundance ratio to our chemical models and found that the observed differences in the DCN/DCO+ abundance ratios are explained by different densities.

<title>Deep Chandra Observations of A2495: A Possible Sloshing-regulated Feedback Cycle in a Triple-offset Galaxy Cluster</title>

<div> 关键词: A2495, Chandra observations, ICM, BCG, AGN feedback

总结: 
A2495是一个研究对象，通过深入的Chandra观测发现了ICM、BCG和Hα发光气体之间的偏移。新的数据确认了X射线发射峰值距离BCG约6.2 kpc，距离Hα发射峰值约3.9 kpc。研究发现了ICM中两代X射线空腔，由中央射电星系活动引起。AGN的能量足以抵消ICM冷却的辐射损失，表明A2495仍然具有有效的反馈循环。偏移很可能是由ICM的搅动引起的，这得到了螺旋结构和在距离中心东部约58 kpc处可能存在的冷锋的支持。最后，研究发现两代X射线空腔之间的喷发间隔与动态搅动的时间尺度相当，因此推测搅动可能会调节A2495中AGN反馈的时间尺度。 <div>
We present the analysis of new, deep Chandra observations (130 ks) of the galaxy cluster A2495. This object is known for the presence of a triple offset between the peaks of the intracluster medium (ICM), the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), and the warm gas glowing in Hα line. The new Chandra data confirm that the X-ray emission peak is located at a distance of ∼6.2 kpc from the BCG, and at ∼3.9 kpc from the Hα emission peak. Moreover, we identify two generations of X-ray cavities in the ICM, likely inflated by the central radio galaxy activity. Through a detailed morphological and spectral analysis, we determine that the power of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) outbursts (Pcav = 4.7 ± 1.3 × 1043 erg s−1) is enough to counterbalance the radiative losses from ICM cooling (Lcool = 5.7 ± 0.1 × 1043 erg s−1). This indicates that, despite a fragmented cooling core, A2495 still harbors an effective feedback cycle. We argue that the offsets are most likely caused by sloshing of the ICM, supported by the presence of spiral structures and a probable cold front in the gas at ∼58 kpc east of the center. Ultimately, we find that the outburst interval between the two generations of X-ray cavities is of the order of the dynamical sloshing timescale, as already hinted from the previous Chandra snapshot. We thus speculate that sloshing may be able to regulate the timescales of AGN feedback in A2495, by periodically fueling the central AGN.

在SDSS J1531+3414星系团中，两个中心星系正在进行重大的合并，周围环绕着一条由19个年轻恒星超星团组成的链状结构。新的Chandra X射线成像揭示了迅速冷却的热（T∼106K）星团内气体，其中两个“翼”形成了一个凹凸不平的密度不连续，靠近冷核心的边缘。 LOFAR 144 MHz观测揭示了与“翼”引人注目地对齐的扩散射电发射，这表明“翼”实际上是一个巨大的X射线超空洞的开口。北部的超空洞处，GMOS探测到包围恒星超星团的温暖（T∼104K）电离气体，但与南部中心星系相比，呈现出高达+800 km s−1的红移。阿塔卡马大型毫米/亚毫米阵列探测到一个类似红移的∼1010M⊙的冷（T∼102K）分子气体储库，但它与年轻恒星相偏移约1-3千秒差距。我们提出，多相气体源自被X射线超空洞卷入的低熵气体，将年轻恒星和分子气体之间的偏移归因于星系团内湍流运动，并建议潮汐相互作用刺激了“串珠状”星形成形态。<br /><br />总结: 在SDSS J1531+3414星系团中发现了两个中心星系的重大合并以及周围的年轻星团链结构，Chandra X射线成像揭示了迅速冷却的热星团内气体和超空洞，LOFAR观测揭示了与超空洞对齐的扩散射电发射，GMOS和阿塔卡马大型毫米/亚毫米阵列观测也揭示了一系列相关现象，这些发现为研究合并、AGN反馈和星形成的相互作用提供了重要实验室。 <div>
With two central galaxies engaged in a major merger and a remarkable chain of 19 young stellar superclusters wound around them in projection, the galaxy cluster SDSS J1531+3414 (z = 0.335) offers an excellent laboratory to study the interplay between mergers, active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback, and star formation. New Chandra X-ray imaging reveals rapidly cooling hot (T ∼ 106 K) intracluster gas, with two “wings” forming a concave density discontinuity near the edge of the cool core. LOFAR 144 MHz observations uncover diffuse radio emission strikingly aligned with the “wings,” suggesting that the “wings” are actually the opening to a giant X-ray supercavity. The steep radio emission is likely an ancient relic of one of the most energetic AGN outbursts observed, with 4pV > 1061 erg. To the north of the supercavity, GMOS detects warm (T ∼ 104 K) ionized gas that enshrouds the stellar superclusters but is redshifted up to +800 km s−1 with respect to the southern central galaxy. The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array detects a similarly redshifted ∼1010M⊙ reservoir of cold (T ∼ 102 K) molecular gas, but it is offset from the young stars by ∼1–3 kpc. We propose that the multiphase gas originated from low-entropy gas entrained by the X-ray supercavity, attribute the offset between the young stars and the molecular gas to turbulent intracluster gas motions, and suggest that tidal interactions stimulated the “beads-on-a-string” star formation morphology.

Multi-messenger astrophysics has produced a wealth of data with much more to come in the future. This enormous data set will reveal new insights into the physics of core-collapse supernovae, neutron star mergers, and many other objects where it is actually possible, if not probable, that new physics is in operation. To tease out different possibilities, we will need to analyze signals from photons, neutrinos, gravitational waves, and chemical elements. This task is made all the more difficult when it is necessary to evolve the neutrino component of the radiation field and associated quantum-mechanical property of flavor in order to model the astrophysical system of interest—a numerical challenge that has not been addressed to this day. In this work, we take a step in this direction by adopting the technique of angular-integrated moments with a truncated tower of dynamical equations and a closure, convolving the flavor-transformation with spatial transport to evolve the neutrino radiation quantum field. We show that moments capture the dynamical features of fast flavor instabilities in a variety of systems, although our technique is by no means a universal blueprint for solving fast flavor transformation. To evaluate the effectiveness of our moment results, we compare to a more precise particle-in-cell method. Based on our results, we propose areas for improvement and application to complementary techniques in the future.

<div> 高红移星系，JWST观测，光度选择，尺寸-星团质量关系，星系结构演化。<br /><br />总结:
本研究利用JWST的观测数据，在高红移星系中鉴定了341个星系，并在文献中找到109个星系的光谱红移测量。研究发现，这些高红移星系的UV大小-恒星质量关系与z∼3的星系相似，但整体尺寸要小约0.7 dex。此外，发现这些星系的平均大小演化速率比已有文献中的推测值更缓慢。一部分星系呈现出较小的尺寸，但具有极高的星团形成表面密度，这与当地星系样本中的特征不同。此外，观测表明这些星系中没有超大质量黑洞的持续吸积。最后发现，这些高红移星系的UV和光学尺寸相当。这些结果表明早期星系可能是从内向外构建结构，尚未表现出低红移时期明显的颜色梯度。 <div>
We present a comprehensive search and analysis of high-redshift galaxies in a suite of nine public JWST extragalactic fields taken in Cycle 1, covering a total effective search area of . Through conservative (8σ) photometric selection, we identify 341 galaxies at 5 < z < 14, with 109 having spectroscopic redshift measurements from the literature, including recent JWST NIRSpec observations. Our regression analysis reveals that the rest-frame UV size–stellar mass relation follows , similar to that of star-forming galaxies at z ∼ 3, but scaled down in size by ∼0.7 dex. We find a much slower rate for the average size evolution over the redshift range, Reff ∝ (1 + z)−0.4±0.2, than that derived in the literature. A fraction (∼13%) of our sample galaxies are marginally resolved even in the NIRCam imaging (≲100 pc), located at ≳1.5σ below the derived size–mass slope. These compact sources exhibit a high star formation surface density ΣSFR > 10 M⊙ yr−1 kpc−2, a range in which only <0.01% of the local star-forming galaxy sample is found. For those with available NIRSpec data, no evidence of ongoing supermassive black hole accretion is observed. A potential explanation for the observed high [O iii]-to-Hβ ratios could be high shock velocities, likely originating within intense star-forming regions characterized by high ΣSFR. Lastly, we find that the rest-frame UV and optical sizes of our sample are comparable. Our results are consistent with these early galaxies building up their structures inside out and being yet to exhibit the strong color gradient seen at lower redshift.

EVQs是极端变异类星系核，研究了它们的光谱特性，发现了“亮时更蓝”的趋势，表明EVQs的光谱变化与普通类星体和活动星系核相一致。此外，在EVQs的Mg ii和C iv谱线中检测到了明显的内在Baldwin效应（即在各个活跃星系核中，在较高的连续光流下，线等效宽度较小）。然而，在宽Hβ线上并未发现系统的内在Baldwin效应，可能是由于较长波长处强烈的宿主污染。此外，通过比较EVQs的iBeff斜率与文献中的变样类星体，发现变样类星体很可能是EVQs的一个偏倚子群，而不是一个截然不同的星系核种群。最后，发现Hβ、Mg ii和C iv的宽线呼吸没有显著的变化，表明类星体的宽线呼吸可能会在较长时间尺度（约3000天）内消失。<br /><br />总结:EVQs的光谱显示出“亮时更蓝”的趋势，同时在Mg ii和C iv谱线中检测到了内在的Baldwin效应。变样类星体很可能是EVQs的一个偏斜子群。此外，在较长时间尺度内，类星体的宽线呼吸可能会消失。 <div>
We previously built a sample of 14,012 extremely variable quasars (EVQs) based on Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Pan-STARRS1 photometric observations. In this work we present the spectral fitting to their SDSS spectra and study the spectral variation in 1259 EVQs with multiepoch SDSS spectra (after prudently excluding spectra with potentially unreliable spectroscopic photometry). We find a clear “bluer-when-brighter” trend in EVQs, consistent with previous findings of normal quasars and active galactic nuclei. We detect significant intrinsic Baldwin effect (iBeff, i.e., smaller line equivalent width at higher continuum flux in individual active galactic nuclei) in the broad Mg ii and C iv lines of EVQs. Meanwhile, no systematical iBeff is found for the broad Hβ line, which could be attributed to strong host contamination at longer wavelengths. Remarkably, by comparing the iBeff slope of EVQs with archived changing-look quasars, we show that the changing-look quasars identified in the literature are most likely a biased (due to its definition) subpopulation of EVQs, rather than a distinct population of quasars. We also found no significant broad line breathing of Hβ, Mg ii, or C iv, suggesting the broad line breathing in quasars may disappear at longer timescales (∼3000 days).

We present Chandra ACIS-S imaging spectroscopy results of the extended (1.″5–8″, 300–1600 pc) hard X-ray emission of NGC 5728, the host galaxy of a Compton-thick active galactic nucleus. We find spectrally and spatially resolved features in the Fe Kα complex (5.0–7.5 keV) redward and blueward of the neutral Fe line at 6.4 keV in the extended narrow-line region bicone. A simple phenomenological fit of a power law plus Gaussians gives a significance of 5.4σ and 3.7σ for the red and blue wings, respectively. Fits to a suite of physically consistent models confirm a significance of ≥3σ for the red wing. The significance of the blue wing may be diminished by the presence of rest-frame highly ionized Fe xxv and Fe xxvi lines (1.4σ–3.7σ range). A detailed investigation of the Chandra ACIS-S point-spread function and comparison with the observed morphology demonstrates that these red and blue wings are radially extended (∼5″, ∼1 kpc) along the optical bicone axis. If the wing emission is due solely to redshifted and blueshifted high-velocity neutral Fe Kα, then the implied line-of-sight velocities are +/− ∼0.1c, and their fluxes are consistent with being equal. A symmetric high-velocity outflow is then a viable explanation. This outflow has deprojected velocities ∼100 times larger than the outflows detected in optical spectroscopic studies, potentially dominating the kinetic feedback power.

We consider small-scale jetlike events that might make the solar wind, as has been suggested in recent studies. We show that the events referred to as “coronal jets” and as “jetlets” both fall on a power-law distribution that also includes large-scale eruptions and spicule-sized features; all of the jetlike events could contribute to the solar wind. Based on imaging and magnetic field data, it is plausible that many or most of these events might form by the same mechanism: Magnetic flux cancelation produces small-scale flux ropes, often containing a cool-material minifilament. This minifilament/flux rope erupts and reconnects with adjacent open coronal field, along which “plasma jets” flow and contribute to the solar wind. The erupting flux ropes can contain twist that is transferred to the open field, and these become Alfvénic pulses that form magnetic switchbacks, providing an intrinsic connection between switchbacks and the production of the solar wind.

<div> 关键词: 出流, 吸收线类型, 宿主星系, 恒星形成率, 演化阶段 <br />
总结: 该研究利用Sloan Digital Sky Survey类星体目录，使用[O II]和[Ne V]发射线的流量比作为指标，比较了显示不同出流吸收线类型的类星体的宿主星系内的恒星形成率。研究发现，LoMini-BAL类星体的恒星形成率与LoNAL类星体相当，略低于LoBAL类星体，但明显高于HiBAL类星体。此外，HiMini-BAL类星体的恒星形成率与HiNAL或非吸收线（Non-abs）类星体相似，但明显高于HiBAL类星体。研究结果表明，不同的吸收线类型可能反映了类星体的演化阶段，提出了一个综合的演化顺序：LoBAL逐渐演变成LoMini-BAL/LoNAL，然后进化成HiBAL，最终形成HiMini-BAL/HiNAL/Non-abs。与此同时，在类星体的宿主星系中，恒星形成率在LoNAL阶段朝向结束时明显下降，在HiMini-BAL阶段之前再次恢复。 <div>
It is commonly accepted that outflows from the central regions of quasars play a substantial role in regulating the global properties of the host galaxy. These outflows are typically detected through blueshifted absorption lines. However, the question remains whether outflows observed with different absorption line types indeed reflect the same environmental or evolutionary stage of the host galaxy. In this study, we use the Sloan Digital Sky Survey quasar catalog and employ the flux ratio of [O II] and [Ne V] emission lines as indicators to compare star formation rates (SFRs) within host galaxies of quasars exhibiting various outflow absorption line types: low-ionization broad absorption line (LoBAL), low-ionization Mini-BAL (LoMini-BAL), low-ionization narrow absorption line (LoNAL), high-ionization broad absorption line (HiBAL), high-ionization Mini-BAL (HiMini-BAL), and high-ionization narrow absorption line (HiNAL). Our findings indicate that the SFR of LoMini-BAL quasars is comparable to that of LoNAL quasars, somewhat less than that of LoBAL quasars, but markedly greater than that of HiBAL quasars. Furthermore, the SFR of HiMini-BAL quasars mirrors that of HiNAL or Non-abs (no associated absorption lines) quasars, but is significantly higher than that of HiBAL quasars. If we consider that differing absorption line types are indicative of the quasar evolution stage, our results propose an inclusive evolution sequence: LoBALs evolve into LoMini-BALs/LoNALs, then progress to HiBALs, and ultimately morph into HiMini-BALs/HiNALs/Non-abs. Concomitantly, the SFR within the host galaxies of quasars appears to decline noticeably nearing the LoNAL phase’s end and rejuvenates before the HiMini-BAL phase.

JWST观测发现了在高红移处存在大量亮度较高的星系，这对流行的星系形成模型可能构成严峻挑战。研究人员使用了蓝色倾斜功率谱（BTPS）模型，进行了宇宙学N体模拟，推导出暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质等暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质。 BTPS模型复现了z=7-9处观测到的星团质量密度，从而缓解了星系形成理论和最近JWST观测之间的紧张关系。当前宇宙的大尺度结构在小尺度功率谱的修改下基本上没有受到影响。通过改变小尺度功率谱的斜率进行了系统性研究，并从一系列高红移星系观测中推导出BTPS模型的限制。 <br /><br />总结: JWST观测发现高红移星系丰富，挑战了星系形成模型；使用BTPS模型进行了N体模拟，复现了高红移星系的质量密度；BTPS模型缓解了星系形成理论与JWST观测之间的紧张关系；大尺度结构基本不受小尺度功率谱修改影响；通过系统研究得出BTPS模型的观测限制。 <div>
Recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) discovered unexpectedly abundant luminous galaxies at high redshift, posing possibly a severe challenge to popular galaxy formation models. We study early structure formation in a cosmological model with a blue, tilted power spectrum (BTPS) given by with ms > 1 at small length scales. We run a set of cosmological N-body simulations and derive the abundance of dark matter halos and galaxies under simplified assumptions on star formation efficiency. The enhanced small-scale power allows rapid nonlinear structure formation at z > 7, and galaxies with stellar mass exceeding 1010M⊙ can be formed by z = 9. Because of frequent mergers, the structure of galaxies and galaxy groups appears clumpy. The BTPS model reproduces the observed stellar mass density at z = 7–9, and thus eases the claimed tension between galaxy formation theory and recent JWST observations. The large-scale structure of the present-day Universe is largely unaffected by the modification of the small-scale power spectrum. We conduct a systematic study by varying the slope of the small-scale power spectrum to derive constraints on the BTPS model from a set of observations of high-redshift galaxies.

<div> CMB lensing, ACT DR6, power spectrum, constraints, structure growth
总结:
本文介绍了关于宇宙微波背景(CMB)透镜效应的新测量结果，使用了Atacama宇宙学望远镜（ACT）数据发布6（DR6）的CMB数据集。利用新的方法得出了CMB透镜功率谱的振幅，提供了对宇宙结构增长幅度的约束。该研究结果与Planck或ACT DR4 + WMAP CMB功率谱测量的ΛCDM模型约束完全一致，表明了在红移z∼0.5–5范围内并无宇宙结构振幅抑制的证据。通过分析大量的空测、一致性检验以及系统误差评估，确保了结果的可靠性和稳健性。同时，该测量结果还提供了关于大尺度结构增长的独立信息，不依赖于Planck或星系调查数据。 <div>
We present new measurements of cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing over 9400 deg2 of the sky. These lensing measurements are derived from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 6 (DR6) CMB data set, which consists of five seasons of ACT CMB temperature and polarization observations. We determine the amplitude of the CMB lensing power spectrum at 2.3% precision (43σ significance) using a novel pipeline that minimizes sensitivity to foregrounds and to noise properties. To ensure that our results are robust, we analyze an extensive set of null tests, consistency tests, and systematic error estimates and employ a blinded analysis framework. Our CMB lensing power spectrum measurement provides constraints on the amplitude of cosmic structure that do not depend on Planck or galaxy survey data, thus giving independent information about large-scale structure growth and potential tensions in structure measurements. The baseline spectrum is well fit by a lensing amplitude of Alens = 1.013 ± 0.023 relative to the Planck 2018 CMB power spectra best-fit ΛCDM model and Alens = 1.005 ± 0.023 relative to the ACT DR4 + WMAP best-fit model. From our lensing power spectrum measurement, we derive constraints on the parameter combination of from ACT DR6 CMB lensing alone and when combining ACT DR6 and Planck NPIPE CMB lensing power spectra. These results are in excellent agreement with ΛCDM model constraints from Planck or ACT DR4 + WMAP CMB power spectrum measurements. Our lensing measurements from redshifts z ∼ 0.5–5 are thus fully consistent with ΛCDM structure growth predictions based on CMB anisotropies probing primarily z ∼ 1100. We find no evidence for a suppression of the amplitude of cosmic structure at low redshifts.

<div> CMB, gravitational lensing, cosmological constraints, ΛCDM, neutrino<br />
总结:<br />
本研究利用通过ACT进行的CMB测量重建了一个重力透镜质量图，涵盖了9400平方度。结合声学振荡和宇宙核合成的测量结果，得出了聚集幅度σ8 = 0.819 ± 0.015和哈勃常数H0 = (68.3 ± 1.1) km s−1 Mpc−1。这些测量结果与Planck CMB镜头的联合约束一致。研究还对KiDS、DES和HSC的星系调查结果进行了重新评估，发现S8值均低于ACT+Planck镜头的水平。此外，研究还限制了中微子质量∑mν < 0.13 eV（95%置信水平）。总的来说，研究结果独立证实了宇宙是平坦的，符合广义相对论，并且与ΛCDM模型相当一致，为未来地基CMB调查中的中微子物理铺平了一条充满希望的道路。 <div>
We present cosmological constraints from a gravitational lensing mass map covering 9400 deg2 reconstructed from measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) made by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) from 2017 to 2021. In combination with measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations and big bang nucleosynthesis, we obtain the clustering amplitude σ8 = 0.819 ± 0.015 at 1.8% precision, , and the Hubble constant H0 = (68.3 ± 1.1) km s−1 Mpc−1 at 1.6% precision. A joint constraint with Planck CMB lensing yields σ8 = 0.812 ± 0.013, , and H0 = (68.1 ± 1.0) km s−1 Mpc−1. These measurements agree with ΛCDM extrapolations from the CMB anisotropies measured by Planck. We revisit constraints from the KiDS, DES, and HSC galaxy surveys with a uniform set of assumptions and find that S8 from all three are lower than that from ACT+Planck lensing by levels ranging from 1.7σ to 2.1σ. This motivates further measurements and comparison, not just between the CMB anisotropies and galaxy lensing but also between CMB lensing probing z ∼ 0.5–5 on mostly linear scales and galaxy lensing at z ∼ 0.5 on smaller scales. We combine with CMB anisotropies to constrain extensions of ΛCDM, limiting neutrino masses to ∑mν < 0.13 eV (95% c.l.), for example. We describe the mass map and related data products that will enable a wide array of cross-correlation science. Our results provide independent confirmation that the universe is spatially flat, conforms with general relativity, and is described remarkably well by the ΛCDM model, while paving a promising path for neutrino physics with lensing from upcoming ground-based CMB surveys.

<title>Relativistic Jet Motion in the Radio-quiet LINER Galaxy KISSR 872</title>

We report superluminal jet motion with an apparent speed of βapp = 1.65 ± 0.57 in the radio-quiet (RQ) low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER) galaxy KISSR 872. This result comes from two-epoch phase-referenced very long baseline interferometry observations at 5 GHz. The detection of bulk relativistic motion in the jet of this extremely radio-faint active galactic nucleus (AGN), with a total 1.4 GHz flux density of 5 mJy in the 5.″4 resolution Very Large Array FIRST survey image and 1.5 mJy in the ∼5 mas resolution Very Long Baseline Array image, is the first of its kind in an RQ LINER galaxy. The presence of relativistic jets in lower accretion rate objects like KISSR 872, with an Eddington ratio of 0.04, reveals that even RQ AGN can harbor relativistic jets and provides evidence of their universality over a wide range of accretion powers.

<div> Spitzer, Messier 58, H2, AGN, jet<br />
<br />总结:<br />这篇文章讨论了在质量巨大的螺旋星系Messier 58的中心发现了高亮度、温暖的H2盘，并且还有一个具有辐射强活动的活动星系核。研究显示星系内部受到了辐射喷流包覆的冲击，尤其在内部2.6千秒差距的范围内。通过各种成像和光谱显示，大部分分子气体在原地受到了冲击，形成了盘状的灰尘分子气体通道朝向星系核心。碳氧化合物和电离气体的动力学表现十分混乱，速度分散达到300km/s。这种动能和湍流的耗散很可能是由辐射喷流驱动的外流注入星际介质所导致的，并且可能是观测到的分子和电离气体的排放的动力来源。尽管存在辐射喷流活动，内部盘中多环芳烃（PAH）的含量和组成看起来是正常的。PAH的比值表明这些物质是受到了来自星神的间星辐射场的激发，而不是星的形成活动的贡献。喷流冲击的H2现象可能显著减少恒星形成，并帮助调节星系内部盘和超大质量黑洞的质量，在这个通常来说是正常的螺旋星系中发现了类似强烈的H2排放。 <div>
Spitzer spectral maps reveal a disk of highly luminous, warm (>150 K) H2 in the center of the massive spiral galaxy Messier 58, which hosts a radio-loud active galactic nucleus (AGN). The inner 2.6 kpc of the galaxy appears to be overrun by shocks from the radio jet cocoon. Gemini NIRI imaging of the H2 1–0 S(1) emission line, Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array CO 2–1, and Hubble Space Telescope multiband imagery indicate that much of the molecular gas is shocked in situ, corresponding to lanes of dusty molecular gas that spiral toward the galactic nucleus. The CO 2–1 and ionized gas kinematics are highly disturbed, with velocity dispersion up to 300 km s−1. Dissipation of the associated kinetic energy and turbulence, likely injected into the interstellar medium by radio-jet-driven outflows, may power the observed molecular and ionized gas emission from the inner disk. The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) fraction and composition in the inner disk appear to be normal, in spite of the jet and AGN activity. The PAH ratios are consistent with excitation by the interstellar radiation field from old stars in the bulge, with no contribution from star formation. The phenomenon of jet-shocked H2 may substantially reduce star formation and help to regulate the stellar mass of the inner disk and supermassive black hole in this otherwise normal spiral galaxy. Similarly strong H2 emission is found at the centers of several nearby spiral and lenticular galaxies with massive bulges and radio-loud AGNs.

通过使用詹姆斯·韦伯太空望远镜的近红外摄像机宽场无缝光谱仪(NIRCam WFSS)和近红外光谱仪(NIRSpec)，在宇宙演化早期释放调查中测量了155个红移大于2的星系的静止框下光学发射线比。盲目的NIRCam光栅观察包括一组未在NIRSpec掩模上观察到的具有明亮发射线的星系样本。我们通过与较低红移的SDSS、CLEAR和MOSDEF样本进行比较，研究了Hα、[O III]/Hβ和[Ne III]/[O II]发射线随红移的变化。我们发现[O III]/Hβ与红移存在显著(>3σ)的相关性，而[Ne III]/[O II]与红移有边缘(2σ)的相关性。我们将[O III]/Hβ和[Ne III]/[O II]与恒星质量和Hβ SFR进行比较。我们发现这两种发射线比与Hβ SFR呈相关，并与红移0<9的恒星质量呈反相关。与MAPPINGS V模型的比较表明，这些趋势与低金属丰度和高电离在低质量和高SFR的星系一致。我们还与IllustrisTNG预测进行了比较，并发现它们有效地描述了我们样本中观察到的最高[O III]/Hβ比值，而不需要引入具有显著冲击电离组分的MAPPINGS模型。 <br /><br />总结: 该研究利用詹姆斯·韦伯太空望远镜的不同设备，测量了高红移星系的光学发射线比，并发现这些比值与红移、恒星质量和Hβ SFR有关。与模型的比较表明，这些趋势与低金属丰度和高电离在低质量和高SFR的星系一致，并为我们对星系的演化提供了重要线索。 <div>
We use James Webb Space Telescope Near-Infrared Camera Wide Field Slitless Spectroscopy (NIRCam WFSS) and the Near-Infrared spectrograph (NIRSpec) in the Cosmic Evolution Early Release survey to measure rest-frame optical emission-line ratios of 155 galaxies at z > 2. The blind NIRCam grism observations include a sample of galaxies with bright emission lines that were not observed on the NIRSpec masks. We study the changes of the Hα, [O III]/Hβ, and [Ne III]/[O II] emission lines in terms of redshift by comparing to lower-redshift SDSS, CLEAR, and MOSDEF samples. We find a significant (>3σ) correlation between [O III]/Hβ with redshift, while [Ne III]/[O II] has a marginal (2σ) correlation with redshift. We compare [O III]/Hβ and [Ne III]/[O II] to stellar mass and Hβ SFR. We find that both emission-line ratios have a correlation with Hβ SFR and an anticorrelation with stellar mass across the redshifts 0 < z < 9. Comparison with MAPPINGS V models indicates that these trends are consistent with lower metallicity and higher ionization in low-mass and high-SFR galaxies. We additionally compare to IllustrisTNG predictions and find that they effectively describe the highest [O III]/Hβ ratios observed in our sample, without the need to invoke MAPPINGS models with significant shock ionization components.

总结:<br />
本研究调查了太阳高次声学模式频率和表面磁活动随着多个太阳周期的时空演变，以改进我们对太阳内部和大气之间联系的理解。研究着重于高次p模式，因其能够表征太阳表面下的剪切层条件，并分析了从全球振荡网络组织获取的22年振荡频率。考虑了10.7厘米射电通量测量、太阳黑子数和局部磁活动指数作为太阳活动的代理，发现模式频率与每个活动指数之间存在强烈的相关性。进一步研究了振荡频率和磁活动代理所关联的南半球和北半球的不对称性，并发现在第23个循环的下降阶段，这两者在南半球占主导地位，而在第24个循环中，这些量在南北半球之间波动。随着太阳循环的推进，分析了不同纬度的频率变化，发现在第24个循环的最大活跃期，中纬度处的变化在南半球占主导地位，但随着循环向最低阶段推进，这些数值开始重合。第25个循环初期的模式频率被发现在南半球占主导地位，遵循磁活动的模式。分析提供了额外证据，表明振荡频率的变化是由强磁场和弱磁场共同导致的。 <div>
We investigate the spatiotemporal evolution of high-degree acoustic-mode frequencies of the Sun and surface magnetic activity over the course of multiple solar cycles, to improve our understanding of the connection between the solar interior and atmosphere. We focus on high-degree p-modes due to their ability to characterize conditions in the shear layer just below the solar surface, and analyze 22 yr of oscillation frequencies obtained from the Global Oscillation Network Group. Considering 10.7 cm radio flux measurements, the sunspot number, and the local magnetic activity index as solar-activity proxies, we find strong correlation between the mode frequencies and each activity index. We further investigate the hemispheric asymmetry associated with oscillation frequencies and magnetic activity proxies, and find that both were dominant in the southern hemisphere during the descending phase of cycle 23, while in cycle 24 these quantities fluctuated between northern and southern hemispheres. Analyzing the frequencies at different latitudes with the progression of solar cycles, we observe that the variations at midlatitudes were dominant in the southern hemisphere during the maximum-activity period of cycle 24, but the values overlap as the cycle advances toward the minimum phase. The mode frequencies at the beginning of cycle 25 are found to be dominant in the southern hemisphere following the pattern of magnetic activity. The analysis provides added evidence that the variability in oscillation frequencies is caused by both strong and weak magnetic fields.

<div> CMEs, angular width, STEREO-A, in situ measurements, magnetic cloud-like signatures
<br /><br />总结:本文利用STEREO-A的观测数据，进行了两部分研究，以限制日冕物质抛射的角宽度。研究表明，在太阳与STEREO-A或地球之间传播的21次CME中，只有4次影响了两艘航天器，且没有一次提供了清晰的磁云状特征。综合两种方法，得出1天文单位处ME的典型角宽度约为20°–30°，比常规假设的2–3倍小，符合椭球形ME的2:1椭圆截面。文章讨论了这一发现对未来多航天器任务设计和CME的连贯性的影响。 <div>
Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are large-scale eruptions with a typical radial size at 1 au of 0.21 au but their angular width in interplanetary space is still mostly unknown, especially for the magnetic ejecta (ME) part of the CME. We take advantage of STEREO-A angular separation of 20°–60° from the Sun–Earth line from 2020 October to 2022 August, and perform a two-part study to constrain the angular width of MEs in the ecliptic plane: (a) we study all CMEs that are observed remotely to propagate between the Sun–STEREO-A and the Sun–Earth lines and determine how many impact one or both spacecraft in situ, and (b) we investigate all in situ measurements at STEREO-A or at L1 of CMEs during the same time period to quantify how many are measured by the two spacecraft. A key finding is that out of 21 CMEs propagating within 30° of either spacecraft only four impacted both spacecraft and none provided clean magnetic cloud-like signatures at both spacecraft. Combining the two approaches, we conclude that the typical angular width of an ME at 1 au is ∼20°–30°, or 2–3 times less than often assumed and consistent with a 2:1 elliptical cross section of an ellipsoidal ME. We discuss the consequences of this finding for future multi-spacecraft mission designs and for the coherence of CMEs.

Accurate atomic data and plasma models are essential for interpreting the upcoming high-quality spectra from missions like XRISM and Athena. Estimating physical quantities, like temperature, abundance, turbulence, and the resonance scattering factor, is highly dependent on the underlying atomic data. We use the AtomDB tool variableapec to estimate the impact of atomic data uncertainties in Einstein A coefficients, collisional rate coefficients, and the ionization and recombination rates of H-, He-, and Li-like iron in modeling the spectrum of Perseus observed by Hitomi. The best-fit temperatures, abundances, resonance scattering factors, and turbulence parameters including atomic data uncertainties vary by approximately 17%, 35%, 30%, and 3%, respectively, from the best-fit temperatures, abundances, RS factors, and turbulence parameters estimated without atomic data uncertainties. These indicate that approximately 32%, 35%, and 25% of the best-fit temperatures, abundances, and resonance scattering factors when including uncertainties lie outside the 3σ error regions of their corresponding best-fit values computed with zero atomic data errors. Expanding the energy range to 1.8–20.0 keV shows less variability, with 26% of the abundances and 22% of the resonance scattering factors lying outside the 3σ errors of the best-fit values. We also studied correlations between physical parameters and atomic rate uncertainties to identify key atomic quantities requiring precise lab measurements. We report negative correlations between the best-fit temperatures and the z (1s2s 3S1 → 1s2) collisional rate coefficients, abundances and y (1s2p 3P1 → 1s2) collisional rate coefficients, and abundances and z collisional rate coefficients, and a positive correlation between the resonance scattering factors and the w (1s2p 1P1 → 1s2) collisional rate coefficients.

研究使用NOVA 1D流体动力学计算代码追踪氧-氖白矮星上热核逃逸的演化过程。他们先吸积太阳物质，然后切换到混合组成物。研究结果显示，氧-氖白矮星的经典新星爆发可能对铝26和锂7的产生有重要影响。此外，模拟预测了伽马射线辐射，并讨论了相关的天文现象。在所有模拟中，白矮星喷射的物质少于吸积的物质，因此预测白矮星由于经典新星爆发而增加质量。这表明氧-氖白矮星可能是促发引力坍缩事件的重要通道。<br /><br />总结: <div>
We report on studies of classical nova (CN) explosions where we follow the evolution of thermonuclear runaways (TNRs) on oxygen–neon (ONe) white dwarfs (WDs). Using NOVA, a 1D hydrodynamic computer code, we accrete solar matter until the TNR is ongoing and then switch to a mixed composition. This approach is guided by the results of multidimensional studies of TNRs in WDs, which find that sufficient mixing with WD core material occurs after the TNR is well underway, and levels of enrichment of the CNONeMg elements are reached that agree with observations of CN ejecta abundances. Because the amount of accreted material is inversely proportional to the oxygen abundance, by first accreting solar matter, the amount of accreted material is larger than in those simulations with an initially enriched composition. We vary the mass of the WD (from 0.6 M⊙ to 1.35 M⊙) and the composition of the mixed materials. Our results show large enrichments of 7Be in the ejected gases, implying that ONe CNe and CO CNe may be responsible for a significant fraction (∼100 M⊙) of the Galactic 7Li (∼1000 M⊙). The production of 22Na and 26Al in CN explosions and the γ-ray emission predicted by our simulations are discussed. The WDs in all our simulations eject less material than they accrete and we predict that the WD is growing in mass as a consequence of the CN outburst. ONe CNe, therefore, may be an important channel for accretion-induced collapse events.

总结:
本研究报告了2021年11月3日至5日太阳风暴期间，Solar Orbiter (SolO)和Wind两个太阳探测器对磁云进行了同时的原位观测。研究发现SolO和Wind测得的磁云内磁场和速度存在显著差异，表明即使是2.2°的角度差异也会对观测结果产生影响。另外，利用SolO测得的震波参数进行预测时，出现了2小时30分钟的预测误差。这些结果提示当前的太阳风暴模型分辨率可能存在问题，影响了预测能力。 <div>
Simultaneous in situ measurements of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), including both plasma and magnetic field, by two spacecraft in radial alignment have been extremely rare. Here, we report on one such CME measured by Solar Orbiter (SolO) and Wind on 2021 November 3–5, while the spacecraft were radially separated by a heliocentric distance of 0.13 au and angularly by only 2.2°. We focus on the magnetic cloud (MC) part of the CME. We find notable changes in the R and N magnetic field components and in the speed profiles inside the MC between SolO and Wind. We observe a greater speed at the spacecraft farther away from the Sun without any clear compression signatures. Since the spacecraft are close to each other and computing fast magnetosonic wave speed inside the MC, we rule out temporal evolution as the reason for the observed differences, suggesting that spatial variations over 2.2° of the MC structure are at the heart of the observed discrepancies. Moreover, using shock properties at SolO, we forecast an arrival time 2 hr 30 minutes too late for a shock that is just 5 hr 31 minutes away from Wind. Predicting the north–south component of the magnetic field at Wind from SolO measurements leads to a relative error of 55%. These results show that even angular separations as low as 2.2° (or 0.03 au in arc length) between spacecraft can have a large impact on the observed CME properties, which raises the issue of the resolutions of current CME models, potentially affecting our forecasting capabilities.

<title>Solar Tachocline Confinement by the Nonaxisymmetric Modes of a Dynamo Magnetic Field</title>

<div> 关键词: 3D numerical simulation, tachocline confinement, dynamo-generated magnetic field, solution regimes, solar tachocline confinement<br />
总结: <br />
该研究通过3D数值模拟首次实现了太阳内部的tachocline confinement，并发现了不同磁场强度下的三种解决方案。在弱场阈值中，大尺度磁场大部分是轴对称的，但无法创造一个confined tachocline。在强场阈值中，大尺度磁场大部分是非轴对称的，并创造了一个confined tachocline。在中等场阈值中，大尺度磁场在一定时间内类似于强场阈值，但间歇性地变弱，允许了强的差动旋转。无论在哪种阈值中，RZ中的极化场强度都可以很好地由皮肤深度参数解释。这些模拟结果提出了一个新的太阳tachocline confinement的图像，即通过与RZ旋转的非轴对称、非常长寿命(有效永久)的场结构来起主导作用，而不是与22年周期相关的定期反转的轴对称场。 <div>
We recently presented the first 3D numerical simulation of the solar interior for which tachocline confinement was achieved by a dynamo-generated magnetic field. In this follow-up study, we analyze the degree of confinement as the magnetic field strength changes (controlled by varying the magnetic Prandtl number) in a coupled radiative zone (RZ) and convection zone (CZ) system. We broadly find three solution regimes, corresponding to weak, medium, and strong dynamo magnetic field strengths. In the weak-field regime, the large-scale magnetic field is mostly axisymmetric with regular, periodic polarity reversals (reminiscent of the observed solar cycle) but fails to create a confined tachocline. In the strong-field regime, the large-scale field is mostly nonaxisymmetric with irregular, quasi-periodic polarity reversals and creates a confined tachocline. In the medium-field regime, the large-scale field resembles a strong-field dynamo for extended intervals but intermittently weakens to allow temporary epochs of strong differential rotation. In all regimes, the amplitude of poloidal field strength in the RZ is very well explained by skin-depth arguments, wherein the oscillating field that gives rise to the skin depth (in the medium- and strong-field cases) is a nonaxisymmetric field structure at the base of the CZ that rotates with respect to the RZ. These simulations suggest a new picture of solar tachocline confinement by the dynamo, in which nonaxisymmetric, very long-lived (effectively permanent) field structures rotating with respect to the RZ play the primary role, instead of the regularly reversing axisymmetric field associated with the 22 yr cycle.

<title>Deep Chandra Observation of the Remarkable Ionization Cones of NGC 5252</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Seyfert galaxy NGC 5252 harbors enormously extended ionization cones that have been previously detected in the optical and X-ray band, offering a unique opportunity to investigate the interaction between the central active galactic nucleus (AGN) and the surrounding gas in the AGN host galaxy. We present deep Chandra imaging spectroscopy of NGC 5252 with a total exposure time of 230 ks. The morphology in the soft X-rays shows resolved extended structure from the nucleus to a large radial distance, and for the first time we detect the outermost X-ray arc at ∼20 kpc. The X-ray cone mostly follows the direction of the optical ionization cones in the southeast and northwest directions, about 20° misaligned with the major axis of the galactic disk of NGC 5252. Fitting the spectra extracted from radial sectors with photoionization models supports that extended emission is mainly photoionized by the central AGN. We also examine the variation of the photoionization parameter along the radial extension and infer a decreasing ionizing continuum of the central engine by a factor of ∼50 over the past 64,000 yr. These findings are consistent with previous suggestions that NGC 5252 resembles a quasar relic with an M ∼ 109M⊙ supermassive black hole that went through a minor merger event and switched to a low accretion rate state.

<title>Absorption of Millimeter-band CO and CN in the Early Universe: Molecular Clouds in the Radio Galaxy B2 0902+34 at Redshift 3.4</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad198d</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad198d</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, we have detected absorption lines due to carbon monoxide, CO(J = 0 → 1), and the cyano radical, CN(N = 0 → 1), associated with radio galaxy B2 0902+34 at redshift z = 3.4. The detection of millimeter-band absorption observed 1.5 Gyr after the Big Bang facilitates studying molecular clouds down to gas masses inaccessible to emission-line observations. The CO absorption in B2 0902+34 has a peak optical depth of τ ≥ 8.6% and consists of two components, one of which has the same redshift as previously detected 21 cm absorption of neutral hydrogen (H i) gas. Each CO component traces an integrated H2 column density of ≳ 3 × 1020 cm−2. CN absorption is detected for both CO components, as well as for a blueshifted component not detected in CO, with CO/CN line ratios ranging from ≲0.4 to 2.4. We discuss the scenario that the absorption components originate from collections of small and dense molecular clouds that are embedded in a region with more diffuse gas and high turbulence, possibly within the influence of the central active galactic nucleus or a starburst region. The degree of reddening in B2 0902+34, with rest-frame color B − K ∼ 4.2, is lower than the very red colors (B − K > 6) found among other known redshifted CO absorption systems at z < 1. Nevertheless, when including the many nondetections from the literature, a potential correlation between the absorption-line strength and B − K color is evident, giving weight to the argument that the red colors of CO absorbers are due to a high dust content.

<title>Heliospheric Diffusion of Stochastic Parker Spirals in Radially Evolving Solar Wind Turbulence</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad19dd</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a stochastic field line mapping model where the interplanetary magnetic field lines are described by a density distribution function satisfying a Fokker–Planck equation that is solved numerically. Due to the spiral geometry of the nominal Parker field and to the evolving nature of solar wind turbulence, the heliospheric diffusion of the magnetic field lines is both heterogeneous and anisotropic, including a radial component. The longitudinal distributions of the magnetic field lines are shown to be close to circular Gaussian distributions, although they develop a noticeable skewness. The magnetic field lines emanating from the Sun are found to differ, on average, from the spirals predicted by Parker. Although the spirals remain close to Archimedean, they are here underwound, on average. Our model predicts a spiral angle that is smaller by ∼5° than the Parker spiral angle at Earth’s orbit for the same solar wind speed of Vsw = 400 km s−1. It also predicts an angular position on the solar disk of the best magnetically connected footpoint to an observer at 1 au that is shifted westward by ∼10° with respect to the Parker’s field model. This significantly changes the angle of the most probable magnetic connection between possible sources on the Sun and observers in the inner heliosphere. The results have direct implications for the heliospheric transport of “scatter-free” electrons accelerated in the aftermath of solar eruptions.

<title>Ultra–short-period WD Binaries Are Not Undergoing Strong Tidal Heating</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad1dd6</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad1dd6</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Double white dwarf (WD) binaries are increasingly being discovered at short orbital periods where strong tidal effects and significant tidal heating signatures may occur. We assume that the tidal potential of the companion excites outgoing gravity waves within the WD primary, the dissipation of which leads to an increase in the WD’s surface temperature. We compute the excitation and dissipation of the waves in cooling WD models in evolving MESA binary simulations. Tidal heating is self-consistently computed and added to the models at every time step. As a binary inspirals to orbital periods less than ∼20 minutes, the WD’s behavior changes from cooling to heating, with temperature enhancements that can exceed 10,000 K compared with nontidally heated models. We compare a grid of tidally heated WD models to observed short-period systems with hot WD primaries. While tidal heating affects their Teff, it is likely not the dominant luminosity. Instead, these WDs are probably intrinsically young and hot, implying that the binaries formed at short orbital periods. The binaries are consistent with undergoing common envelope evolution with a somewhat low efficiency αCE. We delineate the parameter space where the traveling wave assumption is most valid, noting that it breaks down for WDs that cool sufficiently, where standing waves may instead be formed.

<title>The Energy-dependent Gamma-Ray Light Curves and Spectra of the Vela Pulsar in the Dissipative Magnetospheres</title>

We study the pulsar energy-dependent γ-ray light curves and spectra from curvature radiation in the dissipative magnetospheres. The dissipative magnetospheres with the combined force-free (FFE) and Aristotelian are computed by a pseudo-spectral method with a high-resolution simulation in the rotating coordinate system, which produces a near-FFE field structure with the dissipative region only near the equatorial current sheet outside the light cylinder. We use the test-particle trajectory method to compute the energy-dependent γ-ray light curves and phase-average and phase-resolved spectra by including both the accelerating electric field and radiation reaction. The predicted energy-dependent γ-ray light curves and spectra are then compared with those of the Vela pulsar observed by Fermi. Our results can generally reproduce the observed trends of the energy-dependent γ-ray light curves and spectra for the Vela pulsar.

<title>Polarization Leakage and the IXPE Point-spread Function</title>

By measuring photoelectron tracks, the gas pixel detectors of the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer satellite provide estimates of the photon detection location and its electric vector position angle (EVPA). However, imperfections in reconstructing event positions blur the image, and EVPA-position correlations result in artificial polarized halos around bright sources. We introduce a new model describing this “polarization leakage” and use it to recover the on-orbit telescope point-spread functions, useful for faint-source detection and image reconstruction. These point-spread functions are more accurate than previous approximations or ground-calibrated products (Δχ2 ≈ 3 × 104 and 4 × 104 respectively for a bright 106-count source). We also define an algorithm for polarization leakage correction substantially more accurate than existing prescriptions (Δχ2 ≈ 1 × 103). These corrections depend on the reconstruction method, and we supply prescriptions for the mission-standard “Moments” methods as well as for “Neural Net” event reconstruction. Finally, we present a method to isolate leakage contributions to polarization observations of extended sources and show that an accurate PSF allows the extraction of sub-PSF-scale polarization patterns.

<title>Simulating Compressive Stream Interaction Regions during Parker Solar Probe’s First Perihelion Using Stream-aligned Magnetohydrodynamics</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We used the stream-aligned magnetohydrodynamics (SA-MHD) model to simulate Carrington rotation 2210, which contains Parker Solar Probe’s (PSP) first perihelion at 36.5 R⊙ on 2018 November 6, to provide context to the in situ PSP observations by FIELDS and SWEAP. The SA-MHD model aligns the magnetic field with the velocity vector at each point, thereby allowing for clear connectivity between the spacecraft and the source regions on the Sun, without unphysical magnetic field structures. During this Carrington rotation, two stream interaction regions (SIRs) form, due to the deep solar minimum. We include the energy partitioning of the parallel and perpendicular ions and the isotropic electrons to investigate the temperature anisotropy through the compression regions to better understand the wave energy amplification and proton thermal energy partitioning in a global context. Overall, we found good agreement in all in situ plasma parameters between the SA-MHD results and the observations at PSP, STEREO-A, and Earth, including at PSP’s perihelion and through the compression region of the SIRs. In the typical solar wind, the parallel proton temperature is preferentially heated, except in the SIR, where there is an enhancement in the perpendicular proton temperature. This is further showcased in the ion cyclotron relaxation time, which shows a distinct decrease through the SIR compression regions. This work demonstrates the success of the Alfvén wave turbulence theory for predicting interplanetary magnetic turbulence levels, while self-consistently reproducing solar wind speeds, densities, and overall temperatures, including at small heliocentric distances and through SIR compression regions.

Numerous structures conducive to magnetic reconnection are frequently observed in the turbulent regions at quasi-parallel shocks. In this work, we use a particle-in-cell simulation to study 3D magnetic reconnection in shock turbulence. We identify and characterize magnetic null points, and focus on reconnection along the separator between them. We identify a reconnection region with strong parallel current, a finite parallel potential, and counterrotating electron flows. Electrons are shown to be accelerated by the parallel electric field before being scattered at the null.

<br /><br />总结:
本文利用JWST/NIRCam数据对红移大于2的星系进行特征提取，样本包括6869个星系，其中255个红移大于5。在消除了星系定向和背景干扰后，利用变分自动编码器构建了一个具有物理意义的特征空间。研究发现红移增加时，球状星系的存在逐渐减少，早期宇宙中盘状星系占据主导地位。传统的目视分类系统在高红移形态分类中不够精确，因此提出了一种基于机器提取特征的更精细分类方案，并展示了这些提取的簇与测定参数的对齐情况，相较于传统方法有着更大的物理相关性。 <div>
Galaxy morphologies provide valuable insights into their formation processes, tracing the spatial distribution of ongoing star formation and encoding signatures of dynamical interactions. While such information has been extensively investigated at low redshift, it is crucial to develop a robust system for characterizing galaxy morphologies at earlier cosmic epochs. Relying solely on nomenclature established for low-redshift galaxies risks introducing biases that hinder our understanding of this new regime. In this paper, we employ variational autoencoders to perform feature extraction on galaxies at z > 2 using JWST/NIRCam data. Our sample comprises 6869 galaxies at z > 2, including 255 galaxies at z > 5, which have been detected in both the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey Hubble Space Telescope fields and the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey done with JWST, ensuring reliable measurements of redshift, mass, and star formation rates. To address potential biases, we eliminate galaxy orientation and background sources prior to encoding the galaxy features, thereby constructing a physically meaningful feature space. We identify 11 distinct morphological classes that exhibit clear separation in various structural parameters, such as the concentration, asymmetry, and smoothness (CAS) metric and M20, Sérsic indices, specific star formation rates, and axis ratios. We observe a decline in the presence of spheroidal-type galaxies with increasing redshift, indicating the dominance of disk-like galaxies in the early Universe. We demonstrate that conventional visual classification systems are inadequate for high-redshift morphology classification and advocate the need for a more detailed and refined classification scheme. Leveraging machine-extracted features, we propose a solution to this challenge and illustrate how our extracted clusters align with measured parameters, offering greater physical relevance compared to traditional methods.

We combine deep imaging data from the CEERS early release JWST survey and Hubble Space Telescope imaging from CANDELS to examine the size–mass relation of star-forming galaxies and the morphology–quenching relation at stellar masses M⋆ ≥ 109.5M⊙ over the redshift range 0.5 < z < 5.5. In this study with a sample of 2450 galaxies, we separate star-forming and quiescent galaxies based on their star formation activity and confirm that star-forming and quiescent galaxies have different morphologies out to z = 5.5, extending the results of earlier studies out to higher redshifts. We find that star-forming and quiescent galaxies have typical Sérsic indices of n ∼ 1.3 and n ∼ 4.3, respectively. Focusing on star-forming galaxies, we find that the slope of the size–mass relation is nearly constant with redshift, as was found previously, but shows a modest increase at z ∼ 4.2. The intercept in the size–mass relation declines out to z = 5.5 at rates that are similar to what earlier studies found. The intrinsic scatter in the size–mass relation is relatively constant out to z = 5.5.

We present six strongly gravitationally lensed Lyα emitters (LAEs) at z ∼ 4–5 with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) narrowband imaging isolating Lyα. Through complex radiative transfer Lyα encodes information about the spatial distribution and kinematics of the neutral hydrogen upon which it scatters. We investigate the galaxy properties and Lyα morphologies of our sample. Many previous studies of high-redshift LAEs have been limited in Lyα spatial resolution. In this work we take advantage of high-resolution Lyα imaging boosted by lensing magnification, allowing us to probe subgalactic scales that are otherwise inaccessible at these redshifts. We use broadband imaging from HST (rest-frame UV) and Spitzer (rest-frame optical) in spectral energy distribution fitting, providing estimates of the stellar masses (∼108–109M⊙), stellar population ages (t50 < 40 Myr), and amounts of dust (AV ∼ 0.1–0.6, statistically consistent with zero). We employ nonparametric star formation histories to probe the young stellar populations which create the Lyα. We also examine the offsets between the Lyα and stellar continuum, finding small upper limits of offsets (<0.″1) consistent with studies of low-redshift LAEs, indicating our galaxies are not interacting or merging. Finally, we find a bimodality in our sample’s Lyα morphologies: clumpy and extended. We find a suggestive trend: our LAEs with clumpy Lyα are generally younger than the LAEs with extended Lyα, suggesting a possible correlation with age.

We present the kinematic analysis of 246 stars within from the center of Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), the closest massive star cluster with active star formation across the full mass range, which provides valuable insights in the formation and evolution of star cluster on an individual-star basis. High-precision radial velocities and surface temperatures are retrieved from spectra acquired by the NIRSPEC instrument used with adaptive optics (NIRSPAO) on the Keck II 10 m telescope. A 3D kinematic map is then constructed by combining with the proper motions previously measured by the Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys/WFPC2/WFC3IR and Keck II NIRC2. The measured root-mean-squared velocity dispersion is 2.26 ± 0.08 km s−1, significantly higher than the virial equilibrium’s requirement of 1.73 km s−1, suggesting that the ONC core is supervirial, consistent with previous findings. Energy equipartition is not detected in the cluster. Most notably, the velocity of each star relative to its neighbors is found to be negatively correlated with stellar mass. Low-mass stars moving faster than their surrounding stars in a supervirial cluster suggests that the initial masses of forming stars may be related to their initial kinematic states. Additionally, a clockwise rotation preference is detected. A weak sign of inverse mass segregation is also identified among stars excluding the Trapezium stars, although it could be a sample bias. Finally, this study reports the discovery of four new candidate spectroscopic binary systems.

总结: 
本研究利用中国“天庭计划”的旗舰仪器——道孚太阳射电望远镜阵列的无线频谱观测数据，针对2022年4月17日的一次太阳射电暴进行了研究。通过对频谱漂移速度的分析，确定了相关冲击波的初速度。基于此，考虑到冲击波在活塞驱动阶段的稳定速度，再通过行星间空间传播作为爆轰波的方式来估计了相关冲击波到达STEREO-A观测卫星轨道的传播和到达时间。预测显示，冲击波在2022年4月19日14:31:57 UT到达STEREO-A。而STEREO-A卫星在同一天13:52:12 UT检测到了行星间冲击波。预测和实际到达时间的偏差仅为0.66小时。本研究旨在建立一个通用的预测方法，该方法可以利用地面太阳射电光谱仪或类似DSRT的望远镜观测数据，预测未来更多的事件。<br /><br /> <div>
Since fast head-on coronal mass ejections and their associated shocks represent potential hazards to the space environment of the Earth and even other planets, forecasting the arrival time of the corresponding interplanetary shock is a priority in space weather research and prediction. Based on the radio spectrum observations of the 16-element array of the Daocheng Solar Radio Telescope (DSRT), the flagship instrument of the Meridian Project of China, during its construction, this study determines the initial shock speed of a type II solar radio burst on 2022 April 17 from its drifting speed in the spectrum. Assuming that the shock travels at a steady speed during the piston-driven phase (determined from the X-ray flux of the associated flare) and then propagates through interplanetary space as a blast wave, we estimate the propagation and arrival time of the corresponding shock at the orbit of the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory-A (STEREO-A). The prediction shows that the shock will reach STEREO-A at 14:31:57 UT on 2022 April 19. The STEREO-A satellite detected an interplanetary shock at 13:52:12 UT on the same day. The discrepancy between the predicted and observed arrival time of the shock is only 0.66 hr. The purpose of this paper is to establish a general method for predicting the shock’s propagation and arrival time from this example, which will be utilized to predict more events in the future based on the observations of ground-based solar radio spectrometers or telescopes like DSRT.

总结:
本研究探讨了受霍尔效应影响的尘埃和磁化盘的稳定性以及对行星形成的影响。通过线性分析和非线性模拟，我们发现了一种新的背景漂移霍尔不稳定性（BDHI），它可能有助于在受霍尔效应影响的盘区形成行星。我们还发现在低尘埃气比和弱磁场下，BDHI可能占据主导地位，超过了经典的流动不稳定性（SI）和标准MHD不稳定性。我们还识别了经典SI的磁化版本，但这些通常是次要的。这突显了磁场和尘埃气动力学在原行星盘中的复杂相互作用，强调了在行星形成的更广泛叙事中考虑霍尔效应等非理想MHD的必要性。 <div>
Recent studies have shown that the large-scale gas dynamics of protoplanetary disks (PPDs) are controlled by nonideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), but how this influences dust dynamics is not fully understood. To this end, we investigate the stability of dusty, magnetized disks subject to the Hall effect, which applies to planet-forming regions of PPDs. We find a novel background drift Hall instability (BDHI) that may facilitate planetesimal formation in Hall-effected disk regions. Through a combination of linear analysis and nonlinear simulations, we demonstrate the viability and characteristics of BDHI. We find it can potentially dominate over the classical streaming instability (SI) and standard MHD instabilities at low dust-to-gas ratios and weak magnetic fields. We also identify magnetized versions of the classic SI, but these are usually subdominant. We highlight the complex interplay between magnetic fields and dust-gas dynamics in PPDs, underscoring the need to consider nonideal MHD like the Hall effect in the broader narrative of planet formation.

该文章介绍了层次贝叶斯推断如何同时考虑天文目录中的测量不确定性和选择效应。层次结构编码了关于生成观测数据的物理过程相互依赖的信念。文章指出文献中提出的几种近似方法实际上导致了与任何物理检测过程都不兼容的推断。这通常会导致偏见，并且与这样一个假设相关联：在真实源参数给定的情况下，可检测性与观测数据无关。文章还指出了这种错误如何影响了通过引力波观测到的双星并合事件目录进行的天体物理推断，包括错误估计并合率的红移演化以及错误地推断广义相对论是正确的引力理论。总的来说，不能直接拟合“检测分布”，然后在后处理中“排除”选择效应。同样，当比较理论预测和观测时，最好模拟检测到的数据（包括测量噪声和选择效应），而不是比较事件参数检测分布的估计（只包括选择效应）。尽管由于模型错误假设引起的偏差可能小于中等目录大小（O(100)事件）的统计不确定性，但它们仍将构成精密测量天体群体的重大障碍。<br /><br />总结: 本文讨论了层次贝叶斯推断在考虑天文目录中不确定性和选择效应方面的重要性，并强调了模型错误假设引起的偏差对于天体群体的影响。文章重点指出了在观测数据的理论预测和观测数据比较时应该考虑模拟检测到的数据以及不应该直接拟合“检测分布”来避免偏差的产生。 <div>
Hierarchical Bayesian inference can simultaneously account for both measurement uncertainty and selection effects within astronomical catalogs. In particular, the imposed hierarchy encodes beliefs about the interdependence of the physical processes that generate the observed data. We show that several proposed approximations within the literature actually correspond to inferences that are incompatible with any physical detection process. This generically leads to biases and is associated with the assumption that detectability is independent of the observed data given the true source parameters. We show several examples of how this error can affect astrophysical inferences based on catalogs of coalescing binaries observed through gravitational waves, including misestimating the redshift evolution of the merger rate as well as incorrectly inferring that general relativity is the correct theory of gravity when it is not. In general, one cannot directly fit for the “detected distribution” and “divide out” the selection effects in post-processing. Similarly, when comparing theoretical predictions to observations, it is better to simulate detected data (including both measurement noise and selection effects) rather than comparing estimates of the detected distributions of event parameters (which include only selection effects). While the biases introduced by model misspecification from incorrect assumptions may be smaller than statistical uncertainty for moderate catalog sizes (O(100) events), they will nevertheless pose a significant barrier to precision measurements of astrophysical populations.

<div> 太阳活动、HCME、半球分布、太阳黑子活动、太阳风动压
<br /><br />总结:
本研究通过对SOHO卫星观测得到的HCME目录的分析，发现HCME的来源位置受太阳活动带的限制，并不存在磁活动“冲向极地”的现象。HCME的来源位置呈现一般的半球不对称性，并且与太阳黑子活动的不对称性存在显著差异。第24太阳周期的半球分布与第23太阳周期不同，可能是由于在第23太阳周期极性反转后，太阳风动压显著减小导致的。这些结果有助于更全面地理解高能磁结构的半球不对称性，并为理解HCME的地球效应提供了新的视角。 <div>
The hemispheric asymmetry of solar activity is one of the essential physical consequences of the interior dynamo process. However, the hemispheric distribution of halo coronal mass ejection (HCME) source locations has not been investigated in detail. Based on the HCME catalog identified from the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph Experiment on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, we perform a hemispheric distribution analysis of the HCME source locations from 1996 April to 2022 June. The main results are as follows. (1) The HCME source locations are confined to the active region belt, and there is no “rush to the poles” phenomenon that is unique to large-scale magnetic activity. (2) The HCME source locations exhibit a general hemispheric asymmetry, and autoregressive moving-average model results show that the asymmetry of HCME source locations is significantly different from that of sunspot activity. (3) The hemispheric distribution of cycle 24 is different from that of cycle 23, potentially as a result of the heliospheric dynamic pressure having noticeably decreased after the polarity reversal of cycle 23. Our results contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the hemispheric asymmetry of energetic magnetic structures and give a new perspective on understanding the geoeffectiveness of HCMEs.

总结: 本研究旨在探讨不同磁场外推模型对分析太阳活跃区形态参数在三维空间中的重要性，并提出多种预测参数用于改进太阳爆发的预测。研究发现，使用多种磁场外推模型对太阳活跃区进行建模可以获得相似的形态参数演变趋势，并在预爆发条件方面取得了一定的成效。同时，研究结果表明，在下层太阳大气中应用多种前体参数可以提高对太阳爆发的预测能力，而在3D太阳活跃区的快速可靠洞察方面，PF和LFFF方法是可接受的选择，而NF2方法更为合适。 <div>
The three-dimensional (3D) coronal magnetic field has not yet been directly observed. However, for a better understanding and prediction of magnetically driven solar eruptions, 3D models of solar active regions are required. This work aims to provide insight into the significance of different extrapolation models for analyzing the preeruptive conditions of active regions with morphological parameters in 3D. Here, we employed potential field (PF), linear force-free field (LFFF), and nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) models and a neural network-based method integrating observational data and NLFFF physics (NF2). The 3D coronal magnetic field structure of a “flaring” (AR11166) and “flare-quiet” (AR12645) active region, in terms of their flare productivity, is constructed via the four extrapolation methods. To analyze the evolution of the field, six prediction parameters were employed throughout, from the photosphere up to the base of the lower corona. First, we find that the evolution of the adopted morphological parameters exhibits similarity across the investigated time period when considering the four types of extrapolations. Second, all the parameters exhibited preeruptive conditions not only at the photosphere but also at higher altitudes in the case of active region (AR) 11166, while three out of the six proxies also exhibited preeruptive conditions in the case of AR12645. We conclude that: (i) the combined application of several different precursor parameters is important in the lower solar atmosphere to improve eruption predictions, and (ii) to gain a quick yet reliable insight into the preflare evolution of active regions in 3D, the PF and LFFF are acceptable; however, the NF2 method is likely the more suitable option.

<div> X-ray synchrotron-dominated SNR, spectral analysis, nonthermal origin, shock velocities, pulsar-wind nebula (PWN)
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章报告了对壳状超新星遗迹G32.4+0.1的深入Chandra观测结果。研究发现了部分壳状形态，其轮廓相当圆形，半径约11光年。经过分析，证实了X射线来自非热源，即同步辐射。所需的冲击波速度表明遗迹的年龄大约在5000-9000年之间。此外，未发现X射线与射电脉冲星PSR J1850−0026之间的明显对应关系。然而，其位置与X射线辐射区域相接，可能是脉冲星风星云（PWN）。最后，对于非热辐射的起源仍存在问题，因为脉冲星与壳状超新星遗迹的关联性值得怀疑。 <div>
We present a deep Chandra observation of the shell supernova remnant (SNR) G32.4+0.1, whose featureless X-ray spectrum has led to its classification as an X-ray synchrotron-dominated SNR. We find a partial shell morphology whose outline is quite circular, with a radius of about 11 pc at an assumed distance of 11 kpc. Thermal and power-law spectral models for three relatively bright regions provided equally good fits, but the absence of spectral lines required ionization timescales from thermal fits that are inconsistent with the mean densities derived from emission measures. We thus confirm the nonthermal, i.e., synchrotron, origin of X-rays from G32.4+0.1. Shock velocities needed to accelerate electrons to the required TeV energies are ≳1000 km s−1, giving a remnant age ≲ 5000–9000 yr. There is no obvious X-ray counterpart to the radio pulsar PSR J1850−0026, but its position adjoins a region of X-ray emission whose spectrum is somewhat harder than that of other regions of the shell, and which may be a pulsar-wind nebula (PWN), though its spectrum is steeper than almost all known X-ray PWNe. The distance of the pulsar from the center of symmetry of the shell disfavors a birth in a supernova event at that location only a few thousand years before; either the pulsar (and putative PWN) are not associated with the shell SNR, requiring a coincidence of both position and (roughly) absorbing column density, or the SNR is much older, making the origin of nonthermal emission problematic.

Based on the Heliospheric Imager-1 images of the STEREO twin spacecraft, we established the CORrelation-Aided Reconstruction (CORAR) technique to locate and reconstruct the 3D structures of solar wind transients in interplanetary space. Here, we extend the CORAR method to images of COR2 on board STEREO to study the evolution of small-scale transients in the outer corona from 2010 January to May. We confirm that the transients can be located and reconstructed well by comparing the results with those of a self-similar expanding model. The speed distribution of the reconstructed transients generally shows the typical characteristics of the slow solar wind. We further study the sources of the transients on the Sun, and find that most reconstructed transients are located near the top of streamer belts or the heliospheric current sheet and can be tracked back to the boundaries of the closed-field and open-field regions along the field lines extrapolated by corona models. The formation mechanisms of these transients in the slow solar wind are also discussed.

这项研究报告了在Abell 2744透镜场中通过UNCOVER调查识别的三个遥远T型棕矮星的JWST/NIRSpec光谱。其中一个先前基于NIRCam光度被报告为T矮星候选者，而另外两个最初被确定为候选活动星系核。低分辨率的1-5微米光谱证实了与T矮星大气层一致的分子特征，并与光谱标准进行比较推断它们的分类分别为sdT1、T6和T8-T9。最温暖的源UNCOVER-BD-1显示出次太阳金属丰度的证据，大气模型拟合表明其有效温度为1300K，[M/H]约为-1.0，这使得它成为少数几个光谱确认的T次矮星之一。最寒冷的源UNCOVER-BD-3接近T/Y矮星边界，有效温度为550K，并且我们的分析指出在3-5微米区域存在PH3，相对于CO2更受青睐，这可能是次太阳金属丰度的指示物。我们估计这些棕矮星距离银河中面的距离为0.9-4.5千秒差距，这使它们成为具有光谱确认的最遥远的棕矮星。人口模拟结果表明其中两个棕矮星极有可能属于银河厚盘成员，而UNCOVER-BD-1则有可能属于银河暗盘成员。我们的模拟表明在Abell 2744区域内大约有5个T型矮星和1-2个L型矮星，其亮度下限为F444W = 30 AB mag，其中大约三分之一属于厚盘成员。这些结果突显了JWST/NIRSpec光谱对于识别和表征银河中最古老的金属贫棕矮星的实用性。<br /><br />总结: 本研究通过JWST/NIRSpec光谱确认了Abell 2744中的三个遥远T型棕矮星，其中一个被确认为T次矮星，另外两个被初步确定为候选活动星系核。研究还估计了它们的距离和可能的银河成员身份，这些结果突显了使用JWST/NIRSpec光谱鉴定和表征银河中最古老的金属贫棕矮星的实用性。 <div>
We report JWST/NIRSpec spectra of three distant T-type brown dwarfs identified in the Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam ObserVations before the Epoch of Reionization (UNCOVER) survey of the Abell 2744 lensing field. One source was previously reported as a candidate T dwarf on the basis of NIRCam photometry, while two sources were initially identified as candidate active galactic nuclei. Low-resolution 1–5 μm spectra confirm the presence of molecular features consistent with T dwarf atmospheres, and comparison to spectral standards infers classifications of sdT1, T6, and T8–T9. The warmest source, UNCOVER-BD-1, shows evidence of subsolar metallicity, and atmosphere model fits indicate Teff = 1300 K and [M/H] ∼ −1.0, making this one of the few spectroscopically confirmed T subdwarfs known. The coldest source, UNCOVER-BD-3, is near the T/Y dwarf boundary with Teff = 550 K, and our analysis indicates the presence of PH3 in the 3–5 μm region, favored over CO2 and a possible indicator of subsolar metallicity. We estimate distances of 0.9–4.5 kpc from the Galactic midplane, making these the most distant brown dwarfs with spectroscopic confirmation. Population simulations indicate high probabilities of membership in the Galactic thick disk for two of these brown dwarfs, and potential halo membership for UNCOVER-BD-1. Our simulations indicate that there are approximately 5 T dwarfs and 1–2 L dwarfs in the Abell 2744 field down to F444W = 30 AB mag, roughly one-third of which are thick disk members. These results highlight the utility of deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy for identifying and characterizing the oldest metal-poor brown dwarfs in the Milky Way.

Multiwavelength observations are now the norm for studying blazars’ various states of activity, classifying them, and determining the possible underlying physical processes driving their emission. Broadband emission models became unavoidable tools for testing emission scenarios and setting the values of physical quantities such as the magnetic field strength, Doppler factor, or shape of the particle distribution of the emission zone(s). We announce here the first public release of a new tool, Bjet_MCMC, that can automatically fit the broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of blazars. The complete code is available on GitHub and allows for testing leptonic synchrotron self-Compton models with or without external inverse-Compton processes from the thermal environment of supermassive black holes (accretion disk and broad-line region). The code is designed to be user-friendly and computationally efficient. It contains a core written in C++ and a fully parallelized SED fitting method. The original multi-SSC zone model of Bjet is also available on GitHub but is not included in the Markov Chain Monte Carlo fitting process at the moment. We present the features, performance, and results of Bjet_MCMC, as well as user advice.

We investigate the merger between a 16M⊙ star, on its way to becoming a red supergiant (RSG), and a 4M⊙ main-sequence companion. Our study employs three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations using the state-of-the-art adaptive mesh refinement code Octo-Tiger. The initially corotating binary undergoes interaction and mass transfer, resulting in the accumulation of mass around the companion and its subsequent loss through the second Lagrangian point (L2). The companion eventually plunges into the envelope of the primary, leading to its spin-up and subsequent merger with the helium core. We examine the internal structural properties of the post-merger star, as well as the merger environment and the outflow driven by the merger. Our findings reveal the ejection of approximately ∼0.6 M⊙ of material in an asymmetric and somewhat bipolar outflow. We import the post-merger stellar structure into the MESA stellar evolution code to model its long-term nuclear evolution. In certain cases, the post-merger star exhibits persistent rapid equatorial surface rotation as it evolves in the H–R diagram toward the observed location of Betelgeuse. These cases demonstrate surface rotation velocities of a similar magnitude to those observed in Betelgeuse, along with a chemical composition resembling that of Betelgeuse. In other cases, efficient rotationally induced mixing leads to slower surface rotation. This pioneering study aims to model stellar mergers across critical timescales, encompassing dynamical, thermal, and nuclear evolutionary stages.

Green Bank North Celestial Cap survey是最大、最敏感的脉冲星和瞬变射电天体的调查之一，已完成观测，重点转向对其发现进行长期监测。研究团队开发了一个处理大型归档观测数据集的管道，并将其与近期使用Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment望远镜进行的高频率观测相连接。他们处理了128颗脉冲星的数据，并测量了自旋、位置和轨道参数，连接了长达2000天的观测间隔。此外，他们还测量了五颗脉冲星的时间残差中的瞬变以及19颗源的proper motion。他们还更新了19颗脉冲星的轨道参数，包括九颗以前未发表的二元系统。对于其中两个二元系统，他们提供了更精确的后开普勒参数测量，从而更准确地估计了两个系统的总质量。对于PSR J0509+3801，他们大大改善了爱因斯坦延迟的测量结果，得到了脉冲星和伴星的质量分别为1.399(6) M⊙和1.412(6) M⊙的更精确测量。对于这个系统，他们还获得了由于引力波辐射而导致的轨道衰减的测量结果，与这些质量的广义相对论预测的速率一致。 <br /><br />总结: 这项研究使用大数据处理技术处理了脉冲星的观测数据，更新了它们的参数并发现了新的二元系统。对于PSR J0509+3801这个系统，获得了更准确的质量测量和引力波辐射速率的测量结果。 <div>
The Green Bank North Celestial Cap survey is one of the largest and most sensitive searches for pulsars and transient radio objects. Observations for the survey have finished; priorities have shifted toward long-term monitoring of its discoveries. In this study, we have developed a pipeline to handle large data sets of archival observations and connect them to recent, high-cadence observations taken using the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment telescope. This pipeline handles data for 128 pulsars and has produced measurements of spin, positional, and orbital parameters that connect data over observation gaps as large as 2000 days. We have also measured glitches in the timing residuals for five of the pulsars included and proper motion for 19 sources (13 new). We include updates to orbital parameters for 19 pulsars, including nine previously unpublished binaries. For two of these binaries, we provide updated measurements of post-Keplerian binary parameters, which result in much more precise estimates of the total masses of both systems. For PSR J0509+3801, the much improved measurement of the Einstein delay yields much improved mass measurements for the pulsar and its companion, 1.399(6) M⊙ and 1.412(6) M⊙, respectively. For this system, we have also obtained a measurement of the orbital decay due to the emission of gravitational waves, , which is in agreement with the rate predicted by general relativity for these masses.

总结: 
研究团队利用iSHELL在NASA红外望远镜设施上观测了HD 32297恒星周围的M波段光谱，并利用Gemini Planet Imager拍摄了HD 131488的H波段偏振图像。他们在HD 32297的光谱中搜索基本的CO吸收线，但没有检测到。他们估计了CO的列密度上限，并结合ALMA测得的CO质量和盘的几何特性，估计了CO的尺度高度。研究还对其他三个富含CO的边缘盘进行了类似的估算，并发现在假设处于静力平衡的情况下，CO和毫米尘埃的尺度高度可能存在潜在的相关性。可能的解释是这四个系统中气体和尘埃可能具有相似的次级起源。<br /><br />总结: 研究团队利用高光谱分辨率设备和成像设备对恒星周围的碎片盘进行了观测，估计了CO的尺度高度，并发现了潜在的气体和尘埃尺度高度的相关性，提出了气体和尘埃可能具有相似的次级起源的可能解释。 <div>
We present high-spectral-resolution M-band spectra from iSHELL on NASA’s Infrared Telescope Facility along the line of sight to the debris disk host star HD 32297. We also present a Gemini Planet Imager H-band polarimetric image of the HD 131488 debris disk. We search for fundamental CO absorption lines in the iSHELL spectra of HD 32297, but do not detect any. We place an upper limit on the CO column density of ∼6 × 1015 cm−2. By combining the column density upper limit, the CO mass measured with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), and the geometrical properties of the disk, we estimate the scale height of the CO to be ≲2 au across the radial extent of the disk (∼80–120 au). We use the same method to estimate the CO scale height of three other edge-on, CO-rich debris disks that all have CO observed in absorption with the Hubble Space Telescope as well as in emission with ALMA: β Pictoris, HD 110058, and HD 131488. We compare our estimated CO scale heights of these four systems to the millimeter dust scale heights and find that, under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium, there is a potential correlation between the CO and millimeter dust scale heights. There are multiple factors that affect the gas vertical structure such as turbulence, photodissociation with weak vertical mixing, as well as where the gas originates. One possible explanation for the potential correlation could be that the gas and dust are of a similar secondary origin in these four systems.

总结：

Under the assumption of a simple and time-invariant gravitational potential, many Galactic dynamics techniques infer the milky Way’s mass and dark matter distributions from stellar kinematic observations. These methods typically rely on parameterized potential models of the Galaxy and must take into account nontrivial survey selection effects, because they make use of the density of stars in phase space. Large-scale spectroscopic surveys now supply information beyond kinematics in the form of precise stellar label measurements (especially element abundances). These element abundances are known to correlate with orbital actions or other dynamical invariants. Here, we use the Orbital Torus Imaging framework that uses abundance gradients in phase space to map orbits. In many cases these gradients can be measured without detailed knowledge of the selection function. We use stellar surface abundances from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment survey combined with kinematic data from the Gaia mission. Our method reveals the vertical (z-direction) orbital structure in the Galaxy and enables empirical measurements of the vertical acceleration field and orbital frequencies in the disk. From these measurements, we infer the total surface mass density, Σ, and midplane volume density, ρ0, as a function of Galactocentric radius and height. Around the Sun, we find and using the most constraining abundance ratio, [Mg/Fe]. This corresponds to a dark matter contribution in surface density of Σ⊙,DM(z = 1.1 kpc) = 24 ± 4 M⊙ pc−2, and in total volume mass density of ρ⊙,DM(z = 0) = 0.011 ± 0.002 M⊙ pc−3. Moreover, using these mass density values we estimate the scale length of the low-α disk to be hR = 2.24 ± 0.06 kpc.

总结: 
Event Horizon Telescope (EHT)的观测结果使我们能够精确研究超大质量黑洞的吸积过程。文章利用基于动力学物理学的简单模型研究了螺旋度屏障对EHT可见的电磁观测量的影响。研究发现，螺旋度屏障在磁场更加有序的区域以及在MAD流域中可能会对辐射形态和电子温度产生显著影响。此外，忽略螺旋度屏障可能导致低估吸积率和射流功率。研究结果强调了螺旋度屏障在塑造黑洞可观测量和推断吸积系统参数方面的重要性。 <div>
Horizon-scale observations from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) have enabled precision study of supermassive black hole accretion. Contemporary accretion modeling often treats the inflowing plasma as a single, thermal fluid, but microphysical kinetic effects can lead to significant deviations from this idealized picture. We investigate how the helicity barrier influences EHT-accessible electromagnetic observables by employing a simple model for electron heating based on kinetic physics and the cascade of energy and helicity in unbalanced turbulence. Although the helicity barrier plays only a minor role in regions with high plasma β, like in standard and normal evolution (SANE) disks, it may substantially impact regions with more ordered magnetic fields, such as the jet and its surrounding wind in SANE flows as well as throughout the entire domain in magnetically arrested disk (MAD) flows. In SANE flows, emission shifts from the funnel wall toward the lower-magnetization disk region; in MAD flows the emission morphology remains largely unchanged. Including the helicity barrier leads to characteristically lower electron temperatures, and neglecting it can lead to underestimated accretion rates and inferred jet powers. The corresponding higher plasma densities result in increased depolarization and Faraday depths thereby decreasing the amplitude of the β2 coefficient while leaving its angle unchanged. Both the increased jet power and lower may help alleviate outstanding tensions between modeling and EHT observations. We also find that the estimated ring diameter may be underestimated when the helicity barrier is neglected. Our results underscore the significance of the helicity barrier in shaping black hole observables and inferred accretion system parameters.

<div> 低质量星系、低质量天体对、Illustris TNG100模拟、宇宙时期、合并率<br />
总结:<br />这篇文章介绍了对低质量星系对进行研究，并指出了在不同时期低质量星系对的变化趋势与高质量星系对不同，通过利用Illustris TNG100模拟创建了一组物理相关的低质量和高质量星系对的样本，并表明了在恢复低质量和高质量星系对之间的差异时，随着系统质量和红移的变化而变化的分离限制是至关重要的，最后还在宇宙背景下放置了类似于当地星系群中的孤立质量对。 <div>
Low-mass galaxy pair fractions are understudied, and it is unclear whether low-mass pair fractions evolve in the same way as more massive systems over cosmic time. In the era of JWST, Roman, and Rubin, selecting galaxy pairs in a self-consistent way will be critical to connect observed pair fractions to cosmological merger rates across all mass scales and redshifts. Utilizing the Illustris TNG100 simulation, we create a sample of physically associated low-mass (108 < M* < 5 × 109M⊙) and high-mass (5 × 109 < M* < 1011M⊙) pairs between z = 0 and 4.2. The low-mass pair fraction increases from z = 0 to 2.5, while the high-mass pair fraction peaks at z = 0 and is constant or slightly decreasing at z > 1. At z = 0 the low-mass major (1:4 mass ratio) pair fraction is 4× lower than high-mass pairs, consistent with findings for cosmological merger rates. We show that separation limits that vary with the mass and redshift of the system, such as scaling by the virial radius of the host halo (rsep < 1Rvir), are critical for recovering pair fraction differences between low-mass and high-mass systems. Alternatively, static physical separation limits applied equivalently to all galaxy pairs do not recover the differences between low- and high-mass pair fractions, even up to separations of 300 kpc. Finally, we place isolated mass analogs of Local Group galaxy pairs, i.e., Milky Way (MW)–M31, MW–LMC, LMC–SMC, in a cosmological context, showing that isolated analogs of LMC–SMC-mass pairs and low-separation (<50 kpc) MW–LMC-mass pairs are 2–3× more common at z ≳ 2–3.

这篇文章报告了对阿贝尔1240的深度查德拉观测，该天体是一个红移为0.195的二元并合星系团，其中包括两个最亮的星系团星系，它们可能在0.3亿年前相互经过。研究集中在星团核心的西北和东南方向两个明显的广大射电残留物。研究利用了高分辨率的查德拉成像技术，确定了在星团中心西北1兆帕斯卡和东南1.2兆帕斯卡的两个明显的面亮度边缘，与两者的外缘完全一致。我们的温度测量表明这些边缘是冲击波边缘。从气体密度跳跃中求得的马赫数为SE冲击波为3.5，NW冲击波为3.8。我们估计的马赫数与从射电观测中获得的显著小，这突显了重新加速场景占主导地位，而不是直接加速来自热池的电子。此外，我们比较了两种模型对两个冲击波内外的观测温度剖面。两个冲击波都支持库仑碰撞模型，但由于预冲击温度不确定性，我们无法排除纯碰撞模型。 <br /><br />总结: 这篇文章描述了对星团Abell 1240的深度查德拉观测，发现了两个广大射电残留物，并确定了两个冲击波边缘。通过温度测量和马赫数计算，研究结果表明重新加速场景占据主导地位。此外，通过比较两种模型对观测温度剖面的预测，发现射电观测所得的马赫数明显高于碰撞模型预测的值。 <div>
We present a 368 ks deep Chandra observation of Abell 1240, a binary merging galaxy cluster at a redshift of 0.195 with two brightest cluster galaxies that may have passed each other 0.3 Gyr ago. Building upon previous investigations involving Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope, Very Large Array, and LOFAR data, our study focuses on two prominent extended radio relics at the northwest (NW) and southeast (SE) of the cluster core. By leveraging the high-resolution Chandra imaging, we have identified two distinct surface-brightness edges at ∼1 Mpc and 1.2 Mpc NW and SE of the cluster center, respectively, coinciding with the outer edges of both relics. Our temperature measurements suggest the edges to be shock front edges. The Mach numbers, derived from the gas density jumps, yield = for the SE shock and = for the NW shock. Our estimated Mach numbers are remarkably smaller compared to those derived from radio observations ( = 2.3 and = 2.4), highlighting the prevalence of a reacceleration scenario over direct acceleration of electrons from the thermal pool. Furthermore, we compare the observed temperature profiles across both shocks with those of predictions from collisional versus collisionless models. Both shocks favor the Coulomb collisional model, but we could not rule out a purely collisionless model due to pre-shock temperature uncertainties.

太阳探测器Parker Solar Probe在接近太阳的轨道上观测到了与CIR相关的高能质子增强现象。研究发现，这些高能质子在距离太阳46倍半径的地方向太阳辐射，CIR持续时间至少为一个太阳自转周期，并且在1天文单位附近的其他探测器上也观测到了相应的高能质子增强。另外，观测还表明，质子的能谱在太阳附近比较陡峭，在接近1天文单位时变得更硬。这些结果表明，在1天文单位以内，CIR结构可以加速粒子，并且这些粒子可以深入内太阳系。<br /><br /> <div>
The radial evolution of particles accelerated at corotating interaction regions (CIRs) is not fully understood, particularly the distance range over which this particle acceleration occurs and how the energy spectra are modulated by transport through the inner heliosphere. Here, we present observations of energetic proton enhancements associated with a CIR observed by Parker Solar Probe on 2021 April 25 during the inbound leg of its orbit near ∼46 Rs (∼0.21 au). The CIR is identified at additional spacecraft (Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory, STEREO-A; Solar Orbiter, SolO; and Advanced Composition Explorer, ACE) using a corotation time delay estimation, and energetic proton spectra from each spacecraft are compared. We find that (1) energetic protons are observed near 46 Rs streaming sunward ahead of the CIR; (2) the CIR persists for at least one solar rotation and the corresponding energetic proton enhancements are observed at STEREO-A, SolO, and ACE; and (3) the proton energy spectrum is steeper near the Sun and hardens near 1 au. This observation presents the closest in situ energetic particle observation of a CIR to the Sun ever recorded. Results presented here suggest that particles can be accelerated by CIR structures within 1 au and these particles can penetrate very deep into the inner heliosphere.

While various methods have been proposed to disentangle the progenitor system for Type Ia supernovae, their origin is still unclear. A circumstellar environment is key to distinguishing between the double-degenerate and single-degenerate (SD) scenarios since a dense wind cavity is expected only in the case of the SD system. We perform spatially resolved X-ray spectroscopy of Tycho’s supernova remnant (SNR) with XMM-Newton and reveal the three-dimensional velocity structure of the expanding shock-heated ejecta measured from Doppler-broadened lines of intermediate-mass elements. Obtained velocity profiles are fairly consistent with those expected from a uniformly expanding ejecta model near the center, whereas we discover a rapid deceleration (∼4000 to ∼1000 km s−1) near the edge of the remnant in almost every direction. The result strongly supports the presence of a dense wall entirely surrounding the remnant, which is confirmed also by our hydrodynamical simulation. We thus conclude that Tycho’s SNR is likely of SD origin. Our new method will be useful for understanding progenitor systems of Type Ia SNRs in the era of high-angular/energy-resolution X-ray astronomy with microcalorimeters.

Recent numerical studies suggest that magnetic fields play an important role in primordial star formation in the early Universe. However, the detailed evolution of the magnetic field in the collapse phase still has uncertainties because of the complicated physics associated with turbulence in a collapsing magnetized system. Here, we perform a suite of numerical MHD simulations that follow the collapse of magnetized, turbulent primordial gas clouds to investigate the evolution of the magnetic field associated with the turbulence, assuming a polytropic equation of state with exponent γeff and with various numerical resolutions. In addition, we generalize the analytic theory of magnetic field growth/saturation so that it can deal with various exponents γeff and turbulence energy spectra. We find that the numerical results are well reproduced by the theory for various γeff through the collapse phase during the formation of the first stars. The magnetic field is eventually amplified by a factor of 1012–1015 due to kinematic and nonlinear turbulent dynamo effects and reaches 3%–100% of the equipartition level, depending on γeff. We also find that the transition between the kinematic and nonlinear stages can be analytically estimated. These results indicate that the strong magnetic field accompanied by supersonic turbulence is a general property and suggest that it can play a crucial role in the formation of the first stars.

Exoplanets with short orbit periods reside very close to their host stars. They transition very rapidly between different sectors of the circumstellar space environment along their orbit, leading to large variations of the magnetic field in the vicinity of the planet on short timescales. This rapid change of the magnetic flux through the conducting and resistive layer of the planetary upper atmosphere may drive currents that dissipate in the form of Joule heating (JH). Here, we estimate the amount of JH dissipation in the upper atmosphere of Trappist-1e, and two hypothetical planets orbiting the Sun in close-in orbits. We find that the rapid orbital motion could drive a significant amount of atmospheric heating and could significantly affect the planetary atmosphere escape rate. Thus, the process should be accounted for when studying the long-term evolution of exoplanetary atmospheres.

A fundamental question in galaxy and black hole evolution remains how galaxies and their supermassive black holes have evolved together over cosmic time. Specifically, it is still unclear how the position of X-ray active galactic nucleus (AGN) host galaxies with respect to the star-forming main sequence (MS) may change with the X-ray luminosity (LX) of the AGN or the stellar mass (M⋆) of the host galaxy. We use data from the XMM-Spitzer Extragalactic Representative Volume Survey (XMM-SERVS) to probe this issue. XMM-SERVS is covered by the largest medium-depth X-ray survey (with superb supporting multiwavelength data) and thus contains the largest sample to date for study. To ensure consistency, we locally derive the MS from a large reference galaxy sample. In our analysis, we demonstrate that the turnover of the galaxy MS does not allow reliable conclusions to be drawn for high-mass AGNs, and we establish a robust safe regime where the results do not depend upon the choice of MS definition. Under this framework, our results indicate that less massive AGN host galaxies ( ) generally possess enhanced star formation rates compared to their normal-galaxy counterparts while the more massive AGN host galaxies ( ) lie on or below the star-forming MS. Further, we propose an empirical model for how the placement of an AGN with respect to the MS (SFRnorm) evolves as a function of both M⋆ and LX.

Stellar streams form through the tidal disruption of satellite galaxies or globular clusters orbiting a host galaxy. Globular cluster streams are exciting since they are thin (dynamically cold) and therefore sensitive to perturbations from low-mass subhalos. Since the subhalo mass function differs depending on the dark matter composition, these gaps can provide unique constraints on dark matter models. However, current samples are limited to the Milky Way. With its large field of view, deep imaging sensitivity, and high angular resolution, the upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman) presents a unique opportunity to increase the number of observed streams and gaps significantly. This paper presents a first exploration of the prospects for detecting gaps in streams in M31 and other nearby galaxies with resolved stars. We simulate the formation of gaps in a Palomar 5–like stream and generate mock observations of these gaps with background stars in M31 and foreground Milky Way stellar fields. We assess Roman's ability to detect gaps out to 10 Mpc through visual inspection and with the gap-finding tool FindTheGap. We conclude that gaps of ≈1.5 kpc in streams that are created from subhalos of masses ≥5 × 106M⊙ are detectable within a 2–3 Mpc volume in exposure times of 1000 s to 1 hr. This volume contains ≈150 galaxies, including ≈eight galaxies with luminosities >109L⊙. Large samples of stream gaps in external galaxies will open up a new era of statistical analyses of gap characteristics in stellar streams and help constrain dark matter models.

<div> 黑洞、星团、质量分离、模拟、星体破坏
总结：<br /><br />这项研究关注了质量分离对星团内恶性破坏事件的影响。根据蒙特卡洛模拟，发现质量分离会导致重物质体聚集在中心黑洞附近，而轻物质体则过度集中在外围区域。研究还考虑了在黑洞附近星团内被破坏并注入的恒星对该过程的影响。模拟结果表明，这种质量分离对星体的破坏速率产生了自洽的影响，对于星团整体的演化具有重要意义。 <div>
The centers of galaxies host a supermassive black hole (SMBH) surrounded by a dense stellar cluster. The cluster is expected to develop mass segregation, in which gravitational scatterings among the stars cause heavier objects to sink closer to the central black hole, while lighter objects will tend to be overconcentrated in the outer regions. This work focuses on the implications of mass segregation on the different channels for violent destruction of stars in the cluster: tidal disruptions, gravitational-wave-driven inspirals and high-velocity destructive collisions between stars. All such events occur close to the central black hole, where the heavier objects congregate. The analysis is based on a simplified Monte Carlo simulation, which evolves a two-mass population in a cluster surrounding a Milky Way–like SMBH. The simulation is based on the single-mass scheme used by Sari & Fragione and Balberg & Yassur, which has been extended to allow for the dynamical friction effects typical of unequal-mass populations. The effects of mass segregation on the rates of the different destruction channels are analyzed self-consistently in the overall evolution of the cluster. Also considered are stars which are injected into the cluster after being disrupted from a binary system by the SMBH. Such stars are captured in the inner regions of the cluster, and so their orbital evolution, as well as their destruction rate, are therefore influenced by heavy objects that might be abundant in the vicinity of the SMBH.

总结:<br />
这篇文章讨论了如何将系统发育方法应用于模拟的盘状星系，以研究其演化历史。研究发现，至少需要100颗恒星颗粒才能可靠地描绘所选恒星族群的演化历史，并且化学丰度的典型不确定性小于0.08 dex时，整体演化历史能够可靠地保留。研究结果显示，系统树的形状受到年龄-金属丰度关系以及星系恒星形成历史的影响。低星形成率的区域产生的树比高星形成率的区域短。我们的分析表明，系统发育方法可以揭示星系演化的过程。 <div>
Phylogenetic methods have long been used in biology and more recently have been extended to other fields—for example, linguistics and technology—to study evolutionary histories. Galaxies also have an evolutionary history and fall within this broad phylogenetic framework. Under the hypothesis that chemical abundances can be used as a proxy for the interstellar medium’s DNA, phylogenetic methods allow us to reconstruct hierarchical similarities and differences among stars—essentially, a tree of evolutionary relationships and thus history. In this work, we apply phylogenetic methods to a simulated disk galaxy obtained with a chemodynamical code to test the approach. We found that at least 100 stellar particles are required to reliably portray the evolutionary history of a selected stellar population in this simulation, and that the overall evolutionary history is reliably preserved when the typical uncertainties in the chemical abundances are smaller than 0.08 dex. The results show that the shapes of the trees are strongly affected by the age–metallicity relation, as well as the star formation history of the galaxy. We found that regions with low star formation rates produce shorter trees than regions with high star formation rates. Our analysis demonstrates that phylogenetic methods can shed light on the process of galaxy evolution.

<title>Soft X-Ray Energy Spectra in the Wide-field Galactic Disk Area Revealed with HaloSat</title>

<br /><br />总结:
本研究分析了HaloSat对银河盘中五个地方的观测数据，这些地方距离银心较远（135° < l < 254°），旨在理解银河盘中软X射线能量辐射的性质。通过这些观测，发现了可能存在未解的高温等离子体（UHTPGD），其温度在0.8-1.0 keV，发射度为(8-11) × 10−4 cm−6 pc。我们还观测到在没有明亮源的区域中存在UHTPGD辐射。通过堆积光谱的研究，发现星等点源可能是UHTPGD的组成部分。这项研究表明，UHTPGD可能在整个银河盘中都存在，并且可能部分起源于星等点源。 <div>
We analyzed data from HaloSat observations for five fields in the Galactic disk located far away from the Galactic center (135° < l < 254°) to understand the nature of soft X-ray energy emission in the Galactic disk. The fields have 14° diameter and were selected to contain no significant high-flux X-ray sources. All five HaloSat soft X-ray energy spectra (0.4–7 keV with energy resolution of < 100 eV below 1 keV) show a possibility of the presence of unresolved high-temperature plasma in the Galactic disk (UHTPGD) with a temperature of 0.8–1.0 keV and an emission measure of (8–11) × 10−4 cm−6 pc in addition to the soft X-ray diffuse background components mainly studied at higher Galactic latitudes (solar wind charge exchange emission, Local Hot Bubble, Milky Way halo emission, and the cosmic X-ray background). This suggests that the UHTPGD is present across the whole Galactic disk. We also observed UHTPGD emission in a region with no bright sources in an XMM-Newton field contained within one of the HaloSat fields. The temperature and emission measure are consistent with those measured with HaloSat. Moreover, the stacked spectra of the X-ray pointlike sources and near-infrared-identified point sources such as stars in the XMM-Newton field also show a spectral feature similar to the UHTPGD emission. This suggests that the UHTPGD may partly originate from pointlike sources such as stars.

<div> quasars, black hole mass function, Eddington-ratio distribution function, z = 4, broad-line AGNs
<br />
这篇文章研究了在 z=4 时红移的宽线活动星系核（AGNs）的黑洞质量函数（BHMF）和Eddington比分布函数（ERDF），并基于来自Subaru超级望远镜战略计划S16A-Wide2数据集的52个i < 23.2的类星体和来自Sloan数字Sky Survey数据第7版类星体目录中相同红移范围内的1462个i < 20.2类星体进行了研究。利用CIV 1549 Å线的宽度和1350 Å处的连续光度估算了类星体的维里黑洞（BH）质量。通过对低质量或低Eddington比范围中由流量限制选择引起的不完整性进行校正，得到了真实的宽线AGN BHMF和ERDF。与文献中 z∼2时的宽线AGN BHMF相比，我们发现大质量SMBH的数量密度在较高的红移处达到峰值，这与逐渐演化的情况一致。此外，得到的ERDF显示出负相关性，表明更大质量的SMBH倾向于以较低的Eddington比率吸积在z=4时。通过得出的真实的宽线AGN BHMF，我们还评估了 z=4 时在整个SMBH群体中宽线AGN的活动比例。得出的活跃比例可能表明与BH质量的正相关性。最后，我们通过解决连续方程来考察了 z=4 到 6 之间的宽线AGN BHMF的时间演化。结果表明 z=4–6 时的宽线AGN BHMF仅在归一化方面发生演化，但其形状没有显著变化。<br /><br />总结: 本文研究了 z=4 时的宽线活动星系核（AGNs）的黑洞质量函数（BHMF）和Eddington比分布函数（ERDF）。作者通过样本研究发现大质量SMBH的数量密度在较高的红移处达到峰值，且得到的ERDF显示出负相关性。此外，作者还评估了 z=4 时在整个SMBH群体中宽线AGN的活动比例，并考察了 z=4 到 6 之间的宽线AGN BHMF的时间演化，发现了一些有趣的结果。 <div>
We investigate the black hole mass function (BHMF) and Eddington-ratio distribution function (ERDF) of broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at z = 4, based on a sample of 52 quasars with i < 23.2 at 3.50 ≤ z ≤ 4.25 from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program S16A-Wide2 data set, and 1462 quasars with i < 20.2 in the same redshift range from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data release 7 quasar catalog. Virial black hole (BH) masses of quasars are estimated using the width of the CIV 1549 Å line and the continuum luminosity at 1350 Å. To obtain the intrinsic broad-line AGN BHMF and ERDF, we correct for the incompleteness in the low-mass and/or low-Eddington-ratio ranges caused by the flux-limited selection. The resulting BHMF is constrained down to . In comparison with broad-line AGN BHMFs at z ∼ 2 in the literature, we find that the number density of massive SMBHs peaks at higher redshifts, consistent with the downsizing evolutionary scenario. Additionally, the resulting ERDF shows a negative dependence on BH mass, suggesting more massive SMBHs tend to accrete at lower-Eddington ratios at z = 4. With the derived intrinsic broad-line AGN BHMF, we also evaluate the active fraction of broad-line AGNs among the entire SMBH population at z = 4. The resulting active fraction may suggest a positive dependence on BH mass. Finally, we examine the time evolution of broad-line AGN BHMF between z = 4 and 6 through solving the continuity equation. The results suggest that the broad-line AGN BHMFs at z = 4–6 only show evolution in their normalization, but with no significant changes in their shape.

Observations have shown a clear association of filament/prominence eruptions with the emergence of magnetic flux in or near filament channels. Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations have been employed to systematically study the conditions under which such eruptions occur. These simulations to date have modeled filament channels as 2D flux ropes or 3D uniformly sheared arcades. Here we present MHD simulations of flux emergence into a more realistic configuration consisting of a bipolar active region containing a line-tied 3D flux rope. We use the coronal flux-rope model of Titov et al. as the initial condition and drive our simulations by imposing boundary conditions extracted from a flux emergence simulation by Leake et al. We identify three mechanisms that determine the evolution of the system: (i) reconnection displacing footpoints of field lines overlying the coronal flux rope, (ii) changes of the ambient field due to the intrusion of new flux at the boundary, and (iii) interaction of the (axial) electric currents in the preexisting and newly emerging flux systems. The relative contributions and effects of these mechanisms depend on the properties of the preexisting and emerging flux systems. Here we focus on the location and orientation of the emerging flux relative to the coronal flux rope. Varying these parameters, we investigate under which conditions an eruption of the latter is triggered.

<div> Aluminum nitrides, nucleating agent, coupled cluster theory, Murchison meteorite, rovibrational spectroscopic analysis
<br />
本文通过理论研究发现了一种新的铝氮化物形成途径，并计算了相关的振动光谱常数。该发现有潜力辅助天体物理学家在星际介质中检测到新的无机物种，这可能标志着更大的尘埃颗粒的成核过程。通过对AlH3和氨转化为Al2N2H4的反应途径和振动光谱分析，为可能在实验室或观测中的研究提供了参考。AlNH6的ν8弯曲频率为755.7 cm−1（13.23 μm），具有515 km mol−1的振动跃迁强度，比二氧化碳的对称C−O伸展更强，并且具有5.40 D的偶极矩，大约是水的3倍。 <div>
A dust nucleating agent may be present in interstellar or circumstellar media that has gone seemingly undetected and unstudied for decades. Some analyses of the Murchison CM2 meteorite suggest that at least some of the aluminum present within condensed as aluminum nitrides instead of the long-studied, but heretofore undetected suite of aluminum oxides. The present theoretical study utilizes explicitly correlated coupled cluster theory and density functional theory to provide a formation pathway from alane (AlH3) and ammonia to the cyclic structure Al2N2H4, which has the proper Al/N ratio expected of bulk aluminum nitrides. Novel rovibrational spectroscopic constants are computed for alane and the first two formed structures, AlNH6 and AlNH4, along the reaction pathway for use as reference in possible laboratory or observational studies. The ν8 bending frequency for AlNH6 at 755.7 cm−1 (13.23 μm) presents a vibrational transition intensity of 515 km mol−1, more intense than the antisymmetric C−O stretch of carbon dioxide, and contains a dipole moment of 5.40 D, which is ∼3× larger than that of water. Thus, the present reaction pathway and rovibrational spectroscopic analysis may potentially assist in the astrophysical detection of novel, inorganic species which may be indicative of larger dust grain nucleation.

总结: 
Parker Solar Probe（PSP）和Solar Orbiter（SolO）任务打开了一个新的观测窗口，对内部太阳圈层进行直接测量。研究表明，行星际震荡的局部特征以及它们的环境在它们穿越太阳圈层时可能非常不同。PSP观察表明，磁场交替将在通过震荡时被压缩，而离子回旋波的特征在震荡下游消失。相比之下，SolO的观察揭示了一个非常结构化的震荡过渡，随着太阳风结构穿越震荡，出现了高达约2MeV的震荡加速质子的特征。此外，SolO还报告了由于上游震荡导致的能量较低（约100 eV）的电子散射。 <div>
The Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar Orbiter (SolO) missions opened a new observational window in the inner heliosphere, which is finally accessible to direct measurements. On 2022 September 5, a coronal mass ejection (CME)-driven interplanetary (IP) shock was observed as close as 0.07 au by PSP. The CME then reached SolO, which was radially well-aligned at 0.7 au, thus providing us with the opportunity to study the shock properties at different heliocentric distances. We characterize the shock, investigate its typical parameters, and compare its small-scale features at both locations. Using the PSP observations, we investigate how magnetic switchbacks and ion cyclotron waves are processed upon shock crossing. We find that switchbacks preserve their V–B correlation while compressed upon the shock passage, and that the signature of ion cyclotron waves disappears downstream of the shock. By contrast, the SolO observations reveal a very structured shock transition, with a population of shock-accelerated protons of up to about 2 MeV, showing irregularities in the shock downstream, which we correlate with solar wind structures propagating across the shock. At SolO, we also report the presence of low-energy (∼100 eV) electrons scattering due to upstream shocklets. This study elucidates how the local features of IP shocks and their environments can be very different as they propagate through the heliosphere.

Active galactic nucleus (AGN) driven outflows can have a significant impact on the evolution of the host galaxy. In this work, we compare the properties of galaxies that host AGNs with and without outflows. Our sample consists of 103 AGNs identified by mid-IR color–color selection and confirmed with optical spectroscopy at a redshift range of 0.3 ≲ z ≲ 0.9. We fit the [O iii] λ5007 line using spectra from the zCOSMOS survey to identify and study the occurrence of outflows. We find that ionized outflows are present in ∼25% of our sample, with the largest incidence at the highest [O iii] and X-ray luminosity bins. The fastest outflows are found in the more extended and massive galaxies. We do not observe a difference in the star formation rate of AGNs with outflows compared to AGNs without outflows. From visual inspection and nonparametric morphological studies, we obtain that outflows are preferentially observed in galaxies with disk-type and elliptical morphologies.

We present JWST MIRI 5.6, 10, and 21 μm observations of the candidate failed supernova N6946-BH1 along with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFPC/IR 1.1 and 1.6 μm data and ongoing optical monitoring data with the Large Binocular Telescope. There is a very red, dusty source at the location of the candidate, which has only ∼10%–15% of the luminosity of the progenitor star. The source is very faint in the HST near-IR observations (∼103L⊙) and is not optically variable to a limit of ∼103L⊙ at the R band. The dust is likely silicate and probably has to be dominated by very large grains, as predicted for dust formed in a failed supernova. The required visual optical depths are modest, so it should begin to significantly brighten in the near-IR over the next few years.

The corona is a structure possessed by stars, including the Sun. The abnormal heating of the solar corona and chromosphere is one of the greatest mysteries in modern astronomy. While state-of-the-art observations have identified some candidates of magnetic activity events that could be responsible for this abnormal heating, and theoretical studies have proposed various heating modes, a complete physical picture of how they are heated as a whole remains elusive. In this study, the characteristics of the heated corona and chromosphere are investigated, and for the first time, the question of how they are abnormally heated is explicitly answered by analyzing the long-term observations of the global chromosphere in the Ca ii K line and the global corona in the coronal green line. The findings reveal that both the quiet chromosphere and corona are in antiphase with the solar cycle, whereas the active chromosphere and corona are in phase with it. Different parts of the solar corona and chromosphere exhibit significantly different variation characteristics and are found to be heated by different magnetic categories and probably in different modes. This study posits that unraveling the heating mystery is best approached through the lens of magnetic categories, rather than magnetic activity events.

Stellar-mass black holes (sBHs) embedded in gaseous disks of active galactic nuclei (AGN) can be important sources of detectable gravitational radiation for LIGO/Virgo when they form binaries and coalesce due to orbital decay. In this paper, we study the effect of dynamical friction (DF) on the formation of BH binaries in AGN disks using N-body simulations. We employ two simplified models of DF, with the force on the BH depending on Δv, the velocity of the sBH relative to the background Keplerian gas. We integrate the motion of two sBHs initially on circular orbits around the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) and evaluate the probability of binary formation under various conditions. We find that both models of DF (with different dependence of the frictional coefficient on ∣Δv∣) can foster the formation of binaries when the effective friction timescale τ satisfies ΩKτ ≲ 20–30 (where ΩK is the Keplerian frequency around the SMBH): prograde binaries are formed when the DF is stronger (smaller τ), while retrograde binaries dominate when the DF is weaker (larger τ). We determine the distribution of both prograde and retrograde binaries as a function of initial orbital separation and the DF strength. Using our models of DF, we show that for a given sBH number density in the AGN disk, the formation rate of sBH binaries increases with decreasing τ and can reach a moderate value with a sufficiently strong DF.

The blazar TXS 0506+056 has been proposed as a high-energy neutrino emitter. However, it has been shown that the standard one-zone model cannot produce sufficiently high neutrino flux due to constraints from the X-ray data, implying more complex properties of the radiation zones in the blazar than that described by the standard one-zone model. In this work, we investigate multiepoch high-energy muon-neutrino events associated with the blazar TXS 0506+056 that occurred in 2014–2015, 2017–2018, 2021–2022, and 2022–2023, respectively. We applied the so-called “stochastic dissipation model” to account for the neutrino-blazar associations detected in the four epochs simultaneously. This model describes a scenario in which the emission of the blazar arises from the superimposition of two components: a persistent component related to the quasi-stable state of the blazar and a transient component responsible for the sudden enhancement of the blazar’s flux, either in electromagnetic radiation or in neutrino emission. The latter component could form at a random distance along the jet by a strong energy dissipation event. Under such an assumption, the multiepoch broadband spectral energy distribution can be well explained, and the expected number of high-energy neutrino events is statistically realistic. The expected number of neutrino events in half year is around 8.2, 0.07, 0.73, and 0.41, corresponding to the epoch in 2014–2015, 2017–2018, 2021–2022, and 2022–2023, respectively. Hence, our model self-consistently explains the episodic neutrino emission from TXS 0506+056.

<title>First High-resolution Spectroscopy of X-Ray Absorption Lines in the Obscured State of NGC 5548</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Multiwavelength spectroscopy of NGC 5548 revealed remarkable changes due to the presence of an obscuring wind from the accretion disk. This broadened our understanding of obscuration and outflows in active galactic nuclei. Swift monitoring of NGC 5548 shows that over the last 10 yr, the obscuration has gradually declined. This provides a valuable opportunity for analyses that have not been feasible before because of too much obscuration. The lowered obscuration, together with the high-energy spectral coverage of Chandra HETG, facilitates the first study of X-ray absorption lines in the obscured state. The comparison of the lines (Mg xi, Mg xii, Si xiii, and Si xiv) between the new and historical spectra reveals interesting changes, most notably the He-like absorption being significantly diminished in 2022. Our study finds that the changes are caused by an increase in both the ionization parameter and the column density of the warm-absorber outflow in the obscured state. This is contrary to the shielding scenario that is evident in the appearance of the UV lines, where the inner obscuring wind shields outflows that are farther out, thus lowering their ionization. The X-ray absorption lines in the HETG spectra appear to be unaffected by the obscuration. The results suggest that the shielding is complex because various components of the ionized outflow are affected differently. We explore various possibilities for the variability behavior of the X-ray absorption lines and find that the orbital motion of a clumpy ionized outflow traversing our line of sight is the most likely explanation.

<title>Constraining Annihilating Dark Matter Using the Multifrequency Radio Flux Profiles of the M33 Galaxy</title>

Radio data can give stringent constraints for annihilating dark matter. In general, radio observations can detect very accurate radio flux density with high resolution and different frequencies for nearby galaxies. We are able to obtain the radio flux density as a function of distance from the galactic center and frequencies S(r, ν). In this article, we demonstrate a comprehensive radio analysis of the M33 galaxy, combining the radio flux density profile S(r) and the frequency spectrum S(ν) to get the constraints of dark matter annihilation parameters. By analyzing the archival radio data obtained from the Effelsberg telescope, we show that the dark matter annihilation contributing to the radio flux density might be insignificant in the disk region of the M33 galaxy. Moreover, by including the baryonic radio contribution, we constrain the 2σ conservative upper limits of the annihilation cross section, which can be complementary to the existing constraints based on neutrino, cosmic-ray, and gamma-ray observations. Our results indicate that analyzing the galactic multifrequency radio flux profiles can give useful and authentic constraints on dark matter for the leptophilic annihilation channels.

Poisson-FOCuS算法可以在计算成本的限制下优化地检测伽马射线暴，适用于即将推出的HERMES-Pathfinder卫星。该算法能够在实时并以较低的计算成本检测计数时间序列中的所有时间间隔，所有时间尺度和偏移，通过对历史数据进行验证，证明了该实施方案在自动背景评估方面具有更高的检测能力。其分析速度比历史Fermi-GBM的benchmark模拟器快两倍，实现了更高性能。总结:<br /><br />作者使用Poisson-FOCuS算法在小型卫星上实时检测伽马射线暴。他们通过验证和模拟数据表明，该算法在计算成本和检测能力方面都具有优势。 <div>
We describe how a novel online change-point detection algorithm, called Poisson-FOCuS, can be used to optimally detect gamma-ray bursts within the computational constraints imposed by miniaturized satellites such as the upcoming HERMES-Pathfinder constellation. Poisson-FOCuS enables testing for gamma-ray burst onset at all intervals in a count time series, across all timescales and offsets, in real time and at a fraction of the computational cost of conventional strategies. We validate an implementation with automatic background assessment through exponential smoothing, using archival data from Fermi-GBM. Through simulations of lightcurves modeled after real short and long gamma-ray bursts, we demonstrate that the same implementation has higher detection power than algorithms designed to emulate the logic of Fermi-GBM and Compton-BATSE, reaching the performance of a brute-force benchmark with oracle information on the true background rate, when not hindered by automatic background assessment. Finally, using simulated data with different lengths and means, we show that Poisson-FOCuS can analyze data twice as fast as a similarly implemented benchmark emulator for the historic Fermi-GBM on-board trigger algorithms.

总结:
频域分析可以帮助解决活动星系核的中心引擎尺寸问题。NGC 5548的时间延迟与经典的Shakura-Sunyaev盘模型的X射线再处理不一致，但CHAR模型能够很好地解释NGC 5548的时间延迟。此外，我们对Mrk 817进行了CHAR模型预测，并得到了有效于不同黑洞质量和Eddington比率范围内的时间延迟。我们还证明了CHAR模型的滞后 - 亮度关系与观测一致。未来的观测将有助于验证我们的结果，并为解决活动星系核的中心引擎提供新的见解。 <div>
Continuum reverberation mapping with high-cadence, long-term UV/optical monitoring of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) enables us to resolve the AGN central engine sizes on different timescales. The frequency-resolved time lags of NGC 5548 (the target for the AGN STORM I campaign) are inconsistent with the X-ray reprocessing of the classical Shakura–Sunyaev disk model. Here we show that the frequency-resolved time lags in NGC 5548 can be well produced by the Corona-Heated Accretion-disk Reprocessing (CHAR) model. Moreover, we make CHAR model predictions of the frequency-resolved time lags for Mrk 817, the source of the AGN STORM II campaign. We also obtain frequency-resolved time lags as a function of the BH mass and Eddington ratio, which is valid for BH masses from 106.5 to 109M⊙ and Eddington ratios from 0.01 to 1. Moreover, we demonstrate that with the time spans of current continuum reverberation-mapping campaigns, the lag–luminosity relation of the CHAR model can be , which is consistent with observations. Future observations can test our results and shed new light on resolving the AGN central engine.

总结:
脉冲星发出的宽带射电波在穿过星际介质时会受到扭曲和延迟。研究者使用CLEAN去卷积技术来恢复脉冲展宽的时间尺度，从而揭示脉冲的真实形状。通过模拟数据进行参数化，开发了一套测试来确定散射时间尺度及其不确定性。该算法在高度散射的毫秒脉冲星J1903+0327上进行了测试，显示散射时间尺度随时间变化，与脉冲星的折射时间尺度估计一致。这项研究还将改进的算法与循环光谱法进行了比较，验证了其有效性。 <div>
Broadband radio waves emitted from pulsars are distorted and delayed as they propagate toward the Earth due to interactions with the free electrons that compose the interstellar medium (ISM), with lower radio frequencies being more impacted than higher frequencies. Multipath propagation in the ISM results in both later times of arrival for the lower frequencies and causes the observed pulse to arrive with a broadened tail described via the pulse broadening function. We employ the CLEAN deconvolution technique to recover the pulse broadening timescale and by proxy the intrinsic pulse shape. This work expands upon previous descriptions of CLEAN deconvolution used in pulse broadening analyses by parameterizing the efficacy on simulated data and developing a suite of tests to establish which of a set of figures of merit leads to an automatic and consistent determination of the scattering timescale and its uncertainty. We compare our algorithm to the cyclic spectroscopy method of estimating the scattering timescale, specifically to the simulations performed in Dolch et al. (2021). We test our improved algorithm on the highly scattered millisecond pulsar J1903+0327, showing the scattering timescale to change over years, consistent with estimates of the refractive timescale of the pulsar.

本文详细分析了JWST NIRCam在八个滤波器下的点扩散函数（PSF），发现PSF的空间变化随波长增加而减少。且研究比较了构建模型PSF的三种常用方法，并得出PSFEx表现最佳的结论。通过模拟宽线活动星系核（AGN）的图像，评估了PSF不匹配对宿主星系属性恢复的影响。结果发现，使用不匹配的PSF模型通常会高估宿主星系的通量，同时影响宿主测量的系统误差通常大于形式拟合误差。此外，图像分解也可能导致AGN和宿主星系之间的人工偏移，这种现象在高表面亮度的宿主星系中更为常见。文章最后通过一个在CEERS领域的z = 1.646的宽线类星体示例展示了他们的PSF构建和图像分解方法。 <br /><br />总结: 本文研究了JWST NIRCam的PSF特性，评估了PSF不匹配对宿主星系属性恢复的影响，并提出了PSF构建和图像分解的方法。 <div>
We present a detailed analysis of the point-spread function (PSF) of JWST NIRCam imaging in eight filters: F070W, F115W, F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F444W, and F480M, using publicly available data. Spatial variations in the PSF FWHM generally decrease with wavelength: the maximum and rms fractional variations are ∼20% and 5% in F070W, reduced to ∼3% and 0.6% in F444W. We compare three commonly used methods (SWarp, photutils, and PSFEx) to construct model PSFs and conclude that PSFEx delivers the best performance. Using simulated images of broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs), we evaluate the impact of PSF mismatches on the recoverability of host galaxy properties. Host fluxes are generally overestimated when adopting mismatched PSF models, with larger overestimation for more AGN-dominated systems. Broader PSFs tend to produce less concentrated hosts, while narrower PSFs tend to produce more concentrated and compact hosts. Systematic uncertainties in host measurements from PSF and model mismatches are generally larger than the formal fitting uncertainties for high signal-to-noise ratio data. Image decomposition can also lead to an artificial offset between the AGN and host centroids, which is common (e.g., >1σ [3σ] detection in ∼80% [∼20%–30%] of systems), and scales with the mean host surface brightness (SB). Near the SB limit, this artificial offset can reach as large as ∼80%, 26%, and 7% of Re in systems with Re = 0.″12, 0.″48, and 1.″92, respectively. We demonstrate our PSF construction and image decomposition methods with an example broad-line quasar at z = 1.646 in the CEERS field.

总结:
这篇文章讨论了恒星自转周期、年龄的精确测量，以及磁制动的强度和与标准自转减速的偏离程度。通过利用恒星振动学，可以测量出比太阳更老的恒星的自转周期，从而可以对更大范围的老场星进行模型测试。研究发现，通过神经网络和层次化模型拟合方法的结合，可以限制磁制动减弱的开始时间。研究还表明，磁制动减弱在恒星演化到太阳阶段之前就开始了，对于类太阳恒星的主序阶段约有一半的寿命存在挑战。此外，还发现了临界罗斯比数的阈值为Rocrit/Ro⊙ = 0.91 ± 0.03。不同物理假设下的模型网格对于推断制动定律的属性有影响。这些发现对于恒星年龄的测定和自转周期的推断具有重要意义。<br /><br /> <div>
Despite a growing sample of precisely measured stellar rotation periods and ages, the strength of magnetic braking and the degree of departure from standard (Skumanich-like) spin-down have remained persistent questions, particularly for stars more evolved than the Sun. Rotation periods can be measured for stars older than the Sun by leveraging asteroseismology, enabling models to be tested against a larger sample of old field stars. Because asteroseismic measurements of rotation do not depend on starspot modulation, they avoid potential biases introduced by the need for a stellar dynamo to drive starspot production. Using a neural network trained on a grid of stellar evolution models and a hierarchical model-fitting approach, we constrain the onset of weakened magnetic braking (WMB). We find that a sample of stars with asteroseismically measured rotation periods and ages is consistent with models that depart from standard spin-down prior to reaching the evolutionary stage of the Sun. We test our approach using neural networks trained on model grids produced by separate stellar evolution codes with differing physical assumptions and find that the choices of grid physics can influence the inferred properties of the braking law. We identify the normalized critical Rossby number Rocrit/Ro⊙ = 0.91 ± 0.03 as the threshold for the departure from standard rotational evolution. This suggests that WMB poses challenges to gyrochronology for roughly half of the main-sequence lifetime of Sun-like stars.

总结: 本研究针对NGC 2264的星形成区进行了850μm的连续波偏振观测，并发现了非均匀结构的磁场。NGC 2264C地区受到重力的全局支配，而在2264D地区，磁、引力和动能之间的平衡。根据本地解析的磁场结构、重力矢量场和提取的纤维网络，推断出纤维网络主要由两组近似垂直的纤维组成。此外，重力显示出一个主导的汇聚方向，大致垂直于一个纤维方向，暗示着沿着这个方向的物质吸积。我们鉴别出两种类型的纤维，即I型纤维垂直于磁场，而II型纤维平行于磁场。我们解释这两种纤维的产生是由于受到纤维自身引力驱动的径向坍缩和受到区域全局引力驱动的纵向坍缩之间的竞争。 <div>
We report 850 μm continuum polarization observations toward the filamentary high-mass star-forming region NGC 2264, taken as part of the B-fields In STar forming Regions Observations large program on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. These data reveal a well-structured nonuniform magnetic field in the NGC 2264C and 2264D regions with a prevailing orientation around 30° from north to east. Field strength estimates and a virial analysis of the major clumps indicate that NGC 2264C is globally dominated by gravity, while in 2264D, magnetic, gravitational, and kinetic energies are roughly balanced. We present an analysis scheme that utilizes the locally resolved magnetic field structures, together with the locally measured gravitational vector field and the extracted filamentary network. From this, we infer statistical trends showing that this network consists of two main groups of filaments oriented approximately perpendicular to one another. Additionally, gravity shows one dominating converging direction that is roughly perpendicular to one of the filament orientations, which is suggestive of mass accretion along this direction. Beyond these statistical trends, we identify two types of filaments. The type I filament is perpendicular to the magnetic field with local gravity transitioning from parallel to perpendicular to the magnetic field from the outside to the filament ridge. The type II filament is parallel to the magnetic field and local gravity. We interpret these two types of filaments as originating from the competition between radial collapsing, driven by filament self-gravity, and longitudinal collapsing, driven by the region's global gravity.

在最近的研究中，发现磁性阻滞盘（MAD）能够产生强大的喷流，在许多吸积系统中都有观察到。本研究使用cuHARM对14个广义相对论磁流体模拟了黑洞自旋下的MAD状态的吸积支配吸积流。主要发现如下：（i）喷流以Maxwell应力的形式将大量角动量输运至无穷远。对于正值高自旋情况下，角动量输运率比负自旋情况下高出约五倍，而对于非旋转黑洞来说，这一贡献几乎可以忽略不计。（ii）质量吸积率和在视界处计算的MAD参数之间没有相关性，但是它们的时间导数对于每个自旋都是负相关的。（iii）对于零自旋，磁场的径向分量对磁压的贡献可以忽略不计，而对于高自旋的黑洞来说，与径向磁场分量的贡献相当。对于高正自旋情况下，甚至磁场的垂直分量占主导地位。（iv）对于负的自旋，喷流比正自旋情况下更窄，而且波动更强烈。非旋转黑洞的弱喷流是最宽的，波动最弱。我们的研究突显了MAD状态下黑洞自旋与盘和喷流特性之间的复杂非线性关系。

<br /><br />总结:研究表明，MAD状态下黑洞自旋与盘和喷流特性之间存在复杂而非线性的关系，具体表现为喷流通过Maxwell应力以及质量吸积率和MAD参数的时间导数呈负相关。此外，不同自旋情况下磁场构成的不同，对于负自旋喷流更窄波动更强，而非旋转黑洞的喷流最宽波动最弱。 <div>
The study of magnetically arrested disks (MAD) has attracted strong interest in recent years because these disk configurations were found to generate strong jets, as observed in many accreting systems. Here, we present the results of 14 general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of advection-dominated accretion flow in the MAD state across black hole (BH) spins, carried out with cuHARM. Our main findings are as follows. (i) The jets transport a significant amount of angular momentum to infinity in the form of Maxwell stresses. For positive, high spin, the rate of angular momentum transport is about five times higher than for negative spin. This contribution is nearly absent for a nonrotating BH. (ii) The mass accretion rate and the MAD parameter, both calculated at the horizon, are not correlated. However, their time derivatives are anticorrelated for every spin. (iii) For zero spin, the contribution of the toroidal component of the magnetic field to the magnetic pressure is negligible, while for a fast-spinning BH, it is on the same order as the contribution of the radial magnetic component. For high positive spin, the toroidal component even dominates. (iv) For negative spins, the jets are narrower than their positive-spin counterparts, while their fluctuations are stronger. The weak jet from the nonrotating BH is the widest with the weakest fluctuations. Our results highlight the complex nonlinear connection between the black hole spin and the resulting disk and jet properties in the MAD regime.

总结:
利用Very Large Array进行了针对IRAS 19035+0641 A的1.3 cm连续波和22.2 GHz H2O激射观测。发现了一个在尺度≲500 au的延长的双极性1.3 cm连续波结构，与上升的带内谱指数一起，强烈暗示指向IRAS 19035+0641 A的射流是电离的。此外，还确定了8个水激射点，它们与射流轴线很好地对齐。最亮的H2O激射线Stokes V谱显示可能的泽曼分裂，并且可以用拟合到Stokes I谱形的两个高斯成分的导数很好地表示。测得的Blos分别为123 (±27)和156 (±8) mG，相应的预激震磁场约为7 mG。后续的观测证实了泽曼分裂，并且发现了所有水激射点的强烈变化，其中最亮的激射完全消失。在1年的时间尺度内观察到的变化可能是一个吸积事件的结果。这些发现加强了对IRAS 19035+0641 A作为处于早期吸积/流出演化阶段的高质量原恒星的解释。 <div>
We present Very Large Array 1.3 cm continuum and 22.2 GHz H2O maser observations of the high-mass protostellar object IRAS 19035+0641 A. Our observations unveil an elongated bipolar 1.3 cm continuum structure at scales ≲500 au, which, together with a rising in-band spectral index, strongly suggests that the radio emission toward IRAS 19035+0641 A arises from an ionized jet. In addition, eight individual water maser spots well aligned with the jet axis were identified. The Stokes V spectrum of the brightest H2O maser line (∼100 Jy) shows a possible Zeeman splitting and is well represented by the derivatives of two Gaussian components fitted to the Stokes I profile. The measured Blos are 123 (±27) and 156 (±8) mG, translating to a preshock magnetic field of ≈7 mG. Subsequent observations to confirm the Zeeman splitting showed intense variability in all the water maser spots, with the brightest maser completely disappearing. The observed variability in a 1 yr timescale could be the result of an accretion event. These findings strengthen our interpretation of IRAS 19035+0641 A as a high-mass protostar in an early accretion/outflow evolutionary phase.

Photodissociated gas bears the signature of the dynamical evolution of the ambient interstellar medium impacted by the mechanical and radiative feedback from an expanding H ii region. Here we present an analysis of the kinematics of the young Trifid Nebula, based on velocity-resolved observations of the far-infrared fine structure lines of [C ii] at 158 μm and [O i] at 63 μm. The distribution of the photodissociated regions (PDRs) surrounding the nebula is consistent with a shell-like structure created by the H ii region expanding at a velocity of 5 km s−1. Comparison of ratios of [C ii] and [O i]63 μm intensities for identical velocity components with PDR models indicate a density of 104 cm−3. The redshifted and blueshifted PDR shells with a combined mass of 516 M⊙ have a kinetic energy of ∼1047 erg. This is consistent with the thermal energy of the H ii region as well as with the energy deposited by the stellar wind luminosity from HD 169442A, an O7 V star, over the 0.5 Myr lifetime of the star. The observed momentum of the PDR shell is lower than what theoretical calculations predict for the radial momentum due to the shell being swept up by an expanding H ii region, which suggests that significant mass loss has occurred in M20 due to the dispersal of the surrounding gas by the advancing ionization front.

本研究对N v X射线发射线进行了实验测量，发现其强度约为共振线的五分之一。此外，还提供了融合线的波长数据，并进行了原子结构计算的测试，结果与理论计算方法的计算结果相吻合。这些实验和理论数据为精确的静止波长提供了基准，可帮助确定活跃星系核和其他天体物质吸收特征的速度。 <div>
We present laboratory measurements of n = 3 → n = 1 N v X-ray emission lines situated near 26 Å. The lines are excited by electron-impact collisions and are shown to reach a combined intensity of about a fifth of the combined strong N v 1s2s2p2P1/2,3/2 → 1s22s2S1/2 resonance lines, commonly labeled q and r, at 29.4 Å. In addition, we present new experimental data for the wavelength of the blended q and r lines at 29.4 Å, as well as for that of the blended inner-shell-excited N v lines u and v at 30.0 Å. All of these collisional N v lines need to be included in astrophysical emission models in order to properly account for flux from N v in the soft X-ray region. The measured wavelengths provide benchmarks for testing atomic structure calculations and excellent agreement is found with our calculations using the many-body perturbation theory method. We provide a complete listing of the N v energy levels with valence electrons in the n = 2, 3, and 4 shells calculated with this approach. The experimental and theoretical data, thus, provide accurate rest-frame wavelengths needed for velocity determinations based on high-resolution absorption features in spectra of warm absorbers in active galactic nuclei and other astrophysical objects.

<div> 关键词: dark galaxies, IllustrisTNG, 暗物质晕, 星等

总结: 本研究利用IllustrisTNG宇宙水动力学模拟研究了暗物质星系的形成和演化。首先识别了具有恒星质量-总质量比M*/Mtot小于10−4的暗物质星系，与具有M*/Mtot ≥ 10−4的发光星系不同。然后选择了具有大约10^9h-1M⊙暗物质暗物质晕质量的星系，比较它们的物理特性与发光星系。发现，在当今宇宙（z = 0）中，暗物质星系主要位于无星形气体的空洞区域。此外，暗物质星系倾向于具有比较大的尺寸和更高的自旋参数。在早期宇宙中，暗物质星系和发光星系在自旋和局部环境估计的分布上存在较小差异，随着演化，这两个样本之间的差异变得更加显著。研究结果表明，与发光星系不同，暗物质星系倾向于最初形成在密度较小的区域，并且由于宇宙复电离的加热以及与其他含有恒星的系统的相互作用和并合较少而无法形成恒星。这项基于数值模拟的研究能够为验证观测中的暗物质星系候选者和约束星系形成模型提供重要线索。 <div>
We study the formation and evolution of dark galaxies using the IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamical simulation. We first identify dark galaxies with stellar-to-total mass ratios, M*/Mtot, smaller than 10−4, which differ from luminous galaxies with M*/Mtot ≥ 10−4. We then select the galaxies with a dark matter halo mass of ∼109h−1M⊙ for mass completeness and compare their physical properties with those of luminous galaxies. We find that, at the present epoch (z = 0), dark galaxies are predominantly located in void regions without star-forming gas. We also find that dark galaxies tend to have larger sizes and higher spin parameters than luminous galaxies. In the early universe, dark and luminous galaxies show small differences in the distributions of spin and local environment estimates, and the difference between the two samples becomes more significant as they evolve. Our results suggest that, unlike luminous galaxies, dark galaxies tend to be initially formed in less dense regions and could not form stars because of heating from cosmic reionization and few interactions and mergers with other systems containing stars. This study based on numerical simulations can provide important hints for validating dark galaxy candidates in observations and for constraining galaxy formation models.

总结:<br /><br />研究比较了在A2744星系团中使用ALMA 1.2毫米数据和SCUBA-2 450和850 μm成像的效果。结果显示，将SCUBA-2数据与JWST红外观测相结合可以更有效地发现微弱尘埃星系的存在。通过比对观测结果，研究确认约95%的微弱尘埃星系，并且借助红外先验条件还可以进一步深入ALMA图像观测。同时，发现46/69的ALMA源在850 μm波段有信号，24/69在450 μm波段也有信号，总检测率接近75%。另外，发现SCUBA-2检测到的比例在z=3后略有下降，推测这可能与ALMA选择以及波段之间的信号比有关。这项研究强调了结合SCUBA-2数据和JWST颜色观测可以更好地绘制微弱尘埃星系的能力。 <div>
We make a comparison of deep SCUBA-2 450 and 850 μm imaging on the massive lensing cluster field A2744 with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) 1.2 mm data. Our primary goal is to assess how effective the wider-field SCUBA-2 sample, in combination with red JWST priors, is for finding faint dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) compared to the much more expensive mosaicked ALMA observations. We cross-match our previously reported direct (>5σ) SCUBA-2 sample and red JWST NIRCam prior-selected (>3σ) SCUBA-2 sample to direct ALMA sources from the DUALZ survey. We find that roughly 95% are confirmed by ALMA. The red priors also allow us to probe deeper in the ALMA image. Next, by measuring the 450 and 850 μm properties of the full ALMA sample, we show that 46/69 of the ALMA sources are detected at 850 μm and 24/69 are detected at 450 μm in the SCUBA-2 images, with a total detection fraction of nearly 75%. All of the robust (>5σ) ALMA sources that are not detected in at least one SCUBA-2 band lie at 1.2 mm fluxes ≲0.6 mJy and are undetected primarily due to the higher SCUBA-2 flux limits. We also find that the SCUBA-2 detection fraction drops slightly beyond z = 3, which we attribute to the increasing 1.2 mm to 850 μm and 1.2 mm to 450 μm flux ratios combined with the ALMA selection. The results emphasize the power of combining SCUBA-2 data with JWST colors to map the faint DSFG population.

<div> 关键词: Mars, MAVEN, solar wind, deceleration, pickup ions
总结:<br /><br />这项研究使用Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN)获取的粒子和磁场测量数据，研究了火星弓形震波上游的太阳风减速情况。研究发现，平均太阳风减速约为初始太阳风速度的0.7%，远小于先前研究得出的数值。进一步的计算表明，这种观察到的减速与捕获离子质量装载场景是一致的。这一发现对太阳风与火星上层大气的相互作用有重要意义。 <div>
The solar wind deceleration upstream of the Martian bow shock is examined using particle and magnetic field measurements obtained by the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN). Mars lacks a strong intrinsic magnetic field so its upper atmosphere extends beyond the Martian bow shock and interacts directly with the solar wind. Neutral atoms in the Martian upper atmosphere can be ionized through several physical processes and then start to move with the solar wind flow to form pickup ions. In return, the solar wind is expected to slow down due to the momentum transfer to the pickup ions. The present study surveys the MAVEN solar wind measurements between 2015 and 2019 to evaluate the solar wind deceleration upstream of the Martian bow shock. Different from previous studies of solar wind deceleration, our analysis carefully excludes the solar wind deceleration in the shock foot region. The average solar wind deceleration obtained is about 0.7% of the initial solar wind speed, much smaller than the values given by previous studies. Further calculation using several reasonable Martian upper atmosphere density profiles demonstrates that the deceleration observed is consistent with the pickup ion mass-loading scenario.

<title>The Missing Symbiotic Stars: A Joint Analysis with Gaia, GALEX, and XMM-Newton Data</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The existence of a population of low-accretion-rate symbiotic stars (SySts), consisting of a giant star and a compact companion (usually a white dwarf), has been proposed recently. However, their population has not been fully understood. In this work, we present an investigation on SySts candidates consisting of asymptotic giant branch stars (AGBs) by cross-correlating the Gaia DR3, the Galaxy Evolution Explorer All-Sky Imaging Survey, and the 4XMM DR13 catalogs. We first build a sample of AGBs within 500 pc based on their locations in the Gaia color–absolute magnitude diagram. We then explore the UV and X-ray properties of the sampled AGBs and compare them to known SySts and candidates. We find 10 SySts candidates based on the far-ultraviolet excess. The typical UV luminosity of the candidates is 1031 erg s−1, which corresponds to a typical accretion rate of 10−12–10−11M⊙ yr−1, which is more than 1 order of magnitude lower than known SySts. Based on these findings, the total number of SySts within 500 pc is estimated to be 18. The number of AGBs with X-ray flux above 10−14 erg s−1 cm−2 within 500 pc is estimated to be 37. Our finding implies that a large number of low-accretion-rate SySts are yet to be detected, which provides a base for a complete understanding of their population.

<title>Analysis of the 3.2–3.3 μm Interstellar Absorption Feature on Three Milky Way Sightlines</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad1245</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report new analyses of spectra of the 3.2–3.3 μm absorption feature observed in the diffuse interstellar medium toward three Milky Way sources: 2MASS J17470898 − 2829561 (2M1747) and the Quintuplet Cluster, both located in the Galactic center, and Cygnus OB2-12. The 3.2–3.3 μm interval coincides with the CH-stretching region for compact polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). We focus on the 2M1747 spectrum. Its published optical depth spectrum contains residual telluric transmission features, which arise from the 0.06 difference in mean airmasses between the observations of the source and its telluric standard star. We corrected the published spectrum by adding the airmass residual optical depth spectrum. The corrected spectrum is well fit by a superposition of four Gaussians. The absorption spectra of the other two sources were also fit by four Gaussians, with similar central wavelengths, widths, and relative peak opacities. We associate the three longer wavelength Gaussians covering the 3.23–3.31 μm interval with compact PAHs in positive, neutral, and negative charge states. We identify the shortest-wavelength Gaussian, near 3.21 μm, with irregularly shaped PAHs. Constraints imposed by spectral smoothness on the corrected 2M1747 spectrum, augmented by a PAH cluster formation model for post-asymptotic giant branch stars, suggests that >99% of the PAHs in the diffuse interstellar medium reside in small clusters. This study supports the PAH hypothesis, and it suggests that a family of primarily compact PAHs with a C66H20 (circumvalene) parent is consistent with the observed mid-infrared and ultraviolet interstellar absorption spectrum.

<div> 神经网络, 超新星, 56Ni质量, TARDIS模型, 光谱数据
总结:
本研究训练了一组基于1D辐射传输代码TARDIS的深度神经网络，用于模拟超新星爆炸后10至40天内的Ia型超新星（SNe Ia）的光学光谱。这些神经网络被应用于推导一组124个观测良好的SNe Ia样本中的速度范围在光球以上的56Ni质量。一部分SNe具有多时相观测数据，可以用56Ni的衰变来定量测试AIAI。采用观测光谱数据进行的AIAI推导的56Ni质量与56Ni的放射性衰变速率相吻合。AIAI揭示了与Ni ii 4067Å线相关的3890Å附近的光谱特征，而从AIAI中推导的56Ni质量与SNe Ia的光变曲线形状相关联，光度曲线较宽的SNe Ia在光球以上的外壳中显示出更大的56Ni质量。AIAI使得SNe的光谱数据可以在基于明确定义的物理假设的理论框架下进行定量分析。 <div>
Following our previous study of Artificial Intelligence Assisted Inversion (AIAI) of supernova analyses, we train a set of deep neural networks based on the 1D radiative transfer code TARDIS to simulate the optical spectra of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) between 10 and 40 days after the explosion. The neural networks are applied to derive the mass of 56Ni in velocity ranges above the photosphere for a sample of 124 well-observed SNe Ia in the TARDIS model context. A subset of the SNe have multi-epoch observations for which the decay of the radioactive 56Ni can be used to test the AIAI quantitatively. The 56Ni mass derived from AIAI using the observed spectra as inputs for this subset agrees with the radioactive decay rate of 56Ni. AIAI reveals that a spectral signature near 3890 Å is related to the Ni ii 4067Å line, and the 56Ni mass deduced from AIAI is found to be correlated with the light-curve shapes of SNe Ia, with SNe Ia with broader light curves showing larger 56Ni mass in the envelope above the photosphere. AIAI enables spectral data of SNe to be quantitatively analyzed under theoretical frameworks based on well-defined physical assumptions.

<br />这篇文章报告了在GOODS-S场中使用JWST/NIRCam成像和FRESCO进行的广角狭缝光谱仪成像发现了一个在z = 5.4处的极端星系过密度。通过使用λ = 0.4–5.0 μm的哈勃空间望远镜+JWST光度测定确定了过密度潜在成员。随后通过JWST狭缝光谱仪在λ = 3.9–5.0 μm范围内对Hα进行了目标线搜索，确认了5.2 < z < 5.5处81个星系，其中42个在场内，39个在密度约为随机体积的10倍的区域内。从光度测定中推断这些星系的恒星群，并构建了星系的主序，发现原星团成员相对于场内星系拥有更大的质量和更早的星形成。根据经验恒星质量到暗物质晕的关系，估计了这一大尺度结构的总暗物质质量，但由于不完整性，这可能是一个低估。我们的发现展示了JWST在非常早期的宇宙时期约束暗物质晕组装和星系形成的能力。 <br /><br />总结: 该研究使用JWST探测到了z = 5.4处的星系过密度，通过光度测定和狭缝光谱仪确认了81个星系，并研究了它们的恒星群，发现了这一大尺度结构的重要特征，展示了JWST在非常早期宇宙时期的强大能力。 <div>
We report the discovery of an extreme galaxy overdensity at z = 5.4 in the GOODS-S field using James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)/NIRCam imaging from JADES and JEMS alongside JWST/NIRCam wide-field slitless spectroscopy from FRESCO. We identified potential members of the overdensity using Hubble Space Telescope+JWST photometry spanning λ = 0.4–5.0 μm. These data provide accurate and well-constrained photometric redshifts down to m ≈ 29–30 mag. We subsequently confirmed N = 81 galaxies at 5.2 < z < 5.5 using JWST slitless spectroscopy over λ = 3.9–5.0 μm through a targeted line search for Hα around the best-fit photometric redshift. We verified that N = 42 of these galaxies reside in the field, while N = 39 galaxies reside in a density around ∼10 times that of a random volume. Stellar populations for these galaxies were inferred from the photometry and used to construct the star-forming main sequence, where protocluster members appeared more massive and exhibited earlier star formation (and thus older stellar populations) when compared to their field galaxy counterparts. We estimate the total halo mass of this large-scale structure to be using an empirical stellar mass to halo mass relation, which is likely an underestimate as a result of incompleteness. Our discovery demonstrates the power of JWST at constraining dark matter halo assembly and galaxy formation at very early cosmic times.

总结:<br />
这篇文章报道了使用TESS光度测量发现了九颗新的超新星变星，它们具有负超黄短周期信号。其中三颗星在矮新星爆发期间仍具有负超黄信号，并且该信号的振幅会随着爆发的变化而变化。另外六颗星的研究较少，这是首次确定它们的轨道周期、负超黄信号和超轨道信号周期。研究还发现其中两颗星的负超黄周期和振幅会随着超轨道信号周期的变化而变化。文章指出，负超黄振幅随着爆发的变化可以成为研究负超黄来源和改进盘不稳定模型的重要依据。同时，文章也认为单一倾斜盘角度的变化不能完全解释超轨道信号的观测结果，需要考虑其他因素。 <div>
Negative superhumps (NSHs) are signals a few percent shorter than the orbital period of a binary star and are considered to originate from the reverse precession of the tilted disk. Based on TESS photometry, we find nine new cataclysmic variable stars with NSHs. Three (ASAS J1420, TZ Per, and V392 Hya) of these stars similar to AH Her still have NSHs during dwarf nova outbursts, and the NSH amplitude varies with the outburst. The variation in the radius of the accretion disk partially explains this phenomenon. However, it does not explain the rebound of the NSH amplitude after the peak of the outburst and the fact that the NSH amplitude of the quiescence is sometimes not the largest, and it is necessary to include the disk instability model (DIM) and add other ingredients. Therefore, we suggest that the variation of NSH amplitude with outburst can be an important basis for studying the origin of NSHs and improving the DIM. The six (ASASSN-V J1137, ASASSN-V J0611, 2MASS J0715, LAMOST J0925, ASASSN-17qj, and ZTF 18acakuxo) remaining stars have been poorly studied, and for the first time we determine their orbital periods, NSHs, and superorbital signal (SOR) periods. The NSH periods and amplitudes of ASASSN-V J1137 and ASASSN-17qj vary with the SOR, and based on the comparison of the observations with the theory, we suggest that a single change in tilted disk angle does not explain the observations of the SOR and that other ingredients need to be considered as well.

<br /><br />总结: Changing-look AGNs是一类特殊的活动星系核，其物理特性介于FSRQs和BL Lacs之间。通过高斯混合模型分析，研究发现CLBs可能是由于吸积过程改变而产生的过渡类型，对理解CLBs的物理特性具有重要意义。 <div>
Changing-look active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are a special class of AGNs that change their spectral type from type 1 to type 2 or vice versa. In recent years, a number of changing-look blazars (CLBs) were also reported, which transition between flat-spectrum radio quasars and BL Lacs. The physical properties of CLBs are still unclear. Using the mclust R package for Gaussian mixture modeling, we performed a clustering analysis for a sample of 105 CLBs selected from the literature. Three kinds of analysis found that CLBs lie in between the parameter distributions of FSRQs and BL Lacs: (i) univariate analysis; (ii) bivariate analysis; and (iii) multivariate analysis, carried out with a dimension reduction approach of the physical properties of the three types of blazars. Our results suggest that CLBs belong to a transition type between FSRQs and BL Lacs, which may be regulated by the change of accretion process and may be similar to other changing-look AGNs.

超大质量黑洞能够通过旋转超辐射放大入射的玻色子波，诱导超轻量玻色子围绕它们形成束缚态。这种现象有潜力限制新玻色子的参数空间。轴子和轴子样粒子（ALP）是候选的超标准模型粒子，它们可以在超大质量黑洞（SMBH）周围形成这样的尘埃云，并通过轴子-光子耦合对偏振信号产生类似法拉第旋转的影响。之前的努力利用事件视界望远镜（EHT）M87 2017年观测的偏振图像来限制无量纲轴子-光子耦合到以前未曾探索的区域。然而，借助新的校准不敏感量、闭合迹和共轭闭合迹积，可以约束轴子云的存在，同时避免系统误差的主要来源，例如站点增益和极化泄漏。我们利用M87*的偏振图的简单几何模型，通过模拟和实际数据集拟合模型参数，并在M87中达到了可比较的排除轴子云的精度水平。我们的方法的未来应用包括事件视界望远镜和下一代事件视界望远镜对M87*和Sgr A*的观测，预计将在更广泛的轴子和ALP质量范围内产生更强的约束。由于它不需要成像，闭合迹分析可以应用于成像边缘的目标活动星系核，大大扩展了可以从中得到轴子限制的超大质量黑洞的数量。 <br /><br />总结:黑洞可以通过超旋转辐射放大入射的玻色子波，诱导围绕它们形成束缚态。轴子和轴子样粒子可以形成尘埃云并影响偏振信号。利用闭合迹分析可以约束轴子云的存在，避免系统误差。未来的观测预计会产生更强的约束，扩展了限制轴子的超大质量黑洞的范围。 <div>
Black holes can amplify incoming bosonic waves via rotational superradiance, inducing bound states of ultralight bosons around them. This phenomenon has the potential to confine the parameter spaces of new bosons. Axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) are candidate beyond-standard-model particles that can form such clouds around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and impact the polarization signal in a similar fashion to Faraday rotation via axion–photon coupling. Prior efforts have used polarized images from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) M87 2017 observations to limit the dimensionless axion–photon coupling to previously unexplored regions. However, with the novel calibration-insensitive quantities, closure traces, and conjugate closure trace products, it is possible to constrain the existence of axion clouds while avoiding the dominant sources of systematic uncertainties, e.g., station gains and polarization leakages. We utilize a simple geometric model for the polarization map of M87* to fit the model parameters with both simulated and real data sets and reach a comparable level of constraint in the accuracy with which an axion cloud may be excluded in M87. Future applications of our approach include subsequent M87* and Sgr A* observations by EHT and the next-generation EHT that are expected to produce stronger constraints across a wider range of axion and ALP masses. Because it does not require imaging, closure trace analyses may be applied to target active galactic nuclei for which imaging is marginal, extending the number of SMBHs from which axion limits may be obtained significantly.

The structure and dynamics of the star-forming disk of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) have long confounded us. The SMC is widely used as a prototype for galactic physics at low metallicity, and yet we fundamentally lack an understanding of the structure of its interstellar medium (ISM). In this work, we present a new model for the SMC by comparing the kinematics of young, massive stars with the structure of the ISM traced by high-resolution observations of neutral atomic hydrogen (H i) from the Galactic Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder survey. Specifically, we identify thousands of young, massive stars with precise radial velocity constraints from the Gaia and APOGEE surveys and match these stars to the ISM structures in which they likely formed. By comparing the average dust extinction toward these stars, we find evidence that the SMC is composed of two structures with distinct stellar and gaseous chemical compositions. We construct a simple model that successfully reproduces the observations and shows that the ISM of the SMC is arranged into two superimposed, star-forming systems with similar gas mass separated by ∼5 kpc along the line of sight.

<div> NOEMA, CO, H2O, quasars, excitation
总结:
本研究使用NOEMA对两个红移约为6的类星体进行了观测，发现它们的CO谱线能量分布（SLED）分别显示出最高和最低的激发水平。对P215−16进行的辐射传输建模表明，由活动星系核加热的分子气体可能是高CO激发的合理来源。而对J1429+5447的CO SLED分析显示，来自单个光解区的成分可以解释这个射电明亮类星体中的CO激发。这项工作突显了CO SLED在揭示红移最高的年轻类星体-星爆系统中的星际介质属性方面的实用性。CO SLED的多样性揭示了这些早期演化阶段的气体条件和激发机制的复杂性。 <div>
We present observations using the Northern Extended Millimetre Array (NOEMA) of CO and H2O emission lines and the underlying dust continuum in two quasars at z ∼ 6, i.e., P215−16 at z = 5.78 and J1429+5447 at z = 6.18. Notably, among all published CO spectral line energy distributions (SLEDs) of quasars at z ∼ 6, the two systems reveal the highest and the lowest CO levels of excitation, respectively. Our radiative transfer modeling of the CO SLED of P215−16 suggests that the molecular gas heated by active galactic nuclei could be a plausible origin for the high CO excitation. For J1429+5447, we obtain the first well-sampled CO SLED (from transitions from 2−1 to 10−9) of a radio-loud quasar at z ≳ 6. Analysis of the CO SLED suggests that a component from a single photodissociation region could explain the CO excitation in the radio-loud quasar J1429+5447. This work highlights the utility of the CO SLED in uncovering the properties of the interstellar medium in these young quasar–starburst systems at the highest redshift. The diversity of the CO SLEDs reveals the complexities in gas conditions and excitation mechanisms at their early evolutionary stage.

<div> 关键词: 太阳式振荡，恒星质量，金属丰度，三维模拟，尺度关系<br />
总结: <br />
该研究利用现代空间任务探测到的太阳式振荡，对成千上万颗恒星的质量和年龄进行测量，并应用于银河考古学研究。研究表明，尺度关系并非只与有效温度和表面重力成正比，而是受金属丰度影响。通过进行三维近表面对流模拟，研究发现振荡频率与金属丰度呈负相关，与之前使用一维模型得出的正相关结果矛盾。此外，研究对振动速度进行理论估计，结果表明在太阳的有效温度和表面重力下，并不呈现出与金属丰度的相关性。这一研究提出了一个令人兴奋的前景，即通过真实的三维流体动力学恒星模型来测试天体测震尺度关系。 <br /> <div>
Solar-like oscillations have been detected in thousands of stars thanks to modern space missions. These oscillations have been used to measure stellar masses and ages, which have been widely applied in Galactic archeology. One of the pillars of such applications is the scaling relation: the frequency of maximum power , assumed to be proportional to the acoustic cutoff frequency, νac, scales with effective temperature and surface gravity. However, the theoretical basis of the scaling relation is uncertain, and there is an ongoing debate about whether it can be applied to metal-poor stars. We investigate the metallicity dependence of the scaling relation by carrying out 3D near-surface convection simulations for solar-type stars with [Fe/H] between −3 and 0.5 dex. First, we found a negative correlation between νac and metallicity from the 3D models. This is in tension with the positive correlation identified by studies using 1D models. Second, we estimated theoretical values using velocity amplitudes determined from first principles, by quantifying the mode excitation and damping rates with methods validated in our previous works. We found that does not show correlation with metallicity at solar effective temperature and surface gravity. This study opens an exciting prospect of testing the asteroseismic scaling relations against realistic 3D hydrodynamical stellar models.

<div> 关键词: SN-associated GRB, multiwavelength properties, afterglow, central engine, top-hat jet model

总结:
本研究深入探讨了附近超新星（SN）相关的低亮度伽马射线暴（GRB）171205A的多波段特性，以综合限制其物理起源。我们发现脉冲宽度与能量呈幂律关系，这与其他SN/GRBs的指数一致，但大于长GRBs的指数。分析预警伽马射线和X射线平台的总体光变曲线后，推断早期X射线和伽马射线应反映了中心发动机的活动，而晚期X射线可能受外部冲击与周围物质的相互作用的影响。此外，我们发现GRB 171205A的宿主无线电流量和偏移与其他附近低亮度GRB的情况相似。采用九个带有测定偏移的SN/GRB建立了峰值光度（Lγ,p）与谱滞后（τ）之间的关系，得到Lγ,p ∝ τ−1.91±0.33。发现12个SN/GRB和10个长寿命超新星相关的GRB的峰值光度和投影物理偏移之间有适度的相关性，暗示它们具有不同的祖先。通过顶帽形射流模型拟合的多波段余辉表明，GRB 171205A的射流半展开角和视角分别约为34.°4和41.°8，暗示正面以外的发射受到外周囊层的主导，而不是射流核心。 <div>
Multiwavelength properties of the nearby supernova (SN)-associated low-luminosity GRB 171205A are investigated in depth to constrain its physical origin synthetically. The pulse width is found to be correlated with energy with a power-law index of −0.24 ± 0.07, which is consistent with the indices of other SN-associated gamma-ray bursts (SN/GRBs) but larger than those of long GRBs. By analyzing the overall light curve of its prompt gamma rays and X-ray plateaus simultaneously, we infer that the early X-rays together with the gamma-rays should reflect the activities of the central engine, while the late X-rays may be dominated by the interaction of external shocks with circumburst material. In addition, we find that the host radio flux and offset of GRB 171205A are similar to those of other nearby low-luminosity GRBs. We adopt nine SN/GRBs with measured offset to build a relation between peak luminosity (Lγ,p) and spectral lag (τ) as Lγ,p ∝ τ−1.91±0.33. The peak luminosity and the projected physical offset of 12 SN/GRBs and 10 kilonova-associated GRBs are found to be moderately correlated, suggesting their different progenitors. The multiwavelength afterglow fitted with a top-hat jet model indicates that the jet half-opening angle and the viewing angle of GRB 171205A are ∼34.°4 and 41.°8, respectively, which implies that the off-axis emissions are dominated by the peripheral cocoon rather than the jet core.

Black hole (BH) X-ray binaries (XRBs) are ideal targets to study the connection between accretion inflow and jet outflow. Here we present quasi-simultaneous, multiwavelength observations of the Galactic BH system MAXI J1820+070, throughout its 2018–2019 outburst. Our data set includes coverage from the radio through X-ray bands from 17 different instruments/telescopes, and encompasses 19 epochs over a 7 month period, resulting in one of the most well-sampled multiwavelength data sets of a BH XRB outburst to date. With our data, we compile and model the broadband spectra of this source using a phenomenological model that includes emission from the jet, a companion star, and an accretion flow. This modeling allows us to track the evolution of the spectral break in the jet spectrum, a key observable that samples the jet launching region. We find that the spectral break location changes over at least ≈3 orders of magnitude in electromagnetic frequency over this period. Using these spectral break measurements, we link the full cycle of jet behavior, including the rising, quenching, and reignition, to the changing accretion flow properties as the source evolves through its different accretion states. Our analysis shows consistent jet behavior with other sources in similar phases of their outbursts, reinforcing the idea that jet quenching and recovery may be a global feature of BH XRB systems in outburst. Our results also provide valuable evidence supporting a close connection between the geometry of the inner accretion flow and the base of the jet.

<title>Jet Structure and Burst Environment of GRB 221009A</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We conducted a comprehensive investigation of the brightest-of-all-time GRB 221009A, using new insights from very high-energy (VHE) observations from LHAASO and a complete multiwavelength afterglow data set. Through data fitting, we imposed constraints on the jet structure, radiation mechanisms, and burst environment of GRB 221009A. Our findings reveal a structured jet morphology characterized by a core+wing configuration. A smooth transition of energy within the jet takes place between the core and wing, but with a discontinuity in the bulk Lorentz factor. The jet structure differs from both the case of the short GRB 170817A and the results of numerical simulations for long-duration bursts. The VHE emission can be explained by the forward shock synchrotron self-Compton radiation of the core component, but requiring a distinctive transition of the burst environment from uniform to wind-like, suggesting the presence of complex pre-burst mass ejection processes. The low-energy multiwavelength afterglow is mainly governed by the synchrotron radiation from the forward and reverse shocks of the wing component. Our analysis indicates a magnetization factor of 5 for the wing component. Additionally, by comparing the forward shock parameters of the core and wing components, we find a potential correlation between the electron acceleration efficiency and both the Lorentz factor of the shock and the magnetic field equipartition factor. We discuss the significance of our findings, potential interpretations, and remaining issues.

<div> SN 2022oqm, Type Ic supernova, early-time spectral observations, CSM, shock cooling

总结:<br />
SN 2022oqm是一次Ic型超新星，早期光谱观测显示出高离子化的碳和氧吸收特征，指示着存在扩展的C/O物质。光谱和光曲线的演变表明，这次超新星最初的行为可以通过与光学薄的CSM的相互作用以及激冷来解释。在t = 60天时，SN 2022oqm的光谱显示出强烈的Ca ii和[Ca ii]发射，没有检测到[O i]，标志着这个事件是富含Ca的。因此，观测结果支持了三种潜在的解释：一个质量庞大的致密前体、一个带有延伸包层的质量剥离前体，或者一个含有白矮星的双星系统。 <div>
We present the discovery and analysis of SN 2022oqm, a Type Ic supernova (SN) detected <1 day after the explosion. The SN rises to a blue and short-lived (2 days) initial peak. Early-time spectral observations of SN 2022oqm show a hot (40,000 K) continuum with high ionization C and O absorption features at velocities of 4000 km s−1, while its photospheric radius expands at 20,000 km s−1, indicating a pre-existing distribution of expanding C/O material. After ∼2.5 days, both the spectrum and light curves evolve into those of a typical SN Ic, with line velocities of ∼10,000 km s−1, in agreement with the evolution of the photospheric radius. The optical light curves reach a second peak at t ≈ 15 days. By t = 60 days, the spectrum of SN 2022oqm becomes nearly nebular, displaying strong Ca ii and [Ca ii] emission with no detectable [O i], marking this event as Ca-rich. The early behavior can be explained by 10−3M⊙ of optically thin circumstellar material (CSM) surrounding either (1) a massive compact progenitor such as a Wolf–Rayet star, (2) a massive stripped progenitor with an extended envelope, or (3) a binary system with a white dwarf. We propose that the early-time light curve is powered by both the interaction of the ejecta with the optically thin CSM and shock cooling (in the massive star scenario). The observations can be explained by CSM that is optically thick to X-ray photons, is optically thick in the lines as seen in the spectra, and is optically thin to visible-light continuum photons that come either from downscattered X-rays or from the shock-heated ejecta. Calculations show that this scenario is self-consistent.

总结: 
这篇文章研究了SPRC047周围的星体群，使用星体的光谱能量分布来分析星体群的性质，尝试通过分段来获取最佳拟合结果。作者使用了多种星体形成历史先验来进行拟合，并指出由于波长覆盖不足和光信噪比低，无法解决年龄-金属丰度-尘埃的退化问题。作者还讨论了未来深度的可见-近红外观测结合绝对光通量校准的重要性，以及中等紫外线和中红外波段的观测将如何提高宽带SED拟合结果的准确性，从而改进类似未解析成星体的邻近星系周围的低表面亮度目标的研究。 <div>
We have investigated the properties (e.g., age, metallicity) of the stellar populations of a ringlike tidal stellar stream (or streams) around the edge-on galaxy SPRC047 (z = 0.031) using spectral energy distribution (SED) fits to integrated broadband aperture flux densities. We used visual images in six different bands and Spitzer/IRAC 3.6 μm data. We have attempted to derive best-fit stellar population parameters (metallicity, age) in three noncontiguous segments of the stream. Due to the very low surface brightness of the stream, we have performed a deconvolution with a Richardson–Lucy–type algorithm of the low spatial resolution 3.6 μm IRAC image, thereby reducing the effect of the point-spread function aliased emission from the bright edge-on central galaxy at the locations of our three stream segments. Our SED fits that used several different star formation (SF) history priors, from an exponentially decaying SF burst to continuous SF, indicate that the age–metallicity–dust degeneracy is not resolved, most likely because of inadequate wavelength coverage and low signal-to-noise ratios of the low surface brightness features. We also discuss how future deep visual–near-infrared observations, combined with absolute flux calibration uncertainties at or below the 1% level, complemented by equally well absolute flux-calibrated observations in ultraviolet and mid-infrared bands, would improve the accuracy of broadband SED fitting results for low surface brightness targets, such as stellar streams around nearby galaxies that are not resolved into stars.

<div> 关键词: Quasars, quadruply lensed, Malmquist-like selection effect, time delays, Hubble constant
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章讨论了四重透镜的夸萨尔星系的选择效应和对哈勃常数的影响。文章指出四重透镜只有在其位于透镜星系的钻石焦散线内时才发生。这会导致观测到的四重透镜夸萨尔星系的选择效应，高估了真实的焦散区域。并且文章提到了Malmquist的修正可以补偿参数优化中未能将先验因素纳入计算的失败。另外，推断的时间延迟与透镜星系的推断焦散区域成正比。模型时间延迟的偏差长，导致哈勃常数被高估。由于选择效应和模型放大率错误的组合产生了“推断放大率偏差”。这些效应可以被内置为先验，但在实践中可能具有挑战性。 <div>
Quasars are quadruply lensed only when they lie within the diamond caustic of a lensing galaxy. This precondition produces a Malmquist-like selection effect in observed populations of quadruply lensed quasars, overestimating the true caustic area. The bias toward high values of the inferred logarithmic area, , is proportional to the square of the error in that area, . In effect, Malmquist’s correction compensates posthoc for a failure to incorporate a prior into parameter optimization. Inferred time delays are proportional to the square root of the inferred caustic area of the lensing galaxy. Model time delays are biased long, leading to overestimates of the Hubble constant. Crude estimates of for a sample of 13 quadruple systems give a median value of 0.16. We identify a second effect, an “inferred magnification bias,” resulting from the combination of selection by apparent magnitude and errors in model magnification. It is strongly anticorrelated with caustic area bias, and almost always leads to underestimates of the Hubble constant. Malmquist’s scheme can be adapted to priors on multiple parameters, but for quad lenses, the negative covariances between caustic area and absolute magnitude are poorly known. Inferred magnification bias may even cancel out caustic area bias, depending upon (among other things) the slope of the number–magnitude relation for the sample. Proper correction for these combined effects can, in principle, be built into Bayesian modeling schemes as priors, eliminating the need for a Malmquist-style approximation, but is likely to be challenging in practice.

Ice chemistry in the dense, cold interstellar medium (ISM) is probably responsible for the formation of interstellar complex organic molecules (COMs). Recent laboratory experiments performed at T ∼ 4 K have shown that irradiation of CO:N2 ice samples analog to the CO-rich interstellar ice layer can contribute to the formation of COMs when H2 molecules are present. We have tested this organic chemistry under a broader range of conditions relevant to the interior of dense clouds by irradiating CO:15N2:H2 ice samples with 2 keV electrons in the 4–15 K temperature range. The H2 ice abundance depended on both, the ice formation temperature and the thermal evolution of the samples. Formation of H-bearing organics such as formaldehyde (H2CO), ketene (C2H2O), and isocyanic acid (H15NCO) was observed upon irradiation of ice samples formed at temperatures up to 10 K, and also in ices formed at 6 K and subsequently warmed up and irradiated at temperatures up to 15 K. These results suggest that a fraction of the H2 molecules in dense cloud interiors might be entrapped in the CO-rich layer of interstellar ice mantles, and that energetic processing of this layer could entail an additional contribution to the formation of COMs in the coldest regions of the ISM.

Atmospheric escape is crucial to understanding the evolution of planets in and out of the solar system and to interpreting atmospheric observations. While hydrodynamic escape simulations have been actively developed incorporating detailed processes such as UV heating, chemical reactions, and radiative cooling, the radiative cooling by molecules has been treated as emission from selected lines or rotational/vibrational bands to reduce its numerical cost. However, ad hoc selections of radiative lines would risk estimating inaccurate cooling rates because important lines or wavelengths for atmospheric cooling depend on emitting conditions such as temperature and optical thickness. In this study, we apply the correlated-k distribution (CKD) method to cooling rate calculations for H2-dominant transonic atmospheres containing H2O or CO as radiative species, to investigate its numerical performance and the importance of considering all lines of the molecules. Our simulations demonstrate that the sum of weak lines, which provides only 1% of the line emission energy in total at optically thin conditions, can become the primary source of radiative cooling in optically thick regions, especially for H2O-containing atmospheres. Also, in our hydrodynamic simulations, the CKD method with a wavelength resolution of 1000 is found to be effective, allowing the calculation of escape rate and temperature profiles with acceptable numerical cost. Our results show the importance of treating all radiative lines and the usefulness of the CKD method in hydrodynamic escape simulations. It is particularly practical for heavy-element-enriched atmospheres considered in small exoplanets, including super-Earths, without any prior selections for effective lines.

在研究太阳日冕加热问题时，我们通常只能观测到活跃区环的冷却阶段。然而，通过Hinode/EUV成像光谱仪(EIS)的罕见观测，我们得以观察到了X2.1型耀斑后日冕雨的形成过程。通过对等离子体成分的测量，我们发现了日冕雨形成的迹象。此外，通过多种测量手段，我们还观察到了日冕雨的形成和演化过程。这些观测为我们提供了关于日冕雨加热速率、来源和集体行为的新见解。在观测中还发现了日冕雨的一些特性，如在0.7MK时的窄温度分布。这些观测为解决日冕加热问题提供了重要线索。 <br /><br />总结: <div>
A significant impediment to solving the coronal heating problem is that we currently only observe active region loops in their cooling phase. Previous studies showed that the evolution of cooling loop densities and apex temperatures is insensitive to the magnitude, duration, and location of energy deposition. Still, potential clues to how energy is released are encoded in the properties of the cooling phase. The appearance of coronal rain, one of the most spectacular phenomena of the cooling phase, occurs when plasma has cooled below 1 MK, which sets constraints on the heating frequency, for example. Most observations of coronal rain have been made by imaging instruments. Here we report rare Hinode/EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) observations of a loop arcade where coronal rain forms following an X2.1 limb flare. A bifurcation in plasma composition measurements between photospheric at 1.5 MK and coronal at 3.5 MK suggests that we are observing postflare-driven coronal rain. Increases in nonthermal velocities and densities with decreasing temperature (2.7–0.6 MK) suggest that we are observing the formation and subsequent evolution of the condensations. Doppler velocity measurements imply that a 10% correction of apparent flows in imaging data is reasonable. Emission measure analysis at 0.7 MK shows narrow temperature distributions, indicating coherent behavior reminiscent of that observed in coronal loops. The limitations on spatio-temporal resolution of EIS suggest that we are observing the largest features or rain showers. These observations provide insights into the heating rate, source, turbulence, and collective behavior of coronal rain from observations of the loop cooling phase.

We compare the fluxes of [Ne III] 3869 Å, [O III] 5007 Å, [O II] 3726, 3728 Å, and [O i] 6300 Å to that of [Ne v]. All four lines show a strong linear correlation with [Ne v], although lines from ions with lower ionization potentials have a lower correlation coefficient. We investigate the use of two forbidden line ratio diagnostic diagrams that do not rely on Hα in order to classify high-redshift galaxies. These use the [Ne III]/[O II] line ratio plotted against [O III]/[O i] and [O III]/[O II], respectively. We use photoionization modeling to characterize the behavior of the narrow-line region in AGN and star-forming regions and test the validity of our diagnostic diagrams. We also use a luminosity cutoff of log L[O III] [erg s−1] = 42, which lowers the contamination of the AGN region by star-forming galaxies down to 10% but does not remove green pea and purple grape galaxies from the AGN region. We also investigate the OHNO diagram, which uses [Ne III]/[O II] plotted against [O III]/Hβ. Using our new diagnostic diagrams, we are able to reliably classify AGN up to a redshift of z ≤ 1.06 and add more than 822 new AGN to the [Ne v]-selected AGN sample.

在这篇文章中，研究人员通过对类星体的X射线和紫外线亮度之间的关系进行比较，使用了观测数据和统计工具copula构建了三种不同的LX-LUV关系，其中包括标准关系和两种红移演化关系。通过对低红移和高红移数据进行分析，发现使用红移演化关系得到的PAge参数的约束与标准关系相一致，而使用考虑了红移依赖修正的关系时则不一致。当同时使用数据来约束关系的系数和PAge参数时，观测数据支持红移演化关系，显著性超过3σ。而阿凯凯信息准则和贝叶斯信息准则表明，标准关系被强烈拒绝，而红移演化关系也存在轻微拒绝的迹象。这表明，使用copula构建的类星体LX-LUV关系受到了观测数据的支持。 <br /><br />总结: 研究比较了不同的LX-LUV关系，发现红移演化关系得到的PAge参数在低红移和高红移数据中是一致的，而标准关系则不一致。观测数据支持红移演化关系，既有3σ的显著性。信息准则表明标准关系被强烈拒绝，而红移演化关系也存在轻微拒绝的迹象。这表明了使用copula构建的LX-LUV关系受到了观测数据的支持。 <div>
We compare, with data from quasars, Hubble parameter measurements, and Pantheon+ type Ia supernova, three different relations between X-ray luminosity (LX) and ultraviolet luminosity (LUV) of quasars. These three relations consist of the standard and two redshift-evolutionary LX–LUV relations, which are constructed, respectively, by considering a redshift-dependent correction to the luminosities of quasars and using the statistical tool copula. By employing the PAge approximation for a cosmological model–independent description of the cosmic background evolution and dividing the quasar data into the low-redshift and high-redshift parts, we find that the constraints on the PAge parameters from the low-redshift and high-redshift data, which are obtained with the redshift-evolutionary relations, are consistent with each other, while they are not when the standard relation is considered. If the data are used to constrain the coefficients of the relations and the PAge parameters simultaneously, then the observations support the redshift-evolutionary relations at more than 3σ. The Akaike and Bayes information criteria indicate that there is strong evidence against the standard relation and mild evidence against the redshift-evolutionary relation constructed by considering a redshift-dependent correction to the luminosities of quasars. This suggests that the redshift-evolutionary LX–LUV relation of quasars constructed from copula is favored by the observations.

<title>Absorption Troughs of Lyα Emitters in HETDEX</title>

<br /><br />
该文介绍了HETDEX项目，旨在探测和测量超过100万个Lyα发射星系的红移，从而得出宇宙学测量数据，并研究Lyα光谱和辐射传输的基本特性。通过HETDEX数据发布3中的50万个LAEs，研究人员对不同子集进行堆叠，得出了z∼2–3时代典型的Lyα谱线，并了解了它们的物理特性。他们发现Lyα发射周围清晰的吸收翼，红蓝两侧均延伸∼2000 km/s。同时，通过COS和MUSE调查，他们观察到不同红移范围内的吸收谱线，并发现槽在高密度区域更加明显，说明吸收深度取决于LAE附近的局部密度。简单的Lyα辐射传输模拟也产生了类似的槽，这是由LAE周围的H i气体吸收背景光造成的。 
<br /><br />总结: 该研究通过HETDEX项目找到了z∼2–3时代典型的Lyα谱线，发现了吸收翼的特性，并观察到了吸收谱线与密度的关联。通过简单模拟，也验证了H i气体对光的吸收会产生类似的效应。 <div>
The Hobby–Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX) is designed to detect and measure the redshifts of more than 1 million Lyα emitting galaxies (LAEs) 1.88 < z < 3.52. In addition to its cosmological measurements, these data enable studies of Lyα spectral profiles and the underlying radiative transfer. Using the roughly half a million LAEs in the HETDEX Data Release 3, we stack various subsets to obtain the typical Lyα profile for the z ∼ 2–3 epoch and to understand their physical properties. We find clear absorption wings around Lyα emission, which extend ∼2000 km s−1 both redward and blueward of the central line. Using far-UV spectra of nearby (0.002 < z < 0.182) LAEs in the COS Legacy Archive Spectroscopic Survey treasury and optical/near-IR spectra of 2.8 < z < 6.7 LAEs in the Multi Unit Spectroscopic-Wide survey, we observe absorption profiles in both redshift regimes. Dividing the sample by volume density shows that the troughs increase in higher-density regions. This trend suggests that the depth of the absorption is dependent on the local density of objects near the LAE, a geometry that is similar to damped Lyα systems. Simple simulations of Lyα radiative transfer can produce similar troughs due to absorption of light from background sources by H i gas surrounding the LAEs.

<div> 黑洞自旋参数；X射线双星；LMC X-1；尼科尔斯观测望远镜；恒星质量黑洞

总结:
本研究利用NICER和NuSTAR的最新同时观测数据，通过改进的科研方法对黑洞的自旋参数进行测量。首先使用标准相对论盘模型和光学薄的康普顿散射模型得到与以往相似的自旋参数数值。然后考虑了标准模型的修正，使用颜色校正得到了不同的自旋参数范围。进一步考虑了盘面层的能量耗散，假设标准盘被一个温暖且光学厚的康普顿散射层覆盖。最终得到了一个最小的χ2值对应的自旋参数范围。接着，我们对银河系X-1进行了相似的研究，结果表明，使用连续谱方法测量自旋参数极其敏感于对盘结构的假设。 <div>
The black hole spin parameter, a*, was measured to be close to its maximum value of 1 in many accreting X-ray binaries. In particular, a* ≳ 0.9 was found in a number of studies of LMC X-1. These measurements were claimed to take into account both statistical and systematic uncertainties. We perform new measurements using a recent simultaneous observation by NICER and NuSTAR, providing a data set of high quality. We use the disk continuum method together with improved models for coronal Comptonization. With the standard relativistic disk model and optically thin Comptonization, we obtain values of a* similar to those obtained before. We then consider modifications to the standard model. Using a color correction of 2, we find a* ≈ 0.64–0.84. We then consider disks with dissipation in surface layers. To account for that, we assume the standard disk is covered by a warm and optically thick Comptonizing layer. Our model with the lowest χ2 then yields . In order to test the presence of such effects in other sources, we also study an X-ray observation of Cyg X-1 by Suzaku in the soft state. We confirm the previous findings of a* > 0.99 using the standard model, but then we find a weakly constrained when including an optically thick Comptonizing layer. We conclude that determinations of the spin using the continuum method can be highly sensitive to the assumptions about the disk structure.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The galaxy cluster A746 (z = 0.214), featuring a double radio relic system, two isolated radio relics, a possible radio halo, disturbed V-shaped X-ray emission, and intricate galaxy distributions, is a unique and complex merging system. We present a weak-lensing analysis of A746 based on wide-field imaging data from Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam observations. The mass distribution is characterized by a main peak, which coincides with the center of the X-ray emission. At this main peak, we detect two extensions toward the north and west tracing the cluster galaxy and X-ray distributions. Despite the ongoing merger, our estimate of the A746 global mass M500 = 4.4 ± 1.0 × 1014M⊙ is consistent with the previous results from Sunyaev-Zel'dovich and X-ray observations. We conclude that reconciling the distributions of mass, galaxies, and intracluster medium with the double radio relic system and other radio features remains challenging.

<title>Including Neutrino-driven Convection in the Force Explosion Condition to Predict Explodability of Multidimensional Core-collapse Supernovae (FEC+)</title>

Most massive stars end their lives with core collapse. However, it is not clear which explode as a core-collapse supernova (CCSN), leaving behind a neutron star, and which collapse to a black hole, aborting the explosion. One path to predict explodability without expensive multidimensional simulations is to develop analytic explosion conditions. These analytic conditions also provide a deeper understanding of the explosion mechanism and they provide some insight into why some simulations explode and some do not. The analytic force explosion condition (FEC) reproduces the explosion conditions of spherically symmetric CCSN simulations. In this follow-up manuscript, we include the dominant multidimensional effect that aids explosion—neutrino-driven convection—in the FEC. This generalized critical condition (FEC+) is suitable for multidimensional simulations and has potential to accurately predict explosion conditions of two- and three-dimensional CCSN simulations. We show that adding neutrino-driven convection reduces the critical condition by ∼30%, which is consistent with previous multidimensional simulations.

在当前JWST时代，UV光谱对于增进我们对复离子时代（z > 6）中第一批星系的星际介质（ISM）和恒星特性的理解起着至关重要的作用。本文利用HST COS Legacy Archive Spectroscopic SurveY（CLASSY）中的远紫外线（UV）光谱数据，比较了光学图谱和UV图谱之间的关系，分析了在不同UV诊断图中的UV线比的位置，并考虑了最新的光电离和激波模型，以及已测得的ISM和恒星特性。研究发现，C iii] λλ1907,9 He iiλ1640和O iii] λ1666的组合可以在次太阳金属丰度条件下有效区分星际介质的形成源。此外，文中还讨论了检测UV发射线所需的ISM条件，强调了它们仅在低气相金属丰度（12 + log(O/H) ≲ 8.3）和高电离参数（log(U) ≳ −2.5）的环境中可见。总的来说，CLASSY和UV工具将在解释JWST目前正在揭示的最早星系的光谱方面发挥关键作用。<br /><br />总结: 本文利用CLASSY收集的大量UV光谱数据，比较了UV和光学图谱之间的关系，分析了UV线比的位置，并讨论了检测UV发射线所需的ISM条件。研究发现特定的UV线比组合可以区分不同形成源，而UV发射线仅在特定环境下可见。这将对解释JWST发现的早期星系的光谱起到关键作用。 <div>
In the current JWST era, rest-frame UV spectra play a crucial role in enhancing our understanding of the interstellar medium (ISM) and stellar properties of the first galaxies in the epoch of reionization (z > 6). Here, we compare well-known and reliable optical diagrams sensitive to the main ionization source (i.e., star formation, SF; active galactic nuclei, AGN; and shocks) to UV counterparts proposed in the literature—the so-called “UV–BPT diagrams”—using the HST COS Legacy Archive Spectroscopic SurveY (CLASSY), which is the largest high-quality, high-resolution, and broad-wavelength range atlas of far-UV spectra for 45 local star-forming galaxies. In particular, we explore where CLASSY UV line ratios are located in the different UV diagnostic plots, taking into account state-of-the-art photoionization and shock models, and, for the first time, the measured ISM and stellar properties (e.g., gas-phase metallicity, ionization parameter, carbon abundance, and stellar age). We find that the combination of C iii] λλ1907,9 He iiλ1640 and O iii] λ1666 can be a powerful tool to separate between SF, shocks, and AGN at subsolar metallicities. We also confirm that alternative diagrams without O iii] λ1666 still allow us to define an SF-locus, with some caveats. Diagrams including C ivλλ1548,51 should be taken with caution given the complexity of this doublet profile. Finally, we present a discussion detailing the ISM conditions required to detect UV emission lines, visible only in low gas-phase metallicity (12 + log(O/H) ≲ 8.3) and high ionization parameter (log(U) ≳ −2.5) environments. Overall, CLASSY and our UV toolkit will be crucial in interpreting the spectra of the earliest galaxies that JWST is currently revealing.

这篇文章总结了针对COSMOS-Web宝库项目的JWST NIRCam成像数据进行了详细和全面的数据降维和点扩散函数（PSF）模型构建。研究发现NIRCam PSF在四个滤波器（F115W，F150W，F277W和F444W）中存在显著的短时间尺度的时间变化和随机空间变化。通过将NIRCam与哈勃太空望远镜成像数据结合起来，进行多波段活动星系核（AGN）+宿主图像分解，研究了0.35 ≲ z ≲ 3.5的143个X射线选择的宽线AGN的特性。研究利用NIRCam出色的分辨率、波长覆盖和灵敏度，成功在142个对象中分解出中心AGN点源后检测到宿主恒星发射。约2/3的AGN位于星成形星系中，表明没有即时的负面AGN反馈。X射线选择的宽线AGN宿主遵循与非活跃星系类似的恒星质量-尺寸关系，尽管其星系大小略小。研究发现，尽管主要并合在样本中很少（约7%–22%），但来自恒星棒、螺旋臂和小并合等更微妙的非轴对称特征是普遍存在的，突出了非周期过程和小并合在触发AGN活动中的重要性。对于具有来自单一时期光谱的黑洞质量测量的30个AGN子样本（1 < z < 2.5），它们遵循与当地非活跃早期星系相似的黑洞质量-恒星质量关系，但更倾向于驻留在附近AGN的上限。需要注意的是，不同红移下的AGN种群的固有差异可能会显着影响它们在黑洞质量-恒星质量平面上的位置。

We present detailed and comprehensive data reduction and point-spread-function (PSF) model construction for all public JWST NIRCam imaging data from the COSMOS-Web treasury program (up to 2023 June, totaling 0.28 deg2). We show that the NIRCam PSF has significant short-timescale temporal variations and random spatial variations in all four filters (F115W, F150W, F277W, and F444W). Combining NIRCam with archival Hubble Space Telescope imaging, we perform multiwavelength active galactic nucleus (AGN)+host image decomposition to study the properties of 143 X-ray-selected (Lbol = 1043.6–47.2 erg s−1) broad-line AGNs at 0.35 ≲ z ≲ 3.5. Leveraging the superb resolution, wavelength coverage, and sensitivity of NIRCam, we successfully detect host stellar emission after decomposing the central AGN point source in 142 objects. ∼2/3 AGNs are in star-forming galaxies based on the UVJ diagram, suggesting that there is no instantaneous negative AGN feedback. X-ray-selected broad-line AGN hosts follow a similar stellar mass–size relation as inactive galaxies, albeit with slightly smaller galaxy sizes. We find that although major mergers are rare (∼7%–22%) among the sample, more subtle nonaxisymmetric features from stellar bars, spiral arms, and minor mergers are ubiquitous, highlighting the importance of secular processes and minor mergers in triggering AGN activity. For a subsample of 30 AGNs at 1 < z < 2.5 with black hole mass measurements from single epoch spectra, they follow a similar black hole mass-stellar mass relation as local inactive early-type galaxies but reside preferentially near the upper envelope of nearby AGNs. We caution that selection biases and the intrinsic differences of AGN populations at different redshifts may significantly affect their location on the black hole mass-stellar mass plane.

AU Microscopii (AU Mic) is an active 24 ± 3 Myr pre-main-sequence M dwarf in the stellar neighborhood (d = 9.7 pc) with a rotation period of 4.86 days. The two transiting planets orbiting AU Mic, AU Mic b and c, are warm sub-Neptunes on 8.5 and 18.9 day periods and are targets of interest for atmospheric observations of young planets. Here we study AU Mic’s unocculted starspots using ground-based photometry and spectra in order to complement current and future transmission spectroscopy of its planets. We gathered multicolor Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) 0.4 m SBIG photometry to study the star's rotational modulations and LCO Network of Robotic Echelle Spectrographs high-resolution spectra to measure the different spectral components within the integrated spectrum of the star, parameterized by three spectral components and their coverage fractions. We find AU Mic’s surface has at least two spectral components: a Tamb = K ambient photosphere and cool spots that have a temperature of Tspot = K, covering a globally averaged area of 39% ± 4% which increases and decreases by 5.1% ± 0.3% from the average throughout a rotation. We also detect a third flux component with a filling factor less than 0.5% and a largely uncertain temperature between 8500 and 10,000 K that we attribute to flare flux not entirely omitted when time averaging the spectra. We include measurements of spot characteristics using a two-temperature model, which we find agree strongly with the three-temperature results. Our expanded use of various techniques to study starspots will help us better understand this system and may have applications for interpreting the transmission spectra for exoplanets transiting stars of a wide range of activity levels.

We present new high-spectral-resolution observations (R = λ/Δλ = 7000) of the filamentary nebula surrounding NGC 1275, the central galaxy of the Perseus cluster. These observations have been obtained with SITELLE, an imaging Fourier transform spectrometer installed on the Canada–France–Hawai Telescope with a field of view of , encapsulating the entire filamentary structure of ionized gas despite its large size of 80 kpc × 50 kpc. Here, we present renewed fluxes, velocities, and velocity dispersion maps that show in great detail the kinematics of the optical nebula at [S ii] λ6716, [S ii] λ6731, [N ii] λ6584, Hα (6563 Å), and [N ii] λ6548. These maps reveal the existence of a bright flattened disk-shaped structure in the core extending to r ∼10 kpc and dominated by a chaotic velocity field. This structure is located in the wake of X-ray cavities and characterized by a high mean velocity dispersion of 134 km s−1. The disk-shaped structure is surrounded by an extended array of filaments spread out to r ∼ 50 kpc that are 10 times fainter in flux, remarkably quiescent, and have a uniform mean velocity dispersion of 44 km s−1. This stability is puzzling given that the cluster core exhibits several energetic phenomena. Based on these results, we argue that there are two mechanisms that form multiphase gas in clusters of galaxies: a first triggered in the wake of X-ray cavities leading to more turbulent multiphase gas and a second, distinct mechanism, that is gentle and leads to large-scale multiphase gas spreading throughout the core.

Observations of galaxy cluster mergers provide insights on the particle acceleration and heating mechanisms taking place within the intracluster medium. Mergers form shocks that propagate through the plasma, which result in shock/cold fronts in the X-ray, and radio halos and/or relics in the radio regime. The connection between these tracers and the mechanisms driving non-thermal processes, such as inverse Compton, are not well understood. ZWCL 1856.8 is one of the few known double radio relic systems that originate from nearly head-on collisions observed close to the plane of the sky. For the first time, we study NuSTAR and Chandra observations of this system, which contains both relics within their field of view. The spectro-imaging analyses results of the system suggest weak shock fronts with numbers within 2σ of the radio-derived values, and provide evidence of inverse Compton emission at both relic sites. Our findings have great uncertainties due to the shallow exposure times available. Deeper NuSTAR and Chandra data are crucial for studying the connection of the radio and X-ray emission features and for constraining the thermal versus non-thermal emission contributions in this system. We also present methods and approaches on how to investigate X-ray properties of double relic systems by taking full advantage of the complementary properties of NuSTAR and Chandra missions.

总结:<br /><br />文章研究了星系周围介质中的湍流运动对星系演化的重要作用，利用[O ii]和[O iii]发射得到的二维速度图，测量了四个类星体星云的速度结构函数(VSF)。结果显示，这些星云中的气体呈次音速湍流，表明冷气体与热环境介质有动力学耦合。通过对八个星云进行研究，发现最大的星云位于星系团环境中，显示出明显的潮汐相互作用迹象，表明环境效应在促进星系气态晕及形成中起着重要作用。研究还估算了QSO星云中的湍流加热率，发现其值与星团介质和星际星云中的结果相符，但比使用吸收线技术在小尺度下测量的结果高出约103倍。作者讨论了通过将基于发射的VSF测量推进到小于约10千秒差距的前景。<br /> <div>
Turbulent motions in the circumgalactic medium play a critical role in regulating the evolution of galaxies, yet their detailed characterization remains elusive. Using two-dimensional velocity maps constructed from spatially extended [O ii] and [O iii] emission, Chen et al. measured the velocity structure functions (VSFs) of four quasar nebulae at z ≈ 0.5–1.1. One of these exhibits a spectacular Kolmogorov relation. Here, we carry out an ensemble study using an expanded sample incorporating four new nebulae from three additional quasi-stellar object (QSO) fields. The VSFs measured for all eight nebulae are best explained by subsonic turbulence revealed by the line-emitting gas, which in turn strongly suggests that the cool gas (T ∼ 104 K) is dynamically coupled to the hot ambient medium. Previous work demonstrates that the largest nebulae in our sample reside in group environments with clear signs of tidal interactions, suggesting that environmental effects are vital in seeding and enhancing the turbulence within the gaseous halos, ultimately promoting the formation of the extended nebulae. No discernible differences are observed in the VSF properties between radio-loud and radio-quiet QSO fields. We estimate the turbulent heating rate per unit volume, Qturb, in the QSO nebulae to be ∼10−26–10−22 erg cm−3 s−1 for the cool phase and ∼10−28–10−25 erg cm−3 s−1 for the hot phase. This range aligns with measurements in the intracluster medium and star-forming molecular clouds but is ∼103 times higher than the Qturb observed inside cool gas clumps on scales ≲1 kpc using absorption-line techniques. We discuss the prospect of bridging the gap between emission and absorption studies by pushing the emission-based VSF measurements to below ≈10 kpc.

这项研究利用了IXPE的长时间曝光来测量大麦哲伦星云中类似蟹星云的PSR B0540-69及其脉泽风星云的X射线偏振。对于图像平均数据未检测到有统计显著的偏振，给出了2-8keV能量范围下99%置信度的偏振上限为5.3%。然而，相相分析发现在4-6keV能量范围内，脉泽风星云和脉泽均存在偏振。对于脉泽风星云，偏振度为(24.5 ± 5.3)%，偏振角为(78.1 ± 6.2)°，在4.6σ的显著水平上检测到，在光学波段观测到的偏振角一致。对于单个脉冲窗口，在3.8σ的显著水平上测量到偏振度为(50.0 ± 13.1)%，偏振角为(6.2 ± 7.4)°。同时脉冲星/脉泽风星云分析发现，在脉冲的边缘有两个中超过3σ显著度的偏振度，为(68 ± 20)%和(62 ± 20)%；在2-3σ显著度上的相邻区间有较低的偏振度，暗示了额外的偏振结构。 
<br /><br />总结:PSR B0540-69和其脉泽风星云在X射线偏振测量中表现出复杂的特征，图像平均数据未检测到统计显著的偏振，但相相分析发现了偏振的存在，表明了该天体的X射线偏振具有丰富的结构和特性。 <div>
We report on X-ray polarization measurements of the extragalactic Crab-like PSR B0540-69 and its Pulsar Wind Nebula (PWN) in the Large Magellanic Cloud, using a ∼850 ks Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) exposure. The PWN is unresolved by IXPE. No statistically significant polarization is detected for the image-averaged data, giving a 99% confidence polarization upper limit (MDP99) of 5.3% in the 2–8 keV energy range. However, a phase-resolved analysis detects polarization for both the nebula and pulsar in the 4–6 keV energy range. For the PWN defined as the off-pulse phases, the polarization degree (PD) of (24.5 ± 5.3)% and polarization angle (PA) of (78.1 ± 6.2)° is detected at 4.6σ significance level, consistent with the PA observed in the optical band. In a single on-pulse window, a hint of polarization is measured at 3.8σ with PD of (50.0 ± 13.1)% and PA of (6.2 ± 7.4)°. A “simultaneous” PSR/PWN analysis finds two bins at the edges of the pulse exceeding 3σ PD significance, with PD of (68 ± 20)% and (62 ± 20)%; intervening bins at 2–3σ significance have lower PD, hinting at additional polarization structure.

通过Keck Cosmic Web Imager对14个位于z ≈ 2的damped Lyα吸收体周围的领域进行了Lyα积分场谱学研究。9个DLAs具有较高的金属丰度([M/H] > − 0.3)，其中4个在影响参数≲30 kpc处有CO发射星系。研究结果显示，这些高金属度DLA相关的H i选择星系可能存在较低的Lyα逃逸分数，证明了使用Lyα、CO、Hα和[C ii] 158μm发射来鉴定z ≈ 2 DLAs相关星系的必要性。除了与QSO B0551-366有关的场景外，在其余八个高金属度DLA领域中没有检测到显著的Lyα发射。综上所述，研究结果表明对于鉴定z ≈ 2 DLAs相关星系，需要综合多种方法。例如Lyα、CO、Hα和[C ii] 158μm发射。 <br /><br />总结: <br />DLAs对应的高金属度星系可能具有较低的Lyα逃逸分数。需要使用多种方法来识别z ≈ 2 DLAs相关的星系。 <div>
We present Keck Cosmic Web Imager Lyα integral field spectroscopy of the fields surrounding 14 damped Lyα absorbers (DLAs) at z ≈ 2. Of these 14 DLAs, nine have high metallicities ([M/H] > − 0.3), and four of those nine feature a CO-emitting galaxy at an impact parameter ≲30 kpc. Our search reaches median Lyα line flux sensitivities of ∼2 × 10−17 erg s−1 cm−2 over apertures of ∼6 kpc and out to impact parameters of ∼50 kpc. We recover the Lyα flux of three known Lyα-emitting H i-selected galaxies in our sample. In addition, we find two Lyα emitters at impact parameters of ≈50–70 kpc from the high-metallicity DLA at z ≈ 1.96 toward QSO B0551-366. This field also contains a massive CO-emitting galaxy at an impact parameter of ≈15 kpc. Apart from the field with QSO B0551-366, we do not detect significant Lyα emission in any of the remaining eight high-metallicity DLA fields. Considering the depth of our observations and our ability to recover previously known Lyα emitters, we conclude that H i-selected galaxies associated with high-metallicity DLAs at z ≈ 2 are dusty and therefore might feature low Lyα escape fractions. Our results indicate that complementary approaches—using Lyα, CO, Hα, and [C ii] 158 μm emission—are necessary to identify the wide range of galaxy types associated with z ≈ 2 DLAs.

<br /><br />
这篇文章主要介绍了Be星通过快速旋转和非径向脉动来建立分离盘的机制，以及这些盘中特征性的谱线发射的形成。文章指出，很多Be星有快速旋转的特性是由于与另一颗恒星的质量和角动量转移所导致的。通过对37颗Be星进行了光学/近红外干涉观测，并成功构建了六颗Be星与其伴星的三维轨道。此外，文章还指出了一些Be星并未发现低质量的伴星，同时也讨论了一些X射线原型星的可能伴星类型。 <div>
Rapid rotation and nonradial pulsations enable Be stars to build decretion disks, where the characteristic line emission forms. A major but unconstrained fraction of Be stars owe their rapid rotation to mass and angular momentum transfer in a binary. The faint, stripped companions can be helium-burning subdwarf OB-type stars (sdOBs), white dwarfs (WDs), or neutron stars. We present optical/near-infrared Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy (CHARA) interferometry of 37 Be stars selected for spectroscopic indications of low-mass companions. From multiepoch H- and/or K-band interferometry plus radial velocities and parallaxes collected elsewhere, we constructed 3D orbits and derived flux ratios and absolute dynamical masses of both components for six objects, quadrupling the number of anchor points for evolutionary models. In addition, a new wider companion was identified for the known Be + sdO binary 59 Cyg, while auxiliary Very Large Telescope Interferometer/GRAVITY spectrointerferometry confirmed circumstellar matter around the sdO companion to HR 2142. On the other hand, we failed to detect any companion to the six Be stars with γ Cas–like X-ray emission, with sdOB and main-sequence companions of the expected spectroscopic mass being ruled out for the X-ray-prototypical stars γ Cas and π Aqr, leaving elusive WDs as the most likely companions, as well as a likely explanation of the X-rays. No low-mass main-sequence close companions were identified for the other stars.

Transient low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) are discovered largely by X-ray and gamma-ray all-sky monitors. The X-ray outburst is also accompanied by an optical brightening, which empirically can precede the detection of X-rays. Newly sensitive optical synoptic surveys may offer a complementary pathway for discovery and potential for insight into the initial onset and propagation of the thermal instability that leads to the ionization of the accretion disk. We use the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) alert stream to perform a comprehensive search at optical wavelengths for previously undiscovered outbursting LMXBs. Our pipeline first crossmatches the positions of the alerts to cataloged X-ray sources, and then analyzes the 30 day lightcurve of matched alerts by thresholding on differences with an 8 day exponentially weighted moving average. In addition to a 19 month long live search, we ran our pipeline over 4 yr of ZTF archival data, recovering four known LMXBs. We also independently detected an outburst of MAXI J1957+032 in the live search and found the first outburst of Swift J1943.4+0228, an unclassified X-ray transient, in 10 yr. Using Monte Carlo simulations of the Galactic LMXB population, we estimate that 29% of outbursting LMXBs are detectable by ZTF and that 4.4% of LMXBs would be present in the crossmatched X-ray catalogs, giving an estimated Galactic population of . We estimate that our current pipeline can detect 1.3% of all outbursting LMXBs, including those previously unknown, but that Rubin Observatory’s Legacy Survey of Space and Time will be able to detect 43% of outbursting LMXBs.

<div> 核心坍缩超新星 (CCSN) 模拟，三维，产生，核合成，多维效应

核心坍缩超新星 (CCSN) 模拟由 Fornax 进行，研究了 18 个三维模拟的喷射条件和理论核合成结果。大部分模拟在弹跳后至少进行了 3 秒的模拟，这使我们能够在长期内跟踪它们的行为。我们发现多维效应为喷射条件引入了许多复杂性。我们观察到随机的电子分数演化，复杂的峰值温度分布和历史，以及在核合成温度范围内所花费的时间的长尾分布。这些都导致了CCSN核合成产量的实质性变化，并且与一维结果有所不同。我们讨论了轻α-核、放射性同位素、重元素以及一些特别感兴趣的同位素的产生。通过比较CCSN之前和CCSN之后的贡献，我们发现在硅到锗之间大约产生的元素的相当一部分通常是在CCSNe中产生的。我们发现，与56Ni相比，44Ti表现出了较长的产生时间尺度，这可能解释了其在超新星遗迹如 Cas A 和 SN1987A中不同的分布和比先前预测的更高的丰度。我们还讨论了喷射元素的形态。这项研究凸显了三维CCSN模拟中喷射条件和核合成结果的高度多样性，并强调了需要进行额外的长期（约10秒）三维模拟以适当解决这些复杂性。<br /><br />总结: 本研究通过核心坍缩超新星模拟发现了多维效应引入的复杂性，包括随机的电子分数演化、复杂的峰值温度分布和历史，以及多维效应对核合成结果的实质性影响。研究还强调了进行更多长期的三维模拟以解决这些复杂性的必要性。 <div>
We study in detail the ejecta conditions and theoretical nucleosynthetic results for 18 three-dimensional core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulations done by Fornax. Most of the simulations are carried out to at least 3 s after bounce, which allows us to follow their longer-term behaviors. We find that multidimensional effects introduce many complexities into the ejecta conditions. We see a stochastic electron fraction evolution, complex peak temperature distributions and histories, and long-tail distributions of the time spent within nucleosynthetic temperature ranges. These all lead to substantial variation in CCSN nucleosynthetic yields and differences from 1D results. We discuss the production of lighter α-nuclei, radioactive isotopes, heavier elements, and a few isotopes of special interest. Comparing pre-CCSN and CCSN contributions, we find that a significant fraction of elements between roughly Si and Ge are generally produced in CCSNe. We find that 44Ti exhibits an extended production timescale as compared to 56Ni, which may explain its different distribution and higher than previously predicted abundances in supernova remnants such as Cas A and SN1987A. We also discuss the morphology of the ejected elements. This study highlights the high-level diversity of ejecta conditions and nucleosynthetic results in 3D CCSN simulations and emphasizes the need for additional long-term (∼10 s) 3D simulations to properly address such complexities.

<div> 关键词: gas disk, binary system, eccentricity, instability, gravitational waves
总结: 
本研究发现围绕轨道二元系统的气体盘（所谓的微盘）可能会出现共振不稳定性，导致微盘变得极端偏心。通过数值模拟发现，微盘之间的定期碰撞在一定程度上导致并注入了偏心率。当使用等温状态方程时，微盘的偏心率会受到抑制。然而，即使在这种情况下，不稳定性仍然存在。此外，当引力软化程度较大时，微盘的偏心率也会受到抑制。研究指出，这种抑制可能是广泛采用的数值近似的一种人为因素。未来需要进行三维研究以评估偏心微盘是否可以在真实的天体物理环境中发生。如果是这样，这可能对区分活跃星系核中准周期振荡的双星和单黑洞情景的电磁标记具有重要意义。此外，可能有助于利用脉冲星定时阵列有针对性地搜索低频引力波来源于超大质量黑洞双星的情况。 <div>
We show that gas disks around the components of an orbiting binary system (so-called minidisks) may be susceptible to a resonant instability that causes the minidisks to become significantly eccentric. Eccentricity is injected by, and also induces, regular impacts between the minidisks at roughly the orbital period of the binary. Such eccentric minidisks are seen in vertically integrated, two-dimensional simulations of a circular, equal-mass binary accreting from a circumbinary gas disk with a Γ-law equation of state. Minidisk eccentricity is suppressed by the use of an isothermal equation of state. However, the instability still operates and can be revealed in a minimal disk-binary simulation by removing the circumbinary disk and feeding the minidisks from the component positions. Minidisk eccentricity is also suppressed when the gravitational softening length is large (≳4% of the binary semimajor axis), suggesting that its absence could be an artifact of widely adopted numerical approximations; a follow-up study in three dimensions with well-resolved, geometrically thin minidisks (aspect ratios ≲0.02) may be needed to assess whether eccentric minidisks can occur in real astrophysical environments. If they can, the electromagnetic signature may be important for discriminating between binary and single black hole scenarios for quasiperiodic oscillations in active galactic nuclei; in turn, this might aid in targeted searches with pulsar timing arrays for individual supermassive black hole binary sources of low-frequency gravitational waves.

这篇文章总结了首尔国立大学AGN监测项目（SAMP）开展的长期混响映射研究的主要结果。他们在2015年至2021年期间对32个明亮的活动星系核（AGN）进行了高质量数据的收集，并获得了Hβ发射和连续谱变化之间的时间延迟测量。研究还发现，从文献测量结果中得出的Hβ宽线区大小-亮度关系的斜率比先前报道的要平缓。此外，他们的测量时间滞后大多数短于预期，这意味着基于先前校准的单时黑洞质量估计器可能存在较大的系统误差。 <div>
We present the main results from a long-term reverberation mapping campaign carried out for the Seoul National University AGN Monitoring Project (SAMP). High-quality data were obtained during 2015–2021 for 32 luminous active galactic nuclei (AGNs; i.e., continuum luminosity in the range of 1044–46 erg s−1) at a regular cadence, of 20–30 days for spectroscopy and 3–5 days for photometry. We obtain time lag measurements between the variability in the Hβ emission and the continuum for 32 AGNs; 25 of those have the best lag measurements based on our quality assessment, examining correlation strength and the posterior lag distribution. Our study significantly increases the current sample of reverberation-mapped AGNs, particularly at the moderate-to-high-luminosity end. Combining our results with literature measurements, we derive an Hβ broadline region size–luminosity relation with a shallower slope than reported in the literature. For a given luminosity, most of our measured lags are shorter than the expectations, implying that single-epoch black hole mass estimators based on previous calibrations could suffer large systematic uncertainties.

Molecular abundances in protoplanetary disks are highly sensitive to the local physical conditions, including gas temperature, gas density, radiation field, and dust properties. Often multiple factors are intertwined, impacting the abundances of both simple and complex species. We present a new approach to understanding these chemical and physical interdependencies using machine learning. Specifically, we explore the case of CO modeled under the conditions of a generic disk and build an explanatory regression model to study the dependence of CO spatial density on the gas density, gas temperature, cosmic-ray ionization rate, X-ray ionization rate, and UV flux. Our findings indicate that combinations of parameters play a surprisingly powerful role in regulating CO abundance compared to any singular physical parameter. Moreover, in general we find the conditions in the disk are destructive toward CO. CO depletion is further enhanced in an increased cosmic-ray environment and in disks with higher initial C/O ratios. These dependencies uncovered by our new approach are consistent with previous studies, which are more modeling intensive and computationally expensive. Our work thus shows that machine learning can be a powerful tool not only for creating efficient predictive models, but also for enabling a deeper understanding of complex chemical processes.

总结:
本研究提供了地球磁尾磁场中对小振幅压缩性磁流体动力学湍流级联有重要影响的碰撞阻尼(CD)调制的首次观测证据。研究使用了四个Cluster航天器，并基于改进的压缩性磁流体动力学分解算法，将湍流分解为三个本征模式：不可压阿尔文模式和可压缩的慢速和快速（磁音速）模式。观察结果表明，碰撞阻尼增强了可压缩磁流体动力学模式的各向异性，因为碰撞阻尼对波的传播角度有很强的依赖性。快速模式受到更显著的碰撞阻尼调制，具有一个微弱的、与尺度无关的各向异性。随着波数增加，快速模式的各向异性增强。因此，快速模式在可压缩模式的总能量中的比例随着垂直波数（相对于背景磁场）或波传播角度的增加而减少。我们的发现揭示了碰撞阻尼对湍流级联的形成方式以及其在空间环境中各向异性的影响。 <div>
Plasma turbulence is a ubiquitous dynamical process that transfers energy across many spatial and temporal scales and affects energetic particle transport. Recent advances in the understanding of compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence demonstrate the important role of damping in shaping energy distributions on small scales, yet its observational evidence is still lacking. This study provides the first observational evidence of substantial collisionless damping (CD) modulation on the small-amplitude compressible MHD turbulence cascade in Earth’s magnetosheath using four Cluster spacecraft. Based on an improved compressible MHD decomposition algorithm, turbulence is decomposed into three eigenmodes: incompressible Alfvén modes and compressible slow and fast (magnetosonic) modes. Our observations demonstrate that CD enhances the anisotropy of compressible MHD modes because CD has a strong dependence on wave propagation angle. The wavenumber distributions of slow modes are mainly stretched perpendicular to the background magnetic field (B0) and weakly modulated by CD. In contrast, fast modes are subjected to a more significant CD modulation. Fast modes exhibit a weak, scale-independent anisotropy above the CD truncation scale. Below the CD truncation scale, the anisotropy of fast modes enhances as wavenumbers increase. As a result, fast-mode fractions in the total energy of compressible modes decrease with the increase of perpendicular wavenumber (to B0) or wave propagation angle. Our findings reveal how the turbulence cascade is shaped by CD and its consequences for anisotropies in the space environment.

<div> 星系、星系演化、星体形态、星体积效率、星体形态对星体形成效率的影响
<br />
星体形成效率对星体的质量、星体形态和星体形成活动水平有影响。ACA EDGE调查发现，星体形成效率随着星体形成活动水平的降低而系统性减小。研究还发现，处于“绿谷”状态的星系的分子-恒星质量比在核心区域比主序星系更低。此外，研究还指出，在“绿谷”状态的星系中，随着半径增加，分子-恒星质量比和特定星体形成率均呈系统性增加。这些发现暗示了在星系在演化到“绿谷”状态时，星体形成效率的降低是星体形成抑制的重要因素之一。总结：<br /><br />星体形成效率随着星体形成活动水平的降低而系统性减小。处于“绿谷”状态的星系的分子-恒星质量比在核心区域比主序星系更低。在“绿谷”状态的星系中，随着半径增加，分子-恒星质量比和特定星体形成率均呈系统性增加。 <div>
We present a 12CO(J = 2−1) survey of 60 local galaxies using data from the Atacama Compact Array as part of the Extragalactic Database for Galaxy Evolution: the ACA EDGE survey. These galaxies all have integral field spectroscopy from the CALIFA survey. Compared to other local galaxy surveys, ACA EDGE is designed to mitigate selection effects based on CO brightness and morphological type. Of the 60 galaxies in ACA EDGE, 36 are on the star formation main sequence, 13 are on the red sequence, and 11 lie in the “green valley” transition between these sequences. We test how star formation quenching processes affect the star formation rate (SFR) per unit molecular gas mass, SFEmol = SFR/Mmol, and related quantities in galaxies with stellar masses 10 ≤ log[M⋆/M⊙] ≤ 11.5 covering the full range of morphological types. We observe a systematic decrease of the molecular-to-stellar mass fraction ( ) with a decreasing level of star formation activity, with green valley galaxies also having lower SFEmol than galaxies on the main sequence. On average, we find that the spatially resolved SFEmol within the bulge region of green valley galaxies is lower than in the bulges of main-sequence galaxies if we adopt a constant CO-to-H2 conversion factor, αCO. While efficiencies in main-sequence galaxies remain almost constant with galactocentric radius, in green valley galaxies, we note a systematic increase of SFEmol, , and specific SFR with increasing radius. As shown in previous studies, our results suggest that although gas depletion (or removal) seems to be the most important driver of the star formation quenching in galaxies transiting through the green valley, a reduction in star formation efficiency is also required during this stage.

<div> 关键词: 高能辐射，云凝结核，矿物颗粒，聚集，带电状态

总结: 
本研究旨在探索高能辐射对矿物云颗粒聚集和带电状态的影响。实验结果表明，在高湿度环境下，gamma辐射显著增加颗粒的负电荷状态，同时抑制颗粒的聚集形成。而在低湿度环境下，gamma辐射对颗粒的带电状态也有显著影响，但对聚集形成的抑制效果不及在高湿度环境下。因此，高能辐射可能有利于形成大量的小颗粒而非少量的大颗粒。这些发现对于理解行星大气中的云颗粒具有重要意义，特别是考虑到宿主恒星的辐射环境不同，这些研究有助于更好地理解外行星大气的特性。<br /><br /> <div>
It is known from Earth that ionizing high-energy radiation can lead to ion-induced nucleation of cloud condensation nuclei in the atmosphere. Since the amount of high-energy radiation can vary greatly based on the radiative environment of a host star, understanding the effect of high-energy radiation on cloud particles is critical to understand exoplanet atmospheres. This study aims to explore how high-energy radiation affects the aggregation and charging of mineral cloud particles. We present experiments conducted in an atmosphere chamber on mineral SiO2 particles with diameters of 50 nm. The particles were exposed to gamma radiation in either low-humidity (RH ≈ 20%) or high-humidity (RH > 50%) environments. The aggregation and charging state of the particles were studied with a scanning mobility particle sizer. We find that the single SiO2 particles (N1) cluster to form larger aggregates (N2–N4), and that this aggregation is inhibited by gamma radiation. We find that gamma radiation shifts the charging of the particles to become more negative by increasing the charging state of negatively charged particles. Through an independent t-test, we find that this increase is statistically significant within a 5% significance level for all aggregates in the high-humidity environment and all except the N1 particles in the low-humidity environment. For the positively charged particles, the changes in charging state are not within the 5% significance level. We suggest that the overall effect of gamma radiation could favor the formation of a high number of small particles over a lower number of larger particles.

<div> 关键词: 太阳耀斑, 磁场, Lorentz力, 爆发性, 局限性

总结:
太阳耀斑会在光球层的磁场上留下印记，研究旨在通过垂直Lorentz力的变化来区分爆发性和局限性太阳耀斑。研究选取了26个爆发性和11个局限性主要太阳耀斑（强度超过GOES M5级）并分析了这些耀斑区域的磁场。结果显示，在耀斑极性反转线周围区域，水平磁场迅速增加，伴随着相同区域中下行Lorentz力的显著变化。所有局限性事件表现出的Lorentz力变化总量都小于1.8×1022dyn，这一阈值在有效区分爆发性和局限性太阳耀斑中起重要作用。此外，分析结果表明，总Lorentz力的变化还取决于太阳冠层中的重连接高度。这些结果对于理解与耀斑相关的向上脉冲传输以及相关的日冕物质抛射具有重要意义。 <div>
Solar flares are known to leave imprints on the magnetic field in the photosphere, often manifested as an abrupt and permanent change in the downward-directed Lorentz force in localized areas inside the active region. Our study aims to differentiate eruptive and confined solar flares based on the variations in vertical Lorentz force. We select 26 eruptive and 11 confined major solar flares (stronger than the GOES M5 class) observed during 2011–2017. We analyze these flaring regions using SHARP vector magnetograms obtained from NASA’s Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager. We also compare data corresponding to two synthetic flares from a δ-sunspot simulation reported by Chatterjee et al. We estimate the change in the horizontal magnetic field and the total Lorentz force integrated over an area around the polarity inversion line (PIL) that encompasses the location of the flare. Our results indicate a rapid increase in the horizontal magnetic field along the flaring PIL, accompanied by a significant change in the downward-directed Lorentz force in the same vicinity. Notably, we find that all the confined events under study exhibit a total change in Lorentz force of <1.8 × 1022 dyn. This threshold plays an important role in effectively distinguishing eruptive and confined flares. Further, our analysis suggests that the change in total Lorentz force also depends on the reconnection height in the solar corona at the associated flare onset. The results provide significant implications for understanding the flare-related upward impulse transmission for the associated coronal mass ejection.

The analysis of gamma-ray burst (GRB) spectra often relies on empirical models lacking a distinct physical explanation. Previous attempts to couple physical models with observed data focus on individual burst studies, fitting models to segmented spectra with independent physical parameters. However, these approaches typically neglect to explain the time evolution of observed spectra. In this study, we propose a novel approach by incorporating the synchrotron radiation model to provide a self-consistent explanation for a selection of single-pulse GRBs. Our study comprehensively tests the synchrotron model under a unified physical condition, such as a single injection event of electrons. By tracing the evolution of cooling electrons in a decaying magnetic field, our model predicts time-dependent observed spectra that align well with the data. Using a single set of physical parameters, our model successfully fits all time-resolved spectra within each burst. Our model suggests that the rising phase of the GRB light curve results from the increasing number of radiating electrons, while the declining phase is attributed to the curvature effect, electron cooling, and the decaying magnetic field. Our model provides a straightforward interpretation of the peak energy’s evolution, linked to the decline of the magnetic field and electron cooling due to the expansion of the GRB emission region. Our findings strongly support the notion that spectral and temporal evolution in GRB pulses originates from the expansion of the GRB emission region, with an initial radius of approximately 1015 cm, and synchrotron radiation as the underlying emission mechanism.

总结:
通过宇宙学模拟TNG50对类似银河系的星系进行研究发现，银河系类似的恒星盘形成时间和金属丰度存在较大的离散性，约10%的类似银河系的星系在早期形成恒星盘，类似银河系的直接模拟星系大部分质量在100亿年前即已形成，且不受破坏性合并的影响。在早期形成恒星盘的星系中，星盘更倾向于受到旋转支持，且金属丰度较高。相比之下，大多数类似银河系的星系要么是由已经富集的物质形成恒星盘，要么是经历了较晚的破坏性合并导致恒星盘形成较晚并金属丰度较高。 <div>
Recent results from spectroscopic and astrometric surveys of nearby stars suggest that the stellar disk of our Milky Way (MW) was formed quite early, within the first few billion years of its evolution. Chemokinematic signatures of disk formation in cosmological zoom-in simulations appear to be in tension with these data, implying that MW-like disk formation is delayed in simulations. We investigate the formation of galactic disks using a representative sample of MW-like galaxies from the cosmological volume simulation TNG50. We find that on average MW-mass disks indeed form later than the local data suggest. However, their formation time and metallicity exhibit a substantial scatter, such that ∼10% of MW-mass galaxies form disks early, similar to the MW. Thus, although the MW is unusual, it is consistent with the overall population of MW-mass disk galaxies. The direct MW analogs assemble most of their mass early, ≳10 Gyr ago, and are not affected by destructive mergers after that. In addition, these galaxies form their disks during the early enrichment stage when the interstellar medium metallicity increases rapidly, with only ∼25% of early-forming disks being as metal-poor as the MW was at the onset of disk formation, [Fe/H] ≈ −1.0. In contrast, most MW-mass galaxies either form disks from already enriched material or experience late destructive mergers that reset the signatures of galactic disk formation to later times and higher metallicities. Finally, we also show that earlier disk formation leads to more dominant rotationally supported stellar disks at redshift zero.

As stars evolve to higher luminosities during first ascension of the giant branch, previously frozen terrestrial worlds may thaw and host liquid water on their surfaces. Eventually these outer worlds again become uninhabitable due to receiving too much incident light and their water inventory evaporating. Solar-mass stars experience a sudden decrease in luminosity entering the horizontal branch, which could result in a secondary habitable phase for their outer worlds. The outer worlds’ time with habitable surface climates is key in evaluating the possibility of extraterrestrial life arising. The times inside the habitable zone (TIHZ) are calculated for outer worlds orbiting between 5 and 45 au around a Sun-like star. By comparing the TIHZ to time estimates for life to arise on Earth, we evaluate whether such outer worlds are promising candidates in the search for extraterrestrial life. We use two different solar evolution models (PARSEC and Dartmouth) and both optimistic and conservative habitable zone (HZ) definitions. Multiple habitable phases are found for each outer world. Outer worlds with orbits as large as Saturn are found to have a secondary habitable phase which exceeds the first in duration. Generally, the time inside the HZ is found to decrease almost monotonically with orbiting distance. Water loss is calculated after the first habitable phase to determine whether a secondary habitable phase is possible. For all orbiting distances the water loss is insufficient to deplete a water inventory equivalent to that of many moons in the outer solar system.

更新估计卡西opeia A超新星遗迹中中子星(NS)速度的研究。研究利用20年的Chandra观测数据，采用两种方法进行估计：一种是记录数十次Chandra观测中NS的位置，包括数据点的天文学不确定性估计，但不纠正观测的天文测量；另一种是纠正具有足够数量点源并确定了盖亚对应源的13次Chandra观测的天文测量。对于方法#1，观测到一个位于北方177° ± 22°的太阳系速度为275 ± 121 km s−1；对于方法#2，观测到一个位于北方158° ± 12°的太阳系速度为436 ± 89 km s−1。考虑到银河旋转和太阳的特殊运动，这些估计减少到分别为256 km s−1 and 167°和433 km s−1和151°。我们的估计排除了速度≳600 km s−1，与卡西opeia A的爆炸中心估计的速度∼350 km s−1和先前10年基线固有运动测量的570 ± 260 km s−1相匹配，但我们使用了更长时间跨度上的额外数据，导致了2-3倍的减小不确定性。我们的估计更好地匹配包括NS踢动机制的卡西opeia A的模拟。 <br /><br />总结: 通过Chandra观测数据，对卡西opeia A超新星遗迹中中子星(NS)速度进行了研究。使用两种方法得出的估计速度与先前的测量相匹配，但由于使用了更长时间跨度的额外数据，导致了更小的不确定性。新的估计排除了某些速度范围，并与包括NS踢动机制的模拟更好地匹配。 <div>
In this paper, we present updated estimates of the velocity of the neutron star (NS) in the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A using over two decades of Chandra observations. We use two methods: (1) recording the NS positions from dozens of Chandra observations, including the astrometric uncertainty estimates on the data points, but not correcting the astrometry of the observations; and (2) correcting the astrometry of the 13 Chandra observations that have a sufficient number of point sources with identified Gaia counterparts. For method #1, we observe a heliocentric velocity of 275 ± 121 km s−1, with an angle of 177° ± 22° east of north. For method #2, we observe a heliocentric velocity of 436 ± 89 km s−1 at an angle of 158° ± 12°. Correcting for galactic rotation and the Sun’s peculiar motion decreases these estimates to 256 km s−1 at 167° and 433 km s−1 at 151°, respectively. Both of our estimates match with the explosion-center-estimated velocity of ∼350 km s−1 and the previous 10 yr baseline proper-motion measurement of 570 ± 260 km s−1, but our use of additional data over a longer baseline has led to a smaller uncertainty by a factor of 2–3. Our estimates rule out velocities ≳600 km s−1 and better match with simulations of Cassiopeia A that include NS kick mechanisms.

<br /><br />总结:
研究分析了围绕银河系中心超大质量黑洞的S星团的轨道分布。发现了围绕近地点距离rp与轨道离心率e⋆之间的紧密依存关系，这不能简单地通过半长轴和离心率的随机分布来解释。没有发现在大e⋆和大rp区域或小e⋆和小rp区域有任何恒星。虽然样本仍很小，但G云显示了非常相似的分布。确定了确定S星的轨道参数的可能性。具有大e⋆和大rp的恒星的可能性非常小。S星可能存在于该区域。但是，要确定它们的轨道参数，需要在更长的时间段内进行观测。另一方面，如果存在小rp和小e⋆的恒星，则它们的轨道参数应该已经被确定。因此，这一区域的无星表明不存在具有这些轨道特征的S星，为它们的形成提供了约束。我们将这一由rp和e⋆定义的区域称为回避区。最后，结果表明，如果考虑到在回避区内没有恒星存在以及目前无法确定具有大rp和大e⋆的恒星的轨道参数这一事实，观测到的离心率和近地点距离的频率与对rp和e⋆的随机抽样是一致的。 <div>
The orbital distribution of the S-star cluster surrounding the supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way is analyzed. A tight dependence of the pericenter distance rp on orbital eccentricity e⋆ is found, , which cannot be explained simply by a random distribution of semimajor axis and eccentricities. No stars are found in the region with high e⋆ and large or in the region with low e⋆ and small . Although the sample is still small, the G-clouds show a very similar distribution. The likelihood to determine the orbital parameters of S-stars is determined. P is very small for stars with large e⋆ and large . S-stars might exist in this region. To determine their orbital parameters, one however needs observations over a longer time period. On the other hand, if stars would exist in the region of low and small e⋆, their orbital parameters should by now have been determined. That this region is unpopulated therefore indicates that no S-stars exist with these orbital characteristics, providing constraints for their formation. We call this region, defined by , the zone of avoidance. Finally, it is shown that the observed frequency of eccentricities and pericenter distances is consistent with a random sampling of and e⋆ if one takes into account the fact that no stars exist in the zone of avoidance and that orbital parameters cannot yet be determined for stars with large rp and large e⋆.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Spin period distribution provides important clues to understand the formation of millisecond pulsars (MSPs). To uncover the intrinsic period distribution, we analyze three samples of radio MSPs in the Galactic field and globular clusters. The selection bias due to pulse broadening has been corrected but turns out to be negligible. We find that all the samples can be well described by a Weibull distribution of spin frequencies. Considering MSPs in the Galactic field or globular clusters and in isolation or binary systems, we find no significant difference in the spin distribution among these subpopulations. Based on the current known population of MSPs, we find that submillisecond pulsars are unlikely to be discovered by the Square Kilometre Array, although up to ∼10 discoveries of pulsars that spin faster than the current record holder of P = 1.4 ms are expected.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We simulate a black hole accretion disk system with full-transport general relativistic neutrino radiation magnetohydrodynamics for 1.2 s. This system is likely to form after the merger of two compact objects and is thought to be a robust site of r-process nucleosynthesis. We consider the case of a black hole accretion disk arising from the merger of two neutron stars. Our simulation time coincides with the nucleosynthesis timescale of the r-process (∼1 s). Because these simulations are time-consuming, it is common practice to run for a “short” duration of approximately 0.1–0.3 s. We analyze the nucleosynthetic outflow from this system and compare the results of stopping at 0.12 and 1.2 s. We find that the addition of mass ejected in the longer simulation as well as more favorable thermodynamic conditions from emergent viscous ejecta greatly impacts the nucleosynthetic outcome. We quantify the error in nucleosynthetic outcomes between short and long cuts.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The tidal disruption of a star around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) offers a unique opportunity to study accretion onto an SMBH on a human timescale. We present results from our 1000+ days monitoring campaign of AT 2019avd, a nuclear transient with tidal-disruption-event-like properties, with NICER, Swift, and Chandra. Our primary finding is that approximately 225 days following the peak of the X-ray emission, there is a rapid drop in luminosity exceeding 2 orders of magnitude. This X-ray dropoff is accompanied by X-ray spectral hardening, followed by a plateau phase of 740 days. During this phase, the spectral index decreases from 6.2 ± 1.1 to 2.3 ± 0.4, while the disk temperature remains constant. Additionally, we detect pronounced X-ray variability, with an average fractional rms amplitude of 47%, manifesting over timescales of a few dozen minutes. We propose that this phenomenon may be attributed to intervening clumpy outflows. The overall properties of AT 2019avd suggest that the accretion disk evolves from a super-Eddington to a sub-Eddington luminosity state, possibly associated with a compact jet. This evolution follows a pattern in the hardness–intensity diagram similar to that observed in stellar-mass BHs, supporting the mass invariance of accretion–ejection processes around BHs.

<title>Relativistic Effects on Circumbinary Disk Evolution: Breaking the Polar Alignment around Eccentric Black Hole Binary Systems</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We study the effects of general relativity (GR) on the evolution and alignment of circumbinary disks around binaries on all scales. We implement relativistic apsidal precession of the binary into the hydrodynamics code phantom. We find that the effects of GR can suppress the stable polar alignment of a circumbinary disk, depending on how the relativistic binary apsidal precession timescale compares to the disk nodal precession timescale. Studies of circumbinary disk evolution typically ignore the effects of GR, which is an appropriate simplification for low-mass or widely separated binary systems. In this case, polar alignment occurs, provided that the disks initial misalignment is sufficiently large. However, systems with a very short relativistic precession timescale cannot polar align and instead move toward coplanar alignment. In the intermediate regime where the timescales are similar, the outcome depends upon the properties of the disk. Polar alignment is more likely in the wavelike disk regime (where the disk viscosity parameter is less than the aspect ratio, α < H/r), since the disk is in good radial communication. In the viscous disk regime, disk breaking is more likely. Multiple rings can destructively interact with one another, resulting in short disk lifetimes and the disk moving toward coplanar alignment. Around main-sequence star or stellar mass black hole binaries, polar alignment may be suppressed far from the binary, but in general, the inner parts of the disk can align to polar. Polar alignment may be completely suppressed for disks around supermassive black holes for close binary separations.

<title>Magnetic Relaxation Seen in a Rapidly Evolving Light Bridge in a Sunspot</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report a magnetic relaxation process inside a sunspot associated with the evolution of a transient light bridge (LB). From high-resolution imaging and spectro-polarimetric data taken by the 1.6 m Goode Solar Telescope installed at Big Bear Solar Observatory, we observe the evolutionary process of a rapidly evolving LB. The LB is formed as a result of the strong intrusion of filamentary structures with relatively horizontal fields into the vertical umbral field region. A strong current density is detected along a localized region where the magnetic field topology changes rapidly in the sunspot, especially in the boundary region between the LB and the umbra, and bright jets are observed intermittently and repeatedly in the chromosphere along this region through magnetic reconnection. In the second half of our observation, the horizontal component of the magnetic field diminishes within the LB, and the typical convection structure within the sunspot, which manifests itself as umbral dots, is restored. Our findings provide a comprehensive perspective not only on the evolution of an LB itself but also on its impacts in the neighboring regions, including the chromospheric activity and the change of magnetic energy of a sunspot.

We present deep Hubble Space Telescope imaging of the nearby Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2011fe obtained 11.5 yr after explosion. No emission is detected at the SN location to a 1σ (3σ) limit of F555W > 30.2 (29.0) mag, or equivalently MV > 1.2 (−0.1) mag, neglecting the distance uncertainty to M101. We constrain the presence of donor stars impacted by the SN ejecta with the strictest limits thus far on compact (i.e., ) companions. H-rich zero-age main-sequence companions with masses ≥2 M⊙ are excluded, a significant improvement upon the preexplosion imaging limit of ≈5 M⊙. Main-sequence He stars with masses ≥1.0 M⊙ and subgiant He stars with masses ≤0.8 M⊙ are also disfavored by our late-time imaging. Synthesizing our limits on postimpact donors with previous constraints from preexplosion imaging, early-time radio and X-ray observations, and nebular-phase spectroscopy, essentially all formation channels for SN 2011fe invoking a nondegenerate donor star at the time of explosion are unlikely.

<title>Revised Constraints on the Fast Radio Burst Population from the First CHIME/FRB Catalog</title>

In this paper, we investigate the fast radio burst (FRB) population using the first CHIME/FRB catalog. We first reconstruct the extragalactic dispersion measure–redshift relation (DME–z relation) from well-localized FRBs, then use it to infer the redshift and isotropic energy of the first CHIME/FRB catalog. The intrinsic energy distribution is modeled by the power law with an exponential cutoff, and the selection effect of the CHIME telescope is modeled by a two-parametric function of specific fluence. For the intrinsic redshift distribution, the star formation history (SFH) model and five other SFH-related models are considered. We construct the joint likelihood of fluence, energy, and redshift, and all the free parameters are constrained simultaneously using the Bayesian inference method. The Bayesian information criterion (BIC) is used to choose the model that best matches the observational data. For comparison, we fit our models with two data samples, i.e., the Full sample and the Gold sample. The power-law index and cutoff energy are tightly constrained to be 1.8 ≲ α ≲ 1.9 and , which are almost independent of the redshift distribution model and the data sample we choose. The parameters involving the selection effect strongly depend on the data sample but are insensitive to the redshift distribution model. According to BIC, the pure SFH model is strongly disfavored by both the Full sample and Gold sample. For the other five SFH-related redshift distribution models, most of them can match the data well if the parameters are properly chosen. Therefore, with the present data, it is still premature to draw a conclusion on the FRB population.

<div> 二进制黑洞，人口建模，次要质量分布，形成历史，30 M⊙，主要质量分布，脉冲对撞法，超新星堆积

总结：<br /><br />本文针对二进制黑洞群体进行了分析，首次明确拟合了次要质量分布。研究发现，数据表明存在一个约为30 M⊙的峰值，但仅存在于次要质量分布中，这对我们理解这些二进制系统的形成具有重要意义。另一方面，数据也支持这一峰值存在于两个组分的质量分布中，这是大多数以前研究未考虑的可能性。不论哪种情况，这一峰值的观测值都低于以前对主要质量分布的分析结果，这与脉冲对撞法超新星堆积的预期存在进一步的张力。 <div>
When modeling the population of merging binary black holes, analyses have generally focused on characterizing the distribution of primary (i.e., more massive) black holes in the binary, while using simplistic prescriptions for the distribution of secondary masses. However, the secondary mass distribution and its relationship to the primary mass distribution provide a fundamental observational constraint on the formation history of coalescing binary black holes. If both black holes experience similar stellar evolutionary processes prior to collapse, as might be expected in dynamical formation channels, the primary and secondary mass distributions would show similar features. If they follow distinct evolutionary pathways (for example, due to binary interactions that break symmetry between the initially more massive and less massive stars), their mass distributions may differ. We present the first analysis of the binary black hole population that explicitly fits for the secondary mass distribution. We find that the data is consistent with a ∼30 M⊙ peak existing only in the distribution of secondary rather than primary masses. This would have major implications for our understanding of the formation of these binaries. Alternatively, the data is consistent with the peak existing in both component mass distributions, a possibility not included in most previous studies. In either case, the peak is observed at , which is shifted lower than the value obtained in previous analyses of the marginal primary mass distribution, placing this feature in further tension with expectations from a pulsational pair-instability supernova pileup.

总结: 
在低质量恒星形成的发展阶段，对可变吸积进行了深入研究。然而，在恒星形成的初期阶段，吸积历史仍然是一个鲜为人知的课题。通过研究W43-MM1中的46个流出气流，可以对星体的吸积历史进行一些解释。研究发现，需要考虑喷流速度的变化模式和喷流的进动，才能解释W43-MM1中核心#8的观测参数。通过进行3D流体动力学模拟，可以对这一现象进行更深入的研究。 <br /><br />总结: 通过对W43-MM1的研究发现，恒星形成初期阶段的吸积历史是一个重要的课题。W43-MM1包含了大量的流出气流，研究发现核心#8的喷流速度变化模式和进动对解释观测现象至关重要。进行3D流体动力学模拟可以更好地理解这些现象。 <div>
Variable accretion has been well studied in the evolved stages of low-mass star formation. However, the accretion history in the initial phases of star formation is still a seldom studied topic. The outflows and jets emerging from protostellar objects could shed some light on their accretion history. We consider the recently studied case of W43-MM1, a protocluster containing 46 outflows driven by 27 protostellar cores. The outflow kinematics of the individual cores and associated knots in W43-MM1 indicate episodic protostellar ejection. We take the observed parameters of an individual core system (core #8) and perform 3D hydrodynamic simulations of such a system, including episodic changes in the velocity of the outflow. The simulations consist of a collimated jet emerging from a core, taking into account one- and two-velocity modes in the variation of the ejection velocity of the jet. In addition, we investigated the effect of including the precession of the jet in the one- and two-velocity-mode models. From the simulations, we constructed position–velocity diagrams and compared them with the observations. We find that including a second mode in the ejection velocity, as well as the precession, are required to explain the positions of the outflow knots and other position–velocity features observed in core #8 in W43-MM1.

We present cosmological analysis of 12 nearby (z < 0.06) Type IIP supernovae (SNe IIP) observed with the ROTSE-IIIb telescope. To achieve precise photometry, we present a new image-differencing technique that is implemented for the first time on the ROTSE SN photometry pipeline. With this method, we find up to a 20% increase in the detection efficiency and significant reduction in residual rms scatter of the SN lightcurves when compared to the previous pipeline performance. We use the published optical spectra and broadband photometry of well-studied SNe IIP to establish temporal models for ejecta velocity and photospheric temperature evolution for our SNe IIP population. This study yields measurements that are competitive with other methods even when the data are limited to a single epoch during the photospheric phase of SNe IIP. Using the fully reduced ROTSE photometry and optical spectra, we apply these models to the respective photometric epochs for each SN in the ROTSE IIP sample. This facilitates the use of the Expanding Photosphere Method (EPM) to obtain distance estimates to their respective host galaxies. We then perform cosmological parameter fitting using these EPM distances, from which we measure the Hubble constant to be , which is consistent with the standard ΛCDM model values derived using other independent techniques.

<title>Collapsars as Sites of r-process Nucleosynthesis: Systematic Photometric Near-infrared Follow-up of Type Ic-BL Supernovae</title>

<div> 关键词: GW170817, r-process elements, neutron star mergers, collapsars, supernovae Ic-BL
总结: <br /><br />这篇文章讨论了GW170817发现后的开放性问题，即中子星合并是否是产生r过程元素的唯一天体物理场所。他们对Ic-BL超新星进行了光度学研究，以确定这些爆炸中是否合成了多少量的r过程物质。通过使用半解析模型进行光度曲线拟合，他们得出的结果表明，在样本中没有发现任何强有力的r过程丰度迹象。未来的高频红外光度研究和星云光谱分析可能会对更小量的r过程排出物或显示所有collapsars是否完全缺乏r过程核生成提供敏感性。 <div>
One of the open questions following the discovery of GW170817 is whether neutron star (NS) mergers are the only astrophysical sites capable of producing r-process elements. Simulations have shown that 0.01–0.1 M⊙ of r-process material could be generated in the outflows originating from the accretion disk surrounding the rapidly rotating black hole that forms as a remnant to both NS mergers and collapsing massive stars associated with long-duration gamma-ray bursts (collapsars). The hallmark signature of r-process nucleosynthesis in the binary NS merger GW170817 was its long-lasting near-infrared (NIR) emission, thus motivating a systematic photometric study of the light curves of broad-lined stripped-envelope (Ic-BL) supernovae (SNe) associated with collapsars. We present the first systematic study of 25 SNe Ic-BL—including 18 observed with the Zwicky Transient Facility and 7 from the literature—in the optical/NIR bands to determine what quantity of r-process material, if any, is synthesized in these explosions. Using semi-analytic models designed to account for r-process production in SNe Ic-BL, we perform light curve fitting to derive constraints on the r-process mass for these SNe. We also perform independent light curve fits to models without the r-process. We find that the r-process-free models are a better fit to the light curves of the objects in our sample. Thus, we find no compelling evidence of r-process enrichment in any of our objects. Further high-cadence infrared photometric studies and nebular spectroscopic analysis would be sensitive to smaller quantities of r-process ejecta mass or indicate whether all collapsars are completely devoid of r-process nucleosynthesis.

NGC 1087通过詹姆斯·韦伯空间望远镜近红外摄像机观测到微弱的非轴对称结构，且在星体速度图、Hα和CO J = 2 → 1速度场中观察到椭圆形畸变。这种结构仅在近红外的F200W和F300M波段滤波器下才能被发现。这种非轴对称结构类似于星体棒，但与传统的星体棒有显著差异。大部分近红外辐射集中在6″∼500 pc范围内，最大延伸达1.2 kpc。大尺度非圆形运动的空间延伸与星体棒重合，确认了NGC 1087的势能中存在非轴对称扰动。椭圆形畸变在CO中得到增强，这是由于其动力学上的冷性质。研究发现，所有相位（包括恒星、电离和分子）的动力学都可以同时由含有双轴对称扰动的模型描述，然而，沿着星体棒主轴的气体流入模型也很可能存在。此外，与分子质量流入率相关的可以解释星体棒中观察到的星形成率。这一结果进一步加强了星体棒是气体传输和触发星形成的机制的观点。这项工作利用迄今为止最先进的数据丰富了我们对星系非轴对称性的理解。<br /><br />总结: NGC 1087通过詹姆斯·韦伯空间望远镜观测到了非轴对称结构，形似星体棒，但有明显差异。非轴对称运动的空间延伸与星体棒重合，验证了NGC 1087的势能中存在非轴对称扰动。同时，CO中椭圆形畸变增强，而气体流入模型能很好地解释观测到的星形成率。这一研究加强了星体棒是气体传输和触发星形成的重要机制的观点。 <div>
We report a faint nonaxisymmetric structure in NGC 1087 through the use of James Webb Space Telescope Near Infrared Camera, with an associated kinematic counterpart observed as an oval distortion in the stellar velocity map, Hα, and CO J = 2 → 1 velocity fields. This structure is not evident in the MUSE optical continuum images but only revealed in the near-IR with the F200W and F300M band filters at 2 μm and 3 μm, respectively. Due to its elongation, this structure resembles a stellar bar although with remarkable differences with respect to conventional stellar bars. Most of the near-IR emission is concentrated within 6″∼500 pc with a maximum extension up to 1.2 kpc. The spatial extension of the large-scale noncircular motions is coincident with the bar, which undoubtedly confirms the presence of a nonaxisymmetric perturbation in the potential of NGC 1087. The oval distortion is enhanced in CO due to its dynamically cold nature rather than in Hα. We found that the kinematics in all phases, including stellar, ionized, and molecular, can be described simultaneously by a model containing a bisymmetric perturbation; however, we find that an inflow model of gas along the bar major axis is also likely. Furthermore, the molecular mass inflow rate associated can explain the observed star-formation rate in the bar. This reinforces the idea that bars are mechanisms for transporting gas and triggering star formation. This work contributes to our understanding of nonaxisymmetry in galaxies using the most sophisticated data so far.

总结:<br /><br />本文研究了Davis–Chandrasekhar–Fermi (DCF)方法在星云磁场评估中的应用。通过对一个理想云图应用五个DCF方程，确定了局部DCF估计的分布。发现统计校正因子βml表明BDCF是Bml的有偏估计，其值在0.7到0.9之间。此外，统计校正因子与MHD模拟得到的校正因子部分符合。作者估计了统计校正的相对重要性，并提出结构函数和原始DCF方程最为准确，需要的物理校正最少。而大角度和平行-δB方程的物理校正因子较大。这些结果有助于在模型限制下选择适用的DCF方程。 <div>
The Davis–Chandrasekhar–Fermi (DCF) method is widely used to evaluate magnetic fields in star-forming regions. Yet it remains unclear how well DCF equations estimate the mean plane-of-the-sky field strength in a map region. To address this question, five DCF equations are applied to an idealized cloud map. Its polarization angles have a normal distribution with dispersion σθ, and its density and velocity dispersion have negligible variation. Each DCF equation specifies a global field strength BDCF and a distribution of local DCF estimates. The “most-likely” DCF field strength Bml is the distribution mode, for which a correction factor βml ≡ Bml/BDCF is calculated analytically. For each equation, βml < 1, indicating that BDCF is a biased estimator of Bml. The values of βml are βml ≈ 0.7 when due to turbulent excitation of Alfvénic MHD waves, and βml ≈ 0.9 when due to non-Alfvénic MHD waves. These statistical correction factors βml have partial agreement with correction factors obtained from MHD simulations. The relative importance of the statistical correction is estimated by assuming that each simulation correction has both a statistical and a physical component. Then the standard, structure function, and original DCF equations appear most accurate because they require the least physical correction. Their relative physical correction factors are 0.1, 0.3, and 0.4 on a scale from 0 to 1. In contrast, the large-angle and parallel-δB equations have physical correction factors 0.6 and 0.7. These results may be useful in selecting DCF equations, within model limitations.

<br /><br />总结:
研究讨论了Type Ia超新星（SN Ia）在行星状星云（PN）内爆炸的可能性，通过对共同包层（CE）引发的恒星并合导致的SN Ia爆发进行了水动力学和非平衡电离模拟。研究比较了模拟的SNR的动力学和X射线光谱与银河系和麦哲伦云中已知Type Ia SNR的观测特征。研究发现CE事件和SN爆发之间的延迟对模拟结果产生了影响，CE事件后立即发生的SN爆发很难与观测一致，而延迟约10,000年的模型更接近观测结果，并可以解释一些Type Ia SNR的整体性质。 <div>
The nature of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) explosions remains an open issue, with several contending progenitor scenarios actively being considered. One such scenario involves an SN Ia explosion inside a planetary nebula (PN) in the aftermath of a stellar merger triggered by a common envelope (CE) episode. We examine this scenario using hydrodynamic and nonequilibrium ionization simulations of the interaction between the SN ejecta and the PN cocoon into the supernova remnant (SNR) phase, focusing on the impact of the delay between the CE episode and the SN explosion. We compare the bulk dynamics and X-ray spectra of our simulated SNRs to the observed properties of known Type Ia SNRs in the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds. We conclude that models where the SN explosion happens in the immediate aftermath of the CE episode (with a delay ≲1000 yr) are hard to reconcile with the observations, because the interaction with the dense PN cocoon results in ionization timescales much higher than those found in any known Type Ia SNR. Models with a longer delay between the CE episode and the SN explosion (∼10,000 yr) are closer to the observations, and may be able to explain the bulk properties of some Type Ia SNRs.

A considerable effort has been dedicated recently to the construction of generic equations of state (EOSs) for matter in neutron stars. The advantage of these approaches is that they can provide model-independent information on the interior structure and global properties of neutron stars. Making use of more than 106 generic EOSs, we assess the validity of quasi-universal relations of neutron-star properties for a broad range of rotation rates, from slow rotation up to the mass-shedding limit. In this way, we are able to determine with unprecedented accuracy the quasi-universal maximum-mass ratio between rotating and nonrotating stars and reveal the existence of a new relation for the surface oblateness, i.e., the ratio between the polar and equatorial proper radii. We discuss the impact that our findings have on the imminent detection of new binary neutron-star mergers and how they can be used to set new and more stringent limits on the maximum mass of nonrotating neutron stars, as well as to improve the modeling of the X-ray emission from the surface of rotating stars.

Robust estimation of star formation rates (SFRs) at higher redshifts (z ≳ 1) using UV–optical–near-infrared (NIR) photometry is contingent on the ability of spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting to constrain the dust attenuation, stellar metallicity, and star formation history (SFH) simultaneously. IR-derived dust luminosities can help break the degeneracy between these parameters, but IR data are often not available. Here, we explore strategies for SED fitting at z ≳ 1 in the absence of IR data using a sample of log M* > 10.2 star-forming galaxies from the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) for which 24 μm data are available. We adopt the total IR luminosity (LTIR) obtained from 24 μm as the “ground truth,” which allows us to assess how well it can be recovered (as Ldust) from UV–optical–NIR SED fitting. We test a variety of dust attenuation models, stellar population synthesis models, metallicity assumptions, and SFHs separately to identify which assumptions maximize the agreement (correlation and linearity) between LTIR and Ldust. We find that a flexible dust attenuation law performs best. For stellar populations, we find that Bruzual & Charlot models are favored over those of Eldridge et al. Fixing the stellar metallicity at solar value is preferred to other fixed values or leaving it as a free parameter. For SFHs, we find that minimizing the variability in the recent (<100 Myr) SFH improves the agreement with LTIR. Finally, we provide a catalog of galaxy parameters (including M* and SFR) for CANDELS galaxies with and 0.7 < z < 1.3, obtained using the models we found to be the most robust.

<div> voids, galaxies, TNG300 simulation, underdensity, background density
<br /><br />
这篇文章研究了TNG300模拟中的虚空和虚空星系的特性。通过使用明亮星系目录和球形虚空发现算法，他们在红移z=0时识别了5078个虚空。这些虚空覆盖了模拟体积的83%，并且具有中位数半径为4.4 h−1 Mpc。作者基于星系是否存在于虚空内（“虚空星系”；75220个物体）或虚空外（“非虚空星系”；527454个物体），确定了两种星系群。在虚空内，质量不直接追踪光。虚空内的平均径向欠密度轮廓由虚空星系的位置定义，其系统性低于由暗物质定义的平均径向欠密度轮廓（即虚空更缺乏星系而非质量）。此外，与非虚空星系相比，虚空星系的平均年龄更小，质量更小，色彩更蓝，铁元素含量更低，半径更小。总体而言，虚空星系的特有恒星形成速率比非虚空星系高约20％，对于中心超大质量黑洞质量为MBH ≳ 3 × 106h−1 M⊙的星系，活跃虚空星系的比例比活跃的非虚空星系高约25％。

We investigate the properties of voids and void galaxies in the TNG300 simulation. Using a luminous galaxy catalog and a spherical void-finding algorithm, we identify 5078 voids at redshift z = 0. The voids cover 83% of the simulation volume and have a median radius of 4.4 h−1 Mpc. We identify two populations of field galaxies based on whether the galaxies reside within a void (“void galaxies”; 75,220 objects) or outside a void (“nonvoid galaxies”; 527,454 objects). Within the voids, mass does not directly trace light. Instead, the mean radial underdensity profile as defined by the locations of void galaxies is systematically lower than the mean radial underdensity profile as defined by the dark matter (i.e., the voids are more “devoid” of galaxies than they are of mass). Within the voids, the integrated underdensity profiles of the dark matter and the galaxies are independent of the local background density (i.e., voids-in-voids versus voids-in-clouds). Beyond the void radii, however, the integrated underdensity profiles of both the dark matter and the galaxies exhibit strong dependencies on the local background density. Compared to nonvoid galaxies, void galaxies are on average younger, less massive, bluer in color, less metal enriched, and have smaller radii. In addition, the specific star formation rates of void galaxies are ∼20% higher than nonvoid galaxies and, in the case of galaxies with central supermassive black holes with MBH ≳ 3 × 106h−1 M⊙, the fraction of active void galaxies is ∼25% higher than active nonvoid galaxies.

观测Crab脉冲星的Jodrell Bank Observatory使用归档数据产生了日常的巨脉冲对齐堆栈，研究了2012年4月至2016年12月之间日常轮廓的变化。研究表明，介质引起的回波可能比以前的检测率暗示的要普遍得多。所有观察到的回波在最接近正常巨脉冲发射时的延迟为零。这表明产生这些事件的结构必须高度各向异性，典型长度大约大于4天文单位，天空上的典型宽度约为0.1天文单位，典型深度约为5天文单位，鉴于之前观察到的星云丝的电子密度约为1000 cm−3。这表明这些不均匀很可能是来自蟹状星云较大丝状结构的支流亚结构。<br /><br />总结: 这项研究使用Jodrell Bank Observatory的42英尺望远镜的归档数据，对蟹状星云脉冲星的巨脉冲进行了研究，发现存在回波现象。回波表现出高度各向异性，可能是蟹状星云较大丝状结构的支流亚结构。 <div>
Using archival data from the 42-foot telescope at the Jodrell Bank Observatory, we produce daily stacks of aligned giant pulses for the Crab pulsar, to study changes to the daily profiles between 2012 April and 2016 December. From these, we identify echoes, where intervening material away from the line of sight causes pulsed emission to be redirected toward the observer, with delay corresponding to the increased distance of travel, resulting in additional profile components. These observations show that such echoes may be far more common than implied by the previous rate of detections. All the observed echoes are consistent with approaching zero delay at their closest approach to the normal giant pulse emission. This indicates that the structures responsible for producing these events must be highly anisotropic, with typical lengths greater than ∼4 au, typical widths on the sky of ∼0.1 au, and typical depths of ∼5 au, given the previously observed electron densities of the nebular filaments, on the order of 1000 cm−3. This suggests that these inhomogeneities are likely to be offshoot substructure from the larger nebular filaments of the Crab nebula.

总结: 
超新星质量的确定对于了解它们的形成、演化和内部结构至关重要。目前只有少数几十颗超新星的质量被测量过，大部分是属于双星系统。然而，有大量孤立的超新星的质量尚不清楚。利用超新星的微引力透镜现象提供了了解这些紪实体的独特机会。通过使用澳大利亚天文台的脉冲星目录和Gaia DR3，我们搜索和预测了这些最近和未来的事件。我们发现了60个可能由超新星引起的星空测量微引力透镜事件，并利用蒙特卡洛采样对它们的观测值进行了概率分布。我们还发现了四个可能的“定时微引力透镜”事件，即由前景物体引起的脉冲星微引力透镜现象，可能会通过定时测量被检测到。然而，我们对这些事件的预测受到可用星空测量和定时测量的不确定性的限制。 <div>
Determining the mass of neutron stars is crucial for understanding their formation, evolution, and interior structure. Currently, only a few dozen neutron stars have had their masses measured, and most of them belong to binary systems. However, there are a huge number of isolated neutron stars with unknown masses. Microlensing events with neutron stars provide unique opportunities for knowing these compact objects. Astrometric microlensing with a background source lensed by a neutron star might be used to determine the neutron star's mass by measuring the deviation of the motion of the centroid of the images from its unlensed one. We search and predict these recent and future events based on the Australia Telescope National Facility Pulsar Catalog and Gaia DR3. We find 60 candidate astrometric microlensing events caused by neutron stars and the probability distributions of their observables by the Monte Carlo sampling. We also find four candidate “timing microlensing” events with a pulsar lensed by a foreground object that might be detected by timing measurements. While some of these events may be verified by future astrometric missions or pulsar-timing observations, we note that our prediction of these events is significantly restricted by the uncertainties of the available astrometric and timing measurements after assessing and comparing our results with previous works.

<title>Life in a Random Universe: Sciama's Argument Reconsidered</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Random sampling in high dimensions has successfully been applied to phenomena as diverse as nuclear resonances, neural networks, and black hole evaporation. Here we revisit an elegant argument by the British physicist Dennis Sciama, who demonstrated that were our Universe random, it would almost certainly have a negligible chance for life. Under plausible assumptions, we show that a random universe can masquerade as “intelligently designed,” with the fundamental constants instead appearing to be fined tuned to achieve the highest probability for life to occur. For our Universe, this mechanism may only require there to be around a dozen currently unknown fundamental constants. We speculate on broader applications for the mechanism we uncover.

<title>Formation of PSR J1012+5307 with an Extremely Low-mass White Dwarf: Testing Magnetic Braking Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
PSR J1012+5307 is a millisecond pulsar with an extremely low-mass white dwarf (WD) companion in an orbit of 14.5 hr. Magnetic braking (MB) plays an important role in influencing the orbital evolution of binary systems with a low-mass (≲1–2 M⊙) donor star. At present, there exist several different MB descriptions. In this paper, we investigate the formation of PSR J1012+5307 as a probe to test plausible MB models. Employing a detailed stellar evolution model with the MESA code, we find that the convection- and rotation-boosted MB and “Intermediate” MB models can reproduce the WD mass, WD radius, WD surface gravity, neutron star mass, and orbital period observed in PSR J1012+5307. However, our simulated WD has a higher effective temperature than the observations. Three other MB mechanisms, including the standard MB model, are too weak to account for the observed orbital period in the Hubble time. A long cooling timescale caused by H-shell flashes of the WD may alleviate the discrepancy between the simulated effective temperature and the observed value.

<title>rms–Flux Slope in MAXI J1820+070: A Measure of Disk–Corona Coupling</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The linear rms–flux relation has been well established in different spectral states of all accreting systems. In this work, we study the evolution of the frequency-dependent rms–flux relation of MAXI J1820+070 during the initial decaying phase of its 2018 outburst with Insight-HXMT over a broad energy range of 1–150 keV. As the flux decreases, we first observe a linear rms–flux relation at frequencies from 2 mHz to 10 Hz, while such a relation breaks at varying times for different energies, leading to a substantial reduction in the slope. Moreover, we find that the low-frequency variability exhibits the highest sensitivity to the break, which occurs prior to the hard-to-hard state transition time determined through time-averaged spectroscopy, and the time deviation increases with energy. The overall evolution of the rms–flux slope and intercept suggests the presence of a two-component Comptonization system. One component is radially extended, explaining the strong disk–corona coupling before the break, while the other component extends vertically, contributing to a reduction of disk–corona coupling after the break. A further vertical expansion of the latter component is required to accommodate the dynamic evolution observed in the rms–flux slope. In conclusion, we suggest that the rms–flux slope in the 1–150 keV band can be employed as an indicator of disk–corona coupling, and the hard-to-hard state transition in MAXI J1820+070 could be partially driven by changes in the coronal geometry.

总结: 本研究使用Fermi大型面积望远镜的数据对太阳盘的γ射线发射进行了深入调查，发现了太阳盘γ射线发射的非对称特征，并确认了与太阳循环和太阳磁场之间的潜在联系。这些发现挑战了已有的发射模型，促使对高能太阳天体物理学提出新的观点。 <div>
The Sun is one of the most luminous γ-ray sources in the sky and continues to challenge our understanding of its high-energy emission mechanisms. This study provides an in-depth investigation of the solar disk γ-ray emission, using data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope spanning 2008 August to 2022 January. We focus on γ-ray events with energies exceeding 5 GeV, originating from 0.°5 angular aperture centered on the Sun, and implement stringent time cuts to minimize potential sample contaminants. We use a helioprojection method to resolve the γ-ray events relative to the solar rotation axes and combine statistical tests to investigate the distribution of events over the solar disk. We found that integrating observations over large time windows may overlook relevant asymmetrical features, which we reveal in this work through a refined time-dependent morphological analysis. We describe significant anisotropic trends and confirm compelling evidence of energy-dependent asymmetry in the solar disk γ-ray emission. Intriguingly, the asymmetric signature coincides with the Sun’s polar field flip during the cycle 24 solar maximum, around 2014 June. Our findings suggest that the Sun’s magnetic configuration plays a significant role in shaping the resulting γ-ray signature, highlighting a potential link between the observed anisotropies, solar cycle, and the solar magnetic fields. These insights pose substantial challenges to established emission models, prompting fresh perspectives on high-energy solar astrophysics.

Using integral field spectroscopy (IFS) from MaNGA, we study the resolved microstructures in a shocked region in the Criss-cross Nebula (CCN), with an unprecedentedly high resolution of ≲1000 au. We measure surface brightness maps for 34 emission lines, which can be broadly divided into three categories: (1) the [O iii] λ5007-like group including seven high-ionization lines and two [O ii] auroral lines that uniformly present a remarkable lane structure, (2) the Hα λ6563-like group, including 23 low-ionization or recombination lines that present a clump-like structure, and (3) [O ii] λ3726 and [O ii] λ3729 showing high densities at both the [O iii] λ5007 lane and the Hα clump. We use these measurements to constrain resolved shock models implemented in MAPPINGS V. We find our data can be reasonably well fitted by a model that includes a plane-parallel shock with a velocity of 133 ± 5 km s −1, plus an isotropic two-dimensional Gaussian component, which is likely another clump of gas ionized by photons from the shocked region, and a constant background. We compare the electron density and temperature profiles as predicted by our model with those calculated using observed emission-line ratios. We find different line ratios to provide inconsistent temperature maps, and the discrepancies can be attributed to observational effects caused by limited spatial resolution and projection of the shock geometry, as well as contamination of the additional Gaussian component. Implications on shock properties and perspectives on future IFS-based studies of the CCN are discussed.

We present gas-phase elemental abundance ratios of thirteen local extremely metal-poor galaxies (EMPGs), including our new Keck/LRIS spectroscopy determinations together with 33 James Webb Space Telescope z ∼ 4–10 star-forming galaxies in the literature, and compare chemical evolution models. We develop chemical evolution models with the yields of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), Type Ia SNe, hypernovae (HNe), and pair-instability supernovae (PISNe), and compare the EMPGs and high-z galaxies in conjunction with dust depletion contributions. We find that high Fe/O values of EMPGs can (cannot) be explained by PISN metal enrichments (CCSN/HN enrichments even with the mixing-and-fallback mechanism enhancing iron abundance), while the observed Ar/O and S/O values are much smaller than the predictions of the PISN models. The abundance ratios of EMPGs can be explained by the combination of Type Ia SNe and CCSNe/HNe whose inner layers of argon and sulfur mostly fallback, which are comparable to the Sculptor stellar chemical abundance distribution, suggesting that early chemical enrichment has taken place in the EMPGs. Comparing our chemical evolution models with the star-forming galaxies at z ∼ 4–10, we find that the Ar/O and S/O ratios of the high-z galaxies are comparable to those of the CCSN/HN models, while the majority of high-z galaxies do not have constraints good enough to rule out contributions from PISNe. The high N/O ratio recently reported in GN-z11 cannot be explained even by rotating PISNe, but could be reproduced by the winds of rotating Wolf–Rayet stars that end up as a direct collapse.

The first Population III (Pop III) stars formed out of primordial, metal-free gas, in minihalos at z > 20, and kickstarted the cosmic processes of reionization and enrichment. While these stars are likely more massive than their enriched counterparts, the current unknowns of their astrophysics include when the first Pop III stars ignited, how massive they were, and when and how the era of the first stars ended. Investigating these questions requires an exploration of a multidimensional parameter space, including the slope of the Pop III stellar initial mass function (IMF) and the strength of the nonionizing UV background. In this work, we present a novel model which treats both the slope and maximum mass of Pop III stars as truly free parameters while including the physics of the fragmentation of primordial gas. Our results also hint at a nonuniversal Pop III IMF which is dependent on the efficiency of primordial gas fragmentation. Our relatively simple model reproduces the results from hydrodynamic simulations, but with a computational efficiency which allows us to investigate the observable differences between a wide range of potential Pop III IMFs. In addition, the evolution of the number density of Pop III stars may provide insight into the evolution of the H2 dissociating background. While the slope of the Pop III IMF does not significantly affect the predicted number density of the first stars, more top-heavy IMFs produce Pop III star clusters which are 2–3 magnitudes brighter than their more bottom-heavy counterparts. While the Pop III star clusters are too dim for direct detection by JWST, we find they are within the reach of gravitational lensing.

We report the discovery of nine new hot molecular cores in the Deep South (DS) region of Sagittarius B2 using Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Band 6 observations. We measure the rotational temperature of CH3OH and derive the physical conditions present within these cores and the hot core Sgr B2(S). The cores show heterogeneous temperature structure, with peak temperatures between 252 and 662 K. We find that the cores span a range of masses (203–4842 M⊙) and radii (3587–9436 au). CH3OH abundances consistently increase with temperature across the sample. Our measurements show the DS hot cores are structurally similar to Galactic disk hot cores, with radii and temperature gradients that are comparable to sources in the disk. They also show shallower density gradients than disk hot cores, which may arise from the Central Molecular Zone’s higher density threshold for star formation. The hot cores have properties which are consistent with those of Sgr B2(N), with three associated with Class II CH3OH masers and one associated with an ultra-compact H iiregion. Our sample nearly doubles the high-mass star-forming gas mass near Sgr B2(S) and suggests the region may be a younger, comparably massive counterpart to Sgr B2(N) and (M). The relationship between peak CH3OH abundance and rotational temperature traced by our sample and a selection of comparable hot cores is qualitatively consistent with predictions from chemical modeling. However, we observe constant peak abundances at higher temperatures (T ≳ 250 K), which may indicate mechanisms for methanol survival that are not yet accounted for in models.

However, light-curve systematics related to the satellite’s 13.7 day orbit have prevented stellar rotation searches for periods longer than 13 days, putting the majority of stars beyond reach. Machine-learning methods have the ability to identify systematics and recover robust signals, enabling us to recover rotation periods up to 35 days for GK dwarfs and 80 days for M dwarfs. We present a catalog of 7245 rotation periods for cool dwarfs in the Southern Continuous Viewing Zone, estimated using convolutional neural networks. We find evidence for structure in the period distribution consistent with prior Kepler and K2 results, including a gap in 10–20 day cool-star periods thought to arise from a change in stellar spin-down or activity. Using a combination of spectroscopic and gyrochronologic constraints, we fit stellar evolution models to estimate masses and ages for stars with rotation periods. We find strong correlations between the detectability of rotation in TESS and the effective temperature, age, and metallicity of the stars. Finally, we investigate the relationships between rotation and newly obtained spot filling fractions estimated from Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment spectra. Field starspot filling fractions are elevated in the same temperature and period regime where open clusters’ magnetic braking stalls, lending support to an internal shear mechanism that can produce both phenomena.

<div> 关键词: 射电星系，FR-I，相对论流体动力学模拟，宇宙射线，能谱分布

总结:
本研究通过相对论流体动力学模拟重新现实了FR-I射流的流动动力学。研究发现，射流动力学的关键因素是射流脊柱流的平均洛伦兹因子〈Γ〉spine。此外，本研究还通过蒙特卡洛模拟跟踪了宇宙射线在模拟射流中的输运和能量化过程。宇宙射线主要通过扩散性激波加速（E ≲ 1 EeV）和剪切加速（E ≳ 1 EeV）获取能量，其能谱呈现双重幂律，在临界能量Ebreak处有指数截断。Ebreak受Hillas约束条件或通过快速空间扩散逃逸受到限制。本研究的模型能谱可用于研究射电星系对观测到的超高能宇宙射线的贡献。 <div>
Nearby radio galaxies (RGs) of Fanaroff–Riley Class I (FR-I) are considered possible sites for the production of observed ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). Among those, some exhibit blazar-like inner jets, while others display plume-like structures. We reproduce the flow dynamics of FR-I jets using relativistic hydrodynamic simulations. Subsequently, we track the transport and energization of cosmic ray (CR) particles within the simulated jet flows using Monte Carlo simulations. The key determinant of flow dynamics is the mean Lorentz factor of the jet-spine flow, 〈Γ〉spine. When 〈Γ〉spine ≳ 6, the jet spine remains almost unimpeded, but for 〈Γ〉spine ≲ 3, substantial jet deceleration occurs. CRs gain energy mainly through diffusive shock acceleration for E ≲ 1 EeV and shear acceleration for E ≳ 1 EeV. The time-asymptotic energy spectrum of CRs escaping from the jet can be modeled by a double power law, transitioning from ∼E−0.6 to ∼E−2.6 around a break energy, Ebreak, with an exponential cutoff at . Ebreak is limited either by the Hillas confinement condition or by particle escape from the cocoon via fast spatial diffusion. The spectral slopes primarily arise from multiple episodes of shock and relativistic shear acceleration, and the confinement–escape processes within the cocoon. The exponential cutoff is determined by nongradual shear acceleration that boosts the energy of high-energy CRs by a factor of . We suggest that the model spectrum derived in this work could be employed to investigate the contribution of RGs to the observed population of UHECRs.

<br />
这项研究探讨了太阳UV辐射的各向异性对日晕的影响。研究发现，UV辐射各向异性会导致日晕的极向/黄道比率发生变化，尤其在太阳极小期间的变化更为显著。此外，UV辐射各向异性还会增加来自下风方向的日晕强度。通过对SWAN卫星的观测数据进行对比分析，研究者得出了从1996年到2022年两个太阳活动周期期间太阳UV辐射各向异性的日变化情况。研究结果表明，在太阳极小期，太阳风的结构化程度较高，而UV辐射各向异性相对较小；而在太阳极大期，太阳风的各向同性增加，但UV辐射各向异性显著增强。 <div>
We present a study of the influence of solar UV anisotropy on the heliospheric backscatter helioglow generated by resonant scattering of solar Lyα photons on interstellar hydrogen atoms around the Sun. Simulations based on the WawHelioGlow model suggest that the response of the helioglow pole-to-ecliptic ratio to the anisotropy is linear, but 15% of the anisotropy (polar darkening) generates 30%–40% change in the ratio in the solar minimum and 15%–20% in the solar maximum. We attribute this difference to an interplay between the solar UV anisotropy and the latitudinal structure of the solar wind in solar minima. The solar UV anisotropy also increases the helioglow intensity from the downwind direction by 5%–10%, due to the influence of the anisotropy on the ionization losses and trajectories of atoms passing by the Sun in polar regions. Consequently, midlatitude regions (in the heliographic and ecliptic coordinates) are least affected by the UV anisotropy. By comparison of the simulation results with observations of the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory/SWAN satellite instrument, we derive the day-by-day time evolution of the solar Lyα anisotropy for the north and south poles over two solar cycles from 1996 to 2022. The inferred anisotropy is ∼5%–10% in solar minima and ∼15%–25% in solar maxima, the northern anisotropy being stronger than the southern one. Our study suggests that in solar minima a highly structured solar wind is associated with relatively small solar UV anisotropy, while in solar maxima the solar wind is more isotropic but a substantial solar UV anisotropy appears.

总结:
本文研究了潮汐激发的振荡现象，针对之前的作品中的HBSs进行了重新分析，并提出了检验其傅立叶谱中的谐波和非谐波振荡的分析流程。从21个HBSs中发现了12个具有显著的TEOs，并且发现轨道离心率与TEOs的谐波数之间存在正相关关系，而轨道周期与谐波数之间也存在正相关关系。此外，在赫罗图中发现了热星（表面有效温度T ≳ 6500 K）中TEOs更为显著的分布特征。这些结果为未来研究椭圆轨道中潮汐作用的HBSs提供了宝贵的目标。 <div>
Heartbeat stars (HBSs) with tidally excited oscillations (TEOs) are ideal laboratories for studying the effect of equilibrium and dynamical tides. However, studies of TEOs in Kepler HBSs are rare due to the need for better modeling of the equilibrium tide in light curves. We revisit the HBSs in our previous work and study the TEOs in these HBSs based on the derived orbital parameters that could express the equilibrium tide. We also compile a set of analytic procedures to examine the harmonic and anharmonic TEOs in their Fourier spectra. The TEOs of 21 HBSs have been newly analyzed and presented. Twelve of these HBSs show prominent TEOs (signal-to-noise ratio of the harmonics S/N ≥ 10). The relation between the orbital eccentricities and the harmonic number of the TEOs shows a positive correlation. The relation between the orbital periods and the harmonic number also shows a positive correlation. Furthermore, the distribution of HBSs with TEOs in the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram shows that TEOs are more visible in hot stars with surface effective temperatures T ≳ 6500 K. These samples may also be valuable targets for future studies of the effect of tidal action in eccentric orbits.

<br /><br />总结:
最近的研究表明，各向异性对于解析宇宙射线的起源和传播具有重要价值。研究者建立了统一的场景来描述能谱和大尺度各向异性的观测，并注意到它们与能量的同步演变。本研究调查了局部正则磁场（LRMF）及其对各向异性扩散的影响。当垂直扩散系数远小于平行扩散系数时，偶极各向异性指向LRMF，并且可以复制100 TeV以下的观测相。此外，我们发现100 TeV以上的偶极相强烈依赖于局部扩散的演化。但目前该能量的测量仍然很少。我们建议可以进行更精确的100 TeV能量的测量，以揭示局部扩散和局部湍流。 <div>
Recent studies have shown that the anisotropy is of great value to decipher cosmic rays’ origin and propagation. We have built a unified scenario to describe the observations of the energy spectra and the large-scale anisotropy and called attention to their synchronous evolution with energy. In this work, the impact of the local regular magnetic field (LRMF) and corresponding anisotropic diffusion on large-scale anisotropy have been investigated. When the perpendicular diffusion coefficient is much smaller than the parallel one, the dipole anisotropy points to the LRMF and the observational phase below 100 TeV could be reproduced. Moreover, we find that the dipole phase above 100 TeV strongly depends on the evolution of local diffusion. But the current measurements at that energy are still scarce. We suggest that more precise measurements at that energy could be carried out to unveil the local diffusion and further the local turbulence.

总结:
通过数值模拟实验，成功模拟了磁流束的平衡位置随着背景磁场变化的准静态演化，以及由此引发的喷发过程。在喷发过程中，我们发现了从磁流束径向外传播的磁弹性波，并且追踪了它们的起源，揭示了它们是由磁流束内部扰动引起的。作为一个不完美的波导，磁流束允许内部扰动通过其表面逐渐泄漏到外部，引发了观测到的磁弹性波。此外，我们基于模拟数据合成了磁弹性波的图像，并发现与观测一致。这表明扰动从磁流束泄漏到外部可能是产生磁弹性波的合理机制。 <div>
We propose a mechanism for the excitation of large-scale quasiperiodic fast-propagating magnetoacoustic (QFP) waves observed on both sides of the coronal mass ejection. Through a series of numerical experiments, we successfully simulated the quasi-static evolution of the equilibrium locations of the magnetic flux rope in response to the change of the background magnetic field, as well as the consequent loss of the equilibrium that eventually gives rise to the eruption. During the eruption, we identified QFP waves propagating radially outward of the flux rope, and tracing their origin reveals that they result from the disturbance within the flux rope. Acting as an imperfect waveguide, the flux rope allows the internal disturbance to escape to the outside successively via its surface, invoking the observed QFP waves. Furthermore, we synthesized the images of QFP waves on the basis of the data given by our simulations and found consistency with observations. This indicates that the leakage of the disturbance outside the flux rope could be a reasonable mechanism for QFP waves.

We present a robust methodology for identifying photometric binaries in star clusters. Using Gaia DR3, Pan-STARRS, and Two Micron All Sky Survey data, we self-consistently define the cluster parameters and binary demographics for the open clusters (OCs) NGC 2168 (M35), NGC 7789, NGC 6819, NGC 2682 (M67), NGC 188, and NGC 6791. These clusters span in age from ∼200 Myr (NGC 2168) to more than ∼8 Gyr (NGC 6791) and have all been extensively studied in the literature. We use the Bayesian Analysis of Stellar Evolution software suite to derive the age, distance, reddening, metallicity, binary fraction, and binary mass-ratio posterior distributions for each cluster. We perform a careful analysis of our completeness and also compare our results to previous spectroscopic surveys. For our sample of main-sequence stars with masses between 0.6 and 1 M⊙, we find that these OCs have similar binary fractions that are also broadly consistent with the field multiplicity fraction. Within the clusters, the binary fraction increases dramatically toward the cluster centers, likely a result of mass segregation. Furthermore nearly all clusters show evidence of mass segregation within the single and binary populations. The OC binary fraction increases significantly with cluster age in our sample, possibly due to a combination of mass-segregation and cluster-dissolution processes. We also find a hint of an anticorrelation between binary fraction and cluster central density as well as total cluster mass, possibly due to an increasing frequency of higher-energy close stellar encounters that inhibit long-period binary survival and/or formation.

We demonstrate how to constrain the degree of absolute alignment of the total angular momenta of LIGO–Virgo binary black holes, looking for a special direction in space that would break isotropy. We also allow for inhomogeneities in the distribution of black holes over the sky. Making use of dipolar models for the spatial distribution and orientation of the sources, we analyze 57 signals with false-alarm rates ≤1 yr−1 from the third LIGO–Virgo observing run. Accounting for selection biases, we find the population of LIGO–Virgo black holes to be consistent with both homogeneity and isotropy. We additionally find the data to constrain some directions of alignment more than others, discuss the interpretation of this measurement, and produce posteriors for the directions of total angular momentum of all binaries in our set. While our current constraints are weak, the fact that such a small number of detections can already yield a measurement suggests that this will be a powerful tool in the future; we explore this prospect with a number of simulated catalogs of varying size. All code and data are made publicly available at https://github.com/maxisi/gwisotropy/.

We present the first detailed analysis of the ultra-steep spectrum radio halo in the merging galaxy cluster A521, based on upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio telescope observations. The combination of radio observations (300–850 MHz) and archival X-ray data provides a new window into the complex physics occurring in this system. When compared to all previous analyses, our sensitive radio images detected the centrally located radio halo emission to a greater extent of ∼1.3 Mpc. A faint extension of the southeastern radio relic has been discovered. We detected another relic, recently discovered by MeerKAT, and coincident with a possible shock front in the X-rays, at the northwest position of the center. We find that the integrated spectrum of the radio halo is well-fitted with a spectral index of −1.86 ± 0.12. A spatially resolved spectral index map revealed the spectral index fluctuations, as well as an outward radial steepening of the average spectral index. The radio and X-ray surface brightness is well correlated for the entire and different subparts of the halo, with sublinear correlation slopes (0.50–0.65). We also found a mild anticorrelation between the spectral index and X-ray surface brightness. Newly detected extensions of the SE relic and the counter relic are consistent with the merger in the plane of the sky.

In kilonovae, freshly synthesized r-process elements imprint features on optical spectra, as observed in AT2017gfo, the counterpart to the GW170817 binary neutron star merger. However, measuring the r-process compositions of the merger ejecta is computationally challenging. Vieira et al. introduced Spectroscopic r-process Abundance Retrieval for Kilonovae (SPARK), a software tool to infer elemental abundance patterns of the ejecta and associate spectral features with particular species. Previously, we applied SPARK to the 1.4-day spectrum of AT2017gfo and inferred its abundance pattern for the first time, characterized by electron fraction Ye = 0.31, a substantial abundance of strontium, and a dearth of lanthanides and heavier elements. This ejecta is consistent with wind from a remnant hypermassive neutron star and/or accretion disk. We now extend our inference to spectra at 2.4 and 3.4 days and test the need for multicomponent ejecta, where we stratify the ejecta in composition. The ejecta at 1.4 and 2.4 days is described by the same single blue component. At 3.4 days, a new redder component with lower Ye = 0.16 and a significant abundance of lanthanides emerges. This new redder component is consistent with dynamical ejecta and/or neutron-rich ejecta from a magnetized accretion disk. As expected from photometric modeling, this component emerges as the ejecta expands, the photosphere recedes, and the earlier bluer component dims. At 3.4 days, we find an ensemble of lanthanides, with the presence of cerium most concrete. This presence of lanthanides has important implications for the contribution of kilonovae to the r-process abundances observed in the Universe.

The gas-phase reactions of methanimine (CH2NH) with small radicals, such as CN, CP, CCH, and OH, have been extensively studied theoretically in the literature, and the presence of a common, general reaction mechanism has been postulated. Since methanimine is considered the main precursor of complex imines in the interstellar medium (ISM), the present study extends the investigation of its reaction with other small radicals that have already been detected in the ISM. These are SiN, SH, NO, NS, HCO, HCS, and C3N. The corresponding products are easily formulated on the basis of the aforementioned general mechanism, and to understand whether they can be formed in the ISM, a preliminary thermochemical study has been carried out. The only exothermic addition reaction is that occurring between CH2NH and the C3N radical. This reaction has been further investigated in order to accurately characterize its reactive potential energy surface, which has then been employed in ab initio transition state theory calculations to derive global rate coefficients. The products of the CH2NH + C3N reaction are new potential interstellar species, namely, the Z and E isomers of HNCHCCCN and CH2NCCCN. For the first time, their structural characterization has been reported. In addition, this work investigates the possibility of H-abstraction processes for each radical species considered, and re-examines the CH2NH + CP reaction to derive the corresponding rate constants, that were still missing in the literature.

Magnetic fields of molecular clouds in the central molecular zone (CMZ) have been relatively under-observed at sub-parsec resolution. Here, we report JCMT/POL2 observations of polarized dust emission in the CMZ, which reveal magnetic field structures in dense gas at ∼0.5 pc resolution. The 11 molecular clouds in our sample include two in the western part of the CMZ (Sgr C and a farside cloud candidate), four around the Galactic longitude 0 (the 50 km s−1 cloud, CO 0.02−0.02, the Stone, and the Sticks andStraw among the Three Little Pigs), and five along the Dust Ridge (G0.253+0.016, clouds b, c, d, and e/f), for each of which we estimate the magnetic field strength using the angular dispersion function method. The morphologies of magnetic fields in the clouds suggest potential imprints of feedback from expanding H ii regions and young massive star clusters. A moderate correlation between the total viral parameter versus the star formation rate (SFR) and the dense gas fraction of the clouds is found. A weak correlation between the mass-to-flux ratio and the SFR, and a weak anticorrelation between the magnetic field and the dense gas fraction are also found. Comparisons between magnetic fields and other dynamic components in clouds suggest a more dominant role of self-gravity and turbulence in determining the dynamical states of the clouds and affecting star formation at the studied scales.

<div> 长期变异，短期变异，中红外数据，年轻恒星物体，驱动机制
<br />总结:
这篇文章分析了年轻恒星物体（YSOs）的亮度变异现象，探讨了长期和短期的变异情况，使用NEOWISE和YSOVAR两个中红外数据集进行观测。结果发现，短期变异检测率较高，而长期变异振幅通常是短期变异的3倍。此外，对1-2天的极短时间尺度也进行了变异评估。通过综合分析不同时间尺度上YSOs的变异情况，有助于更深入地理解其变异的潜在机制。 <div>
Variability in the brightness of young stellar objects (YSOs) is a common phenomenon that can be caused by changes in various factors, including accretion, extinction, disk morphology, interactions between the disk and the stellar photosphere, and the rotation of hot or cold magnetic spots on the stellar photosphere. Analyzing the variability on different timescales provides insight into the mechanisms driving the changes in the brightness of YSOs. We investigate the variability of YSOs on both long and short timescales using two mid-IR data sets: the Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (NEOWISE) 7.5 yr W2 (4.6 μm) data and the YSOVAR 40 day Spitzer/IRAC2 (4.5 μm) data, respectively. We classify the variability types in each timescale following Park et al. We find a higher detection rate of variable sources in the short term (77.6%) compared to the long term (43.0%) due to the higher sensitivity of the Spitzer observations. In addition, the higher cadence of the YSOVAR data results in the weeks-long short-term variability being mostly secular, while the years-long long-term variability explored with the coarsely sampled NEOWISE data is mostly stochastic. By crossmatching the two catalogs, we statistically analyze the variability types exhibited by YSOs across both timescales. The long-term variability amplitude is mostly three times (up to 10 times) greater than the short-term variability. Furthermore, we evaluate variability on very short (1–2 days) timescales and recover a trend of the increasing amplitude of variability as the timescales increase. By comprehensively analyzing the variability of YSOs over various timescales, we contribute to a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving their variability.

<title>Scale and Time Dependence of Alfvénicity in the Solar Wind as Observed by the Parker Solar Probe</title>

<div> 关键词: Alfvénicity, Parker Solar Probe, 太阳风, 磁场, 速度波动
总结:
Alfvénicity是太阳风中常见的一种特性，通过Parker Solar Probe的数据可以更接近太阳研究这一特性。通过时间滞后的磁场和速度增量的二阶函数来研究Alfvénicity。发现Alfvénicity与时间滞后具有尺度相关的特性，并且随着距离太阳更近而增加。大部分时间太阳风具有高Alfvénicity，但在接近赤道面或其他磁场结构变化明显的地方观察到较低的Alfvénicity。这些结果表明，太阳表面附近产生的Alfvénic波动向外传播，在年轻的太阳风中形成高度Alfvénic的状态，而与大尺度结构和梯度的相互作用导致较弱的Alfvénicity，这是常见于更大的太阳离心距离上的现象。 <div>
Alfvénicity is a well-known property, common in the solar wind, characterized by a high correlation between magnetic and velocity fluctuations. Data from the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) enable the study of this property closer to the Sun than ever before, as well as in the sub-Alfvénic solar wind. We consider scale-dependent measures of Alfvénicity based on second-order functions of the magnetic and velocity increments as a function of time lag, including the normalized cross helicity σc and residual energy σr. Scale-dependent Alfvénicity is strongest for lags near the correlation scale and increases when moving closer to the Sun. We find that σr typically remains close to the maximally negative value compatible with σc. We did not observe significant changes in measures of Alfvénicity between sub-Alfvénic and super-Alfvénic wind. During most times, the solar wind was highly Alfvénic; however, lower Alfvénicity was observed when PSP approached the heliospheric current sheet or other magnetic structures with sudden changes in the radial magnetic field, non-unidirectional strahl electron pitch angle distributions, and strong electron density contrasts. These results are consistent with a picture in which Alfvénic fluctuations generated near the photosphere transport outward, forming highly Alfvénic states in the young solar wind, and subsequent interactions with large-scale structures and gradients lead to weaker Alfvénicity, as commonly observed at larger heliocentric distances.

总结: 
ODIN是一个使用DECam进行观测的天文调查项目，旨在通过窄带滤光片获取深度图像，以探测特定红移的Lyα辐射星系。主要科学目标包括测量LAE、LABs和原星团的聚集强度和暗物质晕的关联，以及它们与宇宙网中的丝状结构的关系。此外，ODIN还将进行其他的辅助科学研究，包括对较低红移的发射线星系样本的类似研究和对附近的星形成星系进行调查。此外，ODIN还将在宇宙中午期间探测红移演化。通过这些研究，我们将能够更好地了解宇宙中午时期的星系形成和演化过程。 <br /><br /> <div>
We describe the survey design and science goals for One-hundred-deg2 DECam Imaging in Narrowbands (ODIN), a NOIRLab survey using the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) to obtain deep (AB ∼ 25.7) narrowband images over an unprecedented area of sky. The three custom-built narrowband filters, N419, N501, and N673, have central wavelengths of 419, 501, and 673 nm and respective FWHM of 7.5, 7.6, and 10.0 nm, corresponding to Lyα at z = 2.4, 3.1, and 4.5 and cosmic times of 2.8, 2.1, and 1.4 Gyr, respectively. When combined with even deeper, public broadband data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam, DECam, and in the future, the Legacy Survey of Space and Time, the ODIN narrowband images will enable the selection of over 100,000 Lyα-emitting (LAE) galaxies at these epochs. ODIN-selected LAEs will identify protoclusters as galaxy overdensities, and the deep narrowband images enable detection of highly extended Lyα blobs (LABs). Primary science goals include measuring the clustering strength and dark matter halo connection of LAEs, LABs, and protoclusters, and their respective relationship to filaments in the cosmic web. The three epochs allow for the redshift evolution of these properties to be determined during the period known as Cosmic Noon, where star formation was at its peak. The narrowband filter wavelengths are designed to enable interloper rejection and further scientific studies by revealing [O ii] and [O iii] at z = 0.34, Lyα and He ii 1640 at z = 3.1, and Lyman continuum plus Lyα at z = 4.5. Ancillary science includes similar studies of the lower-redshift emission-line galaxy samples and investigations of nearby star-forming galaxies resolved into numerous [O iii] and [S ii] emitting regions.

<div> 快速射电暴（FRB）、观测结果、等待时间分布、磁层传播效应、吸收概率

总结：<br /><br />这篇文章介绍了快速射电暴领域进入精细表征时代，观测结果丰富。发现重复性FRB的等待时间分布呈现出左峰低于右峰的双峰特征，认为这种不对称形状是由磁层中的传播效应引起的。文章详细解释了快速射电暴穿过磁化等离子体时诱发的效应，包括电荷粒子的圆周运动形成电流环，进而引起与背景磁场相反方向的感应磁场，从而影响后续快速射电暴的散射吸收概率，以及对爆发光度的影响。 <div>
The field of fast radio bursts (FRBs) has entered the age of fine characterization as observational results from different radio telescopes become more and more abundant. The large FRB sample is suitable for a statistical study. There is an interesting finding that the waiting-time distributions of very active repeating FRBs show a universal double-peaked feature, with left peaks lower than right ones. Assuming these two peaks are independent and initially comparable, we show that the observed asymmetric shape can be ascribed to the propagational effect in the magnetosphere. An FRB passing through the magnetized plasma will induce the circular motion of charged particles to form a current loop. This further leads to an induced magnetic field in the opposite direction with respect to the background field. As the effective field strength changes, the scattering absorption probability of the following FRB will be influenced. The absorption can be important under certain physical conditions and bursts with smaller time lags are easier to be absorbed. Also, there will be an imprint on the flux distribution as the scattering optical depth depends on burst luminosity as well.

X-ray binary systems consist of a companion star and a compact object in close orbit. Thanks to their copious X-ray emission, these objects have been studied in detail using X-ray spectroscopy and timing. The inclination of these systems is a major uncertainty in the determination of the mass of the compact object using optical spectroscopic methods. In this paper, we present a new method to constrain the inclination of X-ray binaries, which is based on the modeling of the polarization of X-rays photons produced by a compact source and scattered off the companion star. We describe our method and explore the potential of this technique in the specific case of the low-mass X-ray binary GS 1826−238 observed by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer observatory.

Both observational evidence and theoretical considerations from magnetohydrodynamic simulations of jets suggest that the relativistic jets of active galactic nuclei (AGN) are radially stratified, with a fast inner spine surrounded by a slower-moving outer sheath. The resulting relativistic shear layers are a prime candidate for the site of relativistic particle acceleration in the jets of AGNs and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). In this article, we present outcomes of particle-in-cell simulations of magnetic-field generation and particle acceleration in the relativistic shear boundary layers (SBLs) of jets in AGNs and GRBs. We investigate the effects of inverse Compton cooling on relativistic particles that are accelerated in the SBLs of relativistic jets, including the self-consistent calculation of the radiation spectrum produced by inverse Compton scattering of relativistic electrons in an isotropic external soft photon field. We find that the Compton cooling can be substantial, depending on the characteristic energy (blackbody temperature and energy density) of the external radiation field. The produced Compton emission is highly anisotropic and more strongly beamed along the jet direction than the characteristic 1/Γ pattern expected from intrinsically isotropic emission in the comoving frame of an emission region moving along the jet with a bulk Lorentz factor Γ. We suggest that this may resolve the long-standing problem of the Doppler factor crisis.

总结:<br />
JWST发布了第一张科学图像，显示了遥远背景中SMACS J0723.3-7327星系团的许多星系。一些人声称红移高达z ≃ 20，挑战了标准的宇宙结构形成模型。研究人员基于5个经光谱确认的系统以及12个预测成像对应物的系统，建立了SMACS J0723.3-7327的透镜模型。他们利用这一模型成功地复现了所有这些成像对应物的位置、形态和相对亮度，并且根据几何测量得出了12个候选多次成像星系的红移范围。研究人员还根据这一透镜模型创建了透镜发现者地图，用于预测具有特定红移的星系被预测为多次成像。通过将这一地图应用到声称在10 ≲ z ≲ 20的三个星系上，研究人员发现没有在预计位置上发现被放大到足以被检测到的成像对应物，这表明这些星系可能位于z ≲ 1.7–3.2。因此，迫切需要为星系团的领域创建可靠的透镜发现者地图，以测试和约束从JWST发现的候选高红移星系的光度推断的红移。 <div>
The first science image released by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) reveals numerous galaxies in the distant background of the galaxy cluster SMACS J0723.3-7327. Some have claimed redshifts of up to z ≃ 20, challenging standard cosmological models for structure formation. Here, we present a lens model for SMACS J0723.3-7327 anchored on five spectroscopically confirmed systems at 1.38 ≤ z ≤ 2.21 that are multiply lensed, along with 12 other systems with proposed image counterparts sharing common colors, spectral energy distributions, and morphological features, but having unknown redshifts. Constrained only by their image positions, and where available, redshifts, our lens model correctly reproduces the positions and correctly predicts the morphologies and relative brightnesses of all these image counterparts, as well as providing geometrically determined redshifts spanning 1.4 ≲ z ≲ 6.7 for the 12 candidate multiply lensed galaxies lacking spectroscopic measurements. From this lens model, we create a lens finder map that defines regions over which galaxies beyond a certain redshift are predicted to be multiply lensed. Applying this map to three galaxies claimed to be at 10 ≲ z ≲ 20, we find no image counterparts at locations (with an uncertainty of ∼0.″5) where they ought to be sufficiently magnified to be detectable—suggesting instead that these galaxies lie at z ≲ 1.7–3.2. In lieu of spectroscopy, the creation of reliable lens finder maps for cluster fields is urgently needed to test and constrain redshifts inferred from photometry for a rapidly increasing number of candidate high-z galaxies found with JWST.

总结:AGORA合作中使用了八种常用的宇宙学代码来分析环銀河介质（CGM）。这些代码具有相同的初始条件，宇宙学参数，加热和冷却，以及恒星形成阈值的校准，但每种代码都有自己独特的架构和恒星反馈实现。研究分析了这些模拟的CGM结构、组成和相位动态。结果表明，金属分布、电离级别和动力学等性质是不同代码反馈和实施方法影响可观测量的有效追踪者，因此在模拟之间可能存在大的差异。虽然这只是一组模型，但可以帮助分解影响CGM可观测量的不同变量，例如显示具有更高电离能量的离子的丰度更受模拟金属丰度的影响，而具有较低电离能量的离子的丰度更受气体密度和温度的影响。 <br /><br />总结: AGORA合作使用八种宇宙学代码对环銀河介质进行了分析，发现不同代码反馈和实施方法会对可观测量产生影响，并且模拟之间可能存在巨大差异。 <div>
We analyze the circumgalactic medium (CGM) for eight commonly-used cosmological codes in the AGORA collaboration. The codes are calibrated to use identical initial conditions, cosmology, heating and cooling, and star formation thresholds, but each evolves with its own unique code architecture and stellar feedback implementation. Here, we analyze the results of these simulations in terms of the structure, composition, and phase dynamics of the CGM. We show properties such as metal distribution, ionization levels, and kinematics are effective tracers of the effects of the different code feedback and implementation methods, and as such they can be highly divergent between simulations. This is merely a fiducial set of models, against which we will in the future compare multiple feedback recipes for each code. Nevertheless, we find that the large parameter space these simulations establish can help disentangle the different variables that affect observable quantities in the CGM, e.g., showing that abundances for ions with higher ionization energy are more strongly determined by the simulation’s metallicity, while abundances for ions with lower ionization energy are more strongly determined by the gas density and temperature.

利用ALMA波段6的观测发现了与HH 30相关的原恒星系统的分子线发射情况。其中13CO分子线显示出了吸积盘，而12CO分子线的发射则追溯到分子流。我们估计了中心物体的动力质量为0.45 ± 0.14 M⊙，分子流的质量为(1.83 ± 0.19) × 10−4M⊙。分子流具有内部腔体以及多个外流壳结构。我们辨别出了三个不同的具有恒定膨胀速度 (∼4–6 km s−1) 和可能有旋转签名（≤0.5 km s−1）的壳层。我们发现这些壳层可以通过磁离心盘风来解释，具有发射半径 Rlaunch ≲ 4 au 和较小的磁力臂 λ ∼ 1.6–1.9。多壳结构可能是由于来自与三个不同时期相关的吸积盘的物质的周期性喷射而产生的，这三个时期的动力学年龄分别为 497 ± 15 yr，310 ± 9 yr 和 262 ± 11 yr。最外层的壳层是在中间壳层之前 187 ± 17 yr 喷射的，而中间壳层是在最内层壳层之前 48 ± 14 yr 喷射的。我们对流和吸积流量的线性和角动量率的估算与预期值一致，表明HH 30的流是由宽角盘风产生的。<br /><br />总结: 本研究利用ALMA波段6对HH30的原恒星系统进行了观测，发现13CO分子线显示出吸积盘，而12CO分子线显示出分子流。对中心物体的质量和分子流的质量进行了估算，发现分子流具有内部腔体以及多个外流壳结构。分别辨识出了三个壳层，并解释这些壳层可能是由于周期性的来自吸积盘的物质喷射而产生。最后，对流和吸积流量的线性和角动量率的估算与预期值一致，表明HH 30的流是由宽角盘风产生的。 <div>
We present archival Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array band 6 observations of the 13CO (J = 2–1) and 12CO (J = 2–1) molecular line emission of the protostellar system associated with HH 30. The 13CO molecular line shows the accretion disk while the molecular outflow is traced by the emission of the 12CO molecular line. We estimated a dynamical mass for the central object of 0.45 ± 0.14 M⊙, and a mass for the molecular outflow of (1.83 ± 0.19) × 10−4M⊙. The molecular outflow presents an internal cavity as well as multiple outflowing shell structures. We distinguish three different shells with constant expansion (∼4–6 km s−1) and possible rotation signatures (≤0.5 km s−1). We find that the shells can be explained by magnetocentrifugal disk winds with launching radii Rlaunch ≲ 4 au and a small magnetic lever arm λ ∼ 1.6–1.9. The multiple shell structure may be the result of episodic ejections of the material from the accretion disk associated with three different epochs with dynamical ages of 497 ± 15 yr, 310 ± 9 yr, and 262 ± 11 yr for the first, second, and third shells, respectively. The outermost shell was ejected 187 ± 17 yr before the middle shell, while the middle shell was launched 48 ± 14 yr before the innermost shell. Our estimations of the linear and angular momentum rates of the outflow as well as the accretion luminosity are consistent with the values expected if the outflow of HH 30 is produced by a wide-angle disk wind.

Stellar counterrotation in disk galaxies directly relates to the complex phenomenon of the disk mass assembly believed to be driven by external processes, such as accretion and mergers. The study of such systems makes it possible to reveal the source of external accretion and establish the details of this process. In this paper, we investigate the galaxy PGC 66551 (MaNGA ID 1-179561), which hosts two large-scale counterrotating (CR) stellar disks identified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey MaNGA data and then confirmed using deep follow-up spectroscopy with the 10 m Southern African Large Telescope. We measured the properties of ionized gas and stellar populations of both CR disks in PGC 66551. We found that the CR disk is compact, contains young stars with subsolar metallicity, and has a stellar mass of 5 × 109M⊙, which amounts to ≈20% of the galaxy’s total. Surprisingly, the main 8 Gyr old disk has a significantly lower metallicity of −0.8 dex than other CR galaxies. We developed a simple analytic model of the history of the metal enrichment, which we applied to PGC 66551 and constrained the parameters of the galactic outflow wind, and estimated the metallicity of the infalling gas that formed the CR disk to be −0.9... −0.5 dex. Our interpretation prefers a merger with a gas-rich satellite over cold accretion from a cosmic filament as a source of gas, which then formed the CR disk in PGC 66551.

<div> NIR-dark, dusty star-forming galaxies, RS-NIRdark galaxies, photometric catalog, cosmic SFRD
<br /><br />总结:
本研究对263个在COSMOS领域发现的射电选择的NIR-dark（RS-NIRdark）星系进行了全光谱的研究。这些星系被选择为射电亮星系（S3 GHz > 12.65 μJy），但在NIR-selected COSMOS2020目录中没有对应物体（Ks ≳ 25.5 mag）。通过构建新的光度测量目录和使用两种不同的代码进行光谱能量分布拟合程序，估计了这些星系的光红移和物理特性。结果表明，这些星系的消光中值很高（Av ∼ 4），星团形成速率也很高（SFR ∼ 500 M⊙ yr−1），符合可能是DSFG的特性。另外，星系的光红移中值很大（z ∼ 3），并且存在一定比例的高红移候选者（z > 4.5），这表明这些星系对宇宙SFRD和高红移星系的演化路径具有重要贡献。 <div>
In the last decades, an increasing scientific interest has been growing in the elusive population of dark (i.e., lacking an optical/near-IR, hereafter NIR, counterpart) dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). Although extremely promising for their likely contribution to the cosmic star formation rate density (SFRD) and for their possible role in the evolution of the first massive and passive galaxies around z ∼ 3, the difficulty in selecting statistically significant samples of dark DSFGs is limiting their scientific potentialities. This work presents the first panchromatic study of a sample of 263 radio-selected NIR-dark (RS-NIRdark) galaxies discovered in the COSMOS field following the procedure by Talia et al. These sources are selected as radio-bright galaxies (S3 GHz > 12.65 μJy) with no counterpart in the NIR-selected COSMOS2020 catalog (Ks ≳ 25.5 mag). For these sources, we build a new photometric catalog including accurate photometry from the optical to the radio obtained with a new deblending pipeline (Photometry Extractor for Blended Objects, or PhoEBO). We employ this catalog to estimate the photo-zs and the physical properties of the galaxies through an spectral energy distribution-fitting procedure performed with two different codes (Magphys and Cigale). Finally, we estimate the active galactic nucleus contamination in our sample by performing a series of complementary tests. The high values of the median extinction (Av ∼ 4) and star formation rate (SFR ∼ 500 M⊙ yr−1) confirm the likely DSFG nature of the RS-NIRdark galaxies. The median photo-z (z ∼ 3) and the presence of a significant tail of high-z candidates (z > 4.5) suggest that these sources are important contributors to the cosmic SFRD and the evolutionary path of galaxies at high redshifts.

<br />太阳23和24周期，平均场动力模型，环形磁通量，BMRs，差分旋转
<br /><br />总结:
太阳周期23和24的数据驱动3D平均场动力模型研究了环形磁通量预算。该模型模拟了全球太阳动力机制，包括太阳表面出现和演化的双极磁区（BMRs）的影响。通过应用斯托克斯定理到动力感应方程，我们展示了在对流层深处的轴对称环形磁场生成率的半球幅值只能部分地从差分旋转和轴对称径向磁场的表面参数估计。沿赤道的径向积分的贡献主要是由对流层底部的转动径向剪切引起的，并且与表面纬向差分旋转的影响几乎同样大小且几乎同相。此外，环形场生成率估计强烈依赖于表面极地附近的径向磁场纬向剖面。在我们的动力模型中，这种剖面明显偏离了观察到的太阳周期22、23和24极小值期间的极地磁场分布。这种差异的原因需要进一步的观测和理论研究。通过比较2D轴对称和3D非轴对称动力模型，我们发现由于BMRs的表面影响，3D模型中环形场生成率增加，导致轴对称磁场的幅值增加。 <div>
We study the toroidal magnetic flux budget of the axisymmetric part of a data-driven 3D mean-field dynamo model of Solar Cycles 23 and 24. The model simulates the global solar dynamo that includes the effects of the formation and evolution of bipolar magnetic regions (BMRs) emerging on the solar surface. By applying Stokes’s theorem to the dynamo induction equation, we show that the hemispheric magnitude of the net axisymmetric toroidal magnetic field generation rate in the bulk of the convection zone can only partially be estimated from the surface parameters of the differential rotation and the axisymmetric radial magnetic field. The contribution of the radial integral along the equator, which is mostly due to the rotational radial shear at the bottom of the convection zone, has the same magnitude and is nearly in phase with the effect of the surface latitudinal differential rotation. Also, the toroidal field generation rate estimate strongly depends on the latitudinal profile of the surface radial magnetic field near the poles. This profile in our dynamo models significantly deviates from the polar magnetic field distribution observed during the minima of Solar Cycles 22, 23, and 24. The cause of this discrepancy requires further observational and theoretical studies. Comparing the 2D axisymmetric and the 3D nonaxisymmetric dynamo models, we find an increase in the toroidal field generation rate in the 3D model due to the surface effects of BMRs, resulting in an increase in the axisymmetric poloidal magnetic field magnitude.

<div> 星系，高红移，氧丰度，金属丰度校准，JWST/NIRSpec
<br /><br />总结:
这篇文章报道了对16个星系的[O III] λ4364电子发射线的探测结果，这些星系的红移在z=2.1-8.7。文章将这些结果与文献中的9个z=4-9星系的检测结果以及21个z=1.4-3.7星系的地面光谱检测结果进行了合并，并为这些星系得到了电子温度(Te)和直接方法氧丰度的数值。这篇文章构建了第一个基于电子温度的高红移金属丰度校准，可适用于z=2-9的星系样本，提高了宇宙中午时期和再电离纪元金属丰度测定的准确性。这些新的高红移校准改进了我们对早期宇宙中反馈和重子循环的理解。JWST/NIRSpec的深度光谱项目有望提高当前样本覆盖的金属丰度范围的低端和高端的数据统计水平，并提高[N II] λ6585的检测率，从而使未来对基于氮的指标的评估成为可能。 <div>
We report detections of the [O iii]λ4364 auroral emission line for 16 galaxies at z = 2.1–8.7, measured from JWST/NIRSpec observations obtained as part of the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) survey program. We combine this CEERS sample with 9 objects from the literature at z = 4−9 with auroral-line detections from JWST/NIRSpec and 21 galaxies at z = 1.4−3.7 with auroral-line detections from ground-based spectroscopy. We derive electron temperature (Te) and direct-method oxygen abundances for the combined sample of 46 star-forming galaxies at z = 1.4−8.7. We use these measurements to construct the first high-redshift empirical Te-based metallicity calibrations for the strong-line ratios [O iii]/Hβ, [O ii]/Hβ, R23 = ([O iii]+[O ii])/Hβ, [O iii]/[O ii], and [Ne iii]/[O ii]. These new calibrations are valid over 12+log(O/H) = 7.4−8.3 and can be applied to samples of star-forming galaxies at z = 2−9, leading to an improvement in the accuracy of metallicity determinations at Cosmic Noon and in the Epoch of Reionization. The high-redshift strong-line relations are offset from calibrations based on typical z ∼ 0 galaxies or H ii regions, reflecting the known evolution of ionization conditions between z ∼ 0 and z ∼ 2. Deep spectroscopic programs with JWST/NIRSpec promise to improve statistics at the low and high ends of the metallicity range covered by the current sample, as well as to improve the detection rate of [N ii]λ6585 and thus allow the future assessment of N-based indicators. These new high-redshift calibrations will enable accurate characterizations of metallicity scaling relations at high redshift, improving our understanding of feedback and baryon cycling in the early Universe.

总结:
本文对Fermi-4LAC明亮的平谱射电类星体（FSRQs）进行为期14年的长期多波段研究，通过Fermi大面积望远镜、斯威夫特X射线望远镜和紫外/光学望远镜获取的伽马射线、X射线和紫外/光学数据的详细变化和光谱分析，揭示了不同活动状态下的变化。通过提出一种新的方法来约束模型参数，有效地重现了样本的多波段同时/准同时谱能分布（SEDs），并估计了样本的射流辐射区参数值。还利用同步辐射自身康普顿和外部康普顿过程，采用对数抛物线谱形来近似样本源的观测谱，考虑到引起的物理参数。模型结果表明：（1）通过有效地再现明亮FSRQs不同活跃状态的SEDs，合理地约束了辐射区内的参数；（2）与其他活跃状态相比，喷流的辐射区在高状态下呈现较小的半径，而在低状态下磁场强度增加；（3）对于处于高活跃状态的明亮FSRQs，多普勒因子增强，通常呈现出能量均分的趋势。 <div>
In this paper, we present a long-term multiwavelength investigation focusing on 12 distinct samples of Fermi-4LAC bright flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs). Detailed variability and spectral analyses of γ-ray, X-ray, and ultraviolet/optical data obtained by the Fermi Large Area Telescope, the Swift X-ray Telescope, and the Swift Ultraviolet and Optical Telescope were performed over a period of about 14 yr, spanning from 2008 October to 2022 October. These analyses provide insights into characterizing the variations within different activity states. To efficiently reproduce the multiwavelength simultaneous/quasi-simultaneous spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the samples, we propose a novel approach for constraining the model parameters. By analyzing the parameters of the energy spectral curvature (β), the peak frequency (νpk), the peak luminosity (Lpk), the Compton dominance parameter (AC), and the variability timescale (tvar) in different activity states, we can estimate the values of the jet radiation region parameters for the samples. Subsequently, we utilize the synchrotron-self-Compton and external Compton processes, employing a logarithmic-parabolic spectral shape to approximate the observed spectra of the sample sources, while considering the induced regime for the physical parameters. The model results show that: (1) by effectively reproducing SEDs in various active states of bright FSRQs, the parameters within the emission region were reasonably constrained; (2) compared to other active states, the emission region of the jet exhibits a reduced radius during the high state, while the magnetic field strength increases during the low state; and (3) for bright FSRQs in a high-activity state, there is an enhancement of the Doppler factor, often exhibiting a tendency toward energy equipartition.

<br />总结:<br />本文指出来自脉冲星和黑洞的相对论性风的等离子体注入效应的主导重要性。在光线圆之外，沿着螺旋磁场滑动的磁场占优势的流动几乎呈径向移动，具有很大的洛伦兹因子，γ0≫1，在间隙内成对产生时，这些因子被印记到流动中。只有在更大的距离r≥γ0(c/Ω)时，MHD加速度Γ∝r才会接管。因此，Blandford-Znajek(BZ)驱动的流动产生了脊柱明亮的图像。M87中最清晰的喷流显示出边缘明亮的特征，以及较弱的脊柱明亮特征。只有脊柱明亮的成分可以由BZ驱动/起源于黑洞的磁层。 <div>
We point out the dominant importance of plasma injection effects of relativistic winds from pulsars and black holes. We demonstrate that outside the light cylinder, the magnetically dominated outflows sliding along the helical magnetic field move nearly radially with very large Lorentz factors, γ0 ≫ 1, imprinted into the flow during pair production within the gaps. Only at larger distances, r ≥ γ0(c/Ω), does MHD acceleration Γ ∝ r take over. As a result, Blandford–Znajek (BZ)-driven outflows produce spine-brightened images. The best-resolved case of the jet in M87 shows both edge-brightened features, as well as weaker spine-brightened features. Only the spine-brightened component can be BZ driven/originate from the black hole's magnetosphere.

<div> 高频紫外到近红外观测，Type Ia 超新星，SN 2023bee，光谱，理论模型，早期过量流量

总结:
观测了超新星SN 2023bee，发现在爆炸后的最初几天有过量流量，特别是在高频观测中。该超新星的过量流量在紫外波段较红，并且较不明亮。光谱显示了较弱的吸收线，但目前的理论模型无法完全解释观测到的现象。可能是由于潜在的不对称发射造成的，这种过量流量的物理原因可能在正常的Type Ia 超新星中普遍存在。 <div>
We present high-cadence ultraviolet through near-infrared observations of the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2023bee at D = 32 ± 3 Mpc, finding excess flux in the first days after explosion, particularly in our 10 minutes cadence TESS light curve and Swift UV data. Compared to a few other normal SNe Ia with early excess flux, the excess flux in SN 2023bee is redder in the UV and less luminous. We present optical spectra of SN 2023bee, including two spectra during the period where the flux excess is dominant. At this time, the spectra are similar to those of other SNe Ia but with weaker Si ii, C ii, and Ca ii absorption lines, perhaps because the excess flux creates a stronger continuum. We compare the data to several theoretical models on the origin of early excess flux in SNe Ia. Interaction with either the companion star or close-in circumstellar material is expected to produce a faster evolution than observed. Radioactive material in the outer layers of the ejecta, either from double detonation explosion or from a 56Ni clump near the surface, cannot fully reproduce the evolution either, likely due to the sensitivity of early UV observable to the treatment of the outer part of ejecta in simulation. We conclude that no current model can adequately explain the full set of observations. We find that a relatively large fraction of nearby, bright SNe Ia with high-cadence observations have some amount of excess flux within a few days of explosion. Considering potential asymmetric emission, the physical cause of this excess flux may be ubiquitous in normal SNe Ia.

Many theories of dark matter beyond the weakly interacting massive particles paradigm feature an enhanced matter power spectrum on subparsec scales, leading to the formation of dense dark matter minihalos. Future local observations are promising to search for and constrain such substructures. The survival probability of these dense minihalos in the Milky Way environment is crucial for interpreting local observations. In this work, we investigate two environmental effects: stellar disruption and (smooth) tidal disruption. These two mechanisms are studied using semianalytic models and idealized N-body simulations. For stellar disruption, we perform a series of N-body simulations of isolated minihalo–star encounters to test and calibrate analytic models of stellar encounters before applying the model to the realistic Milky Way disk environment. For tidal disruption, we perform N-body simulations to confirm the effectiveness of the analytic treatment. Finally, we propose a framework to combine the hierarchical assembly and infall of minihalos to the Milky Way with the late-time disruption mechanisms. We make predictions for the mass functions of minihalos in the Milky Way. The mass survival fraction (at Mmh ≥ 10−12M⊙) of dense dark matter minihalos, e.g., for axion miniclusters and minihalos from early matter domination, is ∼60% with the relatively low-mass, compact population surviving. The survival fraction is insensitive to the detailed model parameters. We discuss various implications of the framework and future direct detection prospects.

本研究在电弧加热设备中对L5普通球粒陨石和IAB-MG铁陨石进行了模拟实验，重现了三种飞行条件。实验结果表明，剪切应力是影响陨石烧蚀的主要因素。研究还分析了陨石的熔融外壳，获得了样本的微观结构，并通过能谱分析确定了石质陨石的元素分布，解释了石质和铁质陨石在烧蚀和再结晶过程中的差异。通过光谱分析确定了原子种类，分析了烧蚀产物。通过热蚀速率和有效热蚀热量的测量，发现了石质陨石的质量损失取决于主体的碎裂，而铁质陨石取决于熔融层的剪切损失。研究结果为理解陨石烧蚀提供了重要信息。 <div>
To observe meteorite ablation, simulation experiments were conducted on the L5 ordinary chondrite and IAB-MG iron meteorites in an arc-heated facility and three flight conditions were reproduced. To mimic the high heating rates and the significant shear stress that meteorites experience during Earth entry, the samples were machined into 9° spherical cones with a 20 mm nose radius. High-quality video, the surface temperature, a time-resolved spectrum, and infrared video were recorded. The atom species were determined via spectroscopy to analyze the ablation products. Due to the electrode erosion and dissociation of air, the atomic lines of copper, nitrogen, and oxygen were detected in all the tests. Although the copper atom is a pollutant to the flow field, the five copper lines were used to determine the flow-field temperature. The ablation rates and effective heat of ablation of both the samples were measured under different conditions. The results indicate that shear stress is the dominant factor influencing meteorite ablation. Furthermore, the diversity between stony and iron meteorites suggests that the mass loss of stony meteorites depends on the fragmentation of the main body and that of iron meteorites depends on the shearing loss of the molten layer. Then, the fusion crusts were analyzed, the microstructures of the samples were obtained, the crust thicknesses were measured, and the elemental distribution of the stony meteorites was determined via energy dispersion spectroscopy. The study results explain the differences in the ablation and recrystallization process between stony and iron meteorites.

总结: 本文采用了潮汐重建方法对红移空间中模拟星系进行了研究。研究发现，红移空间扭曲导致了各向异性的重建结果。虽然由于小尺度速度离散度较大，径向模式的重建结果更加嘈杂，但横向模式仍能以高保真度进行重建，并且与原始大尺度密度模式有很好的相关性。大尺度上重建场的偏差呈现简单的角度相关性，可以用类似于线性红移空间扭曲的形式描述。噪声功率谱在大尺度上几乎是各向同性的，且与尺度无关。这使得重建的潮汐场成为宇宙方差抵消和多探测器分析的理想示踪器，并对未来的21厘米强度映射调查产生深远的影响。<br /><br /> <div>
Gravitational coupling between large- and small-scale density perturbations leads to anisotropic distortions to local small-scale matter fluctuations. Such local anisotropic distortions can be used to reconstruct large-scale matter distribution, known as tidal reconstruction. In this paper, we apply the tidal reconstruction methods to simulated galaxies in redshift space. We find that redshift-space distortions (RSDs) lead to anisotropic reconstruction results. While the reconstructed radial modes are more noisy mainly due to the small-scale velocity dispersion, the transverse modes are still reconstructed with high fidelity, and well correlated with the original large-scale density modes. The bias of the reconstructed field at large scales shows a simple angular dependence, which can be described by a form similar to that of the linear RSD. The noise power spectrum is nearly isotropic and scale independent on large scales. This makes the reconstructed tide fields an ideal tracer for cosmic variance cancellation and multi-tracer analysis and has profound implications for future 21 cm intensity mapping surveys.

RCB stars are L ≈ 104L⊙ solar-mass objects that can exhibit large periods of extinction from dust ejection episodes. Many exhibit semi-regular pulsations in the range of 30–50 days with semi-amplitudes of 0.05–0.3 mag. Space-based photometry has discovered that solar-like oscillations are ubiquitous in hydrogen-dominated stars that have substantial outer convective envelopes, so we explore the hypothesis that the pulsations in RCB stars and the closely related dustless hydrogen-deficient carbon (dLHdC) stars, which have large convective outer envelopes of nearly pure helium, have a similar origin. Through stellar modeling and pulsation calculations, we find that the observed periods and amplitudes of these pulsations follows the well-measured phenomenology of their H-rich brethren. In particular, we show that the observed modes are likely of angular orders l = 0, 1, and 2 and predominantly of an acoustic nature (i.e., p-modes with low radial order). The modes with largest amplitude are near the acoustic cutoff frequency appropriately rescaled to the helium-dominated envelope, and the observed amplitudes are consistent with that seen in high-luminosity (L > 103L⊙) H-rich giants. We also find that for Teff ≳ 5400 K, an hydrogen-deficient carbon stellar model exhibits a radiative layer between two outer convective zones, creating a g-mode cavity that supports much longer period (≈100 days) oscillations. Our initial work was focused primarily on the adiabatic modes, but we expect that subsequent space-based observations of these targets (e.g., with TESS or Plato) are likely to lead to a larger set of detected frequencies that would allow for a deeper study of the interiors of these rare stars.

The zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) is a critical phase for stellar angular momentum evolution, as stars transition from contraction-dominated spin-up to magnetic wind-dominated spin-down. We present the first robust observational constraints on rotation for FGK stars at ≈40 Myr. We have analyzed TESS light curves for 1410 members of five young open clusters with ages between 25 and 55 Myr: IC 2391, IC 2602, NGC 2451A, NGC 2547, and Collinder 135. In total, we measure 868 rotation periods, including 96 new, high-quality periods for stars around 1 M⊙. This is an increase of ten times the existing literature sample at the ZAMS. We then use the τ2 method to compare our data to models for stellar angular momentum evolution. Although the ages derived from these rotation models do not match isochronal ages, we show that these observations can clearly discriminate between different models for stellar wind torques. Finally, τ2 fits indicate that magnetic braking and/or internal angular momentum transport significantly impact rotational evolution even on the pre-main sequence.

The kinematics and spatial distribution of highly ionized ion species such as O vi can be significantly affected by supernova (SN) explosions and early (pre-SN) stellar feedback (e.g., stellar winds, radiation pressure). Here we investigate effects of stellar feedback on O vi absorptions in Milky Way−like galaxies by analyzing the suites of high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations under the framework of SMUGGLE, a physically motivated subgrid interstellar medium and stellar feedback model for the moving-mesh code Arepo. We find that the fiducial run with the full suite of stellar feedback and moderate star formation activities can reasonably reproduce Galactic O vi absorptions observed by space telescopes such as the Far-Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer, including the scale height of low-velocity (∣vLSR∣ < 100 km s−1) O vi, the column density–line width relation for high-velocity (100 km s−1 ≤ ∣vLSR∣ < 400 km s−1) O vi, and the cumulative O vi column densities. In contrast, model variations with more intense star formation activities deviate from observations further. Additionally, we find that the run considering only SN feedback is in broad agreement with the observations, whereas in runs without SN feedback this agreement is absent, which indicates a dominant role of SN feedback in heating and accelerating interstellar O vi. This is consistent with the current picture that interstellar O vi is predominantly produced by collisional ionization where mechanical feedback can play a central role. In contrast, photoionization is negligible for O vi production owing to the lack of high-energy (≳114 eV) photons required.

<div> 高质量恒星形成，银河系，中心分子区，尘埃连续谱，星形成迹象<br />
总结:<br />
本文研究了银河系中心分子区潜在高质量恒星形成地点的星形成特性。使用CMZoom 1.3毫米尘埃连续谱目录识别具有典型半径约0.1帕秒的密集结构，并测量它们与高质量恒星形成迹象的关联性。通过整合来自Midcourse Space Experiment、Spitzer、Herschel和SOFIA的8、21、24、25和70微米的紧凑辐射、编目的年轻恒星物体以及水和甲醇激射器来表征每个源。发现中心分子区的潜在星形成率约为0.08 M⊙ yr−1，在未来的几十万年内。计算了中心分子区潜在星形成率的上限和下限分别约为0.45和0.05 M⊙ yr−1，大致相当于其他估计的中心分子区最近星形成率的几倍。尽管存在较大的不确定性，结果表明中心分子区的潜在星形成率可能比以前的估计要高。发现星形成迹象的普遍性与源体密度并不相关，而是≳75%的高质量恒星形成发生在柱密度比（NSMA/NHerschel）约为1.5的区域以上。最后，突出了环绕进化红外源的寒冷尘埃的atoll源的检测，可能代表了正在破坏其包层的H ii区域。 <div>
In this work, we constrain the star-forming properties of all possible sites of incipient high-mass star formation in the Milky Way’s Galactic Center. We identify dense structures using the CMZoom 1.3 mm dust continuum catalog of objects with typical radii of ∼0.1 pc, and measure their association with tracers of high-mass star formation. We incorporate compact emission at 8, 21, 24, 25, and 70 μm from the Midcourse Space Experiment, Spitzer, Herschel, and SOFIA, cataloged young stellar objects, and water and methanol masers to characterize each source. We find an incipient star formation rate (SFR) for the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of ∼0.08 M⊙ yr−1 over the next few 105 yr. We calculate upper and lower limits on the CMZ’s incipient SFR of ∼0.45 and ∼0.05 M⊙ yr−1,respectively, spanning roughly equal to and several times greater than other estimates of CMZ’s recent SFR. Despite substantial uncertainties, our results suggest the incipient SFR in the CMZ may be higher than previously estimated. We find that the prevalence of star formation tracers does not correlate with source volume density, but instead ≳75% of high-mass star formation is found in regions above a column density ratio (NSMA/NHerschel) of ∼1.5. Finally, we highlight the detection of atoll sources, a reoccurring morphology of cold dust encircling evolved infrared sources, possibly representing H ii regions in the process of destroying their envelopes.

总结: 本研究使用阿塔卡马大型毫米/亚毫米阵列望远镜对11个大型原型星团进行连续体和硫甲醛（H2CS）线345 GHz的观测，检测到145个连续核心和72个H2CS线转换，确定了H2CS的旋转温度和柱密度，并发现H2CS的丰度与柱密度正相关。这表明H2CS在不同物理环境下的星形成核心中广泛分布，并且随着温度上升而增加丰度。总之，研究结果对于理解大型原型星团中气体的温度和密度结构以及化学性质具有重要意义。<br /><br /> <div>
Investigating the temperature and density structures of gas in massive protoclusters is crucial for understanding the chemical properties therein. In this study, we present observations of the continuum and thioformaldehyde (H2CS) lines at 345 GHz of 11 massive protoclusters using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array telescope. High spatial resolution and sensitivity observations have detected 145 continuum cores from the 11 sources. H2CS line transitions are observed in 72 out of 145 cores, including line-rich cores, warm cores, and cold cores. The H2 column densities of the 72 cores are estimated from the continuum emission, which are larger than the density threshold value for star formation, suggesting that H2CS can be widely distributed in star-forming cores with different physical environments. The rotation temperature and column density of H2CS are derived using the XCLASS software. The results show that the H2CS abundances increase as temperature rises and higher gas temperatures are usually associated with higher H2CS column densities. The abundances of H2CS are positively correlated with its column density, suggesting that the H2CS abundances are enhanced from cold cores, warm cores, and line-rich cores in star-forming regions.

<div> Praesepe, Hyades, rotation–activity relation, M dwarfs, Hα emission

总结: 
本研究旨在通过对约700百万年的Praesepe和Hyades开放星团成员的观测来表征不同活动迹象在这个年龄的旋转-活动关系。通过获得新的光谱数据、X射线探测结果和旋转周期，我们得出了以下结论：在约700百万年时，几乎所有M型矮星都表现出Hα发射，联星与单星的整体颜色-Hα等价宽度分布相同；在Ro-LHα/Lbol平面上，非饱和单星遵循一个幂律，Ro > 0.3时指数为-5.9 ± 0.8；在Ro-LX/Lbol平面上，我们观察到有关Ro ≲ 0.01的单星存在超饱和迹象，并且遵循一个幂律，支持了这些恒星的日冕被离心剥离的假设；在LHα/Lbol和LX/Lbol之间几乎存在1:1的关系，这表明日冕和色球都经历了类似的磁加热过程。 <div>
Low-mass (≲1.2 M⊙) main-sequence stars lose angular momentum over time, leading to a decrease in their magnetic activity. The details of this rotation–activity relation remain poorly understood, however. Using observations of members of the ≈700 Myr old Praesepe and Hyades open clusters, we aim to characterize the rotation–activity relation for different tracers of activity at this age. To complement published data, we obtained new optical spectra for 250 Praesepe stars, new X-ray detections for 10, and new rotation periods for 28. These numbers for Hyads are 131, 23, and 137, respectively. The latter increases the number of Hyads with periods by 50%. We used these data to measure the fractional Hα and X-ray luminosities, LHα/Lbol and LX/Lbol, and to calculate Rossby numbers Ro. We found that at ≈700 Myr almost all M dwarfs exhibit Hα emission, with binaries having the same overall color–Hα equivalent width distribution as single stars. In the Ro–LHα/Lbol plane, unsaturated single stars follow a power law with index β = −5.9 ± 0.8 for Ro > 0.3. In the Ro–LX/Lbol plane, we see evidence for supersaturation for single stars with Ro ≲ 0.01, following a power law with index , supporting the hypothesis that the coronae of these stars are being centrifugally stripped. We found that the critical Ro value at which activity saturates is smaller for LX/Lbol than for LHα/Lbol. Finally, we observed an almost 1:1 relation between LHα/Lbol and LX/Lbol, suggesting that both the corona and the chromosphere experience similar magnetic heating.

<div> 关键词：宇宙学观测、原初曲率扰动、原始黑洞、快速射电暴、透镜效应<br />
总结:<br />本文首先推导了一个简单的公式来应用原始黑洞的约束条件以及单色质量分布到扩展质量分布。然后，利用最新的快速射电暴观测结果，结合透镜效应，对小尺度上两种原初曲率扰动模型进行了约束。研究结果显示，在目前可用的观测结果中，透镜效应下的快速射电暴没有检测到任何信号，在尺度范围为105-106 Mpc^-1的区域，原初曲率扰动的振幅应小于8 × 10^-2。这对应着与LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA以及未来Einstein Telescope或Cosmic Explorer探测到的双黑洞质量范围相关的一个有趣的质量范围。 <div>
Cosmological observations, e.g., cosmic microwave background, have precisely measured the spectrum of primordial curvature perturbation on larger scales, but smaller scales are still poorly constrained. Since primordial black holes (PBHs) could form in the very early Universe through the gravitational collapse of primordial density perturbations, constraints on the PBH could encode much information on primordial fluctuations. In this work, we first derive a simple formula for the lensing effect to apply PBH constraints with the monochromatic mass distribution to an extended mass distribution. Then, we investigate the latest fast radio burst observations with this relationship to constrain two kinds of primordial curvature perturbation models on small scales. This suggests that, from the null search result of lensed fast radio bursts in currently available observations, the amplitude of primordial curvature perturbation should be less than 8 × 10−2 at the scale region of 105–106 Mpc−1. This corresponds to an interesting mass range relating to binary black holes detected by LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA and future Einstein Telescope or Cosmic Explorer.

<br /><br />总结: 该研究通过高分辨率光谱学分析了M7.5伴星HIP 55507 B及其主星的大气特性，并对其动态质量和化学成分进行了测量，结果显示HIP 55507 A和B具有一致的大气成分，为测量类似光谱类型的亚恒星甚至行星质量伴星的大气成分提供了一种新方法。 <div>
M dwarfs are common host stars to exoplanets but often lack atmospheric abundance measurements. Late-M dwarfs are also good analogs to the youngest substellar companions, which share similar Teff ∼ 2300–2800 K. We present atmospheric analyses for the M7.5 companion HIP 55507 B and its K6V primary star with Keck/KPIC high-resolution (R ∼ 35,000) K-band spectroscopy. First, by including KPIC relative radial velocities between the primary and secondary in the orbit fit, we improve the dynamical mass precision by 60% and find , putting HIP 55507 B above the stellar–substellar boundary. We also find that HIP 55507 B orbits its K6V primary star with au and e = 0.40 ± 0.04. From atmospheric retrievals of HIP 55507 B, we measure [C/H] = 0.24 ± 0.13, [O/H] = 0.15 ± 0.13, and C/O = 0.67 ± 0.04. Moreover, we strongly detect 13CO (7.8σ significance) and tentatively detect (3.7σ significance) in the companion’s atmosphere and measure and after accounting for systematic errors. From a simplified retrieval analysis of HIP 55507 A, we measure and for the primary star. These results demonstrate that HIP 55507 A and B have consistent 12C/13C and 16O/18O to the <1σ level, as expected for a chemically homogeneous binary system. Given the similar flux ratios and separations between HIP 55507 AB and systems with young substellar companions, our results open the door to systematically measuring 13CO and abundances in the atmospheres of substellar or even planetary-mass companions with similar spectral types.

<title>MINDS. JWST/MIRI Reveals a Dynamic Gas-rich Inner Disk inside the Cavity of SY Cha</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
SY Cha is a T Tauri star surrounded by a protoplanetary disk with a large cavity seen in the millimeter continuum but has the spectral energy distribution of a full disk. Here we report the first results from JWST/Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI) Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) observations taken as part of the MIRI mid-INfrared Disk Survey (MINDS) GTO Program. The much improved resolution and sensitivity of MIRI-MRS compared to Spitzer enables a robust analysis of the previously detected H2O, CO, HCN, and CO2 emission as well as a marginal detection of C2H2. We also report the first robust detection of mid-infrared OH and rovibrational CO emission in this source. The derived molecular column densities reveal the inner disk of SY Cha to be rich in both oxygen- and carbon-bearing molecules. This is in contrast to PDS 70, another protoplanetary disk with a large cavity observed with JWST, which displays much weaker line emission. In the SY Cha disk, the continuum, and potentially the line, flux varies substantially between the new JWST observations and archival Spitzer observations, indicative of a highly dynamic inner disk.

<title>A New Cosmic-Ray Rejection Routine for HST WFC3/UVIS via Label-free Training of deepCR</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
deepCR is a deep-learning-based cosmic-ray (CR) rejection framework originally presented by Zhang & Bloom. The original approach requires a dedicated training set that consists of multiple frames of the same fields, enabling automatic CR labeling through comparison with their median coadds. Here, we present a novel training approach that circumvents the need for a dedicated training set, but instead utilizes dark frames and the science images requiring CR removal themselves. During training, CRs present in dark frames are added to the science images, which the network is then trained to identify. In turn, the trained deepCR model can then be applied to identify CRs originally present in the science images. Using this approach, we present a new deepCR model trained on a diverse set of Hubble Space Telescope images taken from resolved galaxies in the Local Group, which is universally applicable across all WFC3/UVIS filters. We introduce a robust approach to determining the threshold for generating binary cosmic-ray masks from predictions from deepCR probability maps. When applied to the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Southern Treasury survey, our new deepCR model added ∼7% of good-quality stars that exhibit distinct features in their color–magnitude diagrams.

<title>Can Fallback Accretion on the Magnetar Model Power the X-Ray Flares Simultaneously Observed with Gamma Rays of Gamma-Ray Bursts?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The prompt emission, X-ray plateau, and X-ray flares of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are thought to be from internal dissipation, and the magnetar as the central engine with propeller fallback accretion is proposed to interpret the observed phenomena of GRBs. In this paper, by systematically searching for X-ray emission observed by Swift/X-ray Telescope, we find that seven robust GRBs include both X-ray flares and plateau emissions with measured redshift. More interestingly, the X-ray flares/bumps for those seven GRBs are simultaneously observed in the gamma-ray band. By adopting the propeller fallback accretion model to fit the observed data, it is found that the free parameters of two GRBs (140512A and 180329B) can be constrained very well, while in the other five cases, more or less, they are not all sufficiently constrained. On the other hand, this requires the conversion efficiency of the propeller to be two or three times higher than that of the spindown dipole radiation of the magnetar. If this is the case, it is contradictory to the expectation from the propeller model: namely, a dirtier ejecta should be less efficient in producing gamma-ray emissions. Our results hint that at least the magnetar central engine with propeller fallback accretion model cannot interpret very well both the GRB X-ray flares simultaneously observed in the gamma-ray band and the X-ray flares of GRBs with a high Lorentz factor.

<title>A Population of Short-duration Gamma-Ray Bursts with Dwarf Host Galaxies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a population of 11 of the faintest (>25.5 AB mag) short gamma-ray burst (GRB) host galaxies. We model their sparse available observations using the stellar population inference code Prospector-β and develop a novel implementation to incorporate the galaxy mass–radius relation. Assuming these hosts are randomly drawn from the galaxy population and conditioning this draw on their observed flux and size in a few photometric bands, we determine that these hosts have dwarf galaxy stellar masses of . This is striking as only 14% of short GRB hosts with previous inferred stellar masses had M* ≲ 109M⊙. We further show these short GRBs have smaller physical and host-normalized offsets than the rest of the population, suggesting that the majority of their neutron star (NS) merger progenitors were retained within their hosts. The presumably shallow potentials of these hosts translate to small escape velocities of ∼5.5–80 km s−1, indicative of either low postsupernova systemic velocities or short inspiral times. While short GRBs with identified dwarf host galaxies now comprise ≈14% of the total Swift-detected population, a number are likely missing in the current population, as larger systemic velocities (observed from the Galactic NS population) would result in highly offset short GRBs and less secure host associations. However, the revelation of a population of short GRBs retained in low-mass host galaxies offers a natural explanation for the observed r-process enrichment via NS mergers in Local Group dwarf galaxies, and has implications for gravitational-wave follow-up strategies.

<title>Detection of CO(1−0) Emission at the Tips of the Tidal Tail in the Antennae Galaxies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The tip of the tidal tail, resulting from an encounter between galaxies, features gas concentrations and some star-forming regions, such as tidal dwarf galaxies (TDGs). This region provides a unique laboratory for examining the star formation process in a dynamical environment distinct from that of disk galaxies. Using the Nobeyama 45 m telescope, we conducted 12CO(1−0) position-switching observations at the tips of the southern tidal tail in the Antennae galaxies. We detected CO emission not only from the two star-forming TDG candidates but also in regions with no significant star formation. Adopting a Galactic CO-to-H2 conversion factor without helium correction, the H2 gas surface density is ∼5–12 M⊙ pc−2. In most regions, the molecular-to-atomic gas ratio is around unity (0.6–1.9), but we find a region with a high ratio with a 3σ lower limit of >7.2. The star formation efficiency (SFE) of molecular gas is notably low (<0.15 Gyr−1), indicating less active star formation than in both nearby disk galaxies (∼0.5–1.0 Gyr−1) and other TDGs previously observed. Including previous observations, the molecular gas SFEs vary widely among TDGs/tidal tails, from 10−2 to 10 Gyr−1, demonstrating significant variations in star formation activity. Potential factors contributing to the low SFE in the Antennae tail tips include extensive tides and/or the young age of the tail.

<title>Detectability of Strongly Gravitationally Lensed Tidal Disruption Events</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
More than 100 tidal disruption events (TDEs) have been detected at multiple bands, which can be viewed as extreme laboratories to investigate the accretion physics and gravity in the immediate vicinity of massive black holes. Future transient surveys are expected to detect several tens of thousands of TDEs, among which a small fraction may be strongly gravitationally lensed by intervening galaxies. In this paper, we statistically estimate the detection rate of lensed TDEs, with dependence on the limiting magnitude of the transient all-sky surveys searching for them. We find that the requisite limiting magnitude for an all-sky transient survey to observe at least 1 yr−1 is ≳21.3, 21.2, and 21.5 mag in the u, g, and z bands, respectively. If the limiting magnitude of the all-sky survey can reach ∼25–26 mag in the u, g, and z bands, the detection rate can be up to about several tens to hundreds per year. The discovery and identification of the first image of the lensed TDE can be taken as an early warning of the second and other subsequent images, which may enable detailed monitoring of the pre-peak photometry and spectroscopy evolution of the TDE. The additional early-stage information may help to constrain the dynamical and radiation processes involved in the TDEs.

总结:
研究了高红移星系中分子流对星形成的影响，发现猎户座座标J2054-0005的OH 119μm线显示了P-Cygni型谱线，表明存在出流现象，并且该分子流速度极快，可能导致星形成迅速停止。研究还发现，在4 < z < 6.4的星形成星系和类星体中，质量流出率与红外总光度呈正相关。另外，由于出流速度极高，高达50%的分子气体可能会逸出到星系外的星际介质中。 <div>
Molecular outflows are expected to play a key role in galaxy evolution at high redshift. To study the impact of outflows on star formation at the epoch of reionization, we performed sensitive Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of OH 119 μm toward J2054-0005, a luminous quasar at z = 6.04. The OH line is detected and exhibits a P-Cygni profile that can be fitted with a broad blueshifted absorption component, providing unambiguous evidence of an outflow, and an emission component at near-systemic velocity. The mean and terminal outflow velocities are estimated to be vout ≈ 670 and 1500 km s−1, respectively, making the molecular outflow in this quasar one of the fastest at the epoch of reionization. The OH line is marginally spatially resolved for the first time in a quasar at z > 6, revealing that the outflow extends over the central 2 kpc region. The mass outflow rate is comparable to the star formation rate ( ), indicating rapid (∼107 yr) quenching of star formation. The mass outflow rate in a sample of star-forming galaxies and quasars at 4 < z < 6.4 exhibits a positive correlation with the total infrared luminosity, although the scatter is large. Owing to the high outflow velocity, a large fraction (up to ∼50%) of the outflowing molecular gas may be able to escape from the host galaxy into the intergalactic medium.

改进的WF算法通过调整交叉功率谱密度和加权平均（WA）算法估计的PSD，成功地抑制了噪声水平，重构了公共信号。对观测数据的分析结果表明，该方法成功地检测到了国际原子时间（TAI）和本地原子时间TA（NTSC）的波动。稳定性分析表明，EPT有潜力在7年以上的时间尺度上揭示TAI的不稳定性。这一改进的WF方法还可被用于通过多个原子时间标准检测和监测脉冲星时间残差中的噪声，进而改善EPT。 <br /><br />总结: 该研究提出了一种改进的Wiener滤波方法，成功应用于脉冲星时间尺度的构建，通过模拟数据和观测数据表明了其有效性，能够检测和监测原子时间的波动和不稳定性。 <div>
An improved Wiener filtration (WF) method for constructing the ensemble pulsar timescale (EPT) is proposed to solve the existing problems in the WF algorithm. The improvements consist of three parts: (i) adjusting the cross-power spectral density (PSD) and PSD estimated by the weighted average (WA) algorithm by the concept of the energy upper limit; (ii) combining the cross-PSD and WA PSD to form a different signal modulus for the filtration of residuals of different noise levels; and (iii) setting a weight for each residual by a more general algorithm based on the concept of effective power. We use this improved WF method to construct the EPT by both simulated data and observational data from the second data release of the International Pulsar Timing Array. The results from the simulated data indicate this improved WF can successfully suppress the noise level and reform the common signal. For observational data, this method also successfully detects the fluctuations of International Atomic Time (TAI) and local atomic time TA(NTSC). A stability analysis shows that an EPT will have the potential to reveal the instability of TAI on a scale longer than 7 yr. This improved WF method can also be used to detect and monitor the noise in pulsar timing residuals inversely, by using multiple atomic time standards, which can in turn improve the EPT.

<title>Typical X-Ray Outburst Light Curves of Aql X-1</title>

<div> 关键词: Aql X-1, X-ray outburst, 磁偶极矩, 准周期爆发, 磁场强度

总结:
Aql X-1的X射线暴发光变曲线可以被中子星的吸积盘不稳定模型自然地再现，无需引入部分吸积或推进效应。通过考虑盘面纵横比h/r对X射线辐射通量计算的影响，可以自然产生光变曲线中的转折点和随后的急剧衰减。研究结果还表明，该模型可以解释Aql X-1的长期演化，与观测到的暴发周期和典型光变曲线相符。此外，估算表明，该源在休眠状态也从盘上吸积物质，并且磁偶极矩μ≲4×10^26 G cm^3（表面磁场强度B≲4×10^8 G）。 <div>
We show that the typical X-ray outburst light curve of Aql X-1 can be reproduced by accretion onto a neutron star in the frame of the disk instability model without invoking partial accretion or the propeller effect. The knee and the subsequent sharp decay in the X-ray light curve can be generated naturally by taking into account the weak dependence of the disk aspect ratio, h/r, on the disk mass-flow rate, , in the X-ray irradiation flux calculation. This dependence of h/r only slightly modifies the irradiation temperature profile along the hot disk in comparison to that obtained with a constant h/r. Nevertheless, this small difference has a significant cumulative effect on the hot disk radius, leading to a much faster decrease in the size of the hot disk and thereby to a sharper decay in the X-ray outburst light curve. The same model also produces the long-term evolution of Aql X-1, consistent with its observed outburst recurrence time and typical light curve. Our results imply that the source accretes matter from the disk in the quiescent state as well. We also estimate that the dipole moment of the source μ ≲ 4 × 1026 G cm3 (B ≲ 4 × 108 G at the surface).

Summary: 
该研究分析了来自James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)图像的3300个星系样本，涵盖红移z ≃ 3.5至z ≃ 8.5之间的对象，包括质量低至≃108M⊙的星系。研究利用JWST数据的深度和波长覆盖范围，首次得出了这些高红移、低质量星系的可靠星系质量。通过辅助CANDELS数据，计算了星系星系质量函数，结果显示了随红移增加，低质量端斜率(α)变陡，z ≃ 4时α = −1.61 ± 0.05，z ≃ 7时α = −1.98 ± 0.14。还观察到了从z ≃ 7到z ≃ 4的归一化ϕ*的演化。研究还引入了一种用于估计Eddington偏差的新方法，考虑了其可能依赖于星系质量和红移，并允许误差分布的偏度。最后计算了宇宙星系质量密度，结果显示与先前研究相比，其随红移演化较为平缓。 <br /><br />总结: 星系质量样本通过JWST数据首次得出高红移低质量星系的可靠质量。研究表明，随红移增加，星系质量函数的低质量端斜率变陡，且从z ≃ 7到z ≃ 4归一化ϕ*有演化。研究还引入了一种新方法用于估计Eddington偏差，并计算了宇宙星系质量密度，结果显示其随红移演化较为平缓。 <div>
We analyze a sample of 3300 galaxies between redshifts z ≃ 3.5 and z ≃ 8.5 selected from James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) images in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field and UKIDSS Ultra Deep Survey field, including objects with stellar masses as low as ≃108M⊙ up to z ≃ 8. The depth and wavelength coverage of the JWST data allows us, for the first time, to derive robust stellar masses for such high-z, low stellar mass galaxies on an individual basis. We compute the galaxy stellar mass function, after complementing our sample with ancillary data from CANDELS to constrain the GMSF at high stellar masses ( ). Our results show a steepening of the low stellar mass end slope (α) with redshift, with α = −1.61 ± 0.05 at z ≃ 4 and α = −1.98 ± 0.14 at z ≃ 7. We also observe an evolution of the normalization ϕ* from z ≃ 7 to z ≃ 4, with . Our study incorporates a novel method for the estimation of the Eddington bias, which takes into account its possible dependence both on stellar mass and redshift, while allowing for skewness in the error distribution. We finally compute the resulting cosmic stellar mass density and find a flatter evolution with redshift than previous studies.

<div> 关键词：长时伽马射线暴，光球辐射，数值模拟，偏振分析，能谱特征。<br />
总结:<br />这篇文章研究了长时伽马射线暴中光球辐射的属性，使用了三种数值模型进行模拟，并发现了光谱峰值能量和亮度之间的相关性，以及它们与相对论速度因子的关系。然而，发现合成光谱形状比观测到的要窄，需要额外的物理过程来复现光谱特征。此外，偏振分析表明射流核心的辐射偏振度较低，但随着视角的改变而增加，而且存在大的时间变化和能量依赖性。这些发现有助于我们更好地理解长时伽马射线暴的物理机制。 <div>
We explore the properties of photospheric emission in the context of long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) using three numerical models that combine relativistic hydrodynamical simulations and Monte Carlo radiation transfer calculations in three dimensions. Our simulations confirm that photospheric emission gives rise to correlations between the spectral peak energy and luminosity that agree with the observed Yonetoku, Amati, and Golenetskii correlations. It is also shown that the spectral peak energy and luminosity correlate with the bulk Lorentz factor, as indicated in the literature. On the other hand, synthetic spectral shapes tend to be narrower than those of the observations. This result indicates that an additional physical process that can provide nonthermal broadening is needed to reproduce the spectral features. Furthermore, the polarization analysis finds that, while the degree of polarization is low for the emission from the jet core (Π < 4%), it tends to increase with viewing angle outside of the core and can be as high as Π ∼ 20%–40% in an extreme case. This suggests that the typical GRBs show systematically low polarization compared to softer, dimmer counterparts (X-ray-rich GRBs and X-ray flashes). Interestingly, our simulations indicate that photospheric emission exhibits large temporal variation in the polarization position angle (Δψ ∼ 90°), which may be compatible with those inferred in observations. A notable energy dependence of the polarization property is another characteristic feature found in the current study. Particularly, the difference in the position angle among different energy bands can be as large as ∼90°.

<div> 磁场线，太阳圈边界，星际介质，星际磁场，银河宇宙射线
<br />
这篇论文研究了太阳圈边界附近星际磁场线的几何形态，其中磁场线在太阳风圆层（HP）处分开，在北半球形成一片大型磁陷阱区域。磁陷阱影响着银河宇宙射线（GCRs）的传播，并预测出了环形高能离子环绕在磁陷阱内部的情况。此外，还研究了几种极端的磁场线配置，可以描述其他恒星的星际气囊。采用解析模型研究了极端星际介质磁场的情况，避免了数值磁流体力学（MHD）模型的不合理耗散，结果表明GCRs首次通过HP时倾向于穿过磁陷阱和上风方向之间的新月形区域。该论文还包括了有关太阳圈的MHD模拟结果，提供了磁陷阱中心在黄道坐标系中的坐标。 <div>
This paper examines the geometry of interstellar magnetic field lines close to the boundary of the heliosphere in the direction of the unperturbed local interstellar magnetic field, where the field lines are spread apart by the heliopause (HP). Such field parting establishes a region of weaker magnetic field of about 300 au in size in the northern hemisphere that acts as a giant magnetic trap affecting the propagation of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs). The choice of an analytic model of the magnetic field in the very local interstellar medium allows us to qualitatively study the resulting magnetic field draping pattern while avoiding unphysical dissipation across the HP-impeding numerical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models. We investigate GCR transport in the region exterior to the heliosphere, including the magnetic trap, subject to guiding center drifts, pitch angle scattering, and perpendicular diffusion. The transport coefficients were derived from Voyager 1 observations of magnetic turbulence in the VLISM. Our results predict a ring current of energetic ions drifting around the interior of the magnetic trap. It is also demonstrated that GCRs cross the HP for the first time preferentially through a crescent-shaped region between the magnetic trap and the upwind direction. The paper includes results of MHD modeling of the heliosphere that provide the coordinates of the center of the magnetic trap in ecliptic coordinates. In addition to the heliosphere, we examine several extreme field draping configurations that could describe the astrospheres of other stars.

<div> CSO, 两个类别, CSO 2 的三个亚类, 演化和能量需求, AGN研究<br />
CSO研究结果表明，CSO包括两个无关的类别：边暗、低亮度的CSO 1和边明、高亮度的CSO 2。CSO 2还分为三个亚类：CSO 2.0具有窄喷流和/或窄叶状体的突出热点；CSO 2.2没有突出热点，具有宽喷流和/或叶状体；CSO 2.1表现出混合特性。大多数CSO2不会演化成更大的喷流活跃星系核（AGN），而是在其整个寿命中作为尺寸≲500 pc和年龄≲5000年的CSO。产生CSO 2所需的最小能量范围从∼10−4M⊙c2到∼7M⊙c2。研究显示，大多数CSO 2的暂时性质和它们的诞生率可以通过恒星的潮汐破坏事件中的点火来解释。我们还考虑了利用超大质量黑洞的自旋能量以及利用吸积盘的能量的可能性。我们的结果表明，CSO构成了一个庞大的AGN家族，我们迄今只研究过最明亮的成员。更全面的CSO研究，具有更高的灵敏度、分辨率和动态范围，将彻底改变我们对AGN和供给它们能量的中心引擎的理解。 <br /><br />总结:本研究确认CSO包括两个类别，CSO 2还分为三个亚类，并探讨了其演化和能量需求。对AGN的研究将有望得到颠覆性的提升。 <div>
We use a sample of 54 compact symmetric objects (CSOs) to confirm that there are two unrelated CSO classes: an edge-dimmed, low-luminosity class (CSO 1), and an edge-brightened, high-luminosity class (CSO 2). Using blind tests, we show that CSO 2s consist of three subclasses: CSO 2.0, having prominent hot spots at the leading edges of narrow jets and/or narrow lobes; CSO 2.2, without prominent hot spots and with broad jets and/or lobes; and CSO 2.1, which exhibit mixed properties. Most CSO 2s do not evolve into larger jetted active galactic nuclei (AGN), but spend their whole life cycle as CSOs of size ≲500 pc and age ≲5000 yr. The minimum energies needed to produce the radio luminosity and structure in CSO 2s range from ∼10−4M⊙c2 to ∼7 M⊙c2. We show that the transient nature of most CSO 2s, and their birth rate, can be explained through ignition in the tidal disruption events of stars. We also consider possibilities of tapping the spin energy of the supermassive black hole, and tapping the energy of the accretion disk. Our results demonstrate that CSOs constitute a large family of AGN in which we have thus far studied only the brightest. More comprehensive CSO studies, with higher sensitivity, resolution, and dynamic range, will revolutionize our understanding of AGN and the central engines that power them.

<div> CSOs, jetted AGN, overall size, misclassified, astrophysical studies<br />
总结:<br />
这篇文章介绍了紧凑对称天体（CSOs）的定义和分类标准，指出了原分类标准的局限性，并提出了新的CSO识别标准。通过识别79个符合新标准的CSOs，建立了一个可用于天体物理研究的CSO样本。并且指出了CSOs在特定AGN样本中的比例在6.8%到8.5%之间。 <div>
Compact symmetric objects (CSOs) are jetted active galactic nuclei (AGN) with overall projected size <1 kpc. The classification was introduced to distinguish these objects from the majority of compact jetted AGN in centimeter-wavelength very long baseline interferometry observations, where the observed emission is relativistically boosted toward the observer. The original classification criteria for CSOs were (i) evidence of emission on both sides of the center of activity and (ii) overall size <1 kpc. However, some relativistically boosted objects with jet axes close to the line of sight appear symmetric and have been misclassified as CSOs, thereby undermining the CSO classification. This is because two essential CSO properties, pointed out in the original papers, have been neglected: (iii) low variability and (iv) low apparent speeds along the jets. As a first step toward creating a comprehensive catalog of “bona fide” CSOs, we identify 79 bona fide CSOs, including 15 objects claimed as confirmed CSOs here for the first time, that match the CSO selection criteria. This sample of bona fide CSOs can be used for astrophysical studies of CSOs without contamination by misclassified CSOs. We show that the fraction of CSOs in complete flux density limited AGN samples with S5GHz > 700 mJy is between (6.8 ± 1.6)% and (8.5 ± 1.8)%.

Compact symmetric objects (CSOs) are compact (<1 kpc), jetted active galactic nuclei (AGN), whose jet axes are not aligned close to the line of sight, and whose observed emission is not predominantly relativistically boosted toward us. Two classes of CSOs have previously been identified: approximately one-fifth are edge dimmed and the rest are edge brightened. We designate these as CSO 1s and 2s, respectively. This paper focuses almost exclusively on CSO 2s. Using complete samples of CSO 2s we present three independent lines of evidence, based on their relative numbers, redshift distributions, and size distributions, which show conclusively that the vast majority (>99%) of CSO 2s do not evolve into larger-scale radio sources. These CSO 2s belong to a distinct population of jetted AGN, which should be characterized as “short-lived,” as opposed to “young,” compared to the classes of larger jetted AGN. We show that there is a sharp upper cutoff in the CSO 2 size distribution at ≈500 pc. The distinct differences between most CSO 2s and other jetted AGN provides a crucial new time domain window on the formation and evolution of relativistic jets in AGN and the supermassive black holes that drive them.

总结:<br /><br />本文通过 Gemini 行星成像仪对近红外区域的碎片盘进行了观测，并分析了各个碟片的形态，找出了表明受到干扰的不对称现象。研究发现样本中有19个碟片在表面亮度、颜色、几何形状等方面呈现不对称现象，表明在散射光中，受到干扰是普遍的。研究对系统中的行星和碟片间的关系进行了讨论，并发现了恒星温度、年龄、碟片特性和观察到的干扰之间的相关性。此外，还发现了垂直宽高比与恒星温度、碟片径向延伸以及尘埃颗粒大小分布幂律参数 q 之间的显著趋势，以及碟片颜色与恒星有效温度之间的趋势。这些结果对不同光谱类型恒星周围碎片盘系统的演化具有重要的意义。 <div>
The Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) has excelled in imaging debris disks in the near-infrared. The GPI Exoplanet Survey imaged 24 debris disks in polarized H-band light, while other programs observed half of these disks in polarized J and/or K1 bands. Using these data, we present a uniform analysis of the morphology of each disk to find asymmetries suggestive of perturbations, particularly those due to planet–disk interactions. The multiwavelength surface brightness, disk color, and geometry permit the identification of any asymmetries such as warps or disk offsets from the central star. We find that 19 of the disks in this sample exhibit asymmetries in surface brightness, disk color, disk geometry, or a combination of the three, suggesting that for this sample, perturbations, as seen in scattered light, are common. The relationship between these perturbations and potential planets in the system is discussed. We also explore correlations among stellar temperatures, ages, disk properties, and observed perturbations. We find significant trends between the vertical aspect ratio and the stellar temperature, disk radial extent, and the dust grain size distribution power law, q. We also confirm a trend between the disk color and stellar effective temperature, where the disk becomes increasingly red/neutral with increasing temperature. Such results have important implications for the evolution of debris disk systems around stars of various spectral types.

这篇文章通过对X射线探测到的活动星系核（AGNs）的多波段谱能分布（SED）进行系统性分析，涵盖了60个类型1和137个类型2的AGNs，覆盖了2-10keV的光度范围。研究利用了最新的CIGALE代码，包括了含有尘埃极性组分的分析。文章提到了通过Li等人基于Subaru Hyper-Suprime Cam图像的光谱分解得到可靠的类型1 AGNs的宿主和AGN参数。研究发现，X射线探测到的类型1 AGNs样本的黑洞质量（MBH）和恒星质量（Mstellar）的平均比率接近于Li等人报告的SDSS类星体的本地关系。文章还详述了UV到X射线斜率（αOX）或X射线到绝对光度的校正因子（κ2-10）随AGN光度或艾丁顿比的增加而增加的趋势。最后，文章还发现了类型1和类型2 AGNs在相同光度范围内具有类似的宿主恒星质量分布，而类型2的AGNs倾向于显示比类型1的AGNs更小的AGN光度。这支持了明亮度相关（或艾丁顿比相关）的统一方案。 <br /><br />总结: 这篇文章通过对X射线探测到的AGNs进行谱分析，展示了它们的光度、宿主星系和黑洞质量之间的关系，并强调了AGN的明亮度相关性。 <div>
We perform a systematic, multiwavelength spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis of X-ray detected active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at z = 0.2–0.8 with Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) counterparts in the Stripe 82 region, consisting of 60 type 1 and 137 type 2 AGNs covering a 2–10 keV luminosity range of . The latest CIGALE code, where dusty polar components are included, is employed. To obtain reliable host and AGN parameters in type 1 AGNs, we utilize the image-decomposed optical SEDs of host galaxies by Li et al. based on the Subaru Hyper-Suprime Cam images. The mean ratio of black hole masses (MBH) and stellar masses (Mstellar) of our X-ray detected type 1 AGN sample, , is close to the local relation between BH and stellar masses as reported by Li et al. for SDSS quasars. This ratio is slightly lower than that found for more luminous ( ) type 1 AGNs at z ∼ 1.5. This can be explained by the AGN luminosity dependence of , which little evolves with redshift. We confirm the trend that the UV-to-X-ray slope (αOX) or X-ray-to-bolometric correction factor (κ2–10) increases with AGN luminosity or Eddington ratio. We find that type 1 and type 2 AGNs with the same luminosity ranges share similar host stellar mass distributions, whereas type 2s tend to show smaller AGN luminosities than type 1s. This supports the luminosity-dependent (or Eddington-ratio-dependent) unified scheme.

这项研究探讨了X射线侦测的回波映射类星体样本，并应用于比较活跃星系核中两个已建立的关系——X射线/紫外光度（LX–LUV）关系和宽线区半径–光度（R–L）关系所推断的宇宙学约束。研究发现，相同类星体的LX–LUV和R–L的光度距离存在差异的分布通常是不对称的，而且倾向于呈现正偏移。通过解释这种现象可能是由于紫外/X射线类星体发射受尘埃消光的结果。研究还指出，消光始终会对LX–LUV和R–L基于的光度距离之间的差异产生影响，同时得出了X射线/紫外光度色指数与光度距离差异之间的线性关系。对于当前的58个源样本来说，平均的X射线/紫外光度色指数落在mag的范围内。这种消光对LX–LUV关系的影响更为显著，因为紫外和X射线辐射的消光都在起作用。经过标准的硬X射线和远紫外线消光的筛选后，虽然严重消光的源被移除了，但整体上仍然存在正偏移。消光对光度距离的影响在LX–LUV关系中更为显著，因为紫外和X射线辐射的消光都会对其产生影响。 <br /><br />总结: 这项研究比较了X射线/紫外光度关系和宽线区半径–光度关系所推断的宇宙学约束，发现消光对光度距离产生了影响，平均X射线/紫外光度色指数落在mag的范围内，这对大多数类星体都是典型的，可能归因于宿主星系的周核和星际介质。 <div>
In Khadka et al., a sample of X-ray-detected reverberation-mapped quasars was presented and applied for the comparison of cosmological constraints inferred using two well-established relations in active galactic nuclei—the X-ray/UV luminosity (LX–LUV) relation and the broad-line region radius–luminosity (R–L) relation. LX–LUV and R–L luminosity distances to the same quasars exhibit a distribution of their differences that is generally asymmetric and positively shifted for the six cosmological models we consider. We demonstrate that this behavior can be interpreted qualitatively as arising as a result of the dust extinction of UV/X-ray quasar emission. We show that the extinction always contributes to the nonzero difference between LX–LUV-based and R–L-based luminosity distances and we derive a linear relationship between the X-ray/UV color index EX−UV and the luminosity-distance difference, which also depends on the value of the LX–LUV relation slope. Taking into account the median and the peak values of the luminosity-distance difference distributions, the average X-ray/UV color index falls in the range of mag for the current sample of 58 sources. This amount of extinction is typical for the majority of quasars and can be attributed to the circumnuclear and interstellar media of host galaxies. After applying the standard hard X-ray and far-UV extinction cuts, heavily extincted sources are removed but overall the shift toward positive values persists. The effect of extinction on luminosity distances is more pronounced for the LX–LUV relation since the extinction of UV and X-ray emissions both contribute.

We present high-cadence photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2023axu, a classical Type II supernova with an absolute V-band peak magnitude of –17.2 ± 0.1 mag. SN 2023axu was discovered by the Distance Less Than 40 Mpc (DLT40) survey within 1 day of the last nondetection in the nearby galaxy NGC 2283 at 13.7 Mpc. We modeled the early light curve using a recently updated shock cooling model that includes the effects of line blanketing and found the explosion epoch to be MJD 59971.48 ± 0.03 and the probable progenitor to be a red supergiant. The shock cooling model underpredicts the overall UV data, which point to a possible interaction with circumstellar material. This interpretation is further supported by spectral behavior. We see a ledge feature around 4600 Å in the very early spectra (+1.1 and +1.5 days after the explosion), which can be a sign of circumstellar interaction. The signs of circumstellar material are further bolstered by the presence of absorption features blueward of Hα and Hβ at day >40, which is also generally attributed to circumstellar interaction. Our analysis shows the need for high-cadence early photometric and spectroscopic data to decipher the mass-loss history of the progenitor.

<div> 关键词: 二元星, 周期-光度关系, 金属丰度, 颜色指数, 距离测量
总结: <br /><br />这篇文章强调了宇宙中普遍存在的二元星对于测量距离的重要性，尤其是接触双星具有的周期-光度关系可以作为距离标尺。文章提出了基于当前调查的距离测量的周期-光度-金属丰度-颜色关系模型，精度可以达到6%至8%。此外，文章还强调了基于合成光度的距离测量方法。综合来看，文章指出采用红外波段测量的PLZC或PLC关系数据可以更准确地估算距离。 <div>
Binary stars ubiquitous throughout the Universe are important. Contact binaries (CBs) possessing period–luminosity (PL) relations could be adopted as distance tracers. The PL relations of CBs are influenced by metallicity abundance and color index, which are connected to both the radius and luminosity of stars. Here we propose fine relations of the period–luminosity–metallicity–color (PLZC) from the ultraviolet to infrared bands based on current surveys. The accuracy of the distance estimation is 6% and 8%, respectively, depending on the PLZC relations of the CBs in the infrared and optical bands of the collected data. PLZC models are still more accurate than PLC models in determining intrinsic luminosity, notwithstanding their limited improvement. Meanwhile, these relations based on synthetic photometry are also calibrated. On the basis of the synthetic photometry, a 6% accuracy of distance is estimated. The measured or synthetic data of PLZC or PLC relations in infrared bands comes first in the list of suggestions for distance estimations and is followed by the measured data of optical bands.

<title>X-Ray Constraints on the Hot Gaseous Corona of Edge-on Late-type Galaxies in Virgo</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad138a</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad138a</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a systematic study of the putative hot gas corona around late-type galaxies (LTGs) residing in the Virgo cluster, based on archival Chandra observations. Our sample consists of 21 nearly edge-on galaxies representing a range of star formation rate (SFR) of 0.2–3 M⊙ yr−1 and a range of stellar mass (M*) of (0.2–10) × 1010M⊙, the majority of which have not been explored with high-sensitivity X-ray observations so far. Significant extraplanar diffuse X-ray (0.5–2 keV) emission is detected in only three LTGs, which are also the three galaxies with the highest SFR. A stacking analysis is performed for the remaining galaxies without individual detection, dividing the whole sample into two subsets based on SFR, stellar mass, or specific SFR. Only the high-SFR bin yields a significant detection, which has a value of LX ∼ 3 × 1038 erg s−1 per galaxy. The stacked extraplanar X-ray signals of the Virgo LTGs are consistent with the empirical LX–SFR and LX–M* relations found among highly inclined disk galaxies in the field, but appear to be systematically lower than those of a comparison sample of simulated star-forming galaxies in clusters identified from the Illustris-TNG100 simulation. The apparent paucity of hot gas coronae in the sampled Virgo LTGs might be understood as the net outcome of the long-lasting effect of ram pressure stripping exerted by the hot intracluster medium and in-disk star-forming activity acting on shorter timescales. A better understanding of the roles of environmental effects in regulating the hot gas content of cluster galaxies invites sensitive X-ray observations for a large sample of galaxies.

<title>MEGASIM: Distribution and Detection of Earth Trojan Asteroids</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad1396</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Using N-body simulation results from the MEGASIM data set, we present spatial distributions of Earth Trojan Asteroids and assess the detectability of the population in current and next-generation ground-based astronomical surveys. Our high-fidelity Earth Trojan Asteroid (ETA) distribution maps show never-before-seen high-resolution spatial features that evolve over timescales up to 1 Gyr. The simulation was synchronized to start times and timelines of two observational astronomy surveys: (1) the Vera C. Rubin Observatory’s Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and (2) the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). We calculate upper limits for the number of ETAs potentially observable with both the ZTF and LSST surveys. Due to the Yarkovsky Effect, we find no stable ETAs on billion-year timescales likely to be detected by any ETA survey, as no C-type or S-type ETAs (with H < 22 and H < 24, respectively) are likely to be stable on billion-year timescales, and ETAs large enough to remain stable on billion-year timescales are very rare relative to the rest of the ETA population. We find that a twilight ETA survey will not drastically increase the likelihood of individual ETA detection, but it would provide orders of magnitude more observations of select ETA populations. The null detection to date from ZTF restricts the potential ETA population to hundreds of objects larger than 100 m (at H ≈ 22), while a null detection by LSST will further restrict the ETA population to tens of objects larger than 100 m.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the study of four far-ultraviolet (FUV) bright stars in the field of the open cluster NGC 2420 using the Ultra Violet Imaging Telescope mounted on AstroSat. The three stars 525, 527, and 560 are members, while star 646 is a nonmember of the cluster. To characterize and determine the parameters of these stars, multiwavelength spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are analyzed using UV, optical, and IR data sets. For all four FUV bright stars, a two-component SED model fits well. Our findings indicate that two stars, 525 and 560, are binary blue straggler star (BSS) systems. These BSS systems may have formed in a tertiary system due to mass transfer from an evolved outer tertiary companion. Star 527 is a binary system of a BSS and an extremely low-mass (ELM) white dwarf, while star 646 is a binary system of a horizontal branch star and an ELM white dwarf. The effective temperatures, radii, luminosities, and masses of the two ELMs are (10250, 11500) K (0.42, 0.12) R⊙, (1.61, 0.23) L⊙, and (0.186, 0.170) M⊙, respectively. The star 527 could be a post-mass-transfer system and may have originated through the Case A/B mass-transfer process in a low-density environment. The cooling age of the ELMs is < 1 Myr, indicating that they have only recently formed.

<title>Galaxy Clusters from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys. II. Environmental Effects on the Size–Mass Relation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
To investigate the environmental effects on the growth of galaxies, we study the size–mass relation across a broad range of environments with a vast sample of approximately 32 million galaxies at z < 0.5 from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys. This sample is divided into three subsamples representing galaxies within three different environments: brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs), other cluster galaxies, and field galaxies. The BCGs in our large sample are dominated by quiescent galaxies (QGs), while only a minority (∼13%) of BCGs are star-forming galaxies (SFGs). To demonstrate the influence of the environment on size growth, we attempt to observe the difference in size–mass relation for these three subsamples. In general, the slope differences between QGs and SFGs within various environments are significant and tend to be greater at higher redshifts. For the mass-complete subsamples at z < 0.5, BCGs are found to have the highest slope of size–mass relation, and no difference in size–mass relation is found between cluster members and field galaxies. To assess whether the observed slope differences stem from the variations in environment or mass distribution, we construct the mass-matched subsamples for QGs and SFGs. As a result, both QGs and SFGs show negligible differences in the slope of the size–mass relation among the galaxies within three distinct environments, indicating that stellar mass is the most fundamental factor driving the size evolution at z < 0.5, though the mass growth mode for QGs and SFGs may have been affected by galaxy environment.

<title>Determining the Origin of Very-high-energy Gamma Rays from Galactic Sources by Future Neutrino Observations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Recently, the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) identified 12 gamma-ray sources emitting gamma rays with energies above 100 TeV, making them potential PeV cosmic-ray accelerators (PeVatrons). Neutrino observations are crucial in determining whether the gamma-ray radiation process is of hadronic or leptonic origin. In this paper, we study three detected sources, LHAASO J1908+0621, LHAASO J2018+3651, and LHAASO J2032+4102, which are also the most promising Galactic high-energy neutrino candidate sources with the lowest pretrial p-value based on the stacking searches testing for excess neutrino emission by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. We study the lepto-hadronic scenario for the observed multiband spectra of these LHAASO sources considering the possible counterpart source of the LHAASO sources. The very-high-energy gamma rays are entirely attributed to the hadronic contribution; therefore, the most optimistic neutrino flux can be derived. Then, we evaluate the statistical significance (p-value) as a function of the observation time of IceCube and the next-generation IceCube-Gen2 neutrino observatory, respectively. Our results tend to disfavor that all gamma rays above 100 GeV from LHAASO J1908+0621 are of purely hadronic origin based on current IceCube observations, but the purely hadronic origin of gamma rays above 100 TeV is still possible. By IceCube-Gen2, the origin of gamma rays above 100 TeV from LHAASO J1908+0621 can be further determined at a 5σ significance level within a running time of ∼3 yr. For LHAASO J2018+3651 and LHAASO J2032+4102, the required running time of IceCube-Gen2 is ∼10 yr (3σ) and ∼10 yr (5σ), respectively. Future observations by the next-generation neutrino telescope will be crucial to understanding the particle acceleration and radiation processes inside the sources.

AT 2020mot is a typical UV/optical tidal disruption event (TDE) with no radio or X-ray signatures in a quiescent host. We find an i-band excess and rebrightening along the decline of the light curve which could be due to two consecutive dust echoes from the TDE. We model our observations following van Velzen et al. and find that the near-infrared light curve can be explained by concentric rings of thin dust within ∼0.1 pc of a ∼6 × 106 M⊙ supermassive black hole (SMBH), among the smallest scales at which dust has been inferred near SMBHs. We find dust covering factors of order fc ≤ 2%, much lower than found for dusty tori of active galactic nuclei. These results highlight the potential of TDEs for uncovering the environments around black holes when including near-infrared observations in high-cadence transient studies.

Magnetic helicity, H, measures magnetic linkages in a volume. The early theoretical development of helicity focused on magnetically closed systems in bounded by . For magnetically closed systems, , no magnetic flux threads the boundary, . Berger & Field and Finn & Antonsen extended the definition of helicity to relative helicity, , for magnetically open systems where magnetic flux may thread the boundary. Berger expressed this relative helicity as two gauge-invariant terms that describe the self-helicity of the magnetic field that closes inside and the mutual helicity between the magnetic field that threads the boundary and the magnetic field that closes inside . The total magnetic field that permeates entangles magnetic fields that are produced by current sources J in with magnetic fields that are produced by current sources J∗ in . Building on this fact, we extend Berger's expressions for relative magnetic helicity to eight gauge-invariant quantities that simultaneously characterize both of these self and mutual helicities and attribute their origins to currents J in and/or J∗ in , thereby disentangling the domain of origin for these entangled linkages. We arrange these eight terms into novel expressions for internal and external helicity (self) and internal-external helicity (mutual) based on their domain of origin. The implications of these linkages for interpreting magnetic energy are discussed and new boundary observables are proposed for tracking the evolution of the field that threads the boundary.

We present λ13 cm polarization observations of the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 6946 with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) to examine the nearside halo magnetic fields. Despite λ13 cm exhibiting similar two-dimensional morphology as observed at longer (λ18–22 cm) or shorter (λ3 and λ6 cm) wavelengths, more complete frequency coverage will be required to explain the gap in polarization in the southwest quadrant of the galaxy. We fit models of the turbulent and coherent line-of-sight magnetic fields to the fractional degree of linearly polarized emission at λ3, λ6, λ13, λ18, and λ22 cm from observations taken with the WSRT, Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, and Effelsberg telescopes. The results favor a multilayer turbulent magneto-ionized medium consistent with current observations of edge-on galaxies. We constrain the physical properties of the synchrotron-emitting thin and thick disks (scale heights of 300 pc and 1.4 kpc, respectively) along with the thermal thick disk and halo (scale heights of 1 and 5 kpc, respectively). Our preferred model indicates a clumpy and highly turbulent medium within 1 kpc of the midplane, and a diffuse extraplanar layer with a substantially lower degree of Faraday depolarization. In the halo, we estimate a regular magnetic field strength of 0.4–2.2 μG and that turbulence and a total magnetic field strength of ∼6 μG result in a Faraday dispersion of σRM = 4–48 rad m−2. This work is an example of how the advanced capabilities of modern radio telescopes are opening a new frontier for the study of cosmic magnetism.

<div> LIGO/Virgo, compact object mergers, secular eccentricity oscillations, Lidov-Kozai mechanism, relativistic phase space diffusion
总结: LIGO/Virgo探测到的紧凑对象合并给双星演化和合并理论提出了挑战。一种有前途的产生合并的方法是通过由外部扰动器驱动的视向离心率振荡，可能是第三伴星或恒星团潮汐场。然而，简单的理论模型不考虑外部轨道时间尺度上的扰动扭矩的波动，可能加速合并。在通过任意球对称星团势能扰动的测试粒子四极限制中重新考虑了这些短时间尺度波动的影响，特别是包括1pN广义相对论的内部轨道近日点章动。我们发现了一个新效应，相对论相空间扩散（RPSD），它可以在外部轨道时间尺度上将双星跳到一个全新的动力学轨迹上，违反了DA积分守恒的近似。这种效应即使在分级三星系统中也会发生，但直到现在才被揭示出来。 <div>
The LIGO/Virgo detections of compact object mergers have posed a challenge for theories of binary evolution and coalescence. One promising avenue for producing mergers dynamically is through secular eccentricity oscillations driven by an external perturber, be it a tertiary companion (as in the Lidov–Kozai, LK, mechanism) or the tidal field of the stellar cluster in which the binary orbits. The simplest theoretical models of these oscillations use a “doubly averaged” (DA) approximation, averaging both over the binary’s internal Keplerian orbit and its “outer” barycentric orbit relative to the perturber. However, DA theories do not account for fluctuations of the perturbing torque on the outer orbital timescale, which are known to increase a binary’s eccentricity beyond the maximum DA value, potentially accelerating mergers. Here we reconsider the impact of these short-timescale fluctuations in the test-particle quadrupolar limit for binaries perturbed by arbitrary spherical cluster potentials (including LK as a special case), in particular including 1pN general relativistic (GR) apsidal precession of the internal orbit. Focusing on the behavior of the binary orbital elements around peak eccentricity, we discover a new effect, relativistic phase space diffusion (RPSD), in which a binary can jump to a completely new dynamical trajectory on an outer orbital timescale, violating the approximate conservation of DA integrals of motion. RPSD arises from an interplay between secular behavior at extremely high eccentricity, short-timescale fluctuations, and rapid GR precession, and can change the subsequent secular evolution dramatically. This effect occurs even in hierarchical triples, but has not been uncovered until now.

We report results of an in-depth numerical investigation of three-dimensional projection effects that could influence the observed loop-like structures in an optically thin solar corona. Several archetypal emitting geometries are tested, including collections of luminous structures with circular cross sections of fixed and random size, and light-emitting structures with highly anisotropic cross sections, as well as two-dimensional stochastic current density structures generated by fully developed magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. A comprehensive set of statistical signatures is used to compare the line-of-sight (LOS) integrated emission signals predicted by the constructed numerical models with the loop profiles observed by the extreme ultraviolet telescope on board the flight 2.1 of the High-Resolution Coronal Imager (Hi-C). The results suggest that typical cross-sectional emission envelopes of the Hi-C loops are unlikely to have high eccentricity, and that the observed loops cannot be attributed to randomly oriented quasi-two-dimensional emitting structures, some of which would produce anomalously strong optical signatures due to an accidental LOS alignment, as expected in the ''coronal veil“ scenario proposed recently by Malanushenko et al. The possibility of apparent loop-like projections of very small (close to the resolution limit) or very large (comparable with the size of an active region) light-emitting sheets remains open, but the intermediate range of scales commonly associated with observed loop systems is most likely filled with true quasi-one-dimensional (roughly axisymmetric) structures embedded into the three-dimensional coronal volume.

总结:
研究发现在离银河系附近形成的矮星系倾向于在其暗物质的质量下拥有更高的恒星质量，比较孤立的矮星系在高密度环境中也倾向于生长更快，更早地形成恒星。观测预测表明这些趋势表现在更孤立的矮星系中具有更低的停止形成恒星速率，更高的氢原子分数和更蓝的颜色。整体而言，这项研究将有助于我们更好地了解局部星系群中形成的矮星系在不同环境中的演化过程。 <div>
We are entering an era in which we will be able to detect and characterize hundreds of dwarf galaxies within the Local Volume. It is already known that a strong dichotomy exists in the gas content and star formation properties of field dwarf galaxies versus satellite dwarfs of larger galaxies. In this work, we study the more subtle differences that may be detectable in galaxies as a function of distance from a massive galaxy, such as the Milky Way. We compare smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations of dwarf galaxies formed in a Local Volume-like environment (several megaparsecs away from a massive galaxy) to those formed nearer to Milky Way–mass halos. We find that the impact of environment on dwarf galaxies extends even beyond the immediate region surrounding Milky Way–mass halos. Even before being accreted as satellites, dwarf galaxies near a Milky Way–mass halo tend to have higher stellar masses for their halo mass than more isolated galaxies. Dwarf galaxies in high-density environments also tend to grow faster and form their stars earlier. We show observational predictions that demonstrate how these trends manifest in lower quenching rates, higher H i fractions, and bluer colors for more isolated dwarf galaxies.

本文使用Lyα吸收轮廓来探测星际气体泡和太阳圈层对氢墙和太阳尾的吸收。通过比较具有长“彗星状”尾巴和短“新月饼状”尾巴的蝶形模型的模拟和观测Lyα吸收轮廓，可以探索太阳圈层内和附近的中性氢。两个模型对于鼻部目标（比如半人马α星和36蛇夫座）的Lyα轮廓几乎相同。然而，向尾部目标（HD 35296）观察到了Lyα轮廓的差异。虽然新月饼模型减少了太阳尾长度，但仍然观察到了明显的顺风太阳风吸收，只比彗星模型浅了5%，速度偏移了4 km/s。这意味着不需要扩展的尾巴模型来复现太阳圈层的Lyα吸收观察。更精细的观测光栅可以解决这一速度偏移。此外，当使用较高的星际介质（ISM）中性和等离子体密度以及较低的磁场（∣BLISM∣ = 3.2 μG, αBV ≈ 40°）时，发现与观测到的Lyα轮廓更好的一致性。没有一个模型能同时在所有方向上达成一致。此外，我们发现在对星际介质条件最不确定的情况下（np,LISM, nH,LISM, TLISM, BLISM），BLISM对氢墙结构和Lyα轮廓的影响最显著。<br /><br />总结: 本文利用Lyα吸收轮廓研究了太阳圈层的结构，并发现新月饼和彗星状的尾部模型对于大部分方向上的Lyα轮廓具有相似的效果，但在某些方向上存在差异。研究表明，不需要扩展的尾部模型来复现太阳圈层的观测结果，并且较高的星际介质密度和较低的磁场可以更好地模拟观测所得的Lyα轮廓。此外，本研究强调了磁场对氢墙结构和Lyα轮廓的重要影响。 <div>
Lyα absorption profiles have been used to detect astrospheres and heliospheric absorption from the hydrogen wall and heliotail. Using magnetohydrodynamic models of the heliosphere, we can compare simulated to observed Lyα profiles to probe the neutral hydrogen within and near the heliosphere. There is an ongoing controversy whether the heliosphere has a long “comet-like” tail or a short “croissant-like” tail. Here we present the first Lyα absorption investigation using a croissant-like heliosphere. With identical boundary conditions we compare the BU model, which presents a croissant-like tail, and the Moscow model, which presents a comet-like tail. The BU and Moscow models present nearly identical Lyα profiles toward nose targets (α Cen and 36 Oph). Differences in Lyα profiles are shown toward the tail target (HD 35296). Despite the shortened heliotail of the croissant model, significant downwind heliosheath absorption is seen, just 5% shallower and shifted by 4 km s−1. This implies that an extended tail model is not required to reproduce the heliosheath Lyα absorption observations. Finer observation gratings may be able to resolve this shift. Additionally, when using higher interstellar medium (ISM) neutral and plasma densities and lower magnetic field (∣BLISM∣ = 3.2 μG, αBV ≈ 40°) than in the Moscow model, we find better agreement with observed Lyα profiles. None of the models presented show agreement in all directions simultaneously. Furthermore, we show that for the ISM conditions with the least certainty (np,LISM, nH,LISM, TLISM, BLISM), BLISM has the most significant effect on the structure of the hydrogen wall and Lyα profiles.

<br />总结:<br />本研究对银河系的两个超微弱矮星系Eri IV和Cen I进行了光谱分析。通过使用IMACS/Magellan光谱仪，确定了Eri IV和Cen I的成员星数量，并测量了它们的速度、金属丰度和其他属性。研究发现Eri IV是目前已知的金属含量最低的星系之一，并且具有略微右偏的金属丰度分布。Cen I的金属丰度较低，且金属丰度分布较宽。研究还探讨了这两个星系的固有运动、轨道和宇宙物理J因子，结果表明Eri IV在间接探测暗物质方面具有很好的潜力。研究还指出没有发现Cen I或Eri IV受潮汐剥离的明显证据。综合来说，本研究的测量确认了Eri IV和Cen I是以暗物质为主导的星系，并且具有与其他已知超微弱矮星系相一致的属性。Eri IV的低金属丰度、右偏金属丰度分布和高J因子使其成为进一步研究的特别有趣的候选星系。 <div>
We present a spectroscopic analysis of Eridanus IV (Eri IV) and Centaurus I (Cen I), two ultrafaint dwarf galaxies of the Milky Way. Using IMACS/Magellan spectroscopy, we identify 28 member stars of Eri IV and 34 member stars of Cen I. For Eri IV, we measure a systemic velocity of , and velocity dispersion . Additionally, we measure the metallicities of 16 member stars of Eri IV. We find a metallicity of , and resolve a dispersion of σ[Fe/H]=0.20 ± 0.09. The mean metallicity is marginally lower than all other known ultrafaint dwarf galaxies, making it one of the most metal-poor galaxies discovered thus far. Eri IV also has a somewhat unusual right-skewed metallicity distribution. For Cen I, we find a velocity vsys = 44.9 ± 0.8 km s−1, and velocity dispersion . We measure the metallicities of 27 member stars of Cen I, and find a mean metallicity [Fe/H] = −2.57 ± 0.08, and metallicity dispersion . We calculate the systemic proper motion, orbit, and the astrophysical J-factor for each system, the latter of which indicates that Eri IV is a good target for indirect dark matter detection. We also find no strong evidence for tidal stripping of Cen I or Eri IV. Overall, our measurements confirm that Eri IV and Cen I are dark-matter-dominated galaxies with properties largely consistent with other known ultrafaint dwarf galaxies. The low metallicity, right-skewed metallicity distribution, and high J-factor make Eri IV an especially interesting candidate for further follow-up.

Binary and dual active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are an important observational tool for studying the formation and dynamical evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes. An entirely new method for identifying possible AGN pairs makes use of the exquisite positional accuracy of Gaia to detect astrometrically variable quasars, in tandem with the high spatial resolution of the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). We present a new pilot study of radio observations of 18 quasars (0.8 ≤ z ≤ 2.9), selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR16Q and matched with the Gaia DR3. All 18 targets are identified by their excess astrometric noise in Gaia. We targeted these 18 quasars with the VLA at 2–4 GHz (S band) and 8–12 GHz (X band), providing resolutions of 0.″65 and 0.″2, respectively, in order to constrain the origin of this variability. We combine these data with ancillary radio survey data and perform radio spectral modeling. The new observations are used to constrain the driver of the excess astrometric noise. We find that ∼44% of the target sample is likely to be either candidate dual AGN or gravitationally lensed quasars. Ultimately, we use this new strategy to help identify and understand this sample of astrometrically variable quasars, demonstrating the potential of this method for systematically identifying kiloparsec-scale dual quasars.

In this study we present a novel Monte Carlo code, referred to as GNC, which enables the investigation of dynamical relaxation in clusters comprising multiple mass components in the vicinity of supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies. Our method is based on two-dimensional Fokker–Planck equations in the energy and angular momentum space, and allows the evolution of multiple mass components, including stars and compact objects. The code demonstrates remarkable flexibility in incorporating additional complex dynamics. By employing a weighting method, we effectively enhance the statistical accuracy of rare particle results. In this initial publication, we present the fundamental version of our method, focusing on two-body relaxations and loss cone effects. Through comparisons with previous studies, we establish consistent outcomes in terms of relaxation processes, energy and angular momentum distributions, density profiles, and loss cone consumption rates. We consistently observe the development of tangential anisotropy within the cluster, while the outer regions tend to retain near-isotropic characteristics. GNC holds great promise for exploring a wide range of intriguing phenomena within galactic nuclei, including relativistic stellar dynamics, providing detailed and insightful outcomes.

总结:
本文报告了2012年7月5日21:42的耀斑事件SOL2012-07-05T21:42，观察到在一个太阳黑子的日珥-斑晕边界出现了约3分钟周期的增强振荡现象，这一振荡在色球和日冕通道中均有观察到。在耀斑前后观察到频率的变化，耀斑前存在大约200秒的可变边日辐射，而耀斑后在相同位置观察到了180秒的加强振荡。不同通道观察到的相位差异表明了从高温到低温通道的振荡。在理论上，频率变化与磁场倾角和色球温度的变化密切相关。通过对该区域性质的分析发现，频率变化是由于磁场倾角轻微减小相对于局部垂直所导致的。此外，我们推测增强的3分钟振荡与额外的加热有关，可能是由于耀斑的极紫外晚期阶段的向下流造成的。 <div>
Three-minute oscillations are a common phenomenon in the solar chromosphere above a sunspot. Oscillations can be affected by the energy release process related to solar flares. In this paper, we report on an enhanced oscillation in flare event SOL2012-07-05T21:42 with a period of around 3 minutes that occurred at the location of a flare ribbon at a sunspot umbral–penumbral boundary and was observed in both chromospheric and coronal passbands. An analysis of this oscillation was carried out using simultaneous ground-based observations from the Goode Solar Telescope at the Big Bear Solar Observatory and space-based observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory. A frequency shift was observed before and after the flare, with the running penumbral wave that was present with a period of about 200 s before the flare coexisting with a strengthened oscillation with a period of 180 s at the same locations after the flare. We also found a phase difference between different passbands, with the oscillation occurring from high-temperature to low-temperature passbands. Theoretically, the change in frequency was strongly dependent on the variation of the inclination of the magnetic field and the chromospheric temperature. Following an analysis of the properties of the region, we found the frequency change was caused by a slight decrease of the magnetic inclination angle with respect to the local vertical. In addition, we suggest that the enhanced 3 minute oscillation was related to the additional heating, maybe due to the downflow, during the EUV late phase of the flare.

We present the first results from Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observations as a part of the Fundamental Reference Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) Monitoring Experiment, a program to understand the relationship between AGN accretion physics and wavelength-dependent position as a function of time. With this VLA survey, we investigate the radio properties from a volume-complete sample of 25 hard X-ray-selected AGNs using the VLA in its wideband mode. We observed the targets in the A-array configuration at 4–12 GHz with all polarization products. In this work, we introduce our calibration and imaging methods for this survey, and we present our results and analysis for the radio-quiet AGN NGC 4388. We calibrated and imaged these data using the multiterm, multifrequency synthesis imaging algorithm to determine its spatial, spectral, and polarization structure across a continuous 4–12 GHz band. In the AGN, we measure a broken power law spectrum with α = − 0.06 below a break frequency of 7.3 GHz and α = − 0.34 above. We detect polarization at subarcsecond resolution across both the AGN and a secondary radio knot. We compare our results to ancillary data and find that the VLA radio continuum is likely due to AGN winds interacting with the local interstellar medium that gets resolved away at subparsec spatial scales as probed by the Very Long Baseline Array. A well-known ionization cone to the southwest of the AGN appears likely to be projected material onto the underside of the disk of the host galaxy.

<title>Ring Gap Structure around Class I Protostar WL 17</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
WL 17 is a Class I object and was considered to have a ring–hole structure. We analyzed the structure around WL 17 to investigate the detailed properties of this object. We used Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array archival data, which have a higher angular resolution than previous observations. We investigated the WL 17 system with the 1.3 mm dust continuum and 12CO and C18O (J = 2–1) line emissions. The dust continuum emission showed a clear ring structure with inner and outer edges of ∼11 and ∼21 au, respectively. In addition, we detected an inner disk of <5 au radius enclosing the central star within the ring, the first observation of this structure. Thus, WL 17 has a ring–gap structure, not a ring–hole structure. We did not detect any marked emission in either the gap or inner disk, indicating that there is no sign of a planet, circumplanetary disk, or binary companion. We identified the source of both blueshifted and redshifted outflows based on the 12CO emission, which is clearly associated with the disk around WL 17. The outflow mass ejection rate is ∼3.6 × 10−7M⊙ yr−1 and the dynamical timescale is as short as ∼104 yr. The C18O emission showed that an inhomogeneous infalling envelope, which can induce episodic mass accretion, is distributed in the region within ∼1000 au from the central protostar. With these new findings, we can constrain the scenarios of planet formation and dust growth in the accretion phase of star formation.

<title>A Comparative Study between M30 and M92: M92 is a Merger Remnant with a Large Helium Enhancement</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We perform a comparative study of the ex situ second-parameter pair globular clusters (GCs) M30 and M92, having similar metallicities but different horizontal branch morphologies. We obtain similar mean primordial carbon abundances for both clusters. However, M92 shows a large dispersion in carbon due to a more extended C–N anticorrelation, while M30 exhibits a higher primordial nitrogen abundance, suggesting that they have different chemical enrichment histories. Our new results confirm our previous result that M92 is a metal-complex GC showing a bimodal metallicity distribution. We also find that the metal-rich group of stars in M92 shows a helium enhancement as large as ΔY ∼ 0.05 from the red giant branch bump V magnitudes, which can also be supported by (i) a lack of bright red giant branch stars, (ii) synthetic evolutionary horizontal branch population models and (iii) the more extended spatial distribution due to different degree of the diffusion process from their lower masses. We reinterpret the [Eu/Fe] measurements by others, finding that the two metallicity groups of stars in M92 have significantly different [Eu/Fe] abundances with small scatters. This strongly suggests that they formed independently out of well-mixed interstellar media in different environments. We suggest that M92 is a more complex system than a normal GC, most likely a merger remnant of two GCs or an even more complex system. In the Appendix, we address the problems with the recently developed color–temperature relations and the usage of broadband photometry in the populational taggings.

<title>An ALMA Spectroscopic Survey of the Brightest Submillimeter Galaxies in the SCUBA-2-COSMOS Field (AS2COSPEC): Physical Properties of z = 2–5 Ultra- and Hyperluminous Infrared Galaxies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report the physical properties of the 18 brightest (S870 μm = 12.4–19.2 mJy) and not strongly lensed 870 μm–selected dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs), also known as submillimeter galaxies (SMGs), in the COSMOS field. This sample is part of an ALMA band 3 spectroscopic survey (AS2COSPEC), and spectroscopic redshifts are measured in 17 of them at z = 2–5. We perform spectral energy distribution analyses and deduce a median total infrared luminosity of LIR = (1.3 ± 0.1) × 1013L⊙, infrared-based star formation rate (SFR) of SFRIR = 1390 ± 150 M⊙ yr−1, stellar mass of M* = (1.4 ± 0.6) × 1011M⊙, dust mass of Mdust = (3.7 ± 0.5) × 109M⊙, and molecular gas mass of Mgas = (αCO/0.8)(1.2 ± 0.1) × 1011M⊙, suggesting that they are one of the most massive, ISM-enriched, and actively star-forming systems at z = 2–5. In addition, compared to less massive and less active galaxies at similar epochs, SMGs have comparable gas fractions; however, they have a much shorter depletion time, possibly caused by more active dynamical interactions. We determine a median dust emissivity index of β = 2.1 ± 0.1 for our sample, and by combining our results with those from other DSFG samples, we find no correlation of β with redshift or infrared luminosity, indicating similar dust grain compositions across cosmic time for infrared luminous galaxies. We also find that AS2COSPEC SMGs have one of the highest dust-to-stellar mass ratios, with a median of 0.02 ± 0.01, significantly higher than model predictions, possibly due to too-strong active galactic nucleus feedback implemented in the model. Finally, our complete and uniform survey enables us to put constraints on the most massive end of the dust and molecular gas mass functions.

<title>Disentangling Multiple Emitting Components in Molecular Observations with Nonnegative Matrix Factorization</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Molecular emission from the galactic and extragalactic interstellar medium (ISM) is often used to determine the physical conditions of the dense gas. However, even from spatially resolved regions, the observed molecules do not necessarily arise from a single component. Disentangling multiple gas components is often a degenerate problem in radiative transfer studies. In this paper, we investigate the use of the nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) approach as a means to recover gas components from a set of blended line intensity maps of molecular transitions that may trace different physical conditions. We run a series of experiments on synthetic data sets designed to replicate conditions in two very different environments: galactic pre-stellar cores and the ISM in high-redshift galaxies. We find that the NMF algorithm often recovers the multiple components resembling those used in the data-generating process, provided that the different components have similar column densities. When NMF fails to recover all the individual components it does however group together the most similarly emitting ones. We further found that initialization and regularisation are key factors in the efficiency of the NMF algorithm.

The High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) started observing the extremely powerful long-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB) GRB 221009A starting 53 hr after the triggering event. The H.E.S.S. collaboration carried out observations on 2022 October 11, 12, and 17 under poor atmospheric conditions, without detecting significant very-high-energy photons from the source and computed the upper limits of the fluxes for the different nights. We study these flux upper limits by using the photohadronic model and show that the interaction of high-energy protons with synchrotron seed photons in the forward-shock region of the GRB jet exhibits behavior compatible with the upper limits computed by the H.E.S.S. collaboration.

The two-point correlation function (2PCF) is a powerful statistical tool to measure galaxy clustering. Although 2PCF has also been used to study the clustering of stars on subparsec to kiloparsec scales, its physical implication is not clear. In this study, we use the Illustris-TNG50 simulation to study the connection between the 2PCF of accreted halo stars and the assembly histories of Milky Way-mass galaxies. We find, in general, that the 2PCF signal increases with the increase in galactocentric radii, r, and with the decrease in the pair separations. Galaxies that assemble late on average have stronger 2PCF signals. With z1/4, z1/2, and z3/4 defined as the redshifts when galaxies accreted one-fourth, half, and three-fourths of their ex situ stellar mass today, we find they all show the strongest correlations with the 2PCF signals at r < ∼ 0.2R200. z3/4 shows the strongest correlations than those of z1/4 or z1/2. However, the correlations have large scatters. The 2PCFs in the velocity space show weaker correlations with the galaxy formation times within ∼0.35R200 than real-space 2PCFs, and the scatter is considerably large. Both the real- and velocity-space 2PCFs correlate with the assembly histories of the host dark matter halos as well. Within 0.3R200, the real-space 2PCF shows stronger correlations with the galaxy formation histories than with the halo formation histories. We conclude that it is difficult to use 2PCF alone to precisely predict the formation times or assembly histories of galaxies.

<div> 关键词: 黑洞旋转, 磁化极盘, 伽马射线暴, 赤道维度, 質量增加率
总结:<br /><br />这篇论文研究了新形成的黑洞在质量增加和角动量抽取的影响下，旋转的演化过程。通过磁化极盘模型的应用，发现黑洞如果吸积初始质量的20%，维度旋转将不可避免地达到小值a ≲ 0.2。在这种旋转下，研究人员发现该模型能够复制典型伽马射线暴喷流的能量和功率。推测出延迟的磁化极盘启动可以产生高功率的喷流，但最终旋转仍然会保持在较低水平。这些结果与通过引力波探测得出的二元黑洞合并产生的黑洞旋转低的结论一致。在另一篇论文中，观测伽马射线暴的结果被用来限制了新生黑洞的旋转为a ≃ 0.2。 <div>
The spin of a newly formed black hole (BH) at the center of a massive star evolves from its natal value due to two competing processes: accretion of gas angular momentum that increases the spin and extraction of BH angular momentum by outflows that decreases the spin. Ultimately, the final, equilibrium spin is set by a balance between both processes. In order for the BH to launch relativistic jets and power a γ-ray burst (GRB), the BH magnetic field needs to be dynamically important. Thus, we consider the case of a magnetically arrested disk (MAD) driving the spin evolution of the BH. By applying the semianalytic MAD BH spin evolution model of Lowell et al. to collapsars, we show that if the BH accretes ∼20% of its initial mass, its dimensionless spin inevitably reaches small values, a ≲ 0.2. For such spins, and for mass accretion rates inferred from collapsar simulations, we show that our semianalytic model reproduces the energetics of typical GRB jets, Ljet ∼ 1050 erg s−1. We show that our semianalytic model reproduces the nearly constant power of typical GRB jets. If the MAD onset is delayed, this allows powerful jets at the high end of the GRB luminosity distribution, Ljet ∼ 1052 erg s−1, but the final spin remains low, a ≲ 0.3. These results are consistent with the low spins inferred from gravitational wave detections of binary BH mergers. In a companion paper by Gottlieb et al., we use GRB observations to constrain the natal BH spin to be a ≃ 0.2.

The abundance of bright galaxies at z > 8 can provide key constraints on models of galaxy formation and evolution, as the predicted abundance varies greatly when different physical prescriptions for gas cooling and star formation are implemented. We present the results of a search for bright z ∼ 9–10 galaxies selected from pure parallel Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging programs. We include 132 fields observed as part of the Brightest of Reionizing Galaxies survey, the Hubble Infrared Pure Parallel Imaging Extragalactic Survey, and the WFC3 Infrared Spectroscopic Parallel survey. These observations cover a total of 620 arcmin2, about 70% of which is also covered with Spitzer Space Telescope infrared imaging. We identify 13 candidate galaxies in the range 8.3 < z < 11 with 24.5 < mH < 26.5 (−22.9 < MUV < −21.2), 11 of which constitute new discoveries. This sample capitalizes on the uncorrelated nature of pure parallel observations to overcome cosmic variance and leverages a full multiwavelength selection process to minimize contamination without sacrificing completeness. We perform detailed completeness and contamination analyses, and present measurements of the bright end of the UV luminosity function using a pseudobinning technique. We find a number density consistent with results from Finkelstein et al. and other searches in HST parallel fields. These bright candidates likely reside in overdensities, potentially representing some of the earliest sites of cosmic reionization. These new candidates are excellent targets for follow up with JWST, and four of them will be observed with the NIRSpec prism in Cycle 1.

<div> AGNs, ionized outflows, energy transfer, radiation force, SED
<br /><br />总结:
本文研究了活动星系核（AGN）的电离射流，发现能量和动量从AGN辐射传递到等离子体。辐射非常能量强劲，在距离等离子体较远的帕塞克尺度上能够导致流出。但在更靠近黑洞的地方，重力主导热能，气体处于所谓的“冷”状态，只有磁场或辐射力才能导致流出。研究表明，温度小于4×105K时，线辐射变得低效。同时，热驱动也开始与线驱动相当。此外，通过流体模拟，还说明了流出特性在从线驱动到热驱动的转变中的变化，以及它们对流出参数和SED的依赖。 <div>
Observations of ionized outflows from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) provide evidence of energy and momentum transfer from the AGN radiation to the plasma. The AGN radiation is very energetic. Therefore, at distances of parsec scale, where gravity is relatively weak, energy transfer alone can lead to outflow. Much closer to the black hole, gravity dominates thermal energy and the gas is in the so-called “cold” regime. Only magnetic or radiation forces can lead to outflow. However, it is unclear when the radiation force is efficient in overcoming gravity because of its dependence on the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the radiation and opacity. In this work, we survey the parameter space of radiation forces due to spectral lines resulting from blackbody SEDs with temperatures ranging from ∼104 to 106 K. The objective was to identify the radiation temperature above which line driving becomes inefficient. We find that the temperature ≲4 × 105 K marks such a transition. We also self-consistently calculate heating and cooling balance to estimate gas temperature and identify the transition where thermal driving becomes comparable to line driving. We summarize hydrodynamical simulations of radial outflows to illustrate how wind properties change during the transition from line to thermal driving and their dependence on outflow parameters and SED.

总结: 研究使用深度窄带成像技术观测了近邻螺旋星系M101，得出了其全面星际物质的恒星年龄信息。研究表明，M101存在辐射状恒星年龄梯度，同时在相对不受干扰的主盘区域发现了恒星年龄随螺旋臂距离的增加而逐渐变老的现象，这与动力学理论中大尺度冲击场景相符合。更出人意料的是，在外盘区域也发现了类似的模式，这超出了主要螺旋模式的共转半径范围。研究人员提出M101可能存在着动态或瞬变的螺旋模式，这些模式通过模式耦合形成了连贯的螺旋结构。这一情景将内向星系形成的辐射年龄梯度与动态螺旋臂理论中预测的跨臂年龄梯度结合起来，对整个星系的发展过程起到了一定的解释作用。<br /><br /> <div>
Using deep, narrowband imaging of the nearby spiral galaxy M101, we present stellar age information across the full extent of the disk of M101. Our narrowband filters measure age-sensitive absorption features such as the Balmer lines and the slope of the continuum between the Balmer break and 4000 Å break. We interpret these features in the context of inside-out galaxy formation theories and dynamical models of spiral structure. We confirm the galaxy’s radial age gradient, with the mean stellar age decreasing with radius. In the relatively undisturbed main disk, we find that stellar ages get progressively older with distance across a spiral arm, consistent with the large-scale shock scenario in a quasi-steady spiral wave pattern. Unexpectedly, we find the same pattern across spiral arms in the outer disk as well, beyond the corotation radius of the main spiral pattern. We suggest that M101 has a dynamic, or transient, spiral pattern with multiple pattern speeds joined together via mode coupling to form coherent spiral structure. This scenario connects the radial age gradient inherent to inside-out galaxy formation with the across-arm age gradients predicted by dynamic spiral arm theories across the full radial extent of the galaxy.

这项研究利用直接数值模拟，研究了稳定层流体中剪切不稳定性的非线性饱和，发现在所研究的参数范围内，垂直平均剪切对于控制产生的湍流动力学没有影响，除非其理查逊数小于1。由于大多数恒星辐射区的理查逊数远大于1，这意味着在恒星演化计算中，垂直剪切可以忽略不计，即使它比水平剪切要大得多。这对于剪切不稳定性相关的垂直混合系数的计算具有重要意义，特别是在太阳流层盾层中。 <br /><br />总结: <br />剪切不稳定性在恒星辐射区可以产生大量湍流混合，本研究通过数值模拟发现垂直剪切在控制湍流动力学方面作用不大，对于恒星演化计算中的垂直混合系数的计算具有重要意义。 <div>
Shear instabilities can be the source of significant amounts of turbulent mixing in stellar radiative zones. Past attempts at modeling their effects (either theoretically or using numerical simulations) have focused on idealized geometries, where the shear is either purely vertical or purely horizontal. In stars, however, the shear can have arbitrary directions with respect to gravity. In this work, we use direct numerical simulations to investigate the nonlinear saturation of shear instabilities in a stably stratified fluid, where the shear is sinusoidal in the horizontal direction and either constant or sinusoidal in the vertical direction. We find that in the parameter regime studied here (nondiffusive, fully turbulent flow), the mean vertical shear does not play any role in controlling the dynamics of the resulting turbulence, unless its Richardson number is smaller than 1 (approximately). As most stellar radiative regions have a Richardson number much greater than 1, our result implies that the vertical shear can essentially be ignored in the computation of the vertical mixing coefficient associated with shear instabilities for the purpose of stellar evolution calculations, even when it is much larger than the horizontal shear (as in the solar tachocline, for instance).

<div> Seyfert 1 galaxy, Mrk 817, accretion disk temperature fluctuations, intrinsic variability, detrending AGN lightcurves <br />
<br />总结:
这篇文章研究了赛弗特1星系Mrk 817的紫外/光学光变曲线，产生了时间和半径分辨的黑洞吸积盘温度波动的地图。研究发现，温度波动主要受缓慢移动的径向结构控制，这与盘面变化仅由回响驱动的观念相冲突，而更可能是由盘面本身的变异引起的。作者测试了对输入光变曲线进行平滑和减法处理对结果温度地图的影响，发现多数温度波动存在较长时间尺度（数百天）。文章还探讨了如何通过去趋势化AGN光变曲线来区分由缓慢移动的温度波动和回响引起的流量变化。研究还模拟了盘面连续发射的可能受到宽线区（BLR）连续发射的污染，结果显示只有大约20%的U波段和u波段可变流量可以归因于BLR的污染。最后，研究者讨论了这些地图不仅描述了数据，还可以对AGN变异的其他方面进行预测。 <div>
We fit the UV/optical lightcurves of the Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk 817 to produce maps of the accretion disk temperature fluctuations δT resolved in time and radius. The δT maps are dominated by coherent radial structures that move slowly (v ≪ c) inward and outward, which conflicts with the idea that disk variability is driven only by reverberation. Instead, these slow-moving temperature fluctuations are likely due to variability intrinsic to the disk. We test how modifying the input lightcurves by smoothing and subtracting them changes the resulting δT maps and find that most of the temperature fluctuations exist over relatively long timescales (hundreds of days). We show how detrending active galactic nucleus (AGN) lightcurves can be used to separate the flux variations driven by the slow-moving temperature fluctuations from those driven by reverberation. We also simulate contamination of the continuum emission from the disk by continuum emission from the broad-line region (BLR), which is expected to have spectral features localized in wavelength, such as the Balmer break contaminating the U band. We find that a disk with a smooth temperature profile cannot produce a signal localized in wavelength and that any BLR contamination should appear as residuals in our model lightcurves. Given the observed residuals, we estimate that only ∼20% of the variable flux in the U and u lightcurves can be due to BLR contamination. Finally, we discus how these maps not only describe the data but can make predictions about other aspects of AGN variability.

<br />总结:<br />本研究利用 MaNGA 的最终数据发布版进行了对本地宇宙中后爆发星系（PSB）的大小-质量关系（SMR）和近期恒星形成历史（SFH）的研究。研究包括489个PSB星系，其中94个中心PSB区域的cPSB星系，85个环状PSB区域的rPSB星系，以及310个不规则PSB区域的iPSB星系。与类似星形成率、红移和质量的对照星系相比，所有类型的PSB样本都显示出类似的SMR，除了中心PSB星系cPSB具有中等质量处较小的尺寸。在星形成序列（iPSB-SF）中的iPSB星系显示出Dn（4000）、EW（HδA）和EW（Hα）无/弱梯度，与该类型星系的全局星形成状态一致；而寂静的iPSB（iPSB-Q）样本显示出Dn（4000）负梯度和EW（HδA）正梯度，表明内部区域具有年龄更老的恒星群。而cPSB和rPSB样本则显示出Dn（4000）正梯度和EW（HδA）负梯度，表明内部区域具有年轻的恒星群。这些结果表明，四种类型的PSB星系可以在演化路径上大致分为两类：（1）iPSB-SF和iPSB-Q，其SMR和SFH与对照星系相似，倾向于内部向外熄灭过程；（2）rPSB和cPSB，这两种类型可能是同一事件的不同阶段，并且可能是由于融合等瓦解事件所驱动的外向内熄灭过程，随着熄灭的进行，结构更加紧凑。 <div>
We study the size–mass relation (SMR) and recent star formation history (SFH) of post-starburst (PSB) galaxies in the local Universe using spatially resolved spectroscopy from the final data release of MaNGA. Our sample includes 489 PSB galaxies: 94 cPSB galaxies with central PSB regions, 85 rPSB galaxies with ringlike PSB regions, and 310 iPSB galaxies with irregular PSB regions. When compared to control galaxies of similar star formation rate, redshift, and mass, a similar SMR is found for all types of PSB samples except the cPSB galaxies, which have smaller sizes at intermediate masses ( ). The iPSB galaxies in the star-forming sequence (iPSB-SF) show no/weak gradients in Dn(4000), EW(HδA), and EW(Hα), consistent with the global star-forming status of this type of galaxy, while the quiescent iPSB (iPSB-Q) sample shows negative gradients in Dn(4000) and positive gradients in EW(HδA), indicating older stellar populations in the inner regions. Both the cPSB and rPSB samples show positive gradients in Dn(4000) and negative gradients in EW(HδA), indicating younger stellar populations in the inner regions. These results imply that the four types of PSB galaxies can be broadly divided into two distinct categories in terms of evolutionary pathway: (1) iPSB-SF and iPSB-Q, which have SMRs and SFHs similar to control galaxies, preferring an inside-out quenching process, and (2) rPSB and cPSB, which appear to be different stages of the same event and likely to follow the outside-in quenching process driven by disruption events such as mergers that result in a more compact structure as quenching proceeds.

总结:
太阳大规模耀斑和物质抛射的理解需要对整个系统的演变进行详细的研究，包括包围源区的磁环境以及事件发生前的先兆活动的搜索。通过结合来自太阳动力学观测卫星（SDO）和STEREO-B太空船的立体观测，我们能够观察到2011年10月1日NOAA活跃区（AR）11305发生的一个丝状物质抛射、M1.2级爆发性耀斑和日冕物质抛射（CME）前几个小时的情况。我们发现在被抛射的丝状物质的东南方有两次明显的先兆性日冕变暗。在爆发期间，CME以相当大的速度向变暗区域迅速蔓延。我们利用SDO/Helioseismic和磁场观测仪（HMI）数据重建了系统的磁环境，并发现在变暗区域附近存在一个零点。活跃区11305与附近的AR 11302和11306以及其他衰减活跃区的联系十分复杂。先兆性的变暗伴随着环向上升的回环和朝零点方向的东南运动，以及朝远离的方向的东北和西南运动。这些运动和变暗与零点处持续的磁重连一致，因此在上升和东南移动时清除了AR 11305上方的拉紧磁场。最终，丝状物质以爆炸方式向零点抛射。我们得出结论，太阳耀斑的断裂模型对此事件提供了令人信服的解释。此外，我们推测先兆性的变暗可能比目前认识的要频繁得多。 <div>
Understanding large-scale solar eruptions requires detailed investigation of the entire system’s evolution, including the magnetic environment enveloping the source region and searches for precursor activity prior to event onset. We combine stereoscopic observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and STEREO-B spacecraft for several hours before a filament ejection, M1.2-class eruptive flare, and coronal mass ejection (CME) originating in NOAA active region (AR) 11305 on 2011 October 1. Two episodes of significant preeruption coronal dimming that occurred well to the southeast of the ejected filament are identified. The CME subsequently took off with a substantial component of velocity toward the dimming, which became very pronounced during eruption. We used SDO/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) data to reconstruct the magnetic environment of the system and found that it contains a null point near the dimming region. AR 11305 had quite complex connections to nearby ARs 11302 and 11306, as well as to other regions of decayed AR flux. The intensifying and spatially expanding precursor dimming was accompanied by southeastward rising motions of loops toward the null point and northeastward and southwestward motions of loops retracting away. These motions and the dimming are consistent with persistent magnetic reconnection occurring at the null point as it moved upward and southeastward, thereby removing a strapping magnetic field high above AR 11305. Eventually, the filament was ejected explosively toward the null point. We conclude that the breakout model for solar eruptions provides a compelling account of this event. Furthermore, we conjecture that preeruption dimmings may be much more frequent than currently recognized.

We show that massive, young star clusters may be possible candidates that can accelerate Galactic cosmic rays (CRs) in the range of 107–109 GeV (between the “knee” and “ankle”). Various plausible scenarios, such as acceleration at the wind termination shock and supernova shocks inside these young star clusters, have been proposed, since it is difficult to accelerate particles up to the 107–109 GeV range in the standard paradigm of CR acceleration in supernova remnants. We consider a model for the production of different nuclei in CRs from massive stellar winds using the observed distribution of young star clusters in the Galactic plane. We present a detailed calculation of CR transport in the Galaxy, taking into account the effect of diffusion, interaction losses during propagation, and particle reacceleration by old supernova remnants to determine the all-particle CR spectrum. Using the maximum energy estimate from the Hillas criterion, we argue that a young, massive star cluster can accelerate protons up to a few tens of PeV. Upon comparison with the observed data, our model requires a CR source spectrum with an exponential cutoff of 5 × 107Z GeV (50 Z PeV) from these clusters, together with a CR injection fraction of ∼5% of the wind kinetic energy. We discuss the possibility of achieving these requirements in star clusters, as well as the associated uncertainties, in the context of considering star clusters as the natural accelerator of the “second component” of Galactic CRs.

<div> 长周期，无线电发射，中子星，白矮星，磁场
总结:<br /><br />最近发现了两个无线电发射源，周期分别为18分钟和21分钟。它们的明亮无线电发射类似于无线电磁体，但其长周期和在其他波长上的检测缺乏挑战了中子星的解释。相反，长旋转周期在白矮星中很常见，但尽管有预测，从孤立的磁性白矮星中未曾明确观测到偶极无线电发射。研究人员对这些长周期对象进行了调查，作为孤立中子星或白矮星的偶极无线电发射源，并发现两种情况都对我们对通过对偶极磁层中的对产生无线电发射的理解构成重大挑战。他们进行了基于两种图像中的偶极自旋衰减的群体合成模拟，假设不同的初始周期分布、质量、半径、束流分数和磁场预测，以评估超长脉冲星数量对其影响。在中子星场景中，根据任何物理上合理的（甚至是极端的）周期演化假设，我们不指望有大量超长周期脉冲星存在。另一方面，在白矮星情景中，我们可以轻松容纳大量长周期无线电发射源。然而，无法轻松解释这两种场景中产生如此明亮的相干无线电发射的机制。 <div>
The nature of two recently discovered radio emitters with unusually long periods of 18 minutes (GLEAM-X J1627–52) and 21 minutes (GPM J1839–10) is highly debated. Their bright radio emission resembles that of radio magnetars, but their long periodicities and lack of detection at other wavelengths challenge the neutron star (NS) interpretation. In contrast, long rotational periods are common in white dwarfs (WDs) but, although predicted, dipolar radio emission from isolated magnetic WDs has never been unambiguously observed. In this work, we investigate these long-period objects as potential isolated NS or WD dipolar radio emitters and find that both scenarios pose significant challenges to our understanding of radio emission via pair production in dipolar magnetospheres. We also perform population-synthesis simulations based on dipolar spin-down in both pictures, assuming different initial-period distributions, masses, radii, beaming fractions, and magnetic field prescriptions, to assess their impact on the ultra-long pulsar population. In the NS scenario, we do not expect a large number of ultra-long-period pulsars under any physically motivated (or even extreme) assumptions for the period evolution. On the other hand, in the WD scenario, we can easily accommodate a large population of long-period radio emitters. However, no mechanism can easily explain the production of such bright coherent radio emission in either scenarios.

We report the discovery of the energy-dependent morphology of the GeV gamma-ray emission from HESS J1857+026 with more than 13 yr of Fermi Large Area Telescope data. The GeV gamma-ray emission from this region is composed of two extended components. The hard component with an index of 1.74 ± 0.07 in the energy range of 0.5–500 GeV is spatially coincident with HESS J1857+026, and its 68% containment radius varies from ∼0.°44 below 40 GeV to ∼0.°30 above 140 GeV. The hard GeV gamma-ray spectrum and the energy-dependent morphology of HESS J1857+026 make it favor a pulsar wind nebula origin, which is associated with the energetic pulsar PSR J1856+0245. The soft component with an index of 2.70 ± 0.16 and another extended gamma-ray source detected in this region, 4FGL J1857.9+0313e, with an index of 2.55 ± 0.07, are spatially coincident with two molecular clumps in the northeast and southwest of HESS J1857+026, which favors the hadronic process, and the protons could be accelerated by the hypothetical supernova remnant associated with PSR J1856+0245.

<title>A New Population of Mid-infrared-selected Tidal Disruption Events: Implications for Tidal Disruption Event Rates and Host Galaxy Properties</title>

Most tidal disruption events (TDEs) are currently found in time-domain optical and soft X-ray surveys, both of which are prone to significant obscuration. The infrared (IR), however, is a powerful probe of dust-enshrouded environments; hence, we recently performed a systematic search of NEOWISE mid-IR data for nearby, obscured TDEs within roughly 200 Mpc. We identified 18 TDE candidates in galactic nuclei, using difference imaging to uncover nuclear variability among significant host galaxy emission. These candidates were selected based on the following IR light-curve properties: (1) LW2 ≳ 1042 erg s−1 at peak; (2) fast rise, followed by a slow, monotonic decline; (3) no significant prior variability; and (4) no evidence for active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity in Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) colors. The majority of these sources showed no variable optical counterpart, suggesting that optical surveys indeed miss numerous obscured TDEs. Using narrow-line ionization levels and variability arguments, we identified six sources as possible underlying AGN, yielding a total of 12 TDEs in our gold sample. This gold sample yields a lower limit on the IR-selected TDE rate of (2.0 ± 0.3) × 10−5 galaxy−1 yr−1 ((1.3 ± 0.2) × 10−7 Mpc−3 yr−1), which is comparable to optical and X-ray TDE rates. The IR-selected TDE host galaxies do not show a green valley overdensity nor as a preference for quiescent, Balmer strong galaxies, which are both overrepresented in optical and X-ray TDE samples. This IR-selected sample represents a new population of dusty TDEs that have historically been missed by optical and X-ray surveys and helps alleviate tensions between observed and theoretical TDE rates and the so-called missing energy problem.

这篇文章介绍了一种新的方法，通过分析H i 21厘米线发射的亮度温度谱和其傅立叶变换来空间映射冷中性介质的质量分数下限。这一方法不需要吸收线数据，可以单独利用21厘米发射线数据提取H i 气体的综合性质，并分别映射每个相位。研究使用玩具模型阐明了在傅立叶变换中所看到的干涉图案的起源。通过对热双稳湍流的数值模拟进行测试，证明了该方法得出的冷气体质量分数下限与模拟的“真实”冷气体质量分数呈强线性相关。在NH I≳3–5×1020 cm−2时，与吸收调查的比较显示了类似的行为, 这一方法还揭示了DRAO深空领域的冷丝状结构以及HI4PI调查的全天图。这一新方法具有能够单独提取冷气体质量分数下限并适用于大量发射线数据的特点，计算时间和内存占用较低，并为新一代射电干涉仪提供了新的途径。 
<br /><br />总结: <br />新方法通过分析H i 21厘米线发射的亮度温度谱和其傅立叶变换来空间映射冷中性介质的质量分数下限。这一方法不需要吸收线数据，可以单独利用21厘米发射线数据提取H i 气体的综合性质，并分别映射每个相位。测试验证了方法的有效性，此外，新方法具有提高信噪比、简化数据处理流程等优点，适用于日益增多的射电干涉仪数据处理需求。 <div>
We develop a new method for spatially mapping a lower limit on the mass fraction of the cold neutral medium by analyzing the amplitude structure of , the Fourier transform of Tb(v), the spectrum of the brightness temperature of the H i 21 cm line emission with respect to the radial velocity v. This advances a broader effort exploiting 21 cm emission line data alone (without absorption line data, τ) to extract integrated properties of the multiphase structure of the H i gas and to map each phase separately. Using toy models, we illustrate the origin of interference patterns seen in . Building on this, a lower limit on the cold gas mass fraction is obtained from the amplitude of at high kv. Tested on a numerical simulation of thermally bi-stable turbulence, the lower limit from this method has a strong linear correlation with the “true” cold gas mass fraction from the simulation for a relatively low cold gas mass fraction. At a higher mass fraction, our lower limit is lower than the “true” value, because of a combination of interference and opacity effects. Comparison with absorption surveys shows a similar behavior, with a departure from linear correlation at NH I ≳ 3–5 × 1020 cm−2. Application to the DRAO Deep Field from DHIGLS reveals a complex network of cold filaments in the Spider, an important structural property of the thermal condensation of the H i gas. Application to the HI4PI survey in the velocity range −90 < v < 90 km s−1 produces a full sky map of a lower limit on the mass fraction of the cold neutral medium at 16.′2 resolution. Our new method has the ability to extract a lower limit on the cold gas mass fraction for massive amounts of emission line data alone with low computing time and memory, pointing the way to new approaches suitable for the new generation of radio interferometers.

<div> GNIRS, atmosphere model, C/O ratio, T dwarf, near-infrared spectra
<br /><br />总结:
本文扩展了ATMO 2020大气模型网格，以包括非太阳金属丰度和T矮星区的C/O比率。通过改变碳或氧元素丰度，发现这些元素的非太阳丰度可以基于H和K波段的形状来区分。通过比较这些新模型与三个基准晚期T矮星（GJ 570D、HD 3651B和Ross 458C）的Gemini近红外光谱仪（GNIRS）近红外（0.8–2.4 μm）中分辨率（R ≈ 1700）的光谱，发现在近红外光谱中存在模型-数据差异。排除了模型对分辨率的分子吸收表的假设的不足。最后，发现Ross 458C的GNIRS、SpeX和其他近红外光谱之间存在偏差，表明存在潜在的光谱变化。 <div>
Measurements of the C/O ratio in brown dwarfs are lacking, in part due to past models adopting solar C/O only. We have expanded the ATMO 2020 atmosphere model grid to include nonsolar metallicities and C/O ratios in the T dwarf regime. We change the C/O ratio by altering either the carbon or oxygen elemental abundances, and we find that nonsolar abundances of these elements can be distinguished based on the shapes of the H and K bands. We compare these new models with medium-resolution (R ≈ 1700), near-infrared (0.8–2.4 μm) Gemini Near-Infrared Spectrograph (GNIRS) spectra of three benchmark late-T dwarfs, GJ 570D, HD 3651B, and Ross 458C. We find solar C/O ratios and best-fitting parameters (Teff, , Z) broadly consistent with other analyses in the literature based on low-resolution (R ∼ 100) data. The model-data discrepancies in the near-infrared spectra are consistent across all three objects. These discrepancies are alleviated when fitting the Y, J, H, and K bands individually, but the resulting best-fit parameters are inconsistent and disagree with the results from the full spectrum. By examining the model atmosphere properties we find this is due to the interplay of gravity and metallicity on H2–H2 collisionally induced absorption. We therefore conclude that there are no significant issues with the molecular opacity tables used in the models at this spectral resolution. Instead, deficiencies are more likely to lie in the model assumptions regarding the thermal structures. Finally, we find a discrepancy between the GNIRS, SpeX, and other near-infrared spectra in the literature of Ross 458C, indicating potential spectroscopic variability.

<div> 关键词: 宇宙学红移调查, 高斯过程模拟器, 星系聚集统计, 暗物质, 宇宙加速膨胀<br />
总结:<br />这项研究利用宇宙N体模拟中的星系红移调查数据，构建了星系聚集统计的高斯过程模拟器，以约束宇宙学和星系偏置参数。除了标准统计学之外，还模拟了包括有关局部环境信息的统计学，这扩展了Aemulus III对红移空间畸变的模型。该研究发现，超越标准统计学的额外统计学可以显著提高对感兴趣的宇宙学参数的约束能力。此外，研究还发现小尺度（约6 h^-1 Mpc以下）包含与大尺度同样多的信息，密度敏感的统计学对约束占有分布参数和灵活的环境相关组装偏差模型也做出了贡献。这一分析证明了在小尺度模拟超越标准聚类统计学的潜力，以约束结构的增长作为对宇宙加速膨胀的检验。 <div>
There is untapped cosmological information in galaxy redshift surveys in the nonlinear regime. In this work, we use the Aemulus suite of cosmological N-body simulations to construct Gaussian process emulators of galaxy clustering statistics at small scales (0.1–50 h−1 Mpc) in order to constrain cosmological and galaxy bias parameters. In addition to standard statistics—the projected correlation function wp(rp), the redshift-space monopole of the correlation function ξ0(s), and the quadrupole ξ2(s)—we emulate statistics that include information about the local environment, namely the underdensity probability function PU(s) and the density-marked correlation function M(s). This extends the model of Aemulus III for redshift-space distortions by including new statistics sensitive to galaxy assembly bias. In recovery tests, we find that the beyond-standard statistics significantly increase the constraining power on cosmological parameters of interest: including PU(s) and M(s) improves the precision of our constraints on Ωm by 27%, σ8 by 19%, and the growth of structure parameter, fσ8, by 12% compared to standard statistics. We additionally find that scales below ∼6 h−1 Mpc contain as much information as larger scales. The density-sensitive statistics also contribute to constraining halo occupation distribution parameters and a flexible environment-dependent assembly bias model, which is important for extracting the small-scale cosmological information as well as understanding the galaxy–halo connection. This analysis demonstrates the potential of emulating beyond-standard clustering statistics at small scales to constrain the growth of structure as a test of cosmic acceleration.

The disk of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) is widely regarded as a prominent formation channel of binary black hole (BBH) mergers that can be detected through gravitational waves (GWs). Besides, the presence of dense environmental gas offers the potential for an embedded BBH merger to produce electromagnetic (EM) counterparts. In this paper, we investigate EM emission powered by the kicked remnant of a BBH merger occurring within the AGN disk. The remnant BH will launch a jet via the accretion of a magnetized medium as it traverses the disk. The resulting jet will decelerate and dissipate energy into a lateral cocoon as it propagates. We explore three radiation mechanisms of the jet–cocoon system—jet breakout emission, disk cocoon cooling emission, and jet cocoon cooling emission—and find that the jet cocoon cooling emission is likely to be detected in its own frequency bands. We predict a soft X-ray transient, lasting for O(103) s, to serve as an EM counterpart, of which the time delay O(10) days after the GW trigger contributes to follow-up observations. Consequently, BBH mergers in the AGN disk represent a novel multimessenger source. In the future, enhanced precision in measuring and localizing GWs, coupled with diligent searches for such associated EM signals, will effectively validate or restrict the origin of BBH mergers in the AGN disk.

<div> 关键词: GDXE, X射线源, 光谱拟合, 超新星遗迹, Sgr A*<br />
总结: 
本文研究了银河系扩散X射线辐射的光谱特性以及可能的起源。研究发现，GDXE的X射线光谱主要由紧凑X射线源和扩散X射线源组成。在对GCXE、GRXE和GBXE的光谱拟合中发现了额外的数据超量，经过分析发现这些超量可能来自碰撞电离平衡等离子体。通过添加碰撞电离平衡超新星遗迹的假设，改善了GRXE和GBXE的光谱拟合情况。然而，GCXE的光谱仍然不可接受，进一步的分析显示额外的数据超量可能来自辐合等离子体超新星遗迹。最后，研究提出了一种将所有紧凑X射线源和扩散X射线源结合起来的光谱拟合方法，可以定量和全面地预测GDXE光谱的起源。这为我们深入理解银河系X射线辐射的起源提供了新的解释。 <div>
Galactic diffuse X-ray emission (GDXE) can be spatially segmented into Galactic center X-ray emission (GCXE), Galactic ridge X-ray emission (GRXE), and Galactic bulge X-ray emission (GBXE). The X-ray spectra of GDXE are expressed by the assembly of compact X-ray sources, which are either white dwarfs (WDs) or X-ray active stars consisting of binaries with late-type stars. WDs have either a strong magnetic field or a weak magnetic field. WDs and X-ray active stars are collectively called compact X-ray stars. However, spectral fittings by the assembly of all compact X-ray stars for GCXE, GRXE, and GBXE are rejected, leaving significant excess near the energies of the Kα, Heα, and Lyα lines. These excesses are found in the collisional ionization equilibrium (CIE) plasma. Thus, the spectra of GRXE and GBXE are improved by adding CIE supernova remnants (SNRs). However, the GCXE spectrum is still unacceptable, with significant data excess due to radiative recombination emission (recombining plasma (RP)). The GCXE fit is then significantly improved by adding aged RP-SNRs. Aged RP-SNRs are made by a past big flare of Sgr A* emitting either hard X-rays or low-energy cosmic rays. The big flares may excite Fe and Ni atoms in cold diffuse gas (cold matter (CM)) and emit fluorescent X-ray lines. The CIE-SNRs, RP-SNRs, and CM are called diffuse X-ray sources. This paper presents the spectral fits by the assembly of all the compact and diffuse X-ray sources together with high-quality spectra and a combined fit among all the GDXE of GCXE, GRXE, and GBXE. This provides the first scenario to quantitatively and comprehensively predict the origin of the GDXE spectra.

总结:
本文研究了高银纬处的星际尘埃对天文背景减除、产生弥散散射光以及软化类星体的紫外光谱的影响。作者使用氢柱密度（H i和H2）和远红外（FIR）估计的尘埃红化来评估星际“气尘比”NH/E(B − V)，发现在银河平面这一比值为6.0 ± 0.2（以1021 cm−2 mag−1为单位）。研究发现在低红化视线中，最近的Planck对E(B − V)的估计比Schlafly & Finkbeiner高12%，同时NH I在不同的射电望远镜测量时存在显著变化。在对51个测量了H i和H2的类星体进行研究后，发现使用Planck E(B − V)数据得到的平均比值为10.3 ± 0.4（所有速度的气体）和9.2 ± 0.3（仅低速气体）。高银纬处的H2分数普遍很小（平均为2%–3%），但在39个∣b∣ ≥ 40°的视线中有9个具有1%–17%的fH2。由于FIR推断的E(B − V)对模拟尘埃温度Td和发射指数β很敏感，在低E(B − V)时，气尘比具有大的、不对称的误差。研究发现在具有高速云的视线中，气尘比升高，而高速气体贡献了NH但几乎没有红化。在Complex C中，当排除高速气体时，比值下降了40%。作者预期在银河平面上方的低金属气体中将会观察到尘埃含量的减少，这是因为在冲击中颗粒被破坏，沉降到盘面，以及在热晕气体中的热喷发。 <div>
Interstellar dust at high Galactic latitudes can influence astronomical foreground subtraction, produce diffuse scattered light, and soften the UV spectra of quasars. In a sample of 94 sight lines toward quasars at high latitude and low extinction, we evaluate the interstellar “gas-to-dust ratio” NH/E(B − V), using hydrogen column densities (H i and H2) and far-IR (FIR) estimates of dust reddening. In the Galactic plane, this ratio is 6.0 ± 0.2 (in units of 1021 cm−2 mag−1). On average, recent Planck estimates of E(B − V) in low-reddening sight lines are 12% higher than those from Schlafly & Finkbeiner, and NH I exhibits significant variations when measured at different radio telescopes. In a sample of 51 quasars with measurements of both H i and H2 and 0.01 ≤ E(B − V) ≲ 0.1, we find mean ratios 10.3 ± 0.4 (gas at all velocities) and 9.2 ± 0.3 (low-velocity only) using Planck E(B − V) data. High-latitude H2 fractions are generally small (2%–3% on average), although nine of 39 sight lines at ∣b∣ ≥ 40° have fH2 of 1%–17%. Because FIR-inferred E(B − V) is sensitive to modeled dust temperature Td and emissivity index β, gas-to-dust ratios have large, asymmetric errors at low E(B − V). The ratios are elevated in sight lines with high-velocity clouds, which contribute NH but little reddening. In Complex C, the ratio decreases by 40% when high-velocity gas is excluded. Decreases in dust content are expected in low-metallicity gas above the Galactic plane, resulting from grain destruction in shocks, settling to the disk, and thermal sputtering in hot halo gas.

总结:<br /><br />这项研究对具有三个或更多行星参与平均运动共振的外行星系统进行了全面探索。他们发现许多行星具有高倾角状态，可能在潮汐耗散的影响下保持稳定。通过两个观察到的系统的案例研究，他们展示了这些高倾角状态可能是在最初的盘驱动轨道迁移阶段获得的。此外，他们发现TRAPPIST-1行星很可能具有零倾角状态。这些结果突出显示了共振链的轨道和自转状态对行星形成和演化早期阶段的重要性。 <div>
About a dozen exoplanetary systems have been discovered with three or more planets participating in a sequence of mean-motion resonances. The unique and complex architectures of these so-called “resonant chains” motivate efforts to characterize their planets holistically. In this work, we perform a comprehensive exploration of the spin-axis dynamics of planets in resonant chains. Planetary spin states are closely linked with atmospheric dynamics and habitability and are thus especially relevant to resonant chains like TRAPPIST-1, which hosts several temperate planets. Considering a set of observed resonant chains, we calculate the equilibrium states of the planetary axial tilts (“obliquities”). We show that high-obliquity states exist for ∼60% of planets in our sample, and many of these states can be stable in the presence of tidal dissipation. Using case studies of two observed systems (Kepler-223 and TOI-1136), we demonstrate how these high-obliquity states could have been attained during the initial epoch of disk-driven orbital migration that established the resonant orbital architectures. We show that the TRAPPIST-1 planets most likely have zero obliquities, with the possible exception of planet d. Overall, our results highlight that both the orbital and spin states of resonant chains are valuable relics of the early stages of planet formation and evolution.

Common envelope evolution (CEE) is vital for forming short-orbital-period compact binaries. It covers many objects, such as double compact merging binaries, Type Ia supernovae progenitors, binary pulsars, and X-ray binaries. Knowledge of the common envelope (CE) ejection efficiency still needs to be improved, though progress has been made recently. Short-orbital-period hot subdwarf B star (sdB) plus white dwarf (WD) binaries are the most straightforward samples with which to constrain CEE physics. We apply the known orbital period–WD mass relation to constrain the sdB progenitors of seven sdB+WD binaries with a known inclination angle. The average CE efficiency parameter is 0.32. This is consistent with previous studies. However, the CE efficiency need not be constant, but a function of the initial mass ratio, based on well-constrained sdB progenitor mass and evolutionary stage. Our results can be used as physical inputs for binary population synthesis simulations of related objects. A similar method can also be applied to study other short-orbital-period WD binaries.

The coalescence of binary neutron stars can yield the expulsion of a fast-moving, quasi-isotropic material, which may induce thermal radiation and give rise to kilonova emission. Moreover, the interaction between the ejected material and the surrounding environment generates an external shock, which can result in a long-lasting radio signal that persists for several decades following the merger. In contrast to supernova ejecta, the kilonova ejecta exhibits a relatively lesser mass and higher velocity, and its expansion may ultimately result in the ejecta density becoming so low that the medium particles can freely pass through the ejecta. It would thereby lead to a kind of incomplete sweeping on the interstellar medium. Employing a toy model, our investigation reveals that such incomplete sweeping may considerably diminish the late-time radio radiation power, irrespective of whether the binary neutron star merger results in the formation of a black hole or a neutron star. Our findings thus imply that the previously reported radio upper limits for certain short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) may not necessarily place stringent constraints on the presence of a long-lived magnetar remnant in these short GRBs.

<title>Flashlights: Properties of Highly Magnified Images Near Cluster Critical Curves in the Presence of Dark Matter Subhalos</title>

<div> 关键词: 暗物质子暗, 重子暗物质子, 星团, 引力透镜, 星像放大

总结:<br /><br />本文研究了暗物质子暗的影响以及与更为研究的星和黑洞引力透镜现象相比较。研究发现，星团密度梯度和子暗物质子的分布对图像特性起着重要作用，导致在集群的正负奇偶性两侧出现不对称的图像特性。此外，子暗物质子的镜像特征可以在距离巨大集群的临界曲线1″的范围内找到，此外，子暗物质子还会在集群的正奇偶性一侧造成大于0.1等星等的像素级流量变化，并且这些像素往往聚集在（否则看不见的）子暗物质子周围。 <div>
Dark matter subhalos with extended profiles and density cores, and globular star clusters of mass 106–108M⊙ that live near the critical curves in galaxy cluster lenses can potentially be detected through their lensing magnification of stars in background galaxies. In this work, we study the effect such subhalos have on lensed images, and compare to the case of more well-studied microlensing by stars and black holes near critical curves. We find that the cluster density gradient and the extended mass distribution of subhalos are important in determining image properties. Both lead to an asymmetry between the image properties on the positive- and negative-parity sides of the cluster that is more pronounced than in the case of microlensing. For example, on the negative-parity side, subhalos with cores larger than about 50 pc do not generate any images with magnification above ∼100 outside of the immediate vicinity of the cluster critical curve. We discuss these factors using analytical and numerical analysis, and exploit them to identify observable signatures of subhalos: Subhalos create pixel-to-pixel flux variations of ≳0.1 mag on the positive-parity side of clusters. These pixels tend to cluster around (otherwise invisible) subhalos. Unlike in the case of microlensing, signatures of subhalo lensing can be found up to 1″ away from the critical curves of massive clusters.

<div> 关键词: 太阳耀斑，日冕物质抛射，地磁风暴，磁场演化，磁通绳

总结:
太阳活跃区13283在2023年4月21日发生了一次日冕物质抛射，引发了强烈的地磁风暴。研究显示，演化的磁场积聚了螺旋度，同时，辐合和抵消的磁场通量导致了螺旋度注入的改变，导致磁通绳的不稳定性和进一步的喷发。研究进一步表明，日冕物质抛射的形态显示磁通绳顶部出现了高达56°的顺时针旋转。这次日冕物质抛射的分析表明，日冕物质在喷发过程中的旋转是导致强烈地磁风暴的关键因素。通过多仪器、多波长观测和磁场观测，我们能够更好地理解太阳活动对地球的影响。 <br /><br /> <div>
Using multi-instrument and multiwavelength observations, we studied a coronal mass ejection (CME) that led to an intense geomagnetic storm on 2023 April 23. The eruption occurred on April 21 in solar active region (AR) 13283 near the disk center. The AR was in its decay stage, with fragmented polarities and a preexisting long filament channel a few days before the eruption. The study of the magnetic field evolution suggests that the flux rope (filament) was built up by monotonous helicity accumulation over several days, and furthermore, converging and canceling fluxes led to a change in helicity injection, resulting in an unstable nature of the magnetic flux rope (MFR) and its further eruption. Importantly, the CME morphology revealed that the MFR apex underwent a rotation of up to 56° in clockwise direction owing to its positive helicity. The CME decelerates in the field of view (FOV) of the Large Angle Spectrometric Coronagraph and has a plane-of-sky velocity of 1226 km s−1 at 20 R⊙. In the FOV of the Heliospheric Imager, the lateral expansion of the CME is tracked better than the earthward motion. This implies that the arrival time is difficult to assess. The in situ arrival of the interplanetary CME shock was at 07:30 UT on April 23, and a geomagnetic storm commenced at 08:30 UT. The flux rope fitting to the in situ magnetic field observations reveals that the magnetic cloud flux rope orientation is consistent with its near-Sun orientation, which has a strong negative Bz-component. The analysis of this study indicates that the near-Sun rotation of the filament during its eruption to the CME is the key to the negative Bz-component and consequently the intense geomagnetic storm.

The theoretical oscillation frequencies of even the best asteroseismic models of solar-like oscillators show significant differences from observed oscillation frequencies. Structure inversions seek to use these frequency differences to infer the underlying differences in stellar structure. While used extensively to study the Sun, structure inversion results for other stars have so far been limited. Applying sound speed inversions to more stars allows us to probe stellar theory over a larger range of conditions, as well as look for overall patterns that may hint at deficits in our current understanding. To that end, we present structure inversion results for 12 main-sequence solar-type stars with masses between 1 and 1.15 M⊙. Our inversions are able to infer differences in the isothermal sound speed in the innermost 30% by radius of our target stars. In half of our target stars, the structure of our best-fit model fully agrees with the observations. In the remainder, the inversions reveal significant differences between the sound speed profile of the star and that of the model. We find five stars where the sound speed in the core of our stellar models is too low and one star showing the opposite behavior. For the two stars in which our inversions reveal the most significant differences, we examine whether changing the microphysics of our models improves them and find that changes to nuclear reaction rates or core opacities can reduce, but do not fully resolve, the differences.

<title>Fluid Mixing during Phase Separation in Crystallizing White Dwarfs</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad16dc</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Accurate models of cooling white dwarfs must treat the energy released as their cores crystallize. This phase transition slows the cooling by releasing latent heat and also gravitational energy, which results from phase separation: liquid C is released from the solid C/O core, driving an outward carbon flux. The Gaia color–magnitude diagram provides striking confirmation of this theory by revealing a mass-dependent overdensity of white dwarfs, indicating slowed cooling at the expected location. However, the observed overdensity is enhanced relative to the models. Additionally, it is associated with increased magnetism, suggesting a link between crystallization and magnetic field generation. Recent works aimed at explaining an enhanced cooling delay and magnetic field generation employ a uniform mixing prescription that assumes large-scale turbulent motions; we show here that these calculations are not self-consistent. We also show that thermohaline mixing is most likely efficient enough to provide the required chemical redistribution during C/O phase separation, and that the resulting velocities and mixing lengths are much smaller than previous estimates. These reduced fluid motions cannot generate measurable magnetic fields, suggesting any link with crystallization needs to invoke a separate mechanism. Finally, this mixing alters the chemical profiles, which in turn affects the frequencies of the pulsation modes.

<title>The Long-term Spin-down Trend of Ultraluminous X-Ray Pulsar M82 X-2</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The discovery in 2014 of the pulsation from the ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) M82 X-2 has changed our view of ULXs. Because of the relatively short baseline over which pulsations have been detected so far, M82 X-2's spin state had been assumed to be in an equilibrium state. Using Chandra and XMM-Newton archive data, we are able to investigate the pulsation of M82 X-2 back to 2005 and 2001. The newly determined spin frequencies clearly show a long-term spin-down trend. If this trend is caused by magnetic threading, we infer a dipolar magnetic field of ∼1.2 × 1013 G and that a mild beaming factor (∼4) is needed to match the braking torque with the mass accretion torque. On the other hand, there are NuSTAR observations showing instantaneous spin-down behaviors, which might favor a variable prograde/retrograde flow scenario for M82 X-2.

<title>Accessing the Host Galaxies of Long Gamma-Ray Bursts with Next-generation Telescopes</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a method to estimate the detection expectations of host galaxies of long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) in the grizJHKL bands. It is found that given the same limiting magnitude in each band, the z band produces the largest number of overall LGRB hosts and low-mass hosts (M* ≤ 108M⊙) at mag. For the detection of high-redshift LGRB hosts (redshift ≥5), it is recommended to prioritize the L band, due to its good performance at both low and high limiting magnitudes. We specifically estimate the expectation of LGRB host detection with mag, which the James Webb Space Telescope can partially attain. We find that there may exist 116, 259, 277, 439, 266, 294, 274, and 316 LGRB hosts, including 0.54, 31, 28, 143, 12, 20, 14, and 35 low-mass ones in the grizJHKL bands and 13, 14, 15, 14, and 15 high-redshift ones in the zJHKL bands, for 15 yr Swift LGRBs with S ≥ 10−6 erg cm−2. The results show that the study of LGRB hosts under next-generation observational conditions holds significant potential, especially for low-mass host studies. However, it appears that the deeper sensitivities of galaxy telescopes may not significantly enhance statistical studies of high-redshift hosts. Strategies aimed at increasing the number of distant LGRB hosts may require the expansion of high-redshift LGRB detections.

We present a JWST mid-infrared (MIR) spectrum of the underluminous Type Ia Supernova (SN Ia) 2022xkq, obtained with the medium-resolution spectrometer on the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) ∼130 days post-explosion. We identify the first MIR lines beyond 14 μm in SN Ia observations. We find features unique to underluminous SNe Ia, including the following: isolated emission of stable Ni, strong blends of [Ti ii], and large ratios of singly ionized to doubly ionized species in both [Ar] and [Co]. Comparisons to normal-luminosity SNe Ia spectra at similar phases show a tentative trend between the width of the [Co iii] 11.888 μm feature and the SN light-curve shape. Using non-LTE-multi-dimensional radiation hydro simulations and the observed electron capture elements, we constrain the mass of the exploding WD. The best-fitting model shows that SN 2022xkq is consistent with an off-center delayed-detonation explosion of a near-Chandrasekhar mass WD ( ≈1.37 M⊙) of high central density (ρc ≥ 2.0 × 109 g cm−3) seen equator-on, which produced M(56Ni) =0.324 M⊙ and M(58Ni) ≥0.06 M⊙. The observed line widths are consistent with the overall abundance distribution; and the narrow stable Ni lines indicate little to no mixing in the central regions, favoring central ignition of subsonic carbon burning followed by an off-center deflagration-to-detonation transition beginning at a single point. Additional observations may further constrain the physics revealing the presence of additional species including Cr and Mn. Our work demonstrates the power of using the full coverage of MIRI in combination with detailed modeling to elucidate the physics of SNe Ia at a level not previously possible.

这篇文章讨论了在低质量星系中发现的活动星系核（AGNs）可能在扑灭星形成中扮演的作用。研究使用斯隆数字化天空巡天IV的调查数据，发现低质量星系中有41个AGNs。研究还发现，低质量星系中的AGNs更可能是孤立的或位于低质量星系群中。这表明环境不是这些星系扑灭星形成的主要原因。然而，我们不能排除过去的合并可能。总结: 本研究使用SDSS数据发现了低质量星系中的AGNs并提出了环境不是扑灭星形成的主要原因的可能性。 <div>
The discovery of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in low-mass (M* ≤ 5 × 109 M⊙) galaxies has pushed forward the idea that AGN feedback may play a role in quenching star formation in the low-mass regime. In order to test whether AGNs can be a dominant quenching mechanism, we must first disentangle the effects of internal and external processes caused by a galaxy’s environment. We have used the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory survey to produce resolved Baldwin, Phillips, & Terlevich diagrams, and we find 41 AGNs (∼1.3%) in low-mass galaxies. We have studied the group richness (the number of group members) of our AGN and non-AGN samples as a proxy for determining the possible effect of the environment on the gas reservoir in these galaxies. We find that low-mass galaxies hosting AGNs are more likely to be found in isolation or in low-mass groups than galaxies in the non-AGN samples. This preference is even more clear when we split our samples into star-forming and quiescent subsamples. This suggests that environment is not the main cause of quenching in these galaxies, though we cannot rule out the possibility of past mergers.

<div> 关键词: Cassini RADAR, 泰坦卫星, 季节演变, 效应温度, 甲烷水文

总结:<br />
本研究利用卡西尼雷达记录的数据研究了泰坦卫星北极的两个区域，在整个任务结束时，发现尽管夏季到来，但Ligeia Mare的效应温度几乎下降了1K，而固体区域的温度则缓慢上升至2017年增加了1.4±0.3 K。这些观察可以通过春分后泰坦表面和海洋的蒸发冷却来解释。利用海洋环流模型，研究表明海面的冷却应该会引发海洋内部的对流，最终冷却整个被卡西尼辐射计感知的液柱，因此使得即使在蒸发期过去很久之后，深处的温度也会下降。总的来说，这项工作突显了甲烷水文在控制泰坦北极地区表面和水下温度中的关键作用。 <div>
From 2004 to 2017, the Cassini RADAR recorded the 2.2 cm thermal emission from Titan’s surface in its passive (radiometry) mode of operation. We use this data set to investigate the seasonal evolution of the effective temperature sensed by the microwave radiometer in two regions in the northern pole of the satellite: the sea Ligeia Mare, and its nearby solid terrains. We find that despite the arrival of summer at the end of the mission, the effective temperature of Ligeia Mare decreased by almost 1 K, while that of the solid region slowly increased until 2017 by 1.4 ± 0.3 K. These observations, as well as the lag in summer warming observed by Cassini’s Composite Infrared Spectrometer, can be explained by evaporative cooling in both the solid and liquid surfaces after the vernal equinox. It therefore supports the idea that the northern polar terrains are wet. Using an ocean circulation model, we show that the cooling of the sea surface should initiate convection in the sea’s interior, ultimately cooling the whole liquid column sensed by the Cassini radiometer and thus decreasing the temperature at depths even long after the evaporation period has ceased. Overall, this work highlights the key role of methane hydrology in controlling the surface and submarine temperatures in the boreal polar regions of Titan.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了位于银河平面之外的恒星，通过观测SiO masers，揭示了这些恒星的形成历史。共观测了102颗恒星，发现了8颗新的SiO masers。通过测量maser速度，初步估算了宿主AGB星的径向速度。发现其中三颗星的径向速度明显偏离了银河圆形运动的预期值。更新后的距离和3D速度表明，其中一颗位于银河暗盘，一颗可能位于银河薄盘，其余六颗可能属于银河厚盘。 <div>
Studying stars that are located off the Galactic plane is important for understanding the formation history of the Milky Way. We searched for SiO masers toward off-plane O-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars from the catalog presented by Mauron et al. in order to shed light on the origins of these objects. A total of 102 stars were observed in the SiO J = 1−0, v = 1 and 2 transitions with the Effelsberg 100 m and Tianma 65 m telescopes. SiO masers were discovered in eight stars, all first detections. The measured maser velocities allow for initial estimates of the host AGB stars’ radial velocities. We find that the radial velocities of three stars (namely G068.881−24.615, G070.384−24.886, and G084.453−21.863) significantly deviate from the values expected from Galactic circular motion. The updated distances and 3D motions indicate that G068.881−24.615 is likely located in the Galactic halo, while G160.648−08.846 is probably located in the Galactic thin disk, and the other six stars are probably part of the Galactic thick disk.

We conducted the time-resolved simultaneous optical spectroscopic and photometric observations of mid-M-dwarf flare stars YZ CMi, EV Lac, and AD Leo. Spectroscopic observations were obtained using Apache Point Observatory 3.5 m and Small and Moderate Aperture Research Telescope System 1.5 m telescopes during 31 nights. Among the 41 detected flares, seven flares showed clear blue wing asymmetries in the Hα line, with various correspondences in flare properties. The duration of the blue wing asymmetries range from 20 minutes to 2.5 hr, including a flare showing the shift from blue to red wing asymmetry. Blue wing asymmetries can be observed during both white-light and candidate non-white-light flares. All of the seven flares showed blue wing asymmetries also in the Hβ line, but there are large varieties on which other chromospheric lines showed blue wing asymmetries. One among the 7 flares was also observed with soft X-ray spectroscopy, which enabled us to estimate the flare magnetic field and length of the flare loop. The line-of-sight velocities of the blueshifted components range from –73 to –122 km s−1. Assuming that the blueshifts were caused by prominence eruptions, the mass of upward-moving plasma was estimated to be 1015–1019 g, which are roughly on the relation between flare energy and erupting mass expected from solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Although further investigations are necessary for understanding the observed various properties, these possible prominence eruptions on M-dwarfs could evolve into CMEs, assuming the similar acceleration mechanism with solar eruptions.

Measured properties of young stellar objects (YSOs) are key tools for research into pre-main-sequence stellar evolution. YSO properties are commonly measured by comparing observed radiation to existing grids of template YSO spectral energy distributions (SEDs) calculated by radiative transfer. These grids are often sampled and constructed using simple models of mass assembly/accretion over time. However, because we do not yet have a complete theory of star formation, the choice of model sets the tracked parameters and range of allowed values. By construction, then, the assumed model limits the measurements that can be made using the grid. Radiative transfer models not constrained by specific accretion histories would enable assessment of a wider range of theories. We present an updated version of the Robitaille set (2017) of YSO SEDs, a collection of models with no assumed evolutionary theory. We outline our newly calculated properties: envelope mass, weighted-average dust temperature, disk stability, and circumstellar AV. We also convolve the SEDs with new filters, including JWST, and provide users the ability to perform additional convolutions. We find a correlation between the average temperature and millimeter-wavelength brightness of optically thin dust in our models and discuss its ramifications for mass measurements of pre- and protostellar cores. We also compare the positions of YSOs of different observational classes and evolutionary stages in IR color space and use our models to quantify the extent to which class and stage may be confused due to observational effects. Our updated models are released to the public.

这篇文章报告了使用SPHYNX和FLASH两种模拟代码对旋转20M⊙原恒星的三维恒星核心坍缩超新星模拟的研究。研究发现在跳跃后的第一个100毫秒内，出现两个重要的引力波信号，频率分别约为300赫兹和1.3千赫。这两个特征与来自原恒星变形的m = 1调制有关，该调制由低T/∣W∣不稳定引起。根据观察结果，300赫兹特征在初始角速度为1.0至4.0弧度每秒的模型中存在，而1.3千赫特征仅出现在1.5至3.5弧度每秒的更窄范围内。研究还观察到一个较弱但显著的更高阶模式的引力波特征，其初始峰频约为800赫兹，并逐渐增加至900-1000赫兹。因此，除了引力反弹信号外，检测300赫兹、1.3千赫以及更高阶模式，甚至相关的中微子的不对称发射，可以提供额外的诊断信息来估计坍缩核的初始角速度。<br /><br />总结: <br />核心坍缩超新星模拟产生了约300赫兹和1.3千赫的重要引力波特征，这与m = 1变形和低T/∣W∣不稳定有关。此外，还观察到了更高阶模式的引力波特征。这些结果为估计坍缩核的初始角速度提供了额外的诊断信息。 <div>
We present self-consistent three-dimensional core-collapse supernova simulations of a rotating 20M⊙ progenitor model with various initial angular velocities from 0.0 to 4.0 rad s−1 using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code SPHYNX and the grid-based hydrodynamics code FLASH. We identify two strong gravitational-wave features with peak frequencies of ∼300 Hz and ∼1.3 kHz in the first 100 ms postbounce. We demonstrate that these two features are associated with the m = 1 deformation from the proto-neutron star (PNS) modulation induced by the low-T/∣W∣ instability, regardless of the simulation code. The 300 Hz feature is present in models with an initial angular velocity between 1.0 and 4.0 rad s−1, while the 1.3 kHz feature is only present in a narrower range, from 1.5 to 3.5 rad s−1. We show that the 1.3 kHz signal originates from the high-density inner core of the PNS, and the m = 1 deformation triggers a strong asymmetric distribution of electron antineutrinos. In addition to the 300 Hz and 1.3 kHz features, we also observe one weaker but noticeable gravitational-wave feature from higher-order modes in the range between 1.5 and 3.5 rad s−1. Its initial peak frequency is around 800 Hz, and it gradually increases to 900–1000 Hz. Therefore, in addition to the gravitational bounce signal, the detection of the 300 Hz, 1.3 kHz, the higher-order mode, and even the related asymmetric emission of neutrinos could provide additional diagnostics for estimating the initial angular velocity of a collapsing core.

总结:
A2744是一个由JWST提供数据支持的高分辨率自由形式质量模型。该模型结合了弱引力透镜和强引力透镜数据集，创造了迄今为止单个星团最严格的强引力透镜约束，同时也是迄今为止密度最高的弱引力透镜约束。质量重建显示出一个等腰三角形结构，完美地跟踪了最亮的星团星系。通过MARS算法，我们的质量模型显示出更低的多重像散射参数，远远低于以前的研究。我们还公开了质量和放大地图。 <div>
We present a new high-resolution free-form mass model of A2744 that combines both weak-lensing (WL) and strong-lensing (SL) data sets from JWST. The SL data set comprises 286 multiple images, presenting the most extensive SL constraint to date for a single cluster. The WL data set, employing photo-z selection, yields a source density of , marking the densest WL constraint ever. The combined mass reconstruction enables the highest-resolution mass map of A2744 within the ∼1.8 Mpc × 1.8 Mpc reconstruction region to date, revealing an isosceles triangular structure with two legs of ∼1 Mpc and a base of ∼0.6 Mpc. Although our algorithm, which is called MAximum-entropy ReconStruction (MARS), is entirely blind to the cluster galaxy distribution, the resulting mass reconstruction traces the brightest cluster galaxies remarkably well. The five strongest mass peaks coincide with the five most luminous cluster galaxies within ≲2″. We do not detect any unusual mass peaks that are not traced by the cluster galaxies, unlike the findings in previous studies. Our mass model shows the smallest scatter of SL multiple images in both source (∼0.″05) and image (∼0.″1) planes, which is lower than in previous studies by a factor of ∼4. Although MARS represents the mass field with an extremely large number of free parameters (∼300,000), it converges to a solution within a few hours because we use a deep-learning technique. We make our mass and magnification maps publicly available.

<br />
这篇文章分析了102个Ia型超新星（SNe Ia），这是迄今为止最大的样本，主要基于来自ZTF和ATLAS的归档数据。研究将SNe Ia分为内部集群样本和外部集群样本，并与类似红移的 quiescent 和 star-forming 宿主星系的场样本进行比较。研究发现，内部集群的SNe Ia有更高比例的快速演化天体（SALT3 x1 <−1），这意味着内部集群环境中存在一种本质上不同的SNe Ia种群。研究还表明，集群样本显示了明显的双峰x1分布，快速演化的天体在内部集群中占主导地位，而在星形成星系中占较小比例。此外，研究发现了宇宙膨胀的残差中SN Ia标准化参数的微小差异。研究建议星体群的年龄驱使了所观察的分布，年龄最大的星体群几乎完全产生了快速演化的SNe Ia。
<br /><br />总结: 我们分析了102个近邻（z<0.1）x射线选择的星系团中的SNe Ia。内部星系团样本中的SNe Ia具有更高比例的快速演化天体，并且集群样本显示出明显的双峰x1分布。此外，我们观察到了在SNe Ia标准化参数和宇宙膨胀的残差中的微小差异。我们的研究表明，星体群的年龄可能驱使了所观察到的分布。 <div>
We present an analysis of 102 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in nearby (z < 0.1), x-ray-selected galaxy clusters. This is the largest such sample to date and is based on archival data primarily from ZTF and ATLAS. We divide our SNe Ia into an inner cluster sample projected within r500 of the cluster center and an outer cluster sample projected between r500 and 2 r500. We compare these to field samples of SNe Ia at similar redshifts in both quiescent and star-forming host galaxies. Based on SALT3 fits to the light curves, we find that the inner cluster SNe Ia have a higher fraction of fast-evolving objects (SALT3 x1 < −1) than the outer cluster or field quiescent samples. This implies an intrinsically different population of SNe Ia occurs in inner cluster environments, beyond known correlations based on host galaxy alone. Our cluster samples show a strongly bimodal x1 distribution with a fast-evolving component that dominates the inner cluster objects (≳75%) but is just a small fraction of SNe Ia in field star-forming galaxies (≲10%). We do not see strong evidence for variations in the color (SALT3 c) distributions among the samples and find only minor differences in SN Ia standardization parameters and Hubble residuals. We suggest that the age of the stellar population drives the observed distributions, with the oldest populations nearly exclusively producing fast-evolving SNe Ia.

<div> 关键词: cis-trans-carbonic acid, molecular cloud, IR features, quantum chemical anharmonic procedures, observational reference<br />
总结: <br />
最近，在银河系中心的分子云中探测到了顺式-反式碳酸，表明更稳定但目前尚未观测到的顺式-顺式构型在红外特征上有较强的特点。虽然能量较高的顺式-反式碳酸已经在毫米和厘米波长被探测到，由于其较大的偶极矩，但顺式-顺式碳酸的振动结构更适合在微米波长观测到。两种构型的红外强度都较大，并且其中一些特征落在不被多环芳烃主导的区域。水特征可能会阻碍在2.75μm的氢化物拉伸附近的观测，但在5.5-6.0μm范围内的其他振动基频甚至倍频可能通过JWST数据被识别。这项研究利用高水平和准确基准的量子化学非谐程序计算了与实验相比异常精确的旋转光谱数据。这种性能意味着在该研究中计算的红外吸收甚至级联发射光谱特征应该是准确的，并将为各种天文环境中对碳酸酸构型的观测提供所需的参考。 <div>
With the recent radioastronomical detection of cis-trans-carbonic acid (H2CO3) in a molecular cloud toward the Galactic center, the more stable but currently unobserved cis-cis conformer is shown here to have strong IR features. While the higher-energy cis-trans-carbonic acid was detected at millimeter and centimeter wavelengths, owing to its larger dipole moment, the vibrational structure of cis-cis-carbonic acid is more amenable to its observation at micron wavelengths. Even so, both conformers have relatively large IR intensities, and some of these fall in regions not dominated by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Water features may inhibit observation near the 2.75 μm hydride stretches, but other vibrational fundamentals and even overtones in the 5.5–6.0 μm range may be discernible with JWST data. This work has employed high-level, accurately benchmarked quantum chemical anharmonic procedures to compute exceptionally accurate rotational spectroscopic data compared to experiment. Such performance implies that the IR absorption and even cascade emission spectral features computed in this work should be accurate and will provide the needed reference for observation of either carbonic acid conformer in various astronomical environments.

We report the finding of a new, local diffusion instability in a protoplanetary disk which can operate in a dust fluid, subject to mass diffusion, shear viscosity, and dust–gas drag, provided the diffusivity, viscosity, or both, decrease sufficiently rapidly with increasing dust surface mass density. We devise a vertically averaged, axisymmetric hydrodynamic model to describe a dense, midplane dust layer in a protoplanetary disk. The gas is modeled as a passive component, imposing an effective, diffusion-dependent pressure, mass diffusivity, and viscosity onto the otherwise collisionless dust fluid, via turbulence excited by the gas alone, or dust and gas in combination. In particular, we argue that such conditions are met when the dust–gas mixture generates small-scale turbulence through the streaming instability, as supported by recent measurements of dust mass diffusion slopes in simulations. We hypothesize that the newly discovered instability may be the origin of filamentary features, almost ubiquitously found in simulations of the streaming instability. In addition, our model allows for growing oscillatory modes, which operate in a similar fashion as the axisymmetric viscous overstability in dense planetary rings. However, it remains speculative if the required conditions for such modes can be met in protoplanetary disks.

<title>What is the Reynolds Number of the Solar Wind?</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad118e</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad118e</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The Reynolds number, Re, is an important quantity for describing a turbulent flow. It tells us about the bandwidth over which energy can cascade from large scales to smaller ones, prior to the onset of dissipation. However, calculating it for nearly collisionless plasmas like the solar wind is challenging. Previous studies have used formulations of an “effective” Reynolds number, expressing Re as a function of the correlation scale and either the Taylor scale or a proxy for the dissipation scale. We find that the Taylor scale definition of the Reynolds number has a sizable prefactor of approximately 27, which has not been employed in previous works. Drawing from 18 years of data from the Wind spacecraft at 1 au, we calculate the magnetic Taylor scale directly and use both the ion inertial length and the magnetic spectrum break scale as approximations for the dissipation scale, yielding three distinct Re estimates for each 12 hr interval. Average values of Re range between 116,000 and 3,406,000 within the general distribution of past work. We also find considerable disagreement between the methods, with linear associations of between 0.38 and 0.72. Although the Taylor scale method is arguably more physically motivated, due to its dependence on the energy cascade rate, more theoretical work is needed in order to identify the most appropriate way of calculating effective Reynolds numbers for kinetic plasmas. As a summary of our observational analysis, we make available a data product of 28 years of 1 au solar wind and magnetospheric plasma measurements from Wind.

<title>Gas Morphology of Milky Way–like Galaxies in the TNG50 Simulation: Signals of Twisting and Stretching</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present an in-depth analysis of gas morphologies for a sample of 25 Milky Way–like galaxies from the IllustrisTNG TNG50 simulation. We constrain the morphology of cold, warm, hot gas, and gas particles as a whole using a local shell iterative method and explore its observational implications by computing the hard-to-soft X-ray ratio, which ranges between 10−3 and 10−2 in the inner ∼50 kpc of the distribution and 10−5–10−4 at the outer portion of the hot gas distribution. We group galaxies into three main categories: simple, stretched, and twisted. These categories are based on the radial reorientation of the principal axes of the reduced inertia tensor. We find that a vast majority (77%) of the galaxies in our sample exhibit twisting patterns in their radial profiles. Additionally, we present detailed comparisons between (i) the gaseous distributions belonging to individual temperature regimes, (ii) the cold gas distributions and stellar distributions, and (iii) the gaseous distributions and dark matter (DM) halos. We find a strong correlation between the morphological properties of the cold gas and stellar distributions. Furthermore, we find a correlation between gaseous distributions with a DM halo that increases with gas temperature, implying that we may use the warm–hot gaseous morphology as a tracer to probe the DM morphology. Finally, we show gaseous distributions exhibit significantly more prolate morphologies than the stellar distributions and DM halos, which we hypothesize is due to stellar and active galactic nucleus feedback.

<title>Can Emission Measure Distributions Derived from Extreme-ultraviolet Images Accurately Constrain High-temperature Plasma?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Measuring the relative amount of high-temperature, low emission measure (EM) plasma is considered to be a smoking-gun observation to constrain the frequency of plasma heating in coronal structures. Often, narrowband, extreme-ultraviolet images, such as those obtained by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), are used to determine the EM distribution, though the sensitivity to high-temperature plasma is limited. Conversely, the soft X-ray wavelength range offers multiple high-temperature diagnostics, including emission lines of N vii, O vii, O viii, Fe xvii, Ne ix, and Mg xi, which can provide tight constraints to the high-temperature plasma in the log T = 6.1–6.7 (∼1–5+ MK) range. The Marshall Grazing Incidence X-ray Spectrometer (MaGIXS), a slitless spectrograph launched on a NASA sounding rocket on 2021 July 30, resolved an X-ray-bright point in multiple emission lines in the soft X-ray wavelength range. Using coordinated observations of the same X-ray-bright point from SDO/AIA, we compare and contrast the EM distributions from the EUV image data, the X-ray spectra, and the combined EUV and X-ray data set. In this paper, we demonstrate that EM distributions from SDO/AIA data alone can overestimate the amount of high-temperature (log T > 6.4) plasma in the solar corona by a factor of 3–15. Furthermore, we present our effort to cross-calibrate Hinode/X-ray Telescope (XRT) response functions by comparing the observed XRT fluxes with the predicted ones from combined MaGIXS-1 + AIA EM analysis.

One of the primary outstanding questions in extragalactic astronomy is the formation and early evolution of the supermassive black holes that are seen in nearly every massive galaxy. Low-metallicity dwarf galaxies may offer the most representative local analogs to pristine early galaxies, making them a vital tool in probing black hole seed models through the study of the intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) possibly hosted therein; though these dwarf galaxies, and the IMBHs they may host, are typically not as well-studied in this context as their higher-metallicity and higher-mass counterparts. In this paper, we explore the X-ray properties of a sample of 37 low-metallicity dwarf galaxies using archival XMM observations, and we compare the properties of this population against a representative sample of higher-metallicity counterparts. We report the detection of 10 sources with 0.3–10 keV luminosity in excess of 1040 erg s−1 within the low-metallicity sample, which we highlight for followup as potential IMBH candidates. Finally, we discuss the differing multiwavelength scaling relations (e.g., LX–LW2, LX–star formation rate) between the two galaxy populations, as well as the sample’s LX as a function of metallicity.

这项研究使用了更新和显著增加的Cepheid和TRGB距离样本，覆盖了大范围的金属丰度，并搜索了Cepheid脉动变星振幅与H ii区域金属丰度之间的相关性。研究表明，Cepheid和TRGB距离刻度的零点非常吻合，并且在较近距离选择样本中几乎为零。然而，在较远的样本中，两个距离刻度之间存在更大的偏移。研究还发现，使用除去红化的W(V,VI)周期-光度关系时，Cepheid距离刻度没有显著的金属丰度依赖性。 <div>
Using an updated and significantly augmented sample of Cepheid and tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) distances to 28 nearby spiral and irregular galaxies, covering a wide range of metallicities, we have searched for evidence of a correlation of the zero-point of the Cepheid period–luminosity relation with H ii region (gas-phase) metallicities. Our analysis, for the 21 galaxies closer than 12.5 Mpc, results in the following conclusions: (1) The zero-points of the Cepheid and TRGB distance scales are in remarkably good agreement, with the mean offset in the zero-points of the most nearby distance-selected sample being close to zero, Δμo(Cepheid—TRGB) = −0.026 ± 0.015 mag (for an I-band TRGB zero-point of MI = −4.05 mag); however, for the more distant sample, there is a larger offset between the two distance scales, amounting to −0.073 ± 0.057 mag 〈Δμo〉 (Cepheids—TRGB) = −0.026 ± 0.015 mag, for an I-band TRGB zero-point of MI = −4.05 mag. (2) The individual differences, about that mean, have a measured scatter of ±0.068 mag. (3) We find no statistically significant evidence for a metallicity dependence in the Cepheid distance scale using the reddening-free W(V, VI) period–luminosity relation: Δμo(Cepheid − TRGB) = − 0.022( ± 0.015) × ([O/H] − 8.50) − 0.003(±0.007).

From the formation mechanisms of stars and compact objects to nuclear physics, modern astronomy frequently leverages surveys to understand populations of objects to answer fundamental questions. The population of dark and isolated compact objects in the Galaxy contains critical information related to many of these topics, but is only practically accessible via gravitational microlensing. However, photometric microlensing observables are degenerate for different types of lenses, and one can seldom classify an event as involving either a compact object or stellar lens on its own. To address this difficulty, we apply a Bayesian framework that treats lens type probabilistically and jointly with a lens population model. This method allows lens population characteristics to be inferred despite intrinsic uncertainty in the lens class of any single event. We investigate this method’s effectiveness on a simulated ground-based photometric survey in the context of characterizing a hypothetical population of primordial black holes (PBHs) with an average mass of 30M⊙. On simulated data, our method outperforms current black hole (BH) lens identification pipelines and characterizes different subpopulations of lenses while jointly constraining the PBH contribution to dark matter to ≈25%. Key to robust inference, our method can marginalize over population model uncertainty. We find the lower mass cutoff for stellar origin BHs, a key observable in understanding the BH mass gap, particularly difficult to infer in our simulations. This work lays the foundation for cutting-edge PBH abundance constraints to be extracted from current photometric microlensing surveys.

We present results from angular cross correlations between select samples of CHIME/FRB repeaters and galaxies in three photometric galaxy surveys, which have shown correlations with the first CHIME/FRB catalog containing repeating and nonrepeating sources: Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) × SCOS, DESI-BGS, and DESI-LRG. We find a statistically significant correlation (p-value &lt;0.001, after accounting for look-elsewhere factors) between a sample of repeaters with an extragalactic dispersion measure (DM) &gt; 395 pc cm−3 and WISE × SCOS galaxies with redshift z &gt; 0.275. We demonstrate that the correlation arises surprisingly because of a statistical association between FRB 20200320A (extragalactic DM ≈ 550 pc cm−3) and a galaxy group in the same dark matter halo at redshift z ≈ 0.32. We estimate that the host halo, along with an intervening halo at redshift z ≈ 0.12, accounts for at least ∼30% of the extragalactic DM. Our results strongly motivate incorporating galaxy group and cluster catalogs into direct host association pipelines for FRBs with \lesssim 1^{\prime} localization precision, effectively utilizing the two-point information to constrain FRB properties such as their redshift and DM distributions. In addition, we find marginal evidence for a negative correlation at 99.4% confidence limit between a sample of repeating FRBs with baseband data (median extragalactic DM = 354 pc cm−3) and DESI-LRG galaxies with redshift 0.3 ≤ z &lt; 0.45, suggesting that the repeaters might be more prone than apparent nonrepeaters to propagation effects in FRB–galaxy correlations due to intervening free electrons over angular scales ∼0.°5.

<div> GRB, kilonova, threat, off-axis observers, multi-messenger observations
<br /><br />总结: 本研究基于GW170817/GRB 170817A多信使事件的观测和理论预测，探讨了双中子星合并产生的高能辐射对近处观测者的潜在威胁。研究发现，基准KNe参数下，余辉的X射线辐射可能对约1pc范围内的观测者构成致命威胁，而辐射观测者的伽马射线辐射可能对约4pc范围内的观测者构成威胁，而最大的威胁来自余辉爆炸产生的宇宙射线，可以对约11pc范围内的观测者构成致命威胁。KNe的威胁距离与超新星类似，但发生频率远低。然而，本研究依赖于有限的KNe数据，多信使观测将澄清这类事件可能带来的威胁。 <div>
Binary neutron star mergers produce high-energy emissions from several physically different sources, including a gamma-ray burst (GRB) and its afterglow, a kilonova (KN), and, at late times, a remnant many parsecs in size. Ionizing radiation from these sources can be dangerous for life on Earth-like planets when located too close. Work to date has explored the substantial danger posed by the GRB to on-axis observers; here we focus instead on the potential threats posed to nearby off-axis observers. Our analysis is based largely on observations of the GW170817/GRB 170817A multi-messenger event, as well as theoretical predictions. For baseline KN parameters, we find that the X-ray emission from the afterglow may be lethal out to ∼1 pc and the off-axis gamma-ray emission may threaten a range out to ∼4 pc, whereas the greatest threat comes years after the explosion, from the cosmic rays accelerated by the KN blast, which can be lethal out to distances up to ∼11 pc. The distances quoted here are typical, but the values have significant uncertainties and depend on the viewing angle, ejected mass, and explosion energy in ways we quantify. Assessing the overall threat to Earth-like planets, KNe have a similar kill distance to supernovae, but are far less common. However, our results rely on the scant available KN data, and multi-messenger observations will clarify the danger posed by such events.

<div> BL Lac S5 0716+714, Yunnan Observatory, optical data, quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO), helical motion

总结:<br /><br />
从2017年11月10日到2018年5月15日，利用云南天文台的60厘米望远镜收集了BL Lac S5 0716+714的光学数据，包括g、r和i波段的21396个准同步多波段观测点。通过朗伯-斯卡格尔周期图法和加权小波Z变换法，首次发现了一个周期为44±6天的QPO信号，最终显著性为3.98σ。进一步分析表明，44天QPO信号可能是由喷流中速度为β的斑点的螺旋运动引起的，喷流中发射区域的视角经历周期性变化。此外，利用假设检验方法分析了流量分布，并确定双对数正态分布更适合；因此，在这个源中可能存在两个辐射迷你区域，因此这个44天的QPO信号可能叠加在更长期的突发之上。 <div>
By means of astronomical observation data from the 60 cm Telescope at Yunnan Observatory, optical data in the g, r, and i bands were collected for BL Lac S5 0716+714, spanning from 2017 November 10 to 2018 May 15. The original data set contains 21,396 quasi-simultaneous multiband points, with 7132 data points for each band. The Lomb–Scargle periodogram method and the weighted wavelet Z-transform method were used to search for a quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) signal in the data. For the first time, we report a QPO signal at 44 ± 6 days with a final significance of 3.98σ. Further analysis of the spectrum index reveals that the 44 day QPO signal is most likely explained by a helical motion of a blob with velocity β in the jet, where the viewing angle of the emission region in the jet undergoes periodic variations. In addition, we employed the hypothesis testing method (the null hypothesis) to analyze the flux distribution and determined that a double log-normal distribution provides a better fit; thus, there may be two radiative mini-regions within a jet in this source, so this 44 day QPO signal may be superimposed on a longer-term outburst.

<div> H ii region, multiwavelength, YSO, extinction, star formation
总结:
Sh2-87 H ii region的研究使用了光学到射电波段的多波段数据集。通过Herschel柱密度图和近红外光度数据生成的消光图，揭示了云的丝状结构和非均匀分布。在该区域鉴定出13个I类和202个II类年轻恒星对象（YSOs），以及22个Hα发射源。进一步分析表明，该星团主要由典型年龄约3百万年、质量在0.1-6.0太阳质量范围内的低质量YSOs组成。发现进化型YSOs主要分布在丝状结构和云的外部，而近期的星形成活动主要集中在中心区域的离子化气体和星形成团块中。Sh2-87区域的整体星形成情景与全局分级坍缩模型相似，年轻的大质量恒星形成活动预期在中心核心区域，同时在丝状结构和云的外部分布着进化型低质量YSOs。 <div>
We present a detailed study of the Sh2-87 H ii region using a multiwavelength data set in optical to radio bands. A Herschel column density map revealed that the host cloud is filamentary in nature, and together they formed a central dense hub. The extinction map generated using near-infrared photometric data also signifies the nonuniform distribution of the cloud and reveals its filamentary nature. We estimated a sizable variable extinction over the region up to AV = 34.4 mag, with an average value of AV = 3.4 mag. Using the various infrared color–color criteria, we identified 13 Class I and 202 Class II young stellar objects (YSOs) and 22 Hα-emitting sources toward this region. Further analysis showed that the cluster is mainly composed of low-mass YSOs with a typical age of ∼3 Myr having masses in the range of 0.1–6.0 M⊙. The identified evolved YSOs (i.e., Class II YSOs) are primarily distributed along the filaments and in the outer parts of the cloud, while the recent star formation, inferred by the presence of Class I YSOs, ionized gas, and star-forming clumps, is observed in the hub region. The overall star formation scenario in the Sh2-87 region resembles the global hierarchical collapse model of star formation, where younger massive star formation activity is expected at the central hub along with the distribution of evolved low-mass YSOs in the filaments and the outer parts of the cloud.

<br />
研究团队在澳大利亚平方公里阵列探路者变量和慢变源调查中发现了一个年轻的、高度分散的脉冲星。通过对Parkes射电望远镜进行跟踪观测，他们确定了PSR J1032−5804，测得其周期为78.7毫秒，离散度测量为819 ± 4 pc cm−3，旋转度测量为−2000 ± 1 rad m−2，特征年龄为34.6千年。该脉冲星在3 GHz的脉冲散射时间尺度约为22毫秒，暗示其在1 GHz的时间尺度约为3845毫秒，这使得其成为已知的第三个最分散的脉冲星，解释了其在先前的脉冲星调查中未被检测到的原因。研究团队通过分析脉冲星的频谱能量分布以及多波段图像中的周围延伸辐射，发现了可能存在的脉冲星风星云和超新星遗迹。这些结果突显了从射电连续图像中识别极端分散脉冲星的可能性。持续进行的大规模射电连续巡天将为我们提供一个前所未有的机会，发现更多极端脉冲星（例如高度分散、高度间歇和高度加速），从而增进我们对脉冲星和星际介质特性的理解。
<br /><br />总结: 高度分散脉冲星的发现； Parkes射电望远镜的跟踪观测结果； 脉冲星的特征参数和脉冲散射时间尺度的测算； 脉冲星风星云和超新星遗迹的可能发现； 未来射电连续巡天将促进对极端脉冲星的发现。 <div>
We report the discovery of a young, highly scattered pulsar in a search for highly circularly polarized radio sources as part of the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder Variables and Slow Transients survey. In follow-up observations with the Parkes radio telescope, Murriyang, we identified PSR J1032−5804 and measured a period of 78.7 ms, a dispersion measure of 819 ± 4 pc cm−3, a rotation measure of −2000 ± 1  rad m−2, and a characteristic age of 34.6 kyr. We found a pulse scattering timescale at 3 GHz of ∼22 ms, implying a timescale at 1 GHz of ∼3845 ms, which is the third most scattered pulsar known and explains its nondetection in previous pulsar surveys. We discuss the identification of a possible pulsar wind nebula and supernova remnant in the pulsar’s local environment by analyzing the pulsar spectral energy distribution and the surrounding extended emission from multiwavelength images. Our result highlights the possibility of identifying extremely scattered pulsars from radio continuum images. Ongoing and future large-scale radio continuum surveys will offer us an unprecedented opportunity to find more extreme pulsars (e.g., highly scattered, highly intermittent, and highly accelerated), which will enhance our understanding of the characteristics of pulsars and the interstellar medium.

总结:<br /><br />
这篇文章报告了在G165星系团中发现的一个红移为1.78的Type Ia超新星。通过引力透镜效应，该超新星在三个不同的位置上出现。研究团队利用这个多重成像的超新星测定了哈勃常数。通过对星系团的成像，确定了21个成像倍增性，并用近红外光谱仪确认了其中五个。研究团队构建了一个新的透镜模型，估计星系团600kpc范围内的总质量为(2.6 ± 0.3) × 10^14太阳质量。此外，他们发现了一个与超新星宿主星系重叠的星系密度过剩。近红外光谱还确认了六个成员星系，其中四个环绕着超新星宿主星系。最后，研究团队还发现了另一个以一个强烈透镜效应为中心的星系群，估计其总恒星形成率为每年100个太阳质量。这暗示了对该星系团进行定期监测可能会发现更多的超新星。 <div>
A Type Ia supernova (SN) at z = 1.78 was discovered in James Webb Space Telescope Near Infrared Camera imaging of the galaxy cluster PLCK G165.7+67.0 (G165; z = 0.35). The SN is situated 1.5–2 kpc from the host-galaxy nucleus and appears in three different locations as a result of gravitational lensing by G165. These data can yield a value for Hubble’s constant using time delays from this multiply imaged SN Ia that we call “SN H0pe.” Over the cluster, we identified 21 image multiplicities, confirmed five of them using the Near-Infrared Spectrograph, and constructed a new lens model that gives a total mass within 600 kpc of (2.6 ± 0.3) × 1014M⊙. The photometry uncovered a galaxy overdensity coincident with the SN host galaxy. NIRSpec confirmed six member galaxies, four of which surround the SN host galaxy with relative velocity ≲900 km s−1 and projected physical extent ≲33 kpc. This compact galaxy group is dominated by the SN host galaxy, which has a stellar mass of (5.0 ± 0.1) × 1011M⊙. The group members have specific star formation rates of 2–260 Gyr−1 derived from the Hα-line fluxes corrected for stellar absorption, dust extinction, and slit losses. Another group centered on a strongly lensed dusty star-forming galaxy is at z = 2.24. The total (unobscured and obscured) SFR of this second galaxy group is estimated to be (≳ 100 M⊙ yr−1), which translates to a supernova rate of ∼1 SNe yr−1, suggesting that regular monitoring of this cluster may yield additional SNe.

SLSNe的研究利用哈勃空间望远镜进行了UV成像，发现SLSNe的偏移距离大部分符合指数分布，但偏移较大的情况较为突出。SLSNe偏移距离显著大于长软伽马射线暴(LGRBs)，甚至大于Ib/c型和II型超新星。此外，约37%的SLSNe发生在宿主星系最暗淡的区域，这与LGRBs和Ib/c型以及II型超新星形成鲜明对比。研究还发现，SLSNe的位置与红移、爆发和磁星发动机参数没有显著关系，这表明它们的前体星可能遵循不同的演化路径。研究者推测，SLSNe可能源于被破碎的双星系统抛射出的高速大质量恒星。 <br /><br />总结: SLSNe的研究表明它们的位置分布与其他超新星和伽马射线暴存在显著差异，推测其前体星可能来自被破碎的双星系统抛射出的高速大质量恒星。 <div>
We present an extensive Hubble Space Telescope rest-frame UV imaging study of the locations of Type I superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) within their host galaxies. The sample includes 65 SLSNe with detected host galaxies in the redshift range z ≈ 0.05–2. Using precise astrometric matching with SN images, we determine the distributions of the physical and host-normalized offsets relative to the host centers, as well as the fractional flux distribution relative to the underlying UV light distributions. We find that the host-normalized offsets of SLSNe roughly track an exponential disk profile, but exhibit an overabundance of sources with large offsets of 1.5–4 times their hosts' half-light radii. The SLSNe normalized offsets are systematically larger than those of long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs), and even Type Ib/c and Type II SNe. Furthermore, we find from a Monte Carlo procedure that about {37}_{-8}^{+6} \% of SLSNe occur in the dimmest regions of their host galaxies, with a median fractional flux value of 0.16, in stark contrast to LGRBs and Type Ib/c and Type II SNe. We do not detect any significant trends in the locations of SLSNe as a function of redshift, or as a function of explosion and magnetar engine parameters inferred from modeling of their optical light curves. The significant difference in SLSN locations compared to LGRBs (and normal core-collapse SNe) suggests that at least some of their progenitors follow a different evolutionary path. We speculate that SLSNe arise from massive runaway stars from disrupted binary systems, with velocities of ∼102 km s−1.

总结:
θ Mus是一个引人注目的光谱双星系统，由碳型Wolf–Rayet恒星和OV伴星组成，在约19天的轨道上运转。它还包括一个O-超巨星，如果与双星系统有引力约束，将具有数十年的轨道周期。θ Mus的X射线亮度高，是一个非热无线电源，与大质量碰撞风双星常见的现象相符。新的Chandra X射线观测发现，θ Mus的X射线辐射包括一个冷却的几乎稳定的、受吸收影响较小的等离子体成分，其延伸范围远离双星系统。还存在由Fe xxv辐射示踪的较热等离子体。在≈2-5 keV范围内观察到的通量在≤5年的时间尺度内显着下降。这种通量下降可以归因于对较热等离子体的吸收增加，后者可能位于短周期双星系统的受限风相互作用区域内。θ Mus的X射线辐射与WC+O双星γ2 Vel的类似，包括碳复合谱线，但是这两个系统都显示出挑战CW模型的异常线中心性质。 <div>
θ Mus is a remarkable spectroscopic binary (SB) consisting of a carbon-type Wolf–Rayet star and OV companion (WC6+O6–7V) in a ≈19 days orbit. In addition an O-supergiant is visually detected at a small offset of 46 mas and if gravitationally bound to the SB system would have an orbital period of many decades. θ Mus is X-ray bright and a nonthermal radio source as commonly observed in massive colliding wind (CW) binaries. We present new Chandra X-ray observations of θ Mus, which complement previous XMM-Newton observations. The X-ray emission consists of a cool, nearly steady, weakly absorbed plasma component with broad redshifted emission lines located in an extended region far from the SB system. Hotter plasma is also present traced by Fe xxv emission. The observed flux in the ≈2–5 keV range dropped significantly on a timescale of ≤5 yr. The flux decrease can be attributed to an increase in absorption toward the hotter plasma which is likely located in the confined wind interaction region of the short-period SB system. The X-ray emission of θ Mus is remarkably similar to the WC+O binary γ2 Vel including carbon recombination spectral lines but both systems show unusual line centroid properties that challenge CW models.

总结: <br />
本文利用暗能量光谱仪(DES)的早期数据，从中获得了223个红移z<1的极低金属贫的星系(XMPGs)的大样本。利用直接Te方法测定氧丰度，发现其中95个星系为确认的XMPGs，其余128个为候选XMPGs。这些XMPGs占DES观测星系总数的0.01%。大部分XMPGs具有约1/34太阳金属丰度、约1.5 × 10^7太阳质量的恒星质量和0.22太阳质量每年的星形成率。这些XMPGs主要分布在相对低密度的环境中，许多星系的恒星质量-金属丰度关系(MZRs)低于普通星系。通过与理论模拟的比较，发现XMPGs是高红移星形成星系的良好类比体。由于DESI调查的持续进行，这些XMPG种群的性质将得到更完整的大样本的进一步调查。 <div>
Extremely metal-poor galaxies (XMPGs) at relatively low redshift are excellent laboratories for studying galaxy formation and evolution in the early universe. Much effort has been spent on identifying them from large-scale spectroscopic surveys or spectroscopic follow-up observations. Previous work has identified a few hundred XMPGs. In this work, we obtain a large sample of 223 XMPGs at z &lt; 1 from the early data of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). The oxygen abundance is determined using the direct Te method based on the detection of the [O iii]λ4363 line. The sample includes 95 confirmed XMPGs based on the oxygen abundance uncertainty; the remaining 128 galaxies are regarded as XMPG candidates. These XMPGs are only 0.01% of the total DESI observed galaxies. Their coordinates and other properties are provided in the paper. The most XMPGs have an oxygen abundance of ∼1/34 Z⊙, a stellar mass of about 1.5 × 107M⊙, and a star formation rate of 0.22 M⊙ yr−1. The two most XMPGs present distinct morphologies suggesting different formation mechanisms. The local environmental investigation shows that XMPGs preferentially reside in relatively low-density regions. Many of them fall below the stellar mass–metallicity relations (MZRs) of normal star-forming galaxies. From a comparison of the MZR with theoretical simulations, it appears that XMPGs are good analogs to high-redshift star-forming galaxies. The nature of these XMPG populations will be further investigated in detail with larger and more complete samples from the ongoing DESI survey.

本研究识别出250个双峰发射源（DPEs），并提供了这些DPEs的宽Hα发射线区域的光谱建模以及适配的黑洞吸积盘属性目录。随后对12个DPEs进行了跟踪光谱观测，并发现约50%的DPEs在长达10-20年的时间尺度上显示出红峰和蓝峰相对强度的显著变化。光谱建模得出的黑洞吸积盘参数分析表明，DPEs并不处于特殊的吸积状态，而是在合适的条件下观察到的普通广谱线AGNs。研究还包括了可能的超大质量黑洞双星候选者SDSSJ1430+2303，并讨论了其与ZTF调查中的发射盘AGN种群的光度和光谱变化一致性。 <br /><br />总结: <div>
About 3%–10% of Type I active galactic nuclei (AGNs) have double-peaked broad Balmer lines in their optical spectra originating from the motion of gas in their accretion disk. Double-peaked profiles arise not only in AGNs, but occasionally appear during optical flares from tidal disruption events and changing-state AGNs. In this paper, we identify 250 double-peaked emitters (DPEs) among a parent sample of optically variable broad-line AGNs in the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey, corresponding to a DPE fraction of 19%. We model spectra of the broad Hα emission-line regions and provide a catalog of the fitted accretion disk properties for the 250 DPEs. Analysis of power spectra derived from the 5 yr ZTF light curves finds that DPE light curves have similar amplitudes and power-law indices to other broad-line AGNs. Follow-up spectroscopy of 12 DPEs reveals that ∼50% display significant changes in the relative strengths of their red and blue peaks over long 10–20 yr timescales, indicating that broad-line profile changes arising from spiral arm or hotspot rotation are common among optically variable DPEs. Analysis of the accretion disk parameters derived from spectroscopic modeling provides evidence that DPEs are not in a special accretion state, but are simply normal broad-line AGNs viewed under the right conditions for the accretion disk to be easily visible. We include inspiraling supermassive black hole binary candidate SDSSJ1430+2303 in our analysis, and discuss how its photometric and spectroscopic variability is consistent with the disk-emitting AGN population in the ZTF survey.

<div> Chandra X-ray Observatory, M33, X-ray variability, high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs), monitoring survey
<br /><br />总结: 本研究利用Chandra X射线天文台对邻近的螺旋星系M33进行了为期五个纪元的监测调查，主要探究了时间间隔在两周至四个月之间的X射线变化。研究表征了55个核外明亮点源的X射线变化，其中许多被认为是高质量X射线双星（HMXBs）。在先前的M33 X射线目录中检测到了八个新的候选暂现源，并讨论了它们可能的性质。最终目录中包括了文献中确定的26个已知的HMXB候选者。通过包括这些源的档案X射线观测，我们将X射线光变曲线的基线延长了到21年。我们将源的检测和非检测时期与一系列模拟源的工作循环进行比较，推断出大多数检测到的源的工作循环>30%。我们发现只有四个源的检测模式与具有<30%工作循环一致。这种高工作循环的源比例对于HMXB群体来说是意外的，因此更频繁的X射线监测可能会揭示出更多的低工作循环HMXBs。 <div>
We present a new five-epoch Chandra X-ray Observatory monitoring survey of the nearby spiral galaxy M33 which probes X-ray variability with time sampling between two weeks and four months. We characterize the X-ray variability of 55 bright point sources outside of the nucleus, many of which are expected to be high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs). We detect eight new candidate transients not detected in previous X-ray catalogs of M33 and discuss their possible nature. The final catalog includes 26 known HMXB candidates identified in the literature. We extend the baseline of the X-ray light curves up to 21 yr by including archival X-ray observations of these sources. We compare the detection and nondetection epochs of the sources to suites of simulated source duty cycles and infer that most of our detected sources have duty cycles &gt;30%. We find only four sources whose detection patterns are consistent with having duty cycles below 30%. This large fraction of sources with high duty cycles is unexpected for a population of HMXBs; thus more frequent X-ray monitoring will likely reveal many more low duty cycle HMXBs in M33.

总结:
太阳是明亮的伽马射线源，由于宇宙射线与太阳气体的有声子作用而产生。文章介绍了一个简化的太阳磁场模型，用于捕捉与伽马射线产生相关的主要要素。此模型改进了先前的模型，能够合理地产生在1-200 GeV范围内由Fermi大面积望远镜观测到的硬谱和由高海拔水切可夫观测站（HAWC）在约103 GeV附近观测到的明显较软的谱线。文章指出，低能（≤10 GeV）的伽马射线主要产生在网络元素中，而高能（≳几十GeV）的伽马射线主要产生在网状结构之间的片状结构中。特别地，HAWC观测到的谱线变软是由于有限大小的网状结构对捕获和反射∼104 GeV宇宙射线的效果有限。该研究对理解太阳大气中的宇宙射线传输至关重要，并将为我们提供有关光球小尺度磁场的见解。 <br /><br /> <div>
The Sun is a bright gamma-ray source due to hadronic cosmic-ray interactions with solar gas. While it is known that incoming cosmic rays must generally first be reflected by solar magnetic fields to produce outgoing gamma rays, theoretical models have yet to reproduce the observed spectra. We introduce a simplified model of the solar magnetic fields that captures the main elements relevant to gamma-ray production. These are a flux tube, representing the network elements, and a flux sheet, representing the intergranular sheets. Both the tube and sheet have a horizontal size of order 100 km and serve as sites where cosmic rays are reflected and gamma rays are produced. While our simplified double-structure model does not capture all the complexities of the solar-surface magnetic fields, such as Alfvén turbulence from wave interactions or magnetic fluctuations from convection motions, it improves on previous models by reasonably producing both the hard spectrum seen by Fermi Large Area Telescope at 1–200 GeV and the considerably softer spectrum seen by the High Altitude Water Cherenkov Observatory (HAWC) at near 103 GeV. We show that lower-energy (≲10 GeV) gamma rays are primarily produced in the network elements and higher-energy (≳few × 10 GeV) gamma rays in the intergranular sheets. Notably, the spectrum softening observed by HAWC results from the limited effectiveness of capturing and reflecting ∼104 GeV cosmic rays by the finite-sized intergranular sheets. Our study is important for understanding cosmic-ray transport in the solar atmosphere and will lead to insights into small-scale magnetic fields at the photosphere.

<div> 关键词: GW170817, 二进制中子星合并, kilonova, CVAE, 多信使天体物理

总结:<br />
GW170817观测到了第一个二进制中子星合并的光学对应体，并且开启了多信使天体物理的新时代。结合引力波数据和光学对应体的信息揭示了关于合并系统性质的丰富信息。目前仅有一次GW事件观测到了kilonova，限制了我们对其起源和传播的精确理解。本文使用了条件变分自动编码器(CVAE)对两种不同时间长度的kilonova模型进行训练，可以快速准确地生成kilonova光变曲线。实施这一技术可以提供快速和可靠的结果，为多信使天体物理研究提供了新的工具。 <div>
The discovery of the optical counterpart, along with the gravitational waves (GWs) from GW170817, of the first binary neutron star merger has opened up a new era for multimessenger astrophysics. Combining the GW data with the optical counterpart, also known as AT 2017gfo and classified as a kilonova, has revealed the nature of compact binary merging systems by extracting enriched information about the total binary mass, the mass ratio, the system geometry, and the equation of state. Even though the detection of kilonovae has brought about a revolution in the domain of multimessenger astronomy, there has been only one kilonova from a GW-detected binary neutron star merger event confirmed so far, and this limits the exact understanding of the origin and propagation of the kilonova. Here, we use a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) trained on light-curve data from two kilonova models having different temporal lengths, and consequently, generate kilonova light curves rapidly based on physical parameters of our choice with good accuracy. Once the CVAE is trained, the timescale for light-curve generation is of the order of a few milliseconds, which is a speedup of the generation of light curves by 1000 times as compared to the simulation. The mean squared error between the generated and original light curves is typically 0.015 with a maximum of 0.08 for each set of considered physical parameters, while having a maximum of ≈0.6 error across the whole parameter space. Hence, implementing this technique provides fast and reliably accurate results.

<br />
TRAPPIST-1e行星的大气离子化，中性和离子化学以及大气生物标志的影响是本研究的关键点。通过模拟六种不同情境，发现类似卡林顿事件会大幅增加大气离子化并引起离子化学和光谱传输特征的显著变化。氮 dioxide含量大幅增加，水带深度减小，甲烷带减少，臭氧减少。这显示了必须考虑高能粒子效应，才能正确识别臭氧和甲烷等生物标志信号。另外，发现硝酸在湿润和枯落大气中的特征是不同的。总结：TRAPPIST-1e大气在强烈的恒星能量粒子事件下会出现显著变化，需要考虑高能粒子的影响才能准确识别生物标志信号。 <div>
Ongoing observing projects like the James Webb Space Telescope and future missions offer the chance to characterize Earth-like exoplanetary atmospheres. Thereby, M dwarfs are preferred targets for transit observations, for example, due to their favorable planet–star contrast ratio. However, the radiation and particle environment of these cool stars could be far more extreme than what we know from the Sun. Thus, knowing the stellar radiation and particle environment and its possible influence on detectable biosignatures—in particular, signs of life like ozone and methane—is crucial to understanding upcoming transit spectra. In this study, with the help of our unique model suite INCREASE, we investigate the impact of a strong stellar energetic particle event on the atmospheric ionization, neutral and ion chemistry, and atmospheric biosignatures of TRAPPIST-1e. Therefore, transit spectra for six scenarios are simulated. We find that a Carrington-like event drastically increases atmospheric ionization and induces substantial changes in ion chemistry and spectral transmission features: all scenarios show high event-induced amounts of nitrogen dioxide (i.e., at 6.2 μm), a reduction of the atmospheric transit depth in all water bands (i.e., at 5.5–7.0 μm), a decrease of the methane bands (i.e., at 3.0–3.5 μm), and depletion of ozone (i.e., at ∼9.6 μm). Therefore, it is essential to include high-energy particle effects to correctly assign biosignature signals from, e.g., ozone and methane. We further show that the nitric acid feature at 11.0–12.0 μm, discussed as a proxy for stellar particle contamination, is absent in wet-dead atmospheres.

<br />
利用JWST-CEERS数据，对宇宙早期（0.5–3亿年）质量巨大星系（M* > 10^9.5M⊙）中星形成的抑制进行了分析。通过使用先进的统计方法，对多维和相互关联的参数空间进行准确限制，确定了星系停止形成恒星的内在依赖性。在两种最先进的宇宙学模拟（IllustrisTNG和EAGLE）中，确定了关键的可验证预测，预测星系的停止形成恒星应该由早期宇宙中的超大质量黑洞质量所调控。在光度观测中，星系的重力潜能（ϕ*）被发现是超大质量黑洞质量的最佳替代品。在JWST-CEERS中，星系的停星潜能在所有时期（z = 0–8）都是质量巨大星系停止形成恒星的最具预测性的参数。这些结果强烈暗示了一个稳定的停星机制在宇宙历史上一直在起作用，与星系的中心重力潜能密切相关。在宇宙模型中，这种联系通过超大质量黑洞在深潜势井中形成和增长，随后通过混合的主动星系核反馈对星系进行停星解释。 
<br /><br />总结: 
1. 本研究利用JWST-CEERS数据分析了宇宙早期质量巨大星系中的停星现象。
2. 通过统计方法确定了停星与相关参数的内在依赖性。
3. 两种宇宙学模拟都预测了停星应该由超大质量黑洞质量调控。

5. 结果暗示了一个稳定的停星机制在宇宙历史上一直在起作用。 <div>
We present an analysis of the quenching of star formation in massive galaxies (M* &gt; 109.5M⊙) within the first 0.5–3 Gyr of the Universe’s history utilizing JWST-CEERS data. We utilize a combination of advanced statistical methods to accurately constrain the intrinsic dependence of quenching in a multidimensional and intercorrelated parameter space. Specifically, we apply random forest classification, area statistics, and a partial correlation analysis to the JWST-CEERS data. First, we identify the key testable predictions from two state-of-the-art cosmological simulations (IllustrisTNG and EAGLE). Both simulations predict that quenching should be regulated by supermassive black hole mass in the early Universe. Furthermore, both simulations identify the stellar potential (ϕ*) as the optimal proxy for black hole mass in photometric data. In photometric observations, where we have no direct constraints on black hole masses, we find that the stellar potential is the most predictive parameter of massive galaxy quenching at all epochs from z = 0–8, exactly as predicted by simulations for this sample. The stellar potential outperforms stellar mass, galaxy size, galaxy density, and Sérsic index as a predictor of quiescence at all epochs probed in JWST-CEERS. Collectively, these results strongly imply a stable quenching mechanism operating throughout cosmic history, which is closely connected to the central gravitational potential in galaxies. This connection is explained in cosmological models via massive black holes forming and growing in deep potential wells, and subsequently quenching galaxies through a mix of ejective and preventative active galactic nucleus feedback.

Fukui et al. quantified the hadronic and leptonic gamma-rays in the young TeV gamma-ray shell-type supernova remnant (SNR) RX J1713.7-3946 (RX J1713), and demonstrated that gamma rays are a combination of hadronic and leptonic gamma-ray components with a ratio of ∼6: 4 in gamma-ray counts Ng. This discovery, which adopted a new methodology of multi-linear gamma-ray decomposition, was the first quantification of the two gamma-ray components. In the present work, we applied the same methodology to another TeV gamma-ray shell-type SNR RX J0852.0-4622 (RXJ0852) in 3D space characterized by (the interstellar proton column density Np)-(the nonthermal X-ray count Nx)-[Ng], and quantified the hadronic and leptonic gamma-ray components as having a ratio of ∼5:5 in Ng. The present work adopted the fitting of two/three flat planes in 3D space instead of a single flat plane, which allowed suppression of the fitting errors. This quantification indicates that hadronic and leptonic gamma-rays are of the same order of magnitude in these two core-collapse SNRs, verifying the significant hadronic gamma-ray components. We argue that the target interstellar protons, in particular their spatial distribution, are essential in any attempts to identify the type of particles responsible for gamma-ray emission. The present results confirm that cosmic-ray (CR) energy ≲100 TeV is compatible with a scheme in which SNRs are the dominant source of these Galactic CRs.

Nonlinear gravitational evolution induces strong nonlinearities in the observed cosmological density fields, leading to positive off-diagonal correlations in the power spectrum covariance. This has caused the information saturation in the power spectrum, e.g., the neutrino mass constraints from the nonlinear power spectra are lower than their linear counterparts by a factor of ∼2 at z = 0. In this paper, we explore how nonlinear reconstruction methods improve the cosmological information from nonlinear cosmic fields. By applying nonlinear reconstruction to cold dark matter fields from the Quijote simulations, we find that nonlinear reconstruction can improve the constraints on cosmological parameters significantly, nearly reaching the linear theory limit. For neutrino mass, the result is only 12% lower than the linear power spectrum, i.e., the theoretical best result. This makes nonlinear reconstruction an efficient and useful method to extract neutrino information from current and upcoming galaxy surveys.

The ability to determine galaxy properties such as masses, ages, and star formation rates robustly is critically limited by the ability to measure dust attenuation accurately. Dust reddening is often characterized by comparing observations to models of either nebular recombination lines or the UV continuum. Here, we use a new technique to measure dust reddening by exploiting the He iiλ1640 and λ4686 emission lines originating from the stellar winds of Wolf–Rayet stars. The intrinsic line ratio is determined by atomic physics, enabling an estimate of the stellar reddening similar to how the Balmer lines probe gas-emission reddening. The He ii line ratio is measured from UV and optical spectroscopy using the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on board the Hubble Space Telescope for eight nearby galaxies hosting young massive star clusters. We compare our results to dust reddening values estimated from UV spectral slopes and from Balmer line ratios and find tentative evidence for systematic differences. The reddening derived from the He ii lines tends to be higher, whereas that from the UV continuum tends to be lower. A larger sample size is needed to confirm this trend. If confirmed, this may indicate an age sequence probing different stages of dust clearing. Broad He ii lines have also been detected in galaxies more distant than in our sample, providing the opportunity to estimate the dust reddening of the youngest stellar populations out to distances of ∼100 Mpc.

<div> 关键词: 核心坍缩超新星, 弱爆炸, 重力影响, 天体物理学, X射线暴

总结:
核心坍缩超新星的爆炸能量可能有所不同，当爆炸能量较低时，初始冲击波速度可能会减速至与母体速度接近。这会导致重力对爆炸流体动力学的影响，并可能导致冲击波在母体星内大半径处停滞。研究人员通过发展一种微扰方法来模拟这种弱爆炸的特殊属性，并得出结论，如果爆炸能量低于临界值，冲击波将在母体内停滞。该模型在与流体力学模拟结果的对比中表现出良好的一致性，准确预测了冲击波位置、速度以及停滞位置。这些结果对于黑洞形成和新发现的快速X射线暴（FXTs）具有重要影响。特别是，研究人员推测“幻影冲击波突破”——即星体外层冲破停滞冲击波——可以产生X射线爆发，但不会有随后的光学/紫外线迹象，类似于FXTs。该模型还预测了X射线爆发的上升时间td和平均光子能量kT之间存在反相关关系，大致为T∝{t}_{{\rm{d}}}^{-5/8}。 <div>
Observations and theory suggest that core-collapse supernovae can span a range of explosion energies, and when sub-energetic the shockwave initiating the explosion can decelerate to speeds comparable to the escape speed of the progenitor. In these cases, gravity will complicate the explosion hydrodynamics and conceivably cause the shock to stall at large radii within the progenitor star. To understand these unique properties of weak explosions, we develop a perturbative approach for modeling the propagation of an initially strong shock into a time-steady, infalling medium in the gravitational field of a compact object. This method writes the shock position and the post-shock velocity, density, and pressure as series solutions in the (time-dependent) ratio of the freefall speed to the shock speed, and predicts that the shock stalls within the progenitor if the explosion energy is below a critical value. We show that our model agrees very well with hydrodynamic simulations, and accurately predicts (for example) the time-dependent shock position and velocity and the radius at which the shock stalls. Our results have implications for black hole formation and the newly detected class of fast X-ray transients (FXTs). In particular, we propose that a “phantom shock breakout”—where the outer edge of the star falls through a stalled shock—can yield a burst of X-rays without a subsequent optical/UV signature, similar to FXTs. This model predicts the rise time of the X-ray burst, td, and the mean photon energy, kT, are anticorrelated, approximately as T\propto {t}_{{\rm{d}}}^{-5/8}.

We examine the evolution of ion-beam Weibel instability at strong collisionless shocks in weakly magnetized media. We find that a finite background magnetic field substantially affects both the linear and nonlinear phases of the instability, depending on whether the background electrons behave magnetized or not. Particle-in-cell simulations for magnetized electrons identify a dynamo-like mechanism of magnetic field amplification, which eventually leads to spontaneous magnetic reconnection. We conclude that this scenario is applicable to typical young supernova remnant shocks.

本文研究了帕克太阳探测器第四次相遇中的一次离子尺度波事件，其中包括左手偏振突然过渡为强烈的右手偏振，伴随着阿尔法粒子和质子速度分布函数中的明显核心束结构。线性稳定性分析表明，左手偏振波主要由质子核心种群中的质子回旋不稳定性驱动，并且右手偏振波主要由次要阿尔法束种群中的火管样不稳定性驱动。左手偏振到右手偏振的突然转变是由质子核心温度各向异性降低引起的。作者发现线性理论预测的不稳定波模式的频率和极化与磁场谱中观测到的非常吻合。这项工作深入了解了哪些确切的不稳定可能在内太阳系的波－粒子相互作用中起作用并调节能量转移，同时也强调了次要阿尔法种群可能作为一个很少考虑的自由能源的来源，可用于产生波动活动。 <div>
Ion-scale wave events or wave storms in the solar wind are characterized by enhancements in magnetic field fluctuations as well as coherent magnetic field polarization signatures at or around the local ion cyclotron frequencies. In this paper, we study in detail one such wave event from Parker Solar Probe's (PSP) fourth encounter, consisting of an initial period of left-handed (LH) polarization abruptly transitioning to a strong period of right-handed (RH) polarization, accompanied by a clear core beam structure in both the alpha and proton velocity distribution functions. A linear stability analysis shows that the LH-polarized waves are anti-sunward propagating Alfvén/ion cyclotron waves primarily driven by a proton cyclotron instability in the proton core population, and the RH polarized waves are anti-sunward propagating fast magnetosonic/whistler waves driven by a firehose-like instability in the secondary alpha beam population. The abrupt transition from LH to RH is caused by a drop in the proton core temperature anisotropy. We find very good agreement between the frequencies and polarizations of the unstable wave modes as predicted by linear theory and those observed in the magnetic field spectra. Given the ubiquity of ion-scale wave signatures observed by PSP, this work gives insight into which exact instabilities may be active and mediating energy transfer in wave–particle interactions in the inner heliosphere, as well as highlighting the role a secondary alpha population may play as a rarely considered source of free energy available for producing wave activity.

Cen A hosts the closest active galactic nucleus to the Milky Way, which makes it an ideal target for investigating the dynamical processes in the vicinity of accreting supermassive black holes. In this paper, we present 14 Chandra HETGS spectra of the nucleus of Cen A that were observed throughout 2022. We compared them with each other, and contrasted them against the two previous Chandra HETGS spectra from 2001. This enabled an investigation into the spectral changes occurring on timescales of months and 21 years. All Chandra spectra could be well fitted by an absorbed power law with a strong and narrow Fe Kα line, a leaked power-law feature at low energies, and Si and S Kα lines that could not be associated with the central engine. The flux of the continuum varied by a factor of 2.74 ± 0.05 over the course of the observations, whereas the Fe line only varied by 18.8% ± 8.8%. The photon index increased over 21 years, and the hydrogen column density varied significantly within a few months as well. The Fe Kα line was found at a lower energy than expected from the Cen A redshift, amounting to an excess velocity of {326}_{-94}^{+84}\,\mathrm{km}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1} relative to Cen A. We investigated warped accretion disks, bulk motion, and outflows as possible explanations of this shift.

总结:
球状星团中的恒星显示出化学组成的差异，这一特征无法被目前的任何机制完全解释。研究者通过发展了一种星体建模方法，利用多色差光度法为47 Tucanae球状星团的恒星准确获取了化学丰度。他们发现了化学元素丰度的分布规律，而这不支持恒星相互作用作为化学差异的起源。但需要更准确的吸积理论来得出更确切的结论。未来，随着詹姆斯·韦伯太空望远镜对47 Tucanae球状星团的观测，将扩展我们的分析质量基线到次恒星级别。因此，研究者还展示了47 Tucanae棕矮星成员的预测色-星等图和质量-星等关系。<br /><br /> <div>
Despite their shared origin, members of globular clusters display star-to-star variations in composition. The observed pattern of element abundances is unique to these stellar environments and cannot be fully explained by any proposed mechanism. It remains unclear whether stars form with chemical heterogeneity or inherit it from interactions with other members. These scenarios may be differentiated by the dependence of chemical spread on stellar mass; however, obtaining a sufficiently large mass baseline requires abundance measurements on the lower main sequence, which is too faint for spectroscopy even in the nearest globular clusters. We developed a stellar modeling method to obtain precise chemical abundances for stars near the end of the main sequence from multiband photometry, and we applied it to the globular cluster 47 Tucanae. The computational efficiency is attained by matching chemical elements to the model components that are most sensitive to their abundance. We determined [O/Fe] for ∼5000 members below the main-sequence knee at the level of accuracy, comparable to the spectroscopic measurements of evolved members in the literature. The inferred distribution disfavors stellar interactions as the origin of chemical spread; however, an accurate theory of accretion is required to draw a more definitive conclusion. We anticipate that future observations of 47 Tucanae with the James Webb Space Telescope will extend the mass baseline of our analysis into the substellar regime. Therefore, we present predicted color–magnitude diagrams and mass–magnitude relations for the brown dwarf members of 47 Tucanae.

总结:<br />
本文介绍了在深空探测领域中，对小行星特别是作为潜在威胁的二元小行星物理特性进行估算的挑战。提出了一个新颖的二元小行星模型，结合了轨道和自转运动，通过两个Cellinoid形状的投影和掩星效应来生成模拟亮度。通过Levenberg-Marquardt算法对物理特性进行反演，并通过数值实验和对真实二元小行星的应用进行了验证。研究结果表明，该模型提供了可靠且准确的二元小行星物理特性估算，同时还具有在支持双小行星重定向测试(DART)项目中的潜在应用。 <div>
The field of space science places significant emphasis on deep space exploration, with a particular focus on asteroids as a potential hazard to humanity. Inverting their physical characteristics from photometric observations is essential for uncovering their origins and evolution. This article attempts to present a solution to the challenging task of estimating the physical properties of binary asteroids, which are common in near-Earth asteroids larger than 200 meters. A novel model for binary asteroids is proposed, which integrates orbital and rotational motions to simulate brightness variations based on two Cellinoid shapes. The model combines the projection and occultation effects of the shapes to generate the simulated brightness. The inversion of determining physical properties is optimized based on the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm through a simulation process involving several parameter corrections. Finally, the performance of the proposed model is demonstrated through numerical experiments and applications to two real binary asteroids, namely, asteroid (317) Roxane and asteroid (624) Hektor. The derived results are nearly identical to those from other publications, which confirms that the proposed model provides reliable and accurate estimations of the physical properties of binary asteroids. Additionally, this method has a potential application in supporting the development of effective strategies for the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) project, the first planetary defense experiment in space undertaken by humans.

总结: 该研究观测PSR J1544+4937黑寡妇脉冲星的长期监测结果，发现频率依赖性遮挡频率存在显著变化，推测环境动态演化，受伴星质量流失率影响。 <div>
We present results from long-term monitoring of frequency-dependent eclipses of the radio emission from PSR J1544+4937, which is a black widow spider millisecond pulsar (MSP) in a compact binary system. The majority of such systems often exhibit relatively long-duration radio eclipses caused by ablated material from their companion stars. With the wide spectral bandwidth of the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope, we present the first systematic study of temporal variation of eclipse cutoff frequency. With decade-long monitoring of 39 eclipses for PSR J1544+4937, we notice significant changes in the observed cutoff frequency ranging from 343 ± 7 to ≥740 MHz. We also monitored changes in eclipse cutoff frequency on timescales of tens of days and observed a maximum change of ≥315 MHz between observations that were separated by 22 days. In addition, we observed a change of ∼47 MHz in eclipse cutoff frequency between adjacent orbits, i.e., on timescales of ∼2.9 hr. We infer that such changes in the eclipse cutoff frequency depict an eclipse environment for the PSR J1544+4937 system that is dynamically evolving, where, along with the change in electron density, the magnetic field could also be varying. We also report a significant correlation between the eclipse cutoff frequency and the mass-loss rate of the companion. This study provides the first direct evidence of mass-loss rate affecting the frequency-dependent eclipsing in a spider MSP.

<div> 关键词: Leike et al., 3D dust map, molecular clouds, mass-size relation, volume density

本研究利用Leike等人的3D尘埃地图，结合其约1 pc空间分辨率，生成了太阳附近分子云的均匀目录。通过精确的距离测量，我们消除了质量、大小和密度方面的许多不确定性，对65个云的性质进行了真实的3D空间测量。目录中的云总共包含1.1×105太阳质量，跨越116-440 pc的距离范围，并包括文献中已广泛研究的十几个云。除了在3D体积密度空间推导云的性质外，我们还通过将3D云投影到2D“天空”视图上，创建了2D尘埃消光图。我们分别测量了2D云和3D云的性质。我们比较了遵循Larson定律的云的质量和大小之间的比例关系。我们发现我们的2D投影质量-大小关系M∝r2.1符合Larson的第三关系，但我们的3D推导性质导致了约一个数量级更大的比例关系：M∝r2.9。验证了理论和数值模拟的预测，我们的结果表明，质量-大小关系对于定义云的面密度或体积密度敏感，因为质量在2D中按照面积缩放（M∝r2），在3D中按照体积缩放（M∝r3）。我们的结果表明，分子云的表面密度和体积密度在2D和3D中大致保持恒定，这与在云的质量预算中占主导地位的低密度、较大体积充填气体对云的预期情况相符。 <br /><br />总结: 本研究利用Leike等人的3D尘埃地图，对太阳附近的分子云进行了全面的研究，得出了关于云的质量-大小关系的新发现，对分子云的性质提供了更精确的认识。 <div>
We dendrogram the Leike et al. 3D dust map, leveraging its ∼1 pc spatial resolution to produce a uniform catalog of molecular clouds in the solar neighborhood. Using accurate distances, we measure the properties of 65 clouds in true 3D space, eliminating much of the uncertainty in mass, size, and density. Clouds in the catalog contain a total of 1.1 × 105M☉, span distances of 116−440 pc, and include a dozen well-studied clouds in the literature. In addition to deriving cloud properties in 3D volume density space, we create 2D dust extinction maps from the 3D data by projecting the 3D clouds onto a 2D “Sky” view. We measure the properties of the 2D clouds separately from the 3D clouds. We compare the scaling relation between the masses and sizes of clouds following Larson. We find that our 2D projected mass–size relation, M ∝ r2.1, agrees with Larson's Third Relation, but our 3D derived properties lead to a scaling relation of about one order larger: M ∝ r2.9. Validating predictions from theory and numerical simulations, our results indicate that the mass–size relation is sensitive to whether column or volume density is used to define clouds, since mass scales with area in 2D (M ∝ r2) and with volume in 3D (M ∝ r3). Our results imply a roughly constant column and volume density in 2D and 3D, respectively, for molecular clouds, as would be expected for clouds where the lower density, larger volume-filling gas dominates the cloud mass budget.

<div> z ∼ 6, star formation rate function, spectral energy distribution, rest-frame UV, Schechter function
<br /><br />总结: 该研究在z ∼ 6时提出了一个星体形成率函数（SFRF），该函数基于对CANDELS GOODS-South和North领域中星系的光谱能量分布拟合推导出的恒星形成率（SFR）。研究结果显示，在z ∼ 6时的SFRF相较于仅根据红移UV观测修正尘埃衰减的光度函数（LF）估计结果有过剩，并且可与远红外LF估计相媲美。研究使用Schechter函数参数化SFRF，并在固定斜率和特征数密度的情况下得到了最佳拟合参数。而在z ∼ 6时的最佳适应SFR*与z ∼ 2时的相当，这是宇宙中星体形成活动达到顶峰的时期。此外，通过类似方法使用红移UV到光学数据进行的SFRF估计还发现，在z ∼ 2到∼6时期，SFR*大致保持不变，而在z ∼ 6以上可能有所减少。SFR*对SFRF的高SFR端敏感，这种SFR*的演变表明，在再电离时期，SFRF的高SFR端迅速增长，并达到了在z ∼ 2时观测到的水平。 <div>
We present a star formation rate function (SFRF) at z ∼ 6 based on star formation rates (SFRs) derived by spectral energy distribution fitting on data from rest-frame UV to optical wavelengths of galaxies in the CANDELS GOODS-South and North fields. The resulting SFRF shows an excess compared to the previous estimations by using rest-frame UV luminosity functions (LFs) corrected for the dust attenuation and is comparable to that estimated from a far-infrared LF. This suggests that the number density of dust-obscured intensively star-forming galaxies at z ∼ 6 has been underestimated in the previous approach based only on rest-frame UV observations. We parameterize the SFRF using the Schechter function and obtain the best-fit parameter of the characteristic SFR (SFR*) when the faint-end slope and characteristic number density are fixed. The best-fit SFR* at z ∼ 6 is comparable to that at z ∼ 2, when the cosmic star formation activity reaches its peak. Together with SFRF estimations with a similar approach using rest-frame UV to optical data, the SFR* is roughly constant from z ∼ 2 to ∼6 and may decrease above z ∼ 6. Since the SFR* is sensitive to the high-SFR end of the SFRF, this evolution of SFR* suggests that the high-SFR end of the SFRF grows rapidly during the epoch of reionization and reaches a similar level observed at z ∼ 2.

总结:<br /><br />本文利用统计模型来研究正交偏振模式强度的随机波动对脉冲星的无线电发射调制和去极化的影响。推导了Stokes参数、线性偏振、偏振位置角和分数偏振的分布表达式，当模式强度遵循相同或不同的概率分布时。研究了模式之间的过渡情况。当模式强度遵循相同的分布时，分数线偏振和调制指数在过渡点上是对称的。当模式强度遵循不同的分布时，对称性被破坏。在模式强度分布相同且调制指数较小时，分数线偏振是最小的，并且模式出现的频率在过渡点上迅速改变。还量化了在给定调制指数条件下通过模式的同时出现所能达到的最低分数线偏振的下限。 <div>
A statistical model is used to determine how stochastic fluctuations in the intensities of orthogonal polarization modes contribute to the modulation and depolarization of pulsar radio emission. General expressions for the distributions of the Stokes parameters, linear polarization, polarization position angle, and fractional polarization are derived when the mode intensities follow the same or different probability distributions. The transition between modes is examined. When the mode intensities follow the same distribution, the fractional linear polarization and modulation index are symmetric about the transition. The symmetry is disrupted when the mode intensities follow different distributions. The fractional linear polarization is minimum and the mode frequency of occurrence changes rapidly at transitions where the mode intensity distributions are the same and the modulation index is small. A lower limit on the fractional linear polarization that can be attained via the simultaneous occurrence of the modes as a function of modulation index is quantified.

Close encounters between stellar-mass black holes (BHs) and stars occur frequently in dense star clusters and in the disks of active galactic nuclei. Recent studies have shown that in highly eccentric close encounters, the star can be tidally disrupted by the BH in a microtidal disruption event (microTDE), resulting in rapid mass accretion and possibly bright electromagnetic signatures. Here we consider a scenario in which the star might approach the stellar-mass BH in a gradual, nearly circular inspiral, under the influence of dynamical friction in a circum-binary gas disk or three-body interactions in a star cluster. We perform hydrodynamics simulations of this scenario using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code PHANTOM. We find that under certain circumstances (for initial eccentricity e0 ≳ 0.4 and penetration factor β = 1, or e0 &lt; 0.4 and β ≲ 0.67), the mass of the star is slowly stripped away by the BH. We call this gradual tidal disruption a “tidal-peeling event.” Additionally, we discover that some low-eccentricity microTDEs (e0 &lt; 0.4 and β = 1) are a new form of fast luminous transients similar to parabolic microTDEs. Depending on the initial distance and eccentricity of the encounter, these low-eccentricity microTDEs might exhibit significant accretion rates and orbital evolution distinct from those of a typical (eccentric) microTDE.

It has been suggested that the ratio of photospheric direct to return current, ∣DC/RC∣, may be a better proxy for assessing the ability of solar active regions to produce a coronal mass ejection (CME) than others such as the amount of shear along the polarity inversion line (PIL). To test this conjecture, we measure both quantities prior to eruptive and confined flares of varying magnitude. We find that eruptive-flare source regions have ∣DC/RC∣ &gt; 1.63 and PIL shear above 45° (average values of 3.°2 and 68°, respectively), tending to be larger for stronger events, while both quantities are on average smaller for confined-flare source regions (2.°2 and 68°, respectively), albeit with substantial overlap. Many source regions, especially those of eruptive X-class flares, exhibit elongated direct currents (EDCs) bracketing the eruptive PIL segment, which typically coincide with areas of continuous PIL shear above 45°. However, a small subset of confined-flare source regions have ∣DC/RC∣ close to unity, very low PIL shear (&lt;38°), and no clear EDC signatures, rendering such regions less likely to produce a CME. A simple quantitative analysis reveals that ∣DC/RC∣ and PIL shear are almost equally good proxies for assessing CME-productivity, comparable to other proxies suggested in the literature. We also show that an inadequate selection of the current-integration area typically yields a substantial underestimation of ∣DC/RC∣, discuss specific cases that require careful consideration for ∣DC/RC∣ calculation and interpretation of the results, and suggest improving photospheric CME-productivity proxies by incorporating coronal measures such as the decay index.

Intrigued by recent high-energy study results for nearby galaxies with γ-ray emission and in particular NGC 1068 that has been detected as a neutrino-emitting source by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, we conduct a detailed analysis of the γ-ray data of the galaxies NGC 1068 and NGC 253, obtained with the Large Area Telescope on board the Fermi γ-ray Space Telescope. By checking their possible spectral features and then constructing light curves in the corresponding energy ranges, we identify spectral-change activity from NGC 1068 in the ≥2 GeV energy range and long-term, statistically significant changes for NGC 253 in the ≥5 GeV energy range. In the former, the emission appears harder in two half-year periods than in the otherwise “quiescent” state. In the latter, an ∼two-fold decrease in the detection significance after MJD = 57023 is clearly revealed by the test-statistic maps we obtain. Considering the previous studies carried out and the various models proposed for the γ-ray emissions of the two sources, we discuss the implications of our findings. We suspect that a jet (or outflow) in NGC 1068 might contribute to the γ-ray emission. The nature of the long-term statistically significant changes for NGC 253 is not clear, but since the part of the GeV emission may be connected to the very-high-energy (VHE) emission from the center of the galaxy, it could be further probed with VHE observations.

<div> 关键词: 金属丰富，旋转双重不稳定超新星，质量范围，56Ni质量，质量损失历史

这篇论文重新探讨了与小麦哲伦星云、大麦哲伦星云（LMC）、和0.1太阳金属丰度一致的金属丰富旋转双重不稳定超新星（PISNe）模型。通过计算多个模型，我们打算澄清PISNe的质量范围和喷射出的56Ni质量，以及母体的质量损失历史。我们发现选择Wolf-Rayet（WR）质量损失率是很重要的，我们采用了最近提出的Sander & Vink的速率，它覆盖了PISNe前体的质量范围。我们发现慢速旋转降低了PISN范围，因为旋转混合导致了核心质量的增加。另一方面，当我们假设观测到的OB星的典型旋转速度时，质量损失增加变得更加显著，最终恒星的质量低于非旋转模型。因此，对于这些快速旋转模型，亮度超新星（SN）的典型质量范围，其56Ni质量高于10M⊙，分别为LMC和0.1Z⊙金属丰度，超过400和350M⊙。有趣的是，与以往的研究不同，我们发现大多数情况下是富氧的母体。这种富氧的母体可能与最近确定的PISN候选SN2018ibb一致。He-丰富的母体仅在相对暗淡和金属贫（Z ≲ 0.1Z⊙）的PISNe中出现。我们还讨论了金属丰富PISNe的黑洞质量间隙，并展示了间隙的上限低于III类群体的情况。

<br /><br />总结: 本研究重新探讨了金属丰富旋转双重不稳定超新星（PISNe）模型，以及与小麦哲伦星云、大麦哲伦星云（LMC）、和0.1太阳金属丰度一致的质量范围和地方。特别地，与之前研究不同的是发现了富氧的母体，这一发现与最近确定的PISN候选SN2018ibb相符。同时还讨论了金属丰富PISNe的黑洞质量间隙。 <div>
In this paper, we revisit metal-enriched rotating pair-instability supernovae (PISNe) models for metallicities consistent with the Small Magellanic Cloud, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and 0.1Z⊙. By calculating multiple models, we intend to clarify mass ranges and the ejected 56Ni masses from the PISNe, and mass-loss histories for progenitors. We find that the choice of the Wolf–Rayet (WR) mass-loss rates is important, and we adopt the recently proposed rate of Sander &amp; Vink, which covers the mass ranges for PISNe progenitors. We show that slow rotation lowers the PISN range because the core mass increases by rotational mixing. On the other hand, when we assume a typical rotation speed for observed OB stars, the mass-loss increase becomes more significant, and the final stellar masses are lower than in nonrotating models. As a result, the typical mass range for bright supernovae (SNe), with a 56Ni mass higher than 10M⊙ for these fast-rotating models is more than 400 and 350M⊙ for LMC and 0.1Z⊙ metallicities, respectively. It is interesting that unlike in previous works, we find oxygen-rich progenitors for most cases. This O-rich progenitor may be consistent with the recently identified PISN candidate SN2018ibb. He-rich progenitors are seen only for relatively dim and metal-poor (Z ≲ 0.1Z⊙) PISNe. We also discuss the black hole mass gap for metal-enriched PISNe, and we show that the upper bound for the gap is lower than in the Population III case.

We perform a data-constrained simulation with the zero-β assumption to study the mechanisms of strong rotation and failed eruption of a filament in active region 11474 on 2012 May 5 observed by Solar Dynamics Observatory and Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory. The initial magnetic field is provided by nonlinear force-free field extrapolation, which is reconstructed by the regularized Biot–Savart laws and magnetofrictional method. Our simulation reproduces most observational features very well, e.g., the filament large-angle rotation of about 130°, the confined eruption, and the flare ribbons, allowing us to analyze the underlying physical processes behind observations. We discover two flux ropes in the sigmoid system, an upper flux rope (MFR1) and a lower flux rope (MFR2), which correspond to the filament and hot channel in observations, respectively. Both flux ropes undergo confined eruptions. MFR2 grows by tether-cutting reconnection during the eruption. The rotation of MFR1 is related to the shear-field component along the axis. The toroidal field tension force and the nonaxisymmetry forces confine the eruption of MFR1. We also suggest that the mutual interaction between MFR1 and MFR2 contributes to the large-angle rotation and the eruption failure. In addition, we calculate the temporal evolution of the twist and writhe of MFR1, which is a hint of probable reversal rotation.

<title>On the Role of Alfvénic Fluctuations as Mediators of Coherence within Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections: Investigation of Multi-spacecraft Measurements at 1 au</title>

<div> 关键词: ICMEs, Alfvénic fluctuations, coherence, magnetic field correlation, solar wind<br />
总结:<br />
本研究探讨了Alfvénic fluctuations（AFs）在行星际日冕物质抛射（ICMEs）的一致性中的作用。研究发现，大约65%的ICME鞘和90%的磁场喷发物（MEs）展现出延伸的AFs。交叉螺旋度表明太阳风和行星际来源的AFs可能在1天文单位处的ICME中共存。AFs主要集中在激波的下游和MEs的背部。磁场在ICME鞘内的相关性较差，而在MEs的前后，大多数磁场分量的相关性也减弱。AFs也与较低的磁场相关性相关联。这表明ICME的一致性可能不是通过Alfvén波来介导，这意味着一致性尺度可能比先前预测的更小，或者磁场相关性并不是一致性的衡量标准。 <div>
Interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) are defined as “coherent” if they are capable of responding to external perturbations in a collective manner. This implies that information must be able to propagate across ICME structures, and if this is not the case, single-point in situ measurements cannot be considered as indicative of global ICME properties. Here, we investigate the role of Alfvénic fluctuations (AFs) as mediators of ICME coherence. We consider multipoint magnetic field and plasma measurements of 10 ICMEs observed by the ACE and Wind spacecraft at 1 au at longitudinal separations of 0.5°–0.7°. For each event, we analyze the Alfvénicity in terms of the residual energy and cross helicity of fluctuations, and the coherence in terms of the magnetic correlation between Wind and ACE. We find that ∼65% and 90% of ICME sheaths and magnetic ejecta (MEs), respectively, present extended AFs covering at least 20% of the structure. Cross helicity suggests AFs of solar and interplanetary origin may coexist in the ICME population at 1 au. AFs are mainly concentrated downstream of shocks and in the back of MEs. The magnetic field is poorly correlated within sheaths, while the correlation decreases from the front to the back of the MEs for most magnetic field components. AFs are also associated with lower magnetic field correlations. This suggests either that ICME coherence is not mediated by Alfvén waves, implying that the coherence scale may be smaller than previously predicted, or that the magnetic field correlation is not a measure of coherence.

Ultralight scalar fields and their noninteracting class, i.e., the so-called fuzzy dark matter (FDM), are dark matter candidates introduced to solve the small-scale problems of the standard cold dark matter. In this paper, we investigate whether the physics of FDM, particularly the quantum pressure that leads to the suppression of structure formation on small scales, could leave significant imprints on the large-scale statistics of matter fluctuations. For this purpose, we utilize the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structures (EFT of LSS), wherein small-scale physics is integrated and represented on large scales by only a set of free parameters. These parameters can be determined by fitting them into the cosmological simulations. By fitting the EFT predictions to the simulation data, we determine the value of the speed of sound as a quantitative measure of how UV physics affects large-scale perturbation. We use the Gadget-2 code to study the evolution of 5123 particles in a box with a side length 250 h−1 Mpc. We exploit the suppressed FDM initial power for the FDM universe and perform N-body simulation sufficient to produce accurate—enough for our purpose—results on large scales. In particular, we perform three FDM simulations with different masses and compare their sound speed with the standard cold dark matter (CDM) simulation. We found no difference between the FDM and CDM sound speeds beyond the confidence intervals. However, a consistently increasing trend can be seen in the sound speed for lower masses. This result suggests further investigations using higher-resolution simulations.

这篇论文通过利用LAMOST-Gaia红巨星样本恒星，综合研究了银河盘不同种群的动力学性质。作者发现在不同的空间和种群区间，存在大规模的整体运动，如径向速度的波动、方位速度的南北差异、以及垂直速度的弯曲信号。这些整体运动的振幅和空间相关性显示出不同年龄和丰度的种群存在显著的不同。此外，速度离散的全局空间行为清晰显示了螺旋臂的信号，以及在40亿年内的盘干扰事件的信号，外部区域的盘弯曲现象主要出现在年轻或α-贫的恒星种群中。通过对不同盘区域的年龄/α-丰度-速度离散关系的详细测量，发现年轻/α-贫的种群可能是由巨大分子云和螺旋臂的动态加热而产生，而老年/α-增强种群则需要其他加热机制的显著贡献，如合并和吸积，或者是在富气体系统的混合合并和/或湍动星际介质中产生。 
<br /><br />总结: <div>
We present a comprehensive study of the kinematic properties of the different Galactic disk populations, as defined by the chemical abundance ratios and stellar ages, across a large disk volume (4.5 ≤ R ≤ 15.0 kpc and ∣Z∣ ≤ 3.0 kpc), by using the LAMOST-Gaia red clump sample stars. We determine the median velocities for various spatial and population bins, finding large-scale bulk motions; for example, the wave-like behavior in radial velocity, the north–south discrepancy in azimuthal velocity and the warp signal in vertical velocity, and the amplitudes and spatial dependences of these bulk motions show significant variations for different mono-age and mono-abundance populations. The global spatial behaviors of the velocity dispersions clearly show a signal of spiral arms and a signal of the disk perturbation event within 4 Gyr, as well as disk flaring in the outer region (i.e., R ≥ 12 kpc), mostly for young or alpha-poor stellar populations. Our detailed measurements of age/[α/Fe]-velocity dispersion relations for different disk volumes indicate that young/α-poor populations are likely to originate from dynamic heating by both giant molecular clouds and spiral arms, while old/α-enhanced populations require an obvious contribution from other heating mechanisms, such as merger and accretion, or are born in the chaotic mergers of gas-rich systems and/or turbulent interstellar medium.

<div> 磁通绳, 数值模拟, 太阳喷发, 地磁风暴, 数据驱动建模

总结:<br /><br />本文研究了磁通绳的数值模拟，通过结合时间依赖磁摩擦方法和热力学磁流体动力学模型，成功地再现了观测到的磁通绳的形成和受限喷发，并揭示了观测背后的物理细节。对于活跃区的长期演化过程，模拟结果表明，由于碰撞剪切引起的磁通绳的形成起着至关重要的作用，导致磁自由能和螺旋度显著增加。在喷发阶段，磁通绳在喷发过程中的变形会导致向下张力的增加，从而抑制其进一步上升。这一发现可能揭示了为什么一些环状不稳定的磁通绳在大角度旋转后会导致失败的喷发。此外，我们发现扭曲的磁通在受限喷发期间会积累，这可能导致随后的喷发耀斑的产生。 <div>
Magnetic flux ropes are a bundle of twisted magnetic field lines produced by internal electric currents, which are responsible for solar eruptions and are the major drivers of geomagnetic storms. As such, it is crucial to develop a numerical model that can capture the entire evolution of a flux rope, from its birth to death, in order to predict whether adverse space weather events might occur or not. In this paper, we develop a data-driven modeling that combines a time-dependent magnetofrictional approach with a thermodynamic magnetohydrodynamic model. Our numerical modeling successfully reproduces the formation and confined eruption of an observed flux rope, and unveils the physical details behind the observations. Regarding the long-term evolution of the active region, our simulation results indicate that the flux cancellation due to collisional shearing plays a critical role in the formation of the flux rope, corresponding to a substantial increase in magnetic free energy and helicity. Regarding the eruption stage, the deformation of the flux rope during its eruption can cause an increase in the downward tension force, which suppresses it from further rising. This finding may shed light on why some torus-unstable flux ropes lead to failed eruptions after large-angle rotations. Moreover, we find that twisted fluxes can accumulate during confined eruptions, which would breed the subsequent eruptive flares.

本文使用时间域模拟木星观测来测试和开发Simons Observatory Small Aperture Telescopes的光束重建管道。该方法依赖于一个地图制作程序，用于估计和减去相关的大气噪声，以及一个旨在补偿地图制作程序引起的偏差的光束拟合代码。我们针对四个不同频段的重建性能进行了测试，测试了各种算法参数、大气条件和输入光束。我们还展示了重建质量与可用观测次数的关系，并研究了不同的校准策略如何影响光束不确定性。对于所有考虑的情况，我们发现在多极范围ℓ = 30-700时，拟合结果与输入光束模型之间存在∼1.5%的误差，并在多极范围ℓ = 50-200时存在∼0.5%的误差。最后，我们使用谐波域分量分离算法来验证我们分析中观察到的光束重建误差和偏差对Simons Observatory r测量的影响不大。 <br /><br /> <div>
We use time-domain simulations of Jupiter observations to test and develop a beam reconstruction pipeline for the Simons Observatory Small Aperture Telescopes. The method relies on a mapmaker that estimates and subtracts correlated atmospheric noise and a beam fitting code designed to compensate for the bias caused by the mapmaker. We test our reconstruction performance for four different frequency bands against various algorithmic parameters, atmospheric conditions, and input beams. We additionally show the reconstruction quality as a function of the number of available observations and investigate how different calibration strategies affect the beam uncertainty. For all of the cases considered, we find good agreement between the fitted results and the input beam model within an ∼1.5% error for a multipole range ℓ = 30–700 and an ∼0.5% error for a multipole range ℓ = 50–200. We conclude by using a harmonic-domain component separation algorithm to verify that the beam reconstruction errors and biases observed in our analysis do not significantly bias the Simons Observatory r-measurement

Some quasi-thermal (QT)-dominated gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) could be well described by a multicolor blackbody (mBB) function or a combined model of a BB plus a nonthermal (NT) component. In this analysis, two QT radiation-dominated bursts with known emission properties (GRB 210610B, likely from a hybrid jet, and GRB 210121A, with a spectrum consistent with nondissipative photospheric emission from a pure hot fireball) are used to make a comparison between these two models. To diagnose the magnetization properties of the central engine, the “top-down” approach proposed by Gao and Zhang is adopted. It is found that diagnoses based on these two models provide similar conclusions qualitatively; however, the model with mBB (or mBB+NT) may give more reasonable physical explanations. This implies that impacts from the GRB jet structure and geometrical broadening on the observed spectrum should be considered. However, conservatively, these methods may be not sensitive enough to distinguish between a pure hot fireball and a mildly magnetized hybrid jet. Some other information is necessary to provide more evidence when determining the jet properties for similar GRBs. Based on these considerations, we suggest that the photospheric emission of GRB 221022B is from a hot jet, where dissipation is caused by an internal shock mechanism due to the increasing Lorentz factor with time, which makes its prompt emission display typical evolution from thermal to NT.

总结:<br /><br />本研究报告了Parker Solar Probe（PSP）在第二次接触阶段通过低密度磁通道时检测到的一种弱太阳射电爆发（SRB）。这些弱SRB具有较低的起始频率（约20 MHz）和窄的频率范围（从几十MHz到几百kHz）。它们的动态谱显示出一个明显的演化特征，即中间相对漂移速率从0.01 s-1以上迅速下降至0.01 s-1以下。基于太阳冕等离子体的常见经验模型分析表明，这些弱SRB源自于约1.1-6.1个太阳半径的太阳风加速区，其等离子体的β值较低，其源的运动速度typical是∼vA（Alfvén速度），明显低于有效激发SRB所需的快电子的运动速度。我们提出，孤立的动力阿尔文波可能负责产生这些小尺度的弱SRB，称为孤立波辐射。 <div>
The Parker Solar Probe (PSP) provides us with an unprecedentedly close approach to the observation of the Sun and hence the possibility of directly understanding the elementary process that occurs on the kinetic scale of particles' collective interaction in solar coronal plasmas. We report a type of weak solar radio burst (SRB) that was detected by PSP when it passed a low-density magnetic channel during its second encounter phase. These weak SRBs have a low starting frequency of ∼20 MHz and a narrow frequency range from a few tens of MHz to a few hundred kHz. Their dynamic spectra display a strongly evolving feature of the intermediate relative drift rate decreasing rapidly from above 0.01 s−1 to below 0.01 s−1. Analyses based on common empirical models of solar coronal plasmas indicate that these weak SRBs originate from a heliocentric distance of ∼1.1–6.1 RS (the solar radius), a typical solar wind acceleration region with a low-β plasma, and that their sources have a typical motion velocity of ∼vA (Alfvén velocity) obviously lower than that of the fast electrons required to effectively excite SRBs. We propose that solitary kinetic Alfvén waves with kinetic scales could be responsible for the generation of these small-scale weak SRBs, called solitary wave radiation.

Recent observations of galaxy clusters and groups with misalignments between their central active galactic nucleus jets and X-ray cavities, or with multiple misaligned cavities, have raised concerns about the jet–bubble connection in cooling cores, and the processes responsible for jet realignment. To investigate the frequency and causes of such misalignments, we construct a sample of 16 cool core galaxy clusters and groups. Using Very Long Baseline Array radio data, we measure the parsec-scale position angle of the jets, and compare it with the position angle of the X-ray cavities detected in Chandra data. Using the overall sample and selected subsets, we consistently find that there is a 30%–38% chance to find a misalignment larger than ΔΨ = 45° when observing a cluster/group with a detected jet and at least one cavity. We determine that projection may account for an apparently large ΔΨ only in a fraction of objects (∼35%), and given that gas dynamical disturbances (such as sloshing) are found in both aligned and misaligned systems, we exclude environmental perturbation as the main driver of cavity–jet misalignment. Moreover, we find that large misalignments (up to ∼90°) are favored over smaller ones (45° ≤ ΔΨ ≤ 70°), and that the change in jet direction can occur on timescales between one and a few tens of Myr. We conclude that misalignments are more likely related to actual reorientation of the jet axis, and we discuss several engine-based mechanisms that may cause these dramatic changes.

We present radio and X-ray studies of A3444 and MS1455.0+2232, two galaxy clusters with radio minihalos in their cool cores. A3444 is imaged using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) at 333, 607, and 1300 MHz and the Very Large Array at 1435 MHz. Most of the minihalo is contained within r &lt; 120 kpc, but a fainter extension, stretching out to 380 kpc southwest of the center, is detected at 607 MHz. Using Chandra, we detect four X-ray sloshing cold fronts: three in the cool core at r = 60, 120, and 230 kpc, and a fourth one at r = 400 kpc—in the region of the southwestern radio extension—suggesting that the intracluster medium (ICM) is sloshing on a cluster-wide scale. The radio emission is contained within the envelope defined by these fronts. We also analyzed archival 383 MHz GMRT and Chandra observations of MS 1455.0+2232, which exhibits a known minihalo with its bright part delineated by cold fronts inside the cool core, but with a faint extension beyond the core. Similarly to A3444, we find a cold front at r ∼ 425 kpc, containing the radio emission. Thus the entire diffuse radio emission seen in these clusters appears to be related to large-scale sloshing of the ICM. The radio spectrum of the A3444 minihalo is a power law with a steep index α = 1.0 ± 0.1. The spectrum steepens with increasing distance from the center, as expected if the minihalo originates from reacceleration of relativistic particles by the sloshing-induced turbulence in the ICM.

The J-region Asymptotic Giant Branch (JAGB) method is a standard candle that leverages the constant luminosities of color-selected, carbon-rich AGB stars, measured in the near-infrared at 1.2 μm. The Chicago-Carnegie Hubble Program has obtained JWST imaging of the SN Ia host galaxies NGC 7250, NGC 4536, and NGC 3972. With these observations, the JAGB method can be studied for the first time using JWST. Lee et al. demonstrated the JAGB magnitude is optimally measured in the outer disks of galaxies, because in the inner regions the JAGB magnitude can vary significantly due to a confluence of reddening, blending, and crowding effects. However, determining where the “outer disk” lies can be subjective. Therefore, we introduce a novel method for systematically selecting the outer disk. In a given galaxy, the JAGB magnitude is first separately measured in concentric regions, and the “outer disk” is then defined as the first radial bin where the JAGB magnitude stabilizes to a few hundredths of a magnitude. After successfully employing this method in our JWST galaxy sample, we find the JAGB stars are well segregated from other stellar populations in color–magnitude space, and have observed dispersions about their individual F115W modes of σN7250 = 0.32 mag, σN4536 = 0.34 mag, and σN3972 = 0.35 mag. These measured dispersions are similar to the scatter measured for the JAGB stars in the LMC using 2MASS data (σ = 0.33 mag). In conclusion, the JAGB stars as observed with JWST clearly demonstrate their considerable power both as high-precision extragalactic distance indicators and as SN Ia supernova calibrators.

<title>Formation of Massive Black Holes with M = (103–108) M

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The presence of supermassive black holes with M ∼ 109M⊙ hosted by the luminous quasars at cosmological redshift z ≥ 6 is still an open problem in astrophysical cosmology. Here we study the formation of massive black holes at high redshift (z ≫ 7) through Hoyle–Lyttleton–Bondi accretion of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) onto a 20 M⊙ seed black hole moving with a velocity ∼100 km s−1 inside the short, mean-free path region of an SIDM halo. We consider observational constraints on a specific SIDM cross section, σ/mdm = (0.1–5) cm2 g−1. Formation timescale of massive black holes with M = (103–108) M⊙ is calculated for the universal Navarro–Frenk–White (NFW) profile, singular isothermal sphere (SIS), other power-law profiles with a cusp index 2.19 ≤ γ ≤ 2.5 of accreted dark matter, and modified-core isothermal profiles. The ambient sound speed is taken as Cs = (10–100) km s−1. It is found that an NFW profile with halo concentration C = 4.75–32.58 estimated at z = 20 and 30 for halo masses M200 = (1012–1014) M⊙ favors formation of massive black holes with M = (103–108) M⊙ at high redshift, well before quasar epoch. In this profile, these black holes grow within timescales (0.1–69) Myr at z = 16–20. For the SIS profile, the black hole formation timescales are short compared to NFW. For power-law profiles, massive black holes with M = (106–108) M⊙ grow within a few tens to 100 Myr (z = 5–30). For modified-core isothermal profiles, the timescale of massive black hole formation is in the range (0.79–464.08) Myr (z = 8–30).

在这项研究中，研究人员通过测量95个类星体样本的g和i光度带之间的滞后时间，研究了吸积盘尺寸与类星体性质之间的关系。他们发现样本中存在一些比Shakura和Sunyaev模型预测的延迟时间更长或更短的情况，这需要解释。研究还探讨了不同波长对漫射广谱线区（BLR）污染的影响，并发现了与红移范围密切相关的一些特性。此外，研究人员还发现了一些与先前研究相矛盾的结果，如在他们的样本中并未检测到连续谱和BLR滞后之间的显著相关性。最后，他们得出结论认为，漫射BLR对滞后的影响不太可能是由于鲍德温效应，而更可能是由于低亮度活动星系核中连续谱滞后时间的反相关性。 <br /><br />总结: 在这项研究中，研究人员研究了吸积盘尺寸与类星体性质之间的关系，并发现了一些令人意外的结果。他们还探讨了不同波长的影响以及与漫射BLR的关联性，并得出结论认为，连续谱滞后时间的反相关性可能不是由于鲍德温效应。另外，他们还提出了一些模型来解释这些现象。 <div>
This work studies the relationship between accretion-disk size and quasar properties, using a sample of 95 quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Reverberation Mapping Project with measured lags between the g and i photometric bands. Our sample includes disk lags that are both longer and shorter than predicted by the Shakura and Sunyaev model, requiring explanations that satisfy both cases. Although our quasars each have one lag measurement, we explore the wavelength-dependent effects of diffuse broad-line region (BLR) contamination through our sample’s broad redshift range, 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 1.2. We do not find significant evidence of variable diffuse Fe ii and Balmer nebular emission in the rms spectra, nor from Anderson–Darling tests of quasars in redshift ranges with and without diffuse nebular emission falling in the observed-frame filters. Contrary to previous work, we do not detect a significant correlation between the measured continuum and BLR lags in our luminous quasar sample, similarly suggesting that our continuum lags are not dominated by diffuse nebular emission. Similar to other studies, we find that quasars with larger-than-expected continuum lags have lower 3000 Å luminosities, and we additionally find longer continuum lags with lower X-ray luminosities and black hole masses. Our lack of evidence for diffuse BLR contribution to the lags indicates that the anticorrelation between continuum lag and luminosity is not likely to be due to the Baldwin effect. Instead, these anticorrelations favor models in which the continuum lag increases in lower-luminosity active galactic nuclei, including scenarios featuring magnetic coupling between the accretion disk and X-ray corona, and/or ripples or rims in the disk.

总结:<br /><br /> 这项研究针对质量为100到200太阳质量的旋转原始恒星进行了新的演化模型计算。他们考虑了恒星自转、脉动驱动的质量损失和辐射风等因素，并和初始金属丰度Z = 0和Z = 0.0002进行了比较。他们发现部分模型会在引力波不稳定阶段产生成功的伽马射线爆发（GRB），而另一部分模型则会直接坍缩成黑洞，产生喷射驱动的超新星事件。这些研究成果有望帮助我们更好地理解恒星演化和宇宙中的GRB和黑洞形成，对于探索宇宙中的恒星形成和演化具有重要意义。 <div>
We calculate new evolutionary models of rotating primordial very massive stars, with initial mass from 100 M⊙ to 200 M⊙, for two values of the initial metallicity Z = 0 and Z = 0.0002. For the first time in this mass range, we consider stellar rotation and pulsation-driven mass loss, along with radiative winds. The models evolve from the zero-age main sequence until the onset of pair-instability. We discuss the main properties of the models during their evolution and then focus on the final fate and the possible progenitors of jet-driven events. All tracks that undergo pulsational-pair instability produce successful gamma-ray bursts (GRB) in the collapsar framework, while those that collapse directly to black holes (BH) produce jet-driven supernova events. In these latter cases, the expected black hole mass changes due to the jet propagation inside the progenitor, resulting in different models that should produce BH within the pair-instability black hole mass gap. Successful GRBs predicted here from zero metallicity, and very metal-poor progenitors, may be bright enough to be detected even up to redshift ∼20 using current telescopes such as the Swift-BAT X-ray detector and the JWST.

<title>Dynamical Stellar Mass-to-light Ratio Gradients: Evidence for Very Centrally Concentrated IMF Variations in ETGs?</title>

<div> 关键词：初始质量函数，早期星系，Schwarzschild 模型，星际物质，动力学证据<br />
总结:<br />
这篇文章讨论了对大质量早期星系（ETGs）初始质量函数（IMF）的不同探测方法所得到的结果存在矛盾。研究构建了Schwarzschild模型，使用MUSE和SINFONI观测，发现了动力学证据表明ETGs的质量光比率ϒ向中心增加。研究发现恒定ϒ模型可能会高估星系的质量。在大多数情况下，总动力学质量最小值出现在大约1千光年处，并且对IMF的监管提供最强的限制。在主体区域，发现了类似于银河系的IMF，而在中心区域，发现了具有增加质量归一化的区域，但比之前的研究所暗示的要温和一些，仍然指向了类似于Salpeter IMF的情况。 <div>
Evidence from different probes of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) of massive early-type galaxies (ETGs) has repeatedly converged on IMFs more bottom heavy than in the Milky Way (MW). This consensus has come under scrutiny due to often contradictory results from different methods on the level of individual galaxies. In particular, a number of strong lensing probes are ostensibly incompatible with a non-MW IMF. Radial gradients of the IMF—related to gradients of the stellar mass-to-light ratio ϒ—can potentially resolve this issue. We construct Schwarzschild models allowing for ϒ-gradients in seven massive ETGs with MUSE and SINFONI observations. We find dynamical evidence that ϒ increases toward the center for all ETGs. The gradients are confined to subkiloparsec scales. Our results suggest that constant-ϒ models may overestimate the stellar mass of galaxies by up to a factor of 1.5. For all except one galaxy, we find a radius where the total dynamical mass has a minimum. This minimum places the strongest constraints on the IMF outside the center and appears at roughly 1 kpc. We consider the IMF at this radius characteristic for the main body of each ETG. In terms of the IMF mass-normalization α relative to a Kroupa IMF, we find on average an MW-like IMF 〈αmain〉 = 1.03 ± 0.19. In the centers, we find concentrated regions with increased mass normalizations that are less extreme than previous studies suggested, but still point to a Salpeter-like IMF, 〈αcen〉 = 1.54 ± 0.15.

总结: 本研究使用Dark Energy Survey (DES)的数据进行了对太阳系至0.3至2Mpc外淡淡星系的系统广域搜索。搜索并未发现新的外围星系，但发现了一候选矮星系，距离为2.2Mpc，可能是地方星系NGC 55的卫星。该矮星系具有极低的表面亮度和巨大的扩散，表明可能受到其宿主的潮汐相互作用的影响。通过合成星系，研究得出了对于距离在0.3至2.0Mpc处的矮星系的检测效率，并且估计了发现的候选矮星系的绝对视星等和半光半径。 <div>
We report results from a systematic wide-area search for faint dwarf galaxies at heliocentric distances from 0.3 to 2 Mpc using the full 6 yr of data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES). Unlike previous searches over the DES data, this search specifically targeted a field population of faint galaxies located beyond the Milky Way virial radius. We derive our detection efficiency for faint, resolved dwarf galaxies in the Local Volume with a set of synthetic galaxies and expect our search to be complete to MV ∼ (−7, −10) mag for galaxies at D = (0.3, 2.0) Mpc. We find no new field dwarfs in the DES footprint, but we report the discovery of one high-significance candidate dwarf galaxy at a distance of {2.2}_{-0.12}^{+0.05}\,\mathrm{Mpc}, a potential satellite of the Local Volume galaxy NGC 55, separated by 47′ (physical separation as small as 30 kpc). We estimate this dwarf galaxy to have an absolute V-band magnitude of -{8.0}_{-0.3}^{+0.5}\,\mathrm{mag} and an azimuthally averaged physical half-light radius of {2.2}_{-0.4}^{+0.5}\,\mathrm{kpc}, making this one of the lowest surface brightness galaxies ever found with \mu =32.3\,\mathrm{mag}\,{\mathrm{arcsec}}^{-2}. This is the largest, most diffuse galaxy known at this luminosity, suggesting possible tidal interactions with its host.

总结: <br />
本研究观察到了与电子涡旋相关的亚离子尺度磁隆（MHu)与DF的关联，通过加强磁场的三个分量。MHu中存在径向电场，显示双极变化，主要归因于电子对流项。在MHu前部，存在明显的能量转换（J·E∼−0.3 nW m−3），伴随着电磁能量的流入和流出。DF的其他区域存在相反的能量转换。此外，MHu中还观察到了宽带平行的静电波。这些发现为我们提供了对DF的动力尺度过程的洞察。<br /><br /> <div>
As the plasma boundary between two distinct plasma populations, dipolarization fronts (DFs) host abundant kinetic-scale substructures that change their normal directions and thus cause their deformation. However, studies on such deformation caused by an electron vortex have been lacking. Here, we present novel observations of a subion-scale magnetic hump (MHu) associated with an oblique electron vortex at a DF through strengthening three components of the magnetic field. A radial electric field in the MHu, showing bipolar variation, is also associated with the electron vortex as it is mainly ascribed to the electron convection term. There is apparent energy conversion (\overrightarrow{J}\cdot \overrightarrow{E}∼−0.3 nw m−3) from the particles to the electromagnetic field in the MHu’s leading part, which is accompanied by inflow and outflow of electromagnetic energy (nonzero {\rm{\nabla }}\cdot \overrightarrow{S}). The other regions of the DF host opposite energy conversion (\overrightarrow{J}\cdot \overrightarrow{E} &gt; 0). Broadband parallel electrostatic waves are also observed in the MHu. Our study provides insights into the kinetic-scale processes at DFs.

本文对太阳型恒星的软X射线耀斑进行了统计研究。使用了Chandra Source Catalog Release 2.0和Gaia Data Release 3等数据源，开发了一套方法来识别和分类恒星软X射线耀斑并估算其特性。主要结果包括：耀斑能量范围在10^33到10^37之间，大多数为超级耀斑，并且发现耀斑持续时间与能量呈正相关关系；恒星耀斑能量的频率分布与其他波段和其他类型的恒星相似，表明软X射线波段辐射机制可能是全波段辐射能量的恒定分数。 <div>
The statistical characteristics of stellar flares at optical bands have received extensive study, but they remain to be studied at soft X-ray bands, in particular for solar-type stars. Here, we present a statistical study of soft X-ray flares on solar-type stars, which can help in understanding the multiwavelength behaviors of stellar flares. We mainly use Chandra Source Catalog Release 2.0, which includes a number of flaring stars with denoted variability, and Gaia Data Release 3, which includes the necessary information for classifying stars. We also develop a set of methods for identifying and classifying stellar soft X-ray flares and estimating their properties. A detailed statistical investigation of 129 flare samples on 103 nearby solar-type stars as selected yields the following main results. (1) The flare energy emitted at the soft X-ray band in our sample ranges from ∼1033 to ∼1037 erg, and the majority of them are superflares, with the most energetic one having energy of {6.0}_{-4.7}^{+3.2}\times {10}^{37}\ \mathrm{erg}. (2) The flare duration is related to its energy as formulated by {T}_{\mathrm{duration},\mathrm{SXR}}\propto {E}_{\mathrm{flare},\mathrm{SXR}}^{\ 0.201\pm 0.024}, which is different from those derived at optical and near-IR bands, indicating distinct radiation mechanisms at different bands. (3) The frequency distribution of stellar flares as a function of energy is formulated as {{dN}}_{\mathrm{flare}}/{{dE}}_{\mathrm{flare},\mathrm{SXR}}\propto {E}_{\mathrm{flare},\mathrm{SXR}}^{\ -1.77}, which is similar to the results found at other bands and on other types of stars, indicating that the energy emitted at the soft X-ray band could be a constant fraction of the full-band bolometric energy.

研究利用13CO谱学数据从GRS、FUGIN和SEDIGSM调查中与银河系涡旋臂相关的六个巨型丝状结构中的磁场结构，采用速度梯度技术（VGT）。与尘埃极化发射不同，VGT允许我们使用速度信息来区分前景和背景，并可可靠地确定磁场的方向。大多数情况下，我们发现磁场与丝状结构保持一致，并与盘面平行。所得的结果暗示银河剪切可能塑造了这些丝状结构。磁场在我们分析的分辨率下可以保持正常方向，这表明即使在湍流通过时间短于剪切时间的情况下，湍流运动也不能有效地破坏磁场的规则定向。在一些丝状结构中发现的间断可能是由包括丝状结构重组、引力坍缩和恒星反馈在内的过程所引起的。

We study the magnetic field structures in six giant filaments associated with the spiral arms of the Milky Way by applying the velocity gradient technique (VGT) to the 13CO spectroscopic data from the GRS, FUGIN, and SEDIGSM surveys. Unlike dust-polarized emission, the VGT allows us to separate the foreground and background using the velocity information, from which the orientation of the magnetic field can be reliably determined. We find that in most cases the magnetic fields stay aligned with the filament bodies, which are parallel to the disk midplane. Among these, G29, G47, and G51 exhibit smooth magnetic fields, and G24, G339, and G349 exhibit discontinuities. The fact that most filaments have magnetic fields that stay aligned with the Galactic disk midplane suggests that Galactic shear may be responsible for shaping the filaments. The fact that the magnetic field can stay regular at the resolution of our analysis (≲10 pc), where the turbulence crossing time is short compared to the shear time, suggests that turbulent motion cannot effectively disrupt the regular orientation of the magnetic field. The discontinuities found in some filaments can be caused by processes including filament reassembly, gravitational collapse, and stellar feedback.

<div> Prestellar core, Filamentary structure, Nucleus, Density, CO depletion

总结:
在Orion分子云3（OMC-3）区域内研究了G208-N2前恒星核的内部结构。通过Atacama大型毫米/亚毫米阵列，发现尘埃连续辐射呈丝状结构，长度约5000天文单位，平均H2体积密度约为6×107cm−3。在丝状结构的顶端发现一个半径约150-200天文单位，质量约为0.1太阳质量的核心。核心的中心密度约为2×109cm−3，径向密度剖面为r−1.87±0.11。该核心的密度缩放约为奇异等温球体（SIS）的3.7倍，这以及非常低的维里参数0.39表明重力在核心内部处于主导地位。然而，没有CO流的迹象局限在这个核心区域内。丝状结构由N2D+ 3-2发射追踪，但不是由C18O 2-1发射追踪，这意味着由于高密度和低温度而导致显著的CO耗尽。指向核心的N2D+也显示出衰减的特征。这可能意味着父分子N2的耗竭，或者存在着能够使CO在非常小的区域升华的内嵌非常低辐射的中心源。G208-N2中的核心被认为是处于首次静水压核（FHSC）形成边缘的前恒星核，或者是FHSC的候选者。 <div>
The internal structure of the prestellar core G208.68-19.02-N2 (G208-N2) in the Orion Molecular Cloud 3 (OMC-3) region has been studied with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The dust continuum emission revealed a filamentary structure with a length of ∼5000 au and an average H2 volume density of ∼6 × 107 cm−3. At the tip of this filamentary structure, there is a compact object, which we call a nucleus, with a radius of ∼150–200 au and a mass of ∼0.1 M⊙. The nucleus has a central density of ∼2 × 109 cm−3 with a radial density profile of r−1.87±0.11. The density scaling of the nucleus is ∼3.7 times higher than that of the singular isothermal sphere (SIS). This as well as the very low virial parameter of 0.39 suggests that the gravity is dominant over the pressure everywhere in the nucleus. However, there is no sign of CO outflow localized to this nucleus. The filamentary structure is traced by the N2D+ 3–2 emission, but not by the C18O 2–1 emission, implying the significant CO depletion due to high density and cold temperature. Toward the nucleus, the N2D+ also shows the signature of depletion. This could imply either the depletion of the parent molecule, N2, or the presence of the embedded very-low luminosity central source that could sublimate the CO in the very small area. The nucleus in G208-N2 is considered to be a prestellar core on the verge of first hydrostatic core (FHSC) formation or a candidate for the FHSC.

总结:<br />
这篇文章利用气流悬浮系统在还原大气中进行了RP球粒的再现实验，发现自然RP球粒中的铁分配系数DFe要高于实验再现的结果，表明在高温下球粒形成后，玻璃基质中的铁被移除。实验中发现玻璃基质中形成了许多小的铁金属包裹体，证实了自然RP球粒中DFe增加的过程。因此，RP球粒的DFe可以用来限制球粒形成过程中的冷却速率和氧化还原状态。 <div>
Reproduction experiments of radial pyroxene (RP) chondrules were carried out using an Ar–H2 or Ar gas-jet levitation system in a reducing atmosphere in order to simulate chondrule formation in the protoplanetary disk. The experiments reproduced RP-chondrule textures, consisting of sets of thin pyroxene crystals and mesostasis glass between crystals. However, iron partition coefficients between pyroxene and glassy mesostasis (DFe =Fe mol%pyroxene/Fe mol%mesostasis) in natural RP chondrules were much higher than that in the experimentally reproduced RP chondrules. The high DFe in natural RP chondrules suggests that iron was removed from the mesostasis melt at high temperatures after the growth of pyroxene crystals. We found that many small iron-metal inclusions had formed in the mesostasis glass, indicating that FeO in the high-temperature melt of mesostasis was reduced to metallic iron, and iron in the mesostasis diffused into the newly formed metal inclusions. The formation of the iron-metal inclusions in the mesostasis was reproduced by our experiments in a reducing atmosphere, confirming that DFe in natural RP chondrules increased after the growth of RP crystals. Therefore, the DFe of RP chondrules can be an indicator to constrain cooling rates and redox states during chondrule formation.

<br /><br />
总结: 该研究使用Cloudy模拟了氧、氖等物种的禁区线排放，以追踪原行星盘的风。他们采用了参数化的磁热风模型，这些模型在一定程度上与光蒸发和磁离心风的特征相似，且受到了近期理论研究的青睐。他们发现，可行的风参数可以产生线的宽窄低速成分，而传统的风模型往往难以做到这一点。此外，线的亮度、蓝移、宽度以及这些随着吸积光度和盘倾角的趋势与观测结果一致。 <div>
Emission in forbidden lines of oxygen, neon, and other species are commonly used to trace winds from protoplanetary disks. Using Cloudy, we calculate such emission for parametrized wind models of the magnetothermal type, following Bai et al. These models share characteristics with both photoevaporative and magnetocentrifugal winds, which can be regarded as end members, and are favored by recent theoretical research. Both broad and narrow low-velocity components of the lines can be produced with plausible wind parameters, something that traditional wind models have difficulty with. Line luminosities, blueshifts, and widths, as well as trends of these with accretion luminosity and disk inclination, are in general accordance with observations.

<div> late-M and L dwarfs, forward-modeling analysis, BT-Settl model atmospheres, systematic behavior, interstellar medium–like reddening law
<br />
通过对90个年轻移动星团、昴星团和母牛座中的晚期M型和L型矮星进行低分辨率近红外光谱和BT-Settl模型大气的统一前向建模分析，研究了这些矮星的有效温度、表面重力、半径和质量。得到的观测参数与基于演化模型计算得到的参数存在系统性偏差，特别是在M-L谱型边界附近的物体。研究发现模型光谱有过度预测J-和H-带的峰值流量，表明模型大气中包含的尘埃含量不足以匹配观测。通过在BT-Settl模型光谱中引入类似于星际介质的红化定律，发现模型和观测谱的拟合得到了很大改善，而M-L转变处的红化系数最大。这项工作对BT-Settl模型大气进行了系统的研究，是迄今为止最大的Late-M和L型棕矮星的光谱分析。 
<br /><br />总结: Late-M和L型矮星通过低分辨率近红外光谱和BT-Settl模型大气的前向建模进行了详细分析。观测参数与基于演化模型计算得到的参数存在系统性偏差，尤其是在M-L谱型边界处。对模型光谱引入红化定律可以极大改善模型和观测谱的拟合，表明模型大气中的尘埃含量不足以匹配观测。这项工作是对BT-Settl模型大气最大的系统研究，也是迄今为止最大的Late-M和L型棕矮星的光谱分析。 <div>
We present a uniform forward-modeling analysis of 90 late-M and L dwarfs in nearby young (∼10–200 Myr) moving groups, the Pleiades, and the Hyades using low-resolution (R ≈ 150) near-infrared (0.9–2.4 μm) spectra and the BT-Settl model atmospheres. We derive the objects’ effective temperatures, surface gravities, radii, and masses by comparing our spectra to the models using a Bayesian framework with nested sampling and calculate the same parameters using evolutionary models. Assuming the evolutionary-based parameters are more robust, our spectroscopically inferred parameters from BT-Settl exhibit two types of systematic behavior for objects near the M-L spectral type boundary. Several objects are clustered around Teff ≈ 1800 K and \mathrm{log}g\approx 5.5 dex, implying impossibly large masses (150–1400 MJup), while others are clustered around Teff ≳ 3000 K and \mathrm{log}g\lesssim 3.0 dex, implying unphysically low masses and unreasonably young ages. We find the fitted BT-Settl model spectra tend to overpredict the peak J- and H-band flux for objects located near the M-L boundary, suggesting the dust content included in the model atmospheres is insufficient to match the observations. By adding an interstellar medium–like reddening law to the BT-Settl model spectra, we find the fits between models and observed spectra are greatly improved, with the largest reddening coefficients occurring at the M-L transition. This work delivers a systematic examination of the BT-Settl model atmospheres and constitutes the largest spectral analysis of benchmark late-M- and L-type brown dwarfs to date.

<title>Brightest Cluster Galaxy Formation in the z = 4.3 Protocluster SPT 2349-56: Discovery of a Radio-loud Active Galactic Nucleus</title>

<div> 高红移星系团；AGN；射电观测；SMG；ALMA<br />
总结:<br />
研究了位于z = 4.3的高红移星系团SPT2349−56，通过射电观测探测到了其中的射电活动星系核（AGN）。AGN的射电亮度远高于预期，表明其可能受到形成最亮星系团星系的驱动。与其他样本和高红移强射电星系相比较结果。研究发现，射电活动AGN可能给星系团内介质提供了强大的反馈作用。 <div>
We have observed the z = 4.3 protocluster SPT2349−56 with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) with the aim of detecting radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGNs) among the ∼30 submillimeter (submm) galaxies (SMGs) identified in the structure. We detect the central complex of submm sources at 2.2 GHz with a luminosity of L2.2  = (4.42 ± 0.56)  ×  1025 W Hz−1. MeerKAT and the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder also detect the source at 816 MHz and 888 MHz, respectively, constraining the radio spectral index to α = −1.45 ± 0.16, implying L1.4,rest  = (2.2 ± 0.2) × 1026 W Hz−1. The radio observations do not have sufficient spatial resolution to uniquely identify one of the three Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) galaxies as the AGN, however the ALMA source properties themselves suggest a likely host. This radio luminosity is ∼100× higher than expected from star formation, assuming the usual far-infrared–radio correlation, indicating an AGN driven by a forming brightest cluster galaxy. None of the SMGs in SPT2349−56 show signs of AGNs in any other diagnostics available to us, highlighting the radio continuum as a powerful probe of obscured AGNs. We compare these results to field samples of radio sources and SMGs, along with the 22 gravitationally lensed SPT-SMGs also observed in the ATCA program, as well as powerful radio galaxies at high redshifts. The (3.3 ± 0.7) ×  1038 W of power from the radio-loud AGN sustained over 100 Myr is comparable to the binding energy of the gas mass of the central halo, and similar to the instantaneous energy injection from supernova feedback from the SMGs in the core region. The SPT2349−56 radio-loud AGNs may be providing strong feedback on a nascent intracluster medium.

<title>KilonovAE: Exploring Kilonova Spectral Features with Autoencoders</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Kilonovae are likely a key site of heavy r-process element production in the Universe, and their optical/infrared spectra contain insights into both the properties of the ejecta and the conditions of the r-process. However, the event GW170817/AT2017gfo is the only kilonova so far with well-observed spectra. To understand the diversity of absorption features that might be observed in future kilonovae spectra, we use the TARDIS Monte Carlo radiative transfer code to simulate a suite of optical spectra spanning a wide range of kilonova ejecta properties and r-process abundance patterns. To identify the most common and prominent absorption lines, we perform dimensionality reduction using an autoencoder, and we find spectra clusters in the latent space representation using a Bayesian Gaussian Mixture model. Our synthetic kilonovae spectra commonly display strong absorption by strontium 38Sr ii, yttrium 38Y ii, and zirconium 40Zr i–ii, with strong lanthanide contributions at low electron fractions (Ye ≲ 0.25). When a new kilonova is observed, our machine-learning framework will provide context on the dominant absorption lines and key ejecta properties, helping to determine where this event falls within the larger “zoo” of kilonovae spectra.

<title>A Census of Star Formation Histories of Massive Galaxies at 0.6 < z <  1 from Spectrophotometric Modeling Using Bagpipes and Prospector</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad0c4e</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present individual star formation histories (SFHs) of ∼3000 massive galaxies (log(M*/M⊙) &gt; 10.5) from the Large Early Galaxy Astrophysics Census spectroscopic survey at a lookback time of ∼7 billion yr and quantify the population trends leveraging 20 hr deep-integrated spectra of these ∼1800 star-forming and ∼1200 quiescent galaxies at 0.6 &lt; z &lt; 1.0. Essentially all galaxies at this epoch contain stars of age &lt;3 Gyr, in contrast with older massive galaxies today, facilitating better recovery of previous generations of star formation at cosmic noon and earlier. We conduct spectrophotometric analysis using parametric and nonparametric Bayesian stellar population synthesis modeling tools—Bagpipes and Prospector—to constrain the median SFHs of this mass complete sample and characterize population trends. A consistent picture arises for the late-time stellar mass growth when quantified as t50 and t90, corresponding to the age of the Universe when galaxies formed 50% and 90% of their total stellar mass, although the two methods disagree at the earliest formation times (e.g., t10). Our results reveal trends in both stellar mass and stellar velocity dispersion as in the local Universe—low-mass galaxies with shallower potential wells grow their stellar masses later in cosmic history compared to high-mass galaxies. Unlike local quiescent galaxies, the median duration of late-time star formation (τSF,late = t90–t50) does not consistently depend on the stellar mass. This census sets a benchmark for future deep spectrophotometric studies of the more distant Universe.

<title>Magnetic Fields of the Starless Core L 1512</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad0cc1</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present JCMT POL-2 850 μm dust polarization observations and Mimir H-band stellar polarization observations toward the starless core L 1512. We detect the highly ordered core-scale magnetic field traced by the POL-2 data, of which the field orientation is consistent with the parsec-scale magnetic fields traced by Planck data, suggesting the large-scale fields thread from the low-density region to the dense core region in this cloud. The surrounding magnetic field traced by the Mimir data shows a wider variation in the field orientation, suggesting there could be a transition of magnetic field morphology at the envelope-scale. L 1512 was suggested to be presumably older than 1.4 Myr in a previous study via time-dependent chemical analysis, hinting that the magnetic field could be strong enough to slow the collapse of L 1512. In this study, we use the Davis–Chandrasekhar–Fermi method to derive a plane-of-sky magnetic field strength (Bpos) of 18 ± 7 μG and an observed mass-to-flux ratio (λobs) of 3.5 ± 2.4, suggesting that L 1512 is magnetically supercritical. However, the absence of significant infall motion and the presence of an oscillating envelope are inconsistent with the magnetically supercritical condition. Using a virial analysis, we suggest the presence of a hitherto hidden line-of-sight magnetic field strength of ∼27 μG with a mass-to-flux ratio (λtot) of ∼1.6, in which case both magnetic and kinetic pressures are important in supporting the L 1512 core. On the other hand, L 1512 may have just reached supercriticality and will collapse at any time.

<title>Testing the Polarization of Gravitational-wave Background with the LISA-TianQin Network</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
While general relativity predicts only two tensor modes for gravitational-wave (GW) polarization, general metric theories of gravity allow for up to four additional modes, including two vector and two scalar modes. Observing the polarization modes of GWs could provide a direct test of the modified gravity. The stochastic GW background (SGWB), which can be detected by space-based laser-interferometric detectors at design sensitivity, will provide an opportunity to directly measure alternative polarization. In this paper, we investigate the performance of the LISA-TianQin network for detecting alternative polarizations of stochastic backgrounds, and propose a method to separate different polarization modes. First, we generalize the small antenna approximation to compute the overlap reduction functions for the SGWB with arbitrary polarization, which is suitable for any time-delay interferometry combination. Then we analyze the detection capability of LISA-TianQin for the SGWB with different polarizations. Based on the orbital characteristics of LISA-TianQin, we propose a method to distinguish different polarization modes from their mixed data. Finally, simulation tests are performed to verify the effectiveness of the method. The results of the simulations demonstrate that LISA-TianQin, when employing our proposed method, has the ability to differentiate between various polarization modes, with a specific emphasis on the ability to distinguish between the breathing and longitudinal modes.

<title>Atmospheric Escape From Three Terrestrial Planets in the L 98-59 System</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A critically important process affecting the climate evolution and potential habitability of an exoplanet is atmospheric escape, in which high-energy radiation from a star drives the escape of hydrogen atoms and other light elements from a planet’s atmosphere. L 98-59 is a benchmark system for studying such atmospheric processes, with three transiting terrestrial-sized planets receiving Venus-like instellations (4–25 S⊕) from their M3 host star. We use the VPLanet model to simulate the evolution of the L 98-59 system and the atmospheric escape of its inner three small planets, given different assumed initial water quantities. We find that, regardless of their initial water content, all three planets accumulate significant quantities of oxygen due to efficient water photolysis and hydrogen loss. All three planets also receive enough strong X-ray and extreme-ultraviolet flux to drive rapid water loss, which considerably affects their developing climates and atmospheres. Even in scenarios of low initial water content, our results suggest that the JWST will be sensitive to observations of retained oxygen on the L 98-59 planets in its future scheduled observations, with planets b and c being the most likely targets to possess an extended atmosphere. Our results constrain the atmospheric evolution of these small rocky planets, and they provide context for current and future observations of the L 98-59 system to generalize our understanding of multiterrestrial planet systems.

<title>Investigation of Periodic Modulation Behaviors from Pulsar J2022+5154</title>

We have carried out a detailed study of individual pulse emission from the pulsar J2022+5154 (B2021+51), observed at 2250 MHz using the Jiamusi 66 m radio telescope. We have investigated the modulations in single-pulse behavior using fluctuation spectral analysis, which shows the presence of two prominent periodicities, around 5 and 40 rotation periods, respectively. The shorter periodicity is associated with the phenomenon of subpulse drifting. In the absence of aliasing, the emission pattern is demonstrated to consist of eight subbeams, which rotate around the magnetic axis in about 45 periods. In addition to subpulse drifting, the pulsar also shows the presence of periodic amplitude modulation with a longer periodicity in the single-pulse sequence. The pulsar joins a select group that shows the presence of periodic phase-modulated drifting as well as amplitude-modulated drifting. This provides further evidence for the two phenomena being distinct from each other with different physical origins.

<title>The Age Distribution of Stellar Orbit Space Clumps</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The orbit distribution of young stars in the Galactic disk is highly structured, from well-defined clusters to streams of stars that may be widely dispersed across the sky, but are compact in orbital action-angle space. The age distribution of such groups can constrain the timescales over which conatal groups of stars disperse into the “field.” Gaia data have proven powerful in identifying such groups in action-angle space, but the resulting member samples are often too small and have too narrow a color–magnitude diagram (CMD) coverage to allow robust age determinations. Here, we develop and illustrate a new approach that can estimate robust stellar population ages for such groups of stars. This first entails projecting the predetermined action-angle distribution into the 5D space of positions, parallaxes, and proper motions, where much larger samples of likely members can be identified over a much wider range of the CMD. It then entails isochrone fitting that accounts for: (a) widely varying distances and reddenings; (b) outliers and binaries; (c) sparsely populated main-sequence turnoffs, by incorporating the age information of the low-mass main sequence; and (d) the possible presence of an intrinsic age spread in the stellar population. When we apply this approach to 92 nearby stellar groups identified in 6D orbit space, we find that they are predominantly young (≲1 Gyr), mono-age populations. Many groups are established (known) localized clusters with possible tidal tails, while others tend to be widely dispersed and manifestly unbound. This new age-dating tool offers a stringent approach to understanding on which orbits stars form in the solar neighborhood and how quickly they disperse into the field.

<title>Recurrently Propagating Intensity Disturbances along Polar Plumes Observed in White Light and Extreme Ultraviolet</title>

We study properties of intensity disturbances along polar coronal rays that are associated with plumes below. For this, we draw azimuth–time images of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emission of 171 Å band observed by the SDO/AIA and white light (WL) observed by the SOHO/LASCO C2 in 2020 July. From the azimuth–time image, we define two tracks in which the EUV intensities were recurrently enhanced during two weeks. The two EUV tracks are rooted at 78.°8 and 81.°4 latitudes, but their projected azimuth angles are changed with time as the Sun rotates. Coherent WL tracks at different altitudes are determined by scaling the azimuth angles of the EUV tracks, accounting for the effect of inclination of coronal rays. From this, we construct time–distance images of WL intensities along WL tracks, whose projected azimuth angle changes along time and altitude, but the intensities are correlated with the EUV intensities measured below. The time–distance images of WL show repeated and inclined intensity features. The propagation speeds in the altitude range 2.3–6 solar radii are calculated to be 159 ± 8 km s−1 and 300 ± 24 km s−1. The EUV and WL intensities are found to be coherent at 1–2 day periods. It is also found that dynamic burst events along the EUV track are responsible for the enhanced emission. We conclude that the variation of the WL intensity along the polar coronal rays is related with the evolution of the EUV intensity below.

<title>Investigating Extreme Scattering Events by Volumetric Ray-tracing</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Extreme scattering events (ESEs) are observed as dramatic (&gt;50%) drops in flux density that occur over an extended period of weeks to months. Discrete plasma lensing structures are theorized to scatter the radio waves produced by distant sources such as pulsars, causing the signature decrease in flux density and characteristic caustic spikes in ESE light curves. While plasma lens models in the extant literature have reproduced key features of ESE light curves, they have all faced the problem of being highly overdense and overpressured relative to the surrounding interstellar medium by orders of magnitude. We model ESEs by numerically ray tracing through analytic, volumetric plasma lens models by solving the eikonal equation. Delaunay triangulation connecting the rays approximates the wave front, generating a mapping from the observer plane to the source plane to account for multiple imaging. This eikonal method of ray tracing is tested against known analytic solutions and is then applied to a three-dimensional Gaussian-distributed electron volume density lens and a filament model inspired by Grafton et al. We find convergence of our numerical results with established analytic solutions, validating our numerical method, and reproduce ESE-like light curves. Our numerical ray-tracing method lends itself well to exploring the lensing effects of volumetric turbulence as well as sheet-like lenses, which is currently in progress.

We suggest a physically motivated model of the uncorrelated background, which can be used to improve the accuracy of helioseismic frequency measurements when the background contributes significantly to the formation of spectral lines of acoustic resonances. The basic assumption of our model is that the correlation length of the convective motions is small compared with the horizontal wavelength R⊙/ℓ of the observations, where ℓ is the degree of the spherical harmonic Yℓm(θ, φ). When applied to solar power spectra at frequencies below acoustic resonances, the model reveals a distinct sensitivity to solar rotation: advection of the convective velocity pattern brings spatial correlations in the apparent stochastic velocity field (temporal correlations in the corotating frame induce spatial correlations in the inertial frame). The induced spatiotemporal correlations manifest themselves as an antisymmetric component in the dependence of the convective noise power on azimuthal order m, which allows us to address the solar differential rotation. With 360 days of data obtained by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory, we measure three components of the rotation rate as a function of latitude using only ℓ = 300. This result indicates that the model suggests a new way of measuring solar subsurface rotation. This approach can complement traditional measurements based on correlation tracking.

<title>Black Hole Ultracompact X-Ray Binaries as Galactic Low-frequency Gravitational Wave Sources: The He Star Channel</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Black hole (BH) ultracompact X-ray binaries (UCXBs) are potential Galactic low-frequency gravitational wave (GW) sources. As an alternative channel, BH UCXBs can evolve from BH+He star binaries. In this work, we perform a detailed stellar evolution model for the formation and evolution of BH UCXBs evolving from the He star channel to diagnose their detectability as low-frequency GW sources. Our calculations found that some nascent BH+He star binaries after the common-envelope (CE) phase could evolve into UCXB-LISA sources with a maximum GW frequency of ∼5 mHz, which can be detected in a distance of 10 kpc (or 100 kpc). Once BH+He star systems become UCXBs through mass transfer, they would emit X-ray luminosities of ∼1038 erg s−1, making them ideal multimessenger objects. If the initial He-star masses are ≥0.7 M⊙, those systems are likely to experience two Roche lobe overflows, and the X-ray luminosity can reach a maximum of 3.5 × 1039 erg s−1 in the second mass-transfer stage. The initial He-star masses and initial orbital periods of progenitors of Galactic BH UCXB-LISA sources are in the range of 0.32–2.9 M⊙ and 0.02–0.19 days, respectively. Nearly all BH+He star binaries in the above parameter space can evolve into GW sources whose chirp masses can be accurately measured. Employing a population synthesis simulation, we predict the birthrate and detection number of Galactic BH UCXB-LISA sources evolving from the He star channel are R = 2.2 × 10−6 yr−1 and 33 for an optimistic CE parameter, respectively.

We present results from the Very Long Baseline Array multifrequency (1.6, 4.4, 8.6, and 22 GHz), high-sensitivity (∼25 μJy beam−1), subparsec-scale (&lt;1 pc) observations and spectral energy distributions for a sample of 12 local active galactic nuclei (AGNs), a subset from our previous volume-complete sample with hard-X-ray (14–195 keV) luminosities above 1042 erg s−1, out to a distance of 40 Mpc. All 12 of the sources presented here were detected in the C (4.4 GHz) and X (8.6 GHz) bands, 75% in the L band (1.6 GHz), and 50% in the K band (22 GHz). Most sources showed compact, resolved/slightly resolved, central subparsec-scale radio morphology, except for a few with extended outflow-like features. A couple of sources have an additional component that may indicate the presence of a dual-core, single or double-sided jet or a more intricate feature, such as radio emission resulting from interaction with the nearby interstellar medium. The spectral slopes are mostly gigahertz-peaked or curved, with a few showing steep, flat, or inverted spectra. We found that at the subparsec scale, the gigahertz-peaked spectra belong to the low-accreting, radio-loud AGNs, with a tendency to produce strong outflows, possibly small-scale jets, and/or have a coronal origin. In contrast, flat/inverted spectra suggest compact radio emission from the central regions of highly accreting AGNs, possibly associated with radio-quiet AGNs producing winds/shocks or nuclear star formation in the vicinity of black holes.

<title>The CO Outflow Components Ejected by a Recent Accretion Event in B335</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Protostellar outflows often present a knotty appearance, providing evidence of sporadic accretion in stellar mass growth. To understand the direct relation between mass accretion and ejection, we analyze the contemporaneous accretion activity and associated ejection components in B335. B335 has brightened in the mid-IR by 2.5 mag since 2010, indicating increased luminosity, presumably due to an increased mass accretion rate onto the protostar. Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of 12CO emission in the outflow reveal high-velocity emission, estimated to have been ejected 4.6–2 yr before the ALMA observations and consistent with the jump in mid-IR brightness. The consistency in timing suggests that the detected high-velocity ejection components are directly linked to the most recent accretion activity. We calculated the kinetic energy, momentum, and force for the ejection component associated with the most recent accretion activity and found that, at least, about 1.0% of the accreted mass has been ejected. More accurate information on the jet inclination and the temperature of the ejected gas components will better constrain the ejected mass induced by the recently enhanced accretion event.

<title>Infrared Emission of Specific Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Molecules: Cyanonaphthalenes</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The unidentified infrared emission features at 3.3, 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.3, and 12.7 μm are ubiquitously seen in a wide variety of astrophysical regions and commonly attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules. However, the unambiguous identification of any individual, specific PAH molecules has proven elusive until very recently, when two isomers of cyanonapthalene, which consists of two fused benzene rings and substitutes a nitrile (–CN) group for a hydrogen atom, were discovered in the Taurus Molecular Cloud, based on their rotational transitions at radio frequencies. To facilitate the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to search for cyanonapthalenes in astrophysical regions, we model the vibrational excitation of cyanonapthalenes and calculate their infrared emission spectra in a number of representative astrophysical regions. The model emission spectra and intensities will allow JWST to quantitatively determine or place an upper limit on the abundances of cyanonapthalenes.

<title>Polarized X-Rays Detected from the Anomalous X-Ray Pulsar 1E 2259+586</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs) and soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs) are believed to be associated with magnetars, which have extremely strong magnetic fields. Recently, with the operation of the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE), the polarization information of two AXPs and one SGR have been investigated. In this work, we report the observational results of the fourth magnetar, 1E 2259+586, with IXPE, and perform a joint analysis with observations from Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer. We find that the emission from 1E 2259+586 is linearly polarized, with a polarization degree (5.3% ± 1.3%) and a polarization angle −77° ± 7° in the 2–8 keV energy range. Additionally, both the polarization degree and polarization angle exhibit variability with the pulse phase, and there is a hint of anticorrelation between the polarization degree and the flux, which is similar to AXP 1RXS J170849.0-400910. The phase-dependent polarization angle displays a sinusoidal profile and can be well fitted with the rotating vector model, indicating that the magnetic dipole field dominated the magnetic structure of the pulsar, and the variation in the polarization angle was modulated by the pulsar’s rotation.

<div> 年轻恒星对象，尘埃输运，磁流体力学模拟，尘埃颗粒，质量流失率
总结:
年轻的0/I型恒星对象中的低尘埃不透明度谱指数（β < 1）被解释为这些环境中存在（次）毫米尘埃颗粒的迹象。密度条件和坍缩包围气壳的寿命已被证明不利于固体颗粒的生长达到毫米尺寸。作为一种替代方案，磁流体力学模拟表明原恒星喷流和流出可能会将颗粒从星周盘中抬升并扩散到包围气壳中。我们重新解释了CALYPSO样本中的0/I型源的可用数据，并展示了内部包围中测得的β1–3毫米值与其喷流和流出的质量流失率之间存在着一种负相关关系的初步证据，支持了这两者之间的联系。我们讨论了从盘到内部包围中进行尘埃输运可能对行星形成的几个方面产生的影响。最后，我们呼吁更准确地测量这些相关量，并将这项工作扩展到更大的样本中，以进一步测试这种输运情景。 <div>
Low dust opacity spectral indices (β &lt; 1) measured in the inner envelopes of class 0/I young stellar objects (age ∼104–5 yr) have been interpreted as the presence of (sub-)millimeter dust grains in these environments. The density conditions and the lifetimes of collapsing envelopes have proven unfavorable for the growth of solids up to millimeter sizes. As an alternative, magnetohydrodynamical simulations suggest that protostellar jets and outflows might lift grains from circumstellar disks and diffuse them in the envelope. We reframe available data for the CALYPSO sample of Class 0/I sources and show tentative evidence for an anticorrelation between the value of β1–3 mm measured in the inner envelope and the mass-loss rate of their jets and outflows, supporting a connection between the two. We discuss the implications that dust transport from the disk to the inner envelope might have for several aspects of planet formation. Finally, we urge for more accurate measurements of both correlated quantities and the extension of this work to larger samples, necessary to further test the transport scenario.

We present a search for host galaxy associations for the third set of repeating fast radio burst (FRB) sources discovered by the CHIME/FRB Collaboration. Using the ∼1′ CHIME/FRB baseband localizations and probabilistic methods, we identify potential host galaxies of two FRBs, 20200223B and 20190110C at redshifts of 0.06024(2) and 0.12244(6), respectively. We also discuss the properties of a third marginal candidate host galaxy association for FRB 20191106C with a host redshift of 0.10775(1). The three putative host galaxies are all relatively massive, fall on the standard mass–metallicity relationship for nearby galaxies, and show evidence of ongoing star formation. They also all show signatures of being in a transitional regime, falling in the green valley, which is between the bulk of star-forming and quiescent galaxies. The plausible host galaxies identified by our analysis are consistent with the overall population of repeating and nonrepeating FRB hosts while increasing the fraction of massive and bright galaxies. Coupled with these previous host associations, we identify a possible excess of FRB repeaters whose host galaxies have Mu − Mr colors redder than the bulk of star-forming galaxies. Additional precise localizations are required to confirm this trend.

We present an effective strategy for extensive analysis of eclipsing time variations (ETVs) using modern and sophisticated optimization methods that comprise a set of tools to investigate period variability mechanisms in eclipsing binary stars such as the light-time effect, the Applegate mechanism, and mass transfer. We implement these methods for the first time assuming that the above mechanisms can act simultaneously in the puzzling W UMa–type binary star TZ Bootis by using archival and new TESS data spanning 75 yr and reexamining the up-to-date ETVs. Preliminary analysis of the TESS data revealed for the first time the presence of a second binary in agreement with previous spectroscopic data and astrometric results from Gaia DR3. We consider the most credible scenario for the ETV: two stellar circumbinary companions of minimum masses M3 = 0.5 M☉ and M4 = 0.14 M☉ in highly eccentric orbits e3 = 0.70 and e4 = 0.82 with periods P3 = 38 yr and P4 = 20 yr along with a 24 yr magnetic activity of the secondary component and a long-term period increase (dP/dt = 1.2 × 10−8 days yr−1), interpreted as a conservative mass transfer from the secondary to the primary component at a rate of dM1/dt = 3.7 × 10−9 days yr−1. Further spectroscopic observations, analytical modeling of the second pair, and ETV analysis of both pairs are needed to investigate the quadruple nature of the system.

<div> 关键词: 天文数据，机器学习，主动星系核，巴莱克星座对象，数据分析

总结: 
本研究通过深入数据分析，提出了一种名为分形维度-逆离散小波变换（FDIDWT）的新方法，用于在大容量的天文数据中识别主动星系核（AGN）候选者和巴莱克星座对象（BL Lac）或平谱射电类星体（FSRQ）候选者。通过将原始数据转换为低维度并突出特征的转换数据集，结合使用改进的轻量级MatchboxConv1D模型，成功实现了对4FGL_DR3不确定源中AGN和BL Lac/FSRQ候选者的识别任务，并具有很高的准确性。此外，该方法还具有发现相对较弱变化和相对较暗的源的优势。 <div>
In the forthcoming era of big astronomical data, it is a burden to find target sources from ground-based and space-based telescopes. Although machine-learning methods have been extensively utilized to address this issue, the incorporation of in-depth data analysis can significantly enhance the efficiency of identifying target sources when dealing with massive volumes of astronomical data. In this work, we focused on the task of finding active galactic nucleus (AGN) candidates and identifying BL Lacertae objects (BL Lac) or flat spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) candidates from the 4FGL_DR3 uncertain sources. We studied the correlations among the attributes of the 4FGL_DR3 catalog and proposed a novel method, named fractal dimension–inverse discrete wavelet transform (FDIDWT), to transform the original data. The transformed data set is characterized as low-dimensional and feature-highlighted, with the estimation of correlation features by fractal dimension theory and the multi-resolution analysis by inverse discrete wavelet transform (IDWT). Combining the FDIDWT method with an improved lightweight MatchboxConv1D model, we accomplished two missions: (1) to distinguish the AGNs from others (non-AGNs) in the 4FGL_DR3 uncertain sources with an accuracy of 96.65% ± 1.32%, namely Mission A; and (2) to classify blazar candidates of uncertain type into BL Lacs or FSRQs with an accuracy of 92.03% ± 2.2%, namely Mission B. There are 1354 AGN candidates in Mission A, and 482 BL Lacs candidates and 128 FSRQ candidates were found in Mission B. The results show a high consistency of greater than 98% with the results in previous works. In addition, our method has the advantage of finding less variable and relatively faint sources than ordinary methods.

Globular clusters (GCs)是特别高效形成毫秒脉冲星的地方。在这些脉冲星中，大约一半缺乏伴星，这个比例比银河系场中的要高得多。在一些最密集的GCs中，特别是那些经历了核心崩溃的GCs中，这个比例进一步增加，这表明动态相互作用过程起着关键作用。我们首次创建了能够重现类似银河系GCs中单脉冲星与双脉冲星的比例的N体模型。我们特别关注NGC 6752，这是一个典型的核心崩溃星团，观测到许多毫秒脉冲星。先前的研究表明，在最密集的星团中，中子星双星破碎率增加可能解释了这些系统中单个脉冲星的过多。在这里，我们证明双星破碎是无效的，相反，我们提出两个额外的动态过程起主导作用：（1）中子星对主序星团的潮汐破碎和（2）重型白矮星双星合并残余物的引力坍缩。通过这些过程形成的中子星也可能与最近在外星系GC中观测到的快速射电暴发有关。<br /><br />总结:GCs是形成毫秒脉冲星的高效地方，但一半以上缺乏伴星。N体模型能重现银河系GCs中的现象。NGC 6752是一个典型的核心崩溃星团，关于双脉冲星的过多有新的解释。双星破碎无效，而潮汐破碎和白矮星合并引起的中子星形成可能引起快速射电暴发。 <div>
Globular clusters (GCs) are particularly efficient at forming millisecond pulsars. Among these pulsars, about half lack a companion star, a significantly higher fraction than in the Galactic field. This fraction increases further in some of the densest GCs, especially those that have undergone core collapse, suggesting that dynamical interaction processes play a key role. For the first time, we create N-body models that reproduce the ratio of single-to-binary pulsars in Milky Way–like GCs. We focus especially on NGC 6752, a typical core-collapsed cluster with many observed millisecond pulsars. Previous studies suggested that an increased rate of neutron star binary disruption in the densest clusters could explain the overabundance of single pulsars in these systems. Here, we demonstrate that binary disruption is ineffective and instead we propose that two additional dynamical processes play dominant roles: (1) tidal disruption of main-sequence stars by neutron stars and (2) gravitational collapse of heavy white dwarf binary merger remnants. Neutron stars formed through these processes may also be associated with fast radio bursts similar to those observed recently in an extragalactic GC.

Galactic gamma-ray diffuse emission (GDE) is emitted by cosmic rays (CRs), ultra-relativistic protons, and electrons, interacting with gas and electromagnetic radiation fields in the interstellar medium. Here we present the analysis of teraelectronvolt diffuse emission from a region of the Galactic plane over the range in longitude of l ∈ [43°, 73°], using data collected with the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) detector. Spectral, longitudinal, and latitudinal distributions of the teraelectronvolt diffuse emission are shown. The radiation spectrum is compatible with the spectrum of the emission arising from a CR population with an index similar to that of the observed CRs. When comparing with the DRAGONbase model, the HAWC GDE flux is higher by about a factor of 2. Unresolved sources such as pulsar wind nebulae and teraelectronvolt halos could explain the excess emission. Finally, deviations of the Galactic CR flux from the locally measured CR flux may additionally explain the difference between the predicted and measured diffuse fluxes.

Aligned interstellar grains produce polarized extinction (observed at wavelengths from the far-ultraviolet to the mid-infrared) and polarized thermal emission (observed at far-infrared and submm wavelengths). The grains must be quite nonspherical, but the actual shapes are unknown. The relative efficacy for aligned grains to produce polarization at optical versus infrared wavelengths depends on particle shape. The discrete dipole approximation is used to calculate polarization cross sections for 20 different convex shapes, for wavelengths from 0.1 to 100 μm, and grain sizes aeff from 0.05 to 0.3 μm. Spheroids, cylinders, square prisms, and triaxial ellipsoids are considered. Minimum aspect ratios required by the observed starlight polarization are determined. Some shapes can also be ruled out because they provide too little or too much polarization at far-infrared and submm wavelengths. The ratio of 10 μm polarization to integrated optical polarization is almost independent of grain shape, varying by only ±8% among the viable convex shapes; thus, at least for convex grains, uncertainties in grain shape cannot account for the discrepancy between predicted and observed 10 μm polarization toward Cyg OB2-12.

Cosmic variance introduces significant uncertainties into galaxy number density properties when surveying the high-redshift Universe with a small volume. Such uncertainties produce the field-to-field variance σg of galaxy numbers in observational astronomy, which significantly affects the luminosity function (LF) measurement of Lyα emitters (LAEs). For most previous Lyα LF studies, σg is often adopted from predictions by cosmological simulations, but barely confirmed by observations. Measuring cosmic variance requires a huge sample over a large volume, exceeding the capabilities of most astronomical instruments. In this study, we demonstrate an observational approach for measuring the cosmic variance contribution for z ≈ 2.2 Lyα LFs. The LAE candidates are observed using the narrow band and broad band of the Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam in eight independent fields, making the total survey area ≃11.62 deg2 and a comoving volume of ≃8.71 × 106 Mpc3. We report a best-fit Schechter function with parameters α = −1.75 (fixed), {L}_{\mathrm{Ly}\alpha }^{* }={5.95}_{-0.96}^{+1.22}\times {10}^{42} erg s−1, and {\phi }_{\mathrm{Ly}\alpha }^{* }={5.26}_{-1.27}^{+1.65} × 10−4 Mpc−3 for the overall Lyα LFs. After clipping out the regions that may bias the cosmic variance measurements, we calculate σg by sampling LAEs within multiple pointings on the field image. We investigate the relation between σg and survey volume V, and fit a simple power-law {\sigma }_{g}=k\times {\left(\tfrac{V}{{10}^{5}\,{\mathrm{Mpc}}^{3}}\right)}^{\beta }. We find best-fit values of -{1.399}_{-0.156}^{+0.160} for β and {1.249}_{-0.193}^{+0.213} for k. We compare our measurements with predictions from simulations and find that the cosmic variance of LAEs is likely larger than that of general star-forming galaxies.

We use the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) to measure scintillation arc properties in six bright canonical pulsars with simultaneous dual-frequency coverage. These observations, at frequencies from 300 to 750 MHz, allowed for detailed analysis of arc evolution across frequency and epoch. We perform more robust determinations of frequency dependence for arc curvature, scintillation bandwidth, and scintillation timescale, and comparison between arc curvature and pseudo-curvature than allowed by single-frequency-band-per-epoch measurements, which we find to agree with theory and previous literature. We find a strong correlation between arc asymmetry and arc curvature, which we have replicated using simulations, and attribute to a bias in the Hough transform approach to scintillation arc analysis. Possible evidence for an approximately week-long timescale over which a given scattering screen dominates signal propagation was found by tracking visible scintillation arcs in each epoch in PSR J1136+1551. The inclusion of a 155-minute observation allowed us to resolve the scale of scintillation variations on short timescales, which we find to be directly tied to the amount of interstellar medium sampled over the observation. Some of our pulsars showed either consistent or emerging asymmetries in arc curvature, indicating instances of refraction across their lines of sight. Significant features in various pulsars, such as multiple scintillation arcs in PSR J1136+1551 and flat arclets in PSR J1509+5531, that have been found in previous works, were also detected. The simultaneous multiple-band observing capability of the upgraded GMRT shows excellent promise for future pulsar scintillation work.

总结:<br />
该研究调查了等离子体对慢震荡不稳定性的影响。通过二维磁流体力学模拟，研究结果显示，慢震荡不稳定性最不稳定的尺度约为等离子体扩散长度的5倍。这对于了解星形成过程中慢震荡的影响具有重要意义。 <div>
The Herschel Gould Belt Survey showed that stars form in dense filaments in nearby molecular clouds. Recent studies suggest that massive filaments are bound by the slow shocks caused by accretion flows onto the filaments. The slow shocks are known to be unstable to corrugation deformation of the shock front. Corrugation instability could convert the accretion flow's ram pressure into turbulent pressure that influences the width of the filament, which, according to theory, determines the self-gravitational fragmentation scale and core mass. In spite of its importance, the effect of slow-shock instability on star-forming filaments has not been investigated. In addition, the linear dispersion relation obtained from ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) analysis shows that the most unstable wavelength of shock corrugation is infinitesimally small. In the scale of dense filaments, the effect of ambipolar diffusion can suppress the instability at small scales. This study investigates the influence of ambipolar diffusion on the instability of the slow shock. We perform two-dimensional MHD simulations to examine the linear growth of the slow-shock instability, considering the effect of ambipolar diffusion. The results demonstrate that the most unstable scale of slow-shock instability is approximately 5 times the length scale of ambipolar diffusion ℓAD calculated using post-shock variables, where ℓAD corresponds to the scale where the magnetic Reynolds number for ambipolar diffusivity is unity.

<div> 关键词: 太阳辐射、MeerKAT射电望远镜、频谱图像、太阳观测、大角度尺度

总结:
太阳辐射提供了估算太阳冠层不同物理参数的独特诊断手段，但在射电波段成像太阳冠层的高动态范围结构十分具有挑战性。MeerKAT射电望远镜在880-1670 MHz频段提供了高保真频谱图像，在与模拟图像的比较中表现出极好的形态相似性。观测结果显示，在约900 MHz以下，MeerKAT可以恢复整个太阳盘的大角度尺度的辐射通量。然而，在更高的频率下，缺失的通量可高达50%，但可以进行估算和修正。MeerKAT的太阳观测有望带来许多新的研究，开启大量未被探索的领域，并为未来的Square Kilometre Array-Mid望远镜的太阳科学研究铺平道路。 <div>
Solar radio emissions provide several unique diagnostics to estimate different physical parameters of the solar corona, which are otherwise simply inaccessible. However, imaging the highly dynamic solar coronal emissions spanning a large range of angular scales at radio wavelengths is extremely challenging. At gigahertz frequencies, MeerKAT radio telescope is possibly globally the best-suited instrument at present for providing high-fidelity spectroscopic snapshot solar images. Here, we present the first published spectroscopic images of the Sun made using the observations with MeerKAT in the 880–1670 MHz band. This work demonstrates the high fidelity of spectroscopic snapshot MeerKAT solar images through a comparison with simulated radio images at MeerKAT frequencies. The observed images show extremely good morphological similarities with the simulated images. Our analysis shows that below ∼900 MHz MeerKAT images can recover essentially the entire flux density from the large angular-scale solar disk. Not surprisingly, at higher frequencies, the missing flux density can be as large as ∼50%. However, it can potentially be estimated and corrected for. We believe once solar observation with MeerKAT is commissioned, it will enable a host of novel studies, open the door to a large unexplored phase space with significant discovery potential, and also pave the way for solar science with the upcoming Square Kilometre Array-Mid telescope, of which MeerKAT is a precursor.

<div> 边缘-on原行星盘，James Webb Space Telescope（JWST），IRAS40302+2247，反射星云，内倾区域

总结：<br /><br /> 这篇文章介绍了对IRAS40302+2247嵌入式年轻恒星周围边缘-on原行星盘的James Webb Space Telescope（JWST）成像结果。研究发现，源结构显示两个由暗区隔开的反射星云。源范围由∼4.4微米和较短波长处的扩展丝状包层主导，在7.7微米和更长波长时过渡到来自盘本身的更紧凑的散射光束。暗区厚度随波长变化不显著，这表明盘的上层存在中等大小（∼10微米）的颗粒。研究发现，IRAS40302最亮的星云在12.8和21微米之间切换。文章还探讨了内部倾斜区域对边缘-on盘的一般外观的影响，并发现包括内倾斜区域的盘的辐射传递模型可以再现最亮星云的倒转。此外，模型预测了特定方向的强烈侧向不对称性。观察到的许多边缘-on原行星盘显示出这种侧向不对称性，这表明大部分原行星盘可能存在内倾区域。星际斑点也可能引起侧向不对称性，但这种不对称性的预期变化周期明显较短。变化性研究可以帮助我们测试这些不对称性起源的主要情景。 <div>
We present James Webb Space Telescope imaging from 2 to 21 μm of the edge-on protoplanetary disk around the embedded young star IRAS04302+2247. The structure of the source shows two reflection nebulae separated by a dark lane. The source extent is dominated by the extended filamentary envelope at ∼4.4 μm and shorter wavelengths, transitioning at 7.7 μm and longer wavelengths to more compact lobes of scattered light from the disk itself. The dark lane thickness does not vary significantly with wavelength, which we interpret as an indication for intermediate-sized (∼10 μm) grains in the upper layers of the disk. Intriguingly, we find that the brightest nebula of IRAS40302 switches side between 12.8 and 21 μm. We explore the effect of a tilted inner region on the general appearance of edge-on disks. We find that radiative transfer models of a disk including a tilted inner region can reproduce an inversion in the brightest nebula. In addition, for specific orientations, the model predicts strong lateral asymmetries, which can occur for more than half possible viewing azimuths. A large number of edge-on protoplanetary disks observed in scattered light show such lateral asymmetries (15/20), which suggests that a large fraction of protoplanetary disks might host a tilted inner region. Stellar spots may also induce lateral asymmetries, which are expected to vary over a significantly shorter timescale. Variability studies of edge-on disks would allow us to test the dominant scenario for the origin of these asymmetries.

<div> 高速云，Hubble Space Telescope，金属含量，银河系，麦哲伦星系<br />
总结:<br />
这篇文章研究了小型高速云的金属含量，发现这些云的氧金属含量均≤0.17 Z⊙，因此不可能源自银河系的盘。其中有两个云的金属含量与麦哲伦星流相似，表明它们是麦哲伦星系的碎片。另外三个云的金属含量较低，可能是气态小暗物质晕或受到拉伸相互作用的矮星系的气体剥离。这些结果表明，小型高速云不一定都存在于银河系内部晕或麦哲伦星系，而可能追踪更远的结构。 <div>
High-velocity clouds (HVCs) are multiphase gas structures whose velocities (∣vLSR∣ ≥ 100 km s−1) are too high to be explained by Galactic disk rotation. While large HVCs are well characterized, compact and small HVCs (with H i angular sizes of a few degrees) are poorly understood. Possible origins for such small clouds include Milky Way (MW) halo gas or fragments of the Magellanic System, but neither their origin nor their connection to the MW halo has been confirmed. We use new Hubble Space Telescope/Cosmic Origins Spectrograph UV spectra and Green Bank Telescope H i spectra to measure the metallicities of five small HVCs in the southern Galactic sky projected near the Magellanic System. We build a set of distance-dependent Cloudy photoionization models for each cloud and calculate their ionization-corrected metallicities. All five small HVCs have oxygen metallicities ≤0.17 Z⊙, indicating they do not originate in the disk of the MW. Two of the five have metallicities of 0.16–0.17 Z⊙, similar to the Magellanic Stream, suggesting these clouds are fragments of the Magellanic System. The remaining three clouds have much lower metallicities of 0.02–0.04 Z⊙. While the origin of these low-metallicity clouds is unclear, they could be gaseous minihalos or gas stripped from dwarf galaxies by ram pressure or tidal interactions. These results suggest that small HVCs do not all reside in the inner MW halo or the Magellanic System, but instead can trace more distant structures.

总结:
通过UNIONS调查发现了银河系中亮度最低的卫星Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1，其被估计具有+2.2 mag的绝对V带星等，相当于总星体质量约16M⊙。经过Keck II/DEIMOS随访光谱学确认了其存在，并识别出了11个径向速度成员，其中8个有Gaia的完整天文测量数据，并根据它们的 proper motions 确定了它们的共同运动。根据这11个径向速度成员，我们得出了一个固有速度离散度约为3.7 km s−1，但一些注意事项目前阻碍了这个值被解释为潜在重力势。 Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1 的存在可能被二元星体膨胀了这个测量值，因此认为它是一个进行多次观测的高优先级候选目标，以了解这个非常微弱卫星的真实性质。 <div>
We present the discovery of Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1, the least luminous known satellite of the Milky Way, which is estimated to have an absolute V-band magnitude of +{2.2}_{-0.3}^{+0.4} mag, equivalent to a total stellar mass of {16}_{-5}^{+6}M⊙. Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1 was uncovered in the deep, wide-field Ultraviolet Near Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS) and is consistent with an old (τ &gt; 11 Gyr), metal-poor ([Fe/H] ∼ −2.2) stellar population at a heliocentric distance of ∼10 kpc. Despite its being compact (rh = 3 ± 1 pc) and composed of few stars, we confirm the reality of Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1 with Keck II/DEIMOS follow-up spectroscopy and identify 11 radial velocity members, eight of which have full astrometric data from Gaia and are co-moving based on their proper motions. Based on these 11 radial velocity members, we derive an intrinsic velocity dispersion of {3.7}_{-1.0}^{+1.4} km s−1 but some caveats preclude this value from being interpreted as a direct indicator of the underlying gravitational potential at this time. Primarily, the exclusion of the largest velocity outlier from the member list drops the velocity dispersion to {1.9}_{-1.1}^{+1.4} km s−1, and the subsequent removal of an additional outlier star produces an unresolved velocity dispersion. While the presence of binary stars may be inflating the measurement, the possibility of a significant velocity dispersion makes Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1 a high-priority candidate for multi-epoch spectroscopic follow-ups to deduce the true nature of this incredibly faint satellite.

We present a comprehensive study of type III radio bursts and their association with solar flares of magnitude M1.0 and larger, as observed by four widely separated spacecraft (Parker Solar Probe, Solar Orbiter, STEREO-A, and Wind). Our main focus is the introduction and validation of two methods for localizing radio bursts using the available multispacecraft data. The first method utilizes intensity fitting with a circular Gaussian distribution, while the second method is based on the time arrival of radio bursts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods through the analysis of a single type III burst event and compare their results with the traditional radio triangulation technique. Furthermore, we conduct a statistical study of 17 type III bursts associated with M- and X-class solar flares in years 2020–2022. Our findings suggest a possible correlation between solar flare intensities and longitudes, with east limb flares tending to be weaker than west limb flares. We also observe a systematic drift of radio burst longitudes toward the east, potentially explained by a poleward component of the local density gradient. Our results suggest a strong correlation between solar flare intensities and radio burst properties, enhancing our understanding of the relationship between solar flares and type III radio bursts.

<br />总结:
GRAPES-3 是一个位于中纬度（2200米）和赤道附近（纬度11.°4N）的空气阵列，与北半球和南半球的实验重叠，用于观测宇宙射线。该研究分析了2013年1月1日至2016年12月31日期间GRAPES-3实验收集的37亿个宇宙射线事件样本，其中能量中值约为16TeV，用于研究小尺度（<60°）角尺度各向异性。研究发现了两个结构A和B，它们与预期的宇宙射线各向同性分布存在显著偏差。这些结果与Milagro、ARGO-YBJ和HAWC的观测结果一致。这些观测结果有望更好地理解宇宙射线的来源、传播以及银河系中的磁结构。 <div>
GRAPES-3 is a mid-altitude (2200 m) and near-equatorial (11.°4N) air shower array, overlapping in its field of view for cosmic-ray observations with experiments that are located in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. We analyze a sample of 3.7 × 109 cosmic-ray events collected by the GRAPES-3 experiment between 2013 January 1 and 2016 December 31 with a median energy of ∼16 TeV for study of small-scale (&lt;60°) angular-scale anisotropies. We observed two structures, labeled A and B, that deviate from the expected isotropic distribution of cosmic rays in a statistically significant manner. Structure A spans 50°–80° in R.A. and from −15° to 30° in decl. The relative excess observed in structure A is at the level of (6.5 ± 1.3) × 10−4 with a statistical significance of 6.8 standard deviations. Structure B is observed in the R.A. range 110°–140° and at decl. from −10° to 30°. The relative excess observed in this region is at the level of (4.9 ± 1.4) × 10−4 with a statistical significance of 4.7 standard deviations. These structures are consistent with those reported by Milagro, ARGO-YBJ, and HAWC. These observations could provide a better understanding of the sources of cosmic rays, their propagation, and the magnetic structures in our Galaxy.

<br />
通过NICER观测，第一次推断出PSR J0030+0451的质量和半径，并对描述密集物质的状态方程进行了限制。使用升级后的分析框架重新分析了NICER数据，并结合XMM-Newton数据进行了联合分析，发现了后验面的多模结构。包括XMM-Newton数据的约束排除了先前发现的主要解决方案，而是支持了新的和更复杂的模型。这些模型显示出推断出的质量和半径取决于所假定的模型，并指向了温度梯度的存在和需要考虑这一点。得出的推断质量和半径分别为∼[1.4 M⊙, 11.5 km]和∼[1.7 M⊙, 14.5 km]。这些发现是对先前研究的拓展，并且对于理解PSR J0030+0451的物理性质非常重要。
<br /><br />总结: PSR J0030+0451的质量和半径在1.4-1.7M⊙和11.5-14.5km之间，新的分析方法揭示了质量和半径的多模结构，需要考虑温度梯度的存在。 <div>
In 2019 the NICER collaboration published the first mass and radius inferred for PSR J0030+0451, thanks to NICER observations, and consequent constraints on the equation of state characterizing dense matter. Two independent analyses found a mass of ∼1.3–1.4 M⊙ and a radius of ∼13  km. They also both found that the hot spots were all located on the same hemisphere, opposite to the observer, and that at least one of them had a significantly elongated shape. Here we reanalyze, in greater detail, the same NICER data set, incorporating the effects of an updated NICER response matrix and using an upgraded analysis framework. We expand the adopted models and also jointly analyze XMM-Newton data, which enables us to better constrain the fraction of observed counts coming from PSR J0030+0451. Adopting the same models used in previous publications, we find consistent results, although with more stringent inference requirements. We also find a multimodal structure in the posterior surface. This becomes crucial when XMM-Newton data is accounted for. Including the corresponding constraints disfavors the main solutions found previously, in favor of the new and more complex models. These have inferred masses and radii of ∼[1.4 M⊙, 11.5 km] and ∼[1.7 M⊙, 14.5 km], depending on the assumed model. They display configurations that do not require the two hot spots generating the observed X-rays to be on the same hemisphere, nor to show very elongated features, and point instead to the presence of temperature gradients and the need to account for them.

Planets can excite density waves and open annular gas gaps in protoplanetary disks. The depth of gaps is influenced by the evolving angular momentum carried by density waves. While the impact of radiative cooling on the evolution of density waves has been studied, a quantitative correlation to connect gap depth with the cooling timescale is lacking. To address this knowledge gap, we employ the grid-based code Athena++ to simulate disk-planet interactions, treating cooling as a thermal relaxation process. We establish quantitative dependencies of steady-state gap depth (Equation 36) and width (Equation 41) on planetary mass, Shakura–Sunyaev viscosity, disk scale height, and thermal relaxation timescale (β). We confirm previous results that gap opening is the weakest when the thermal relaxation timescale is comparable to the local dynamical timescale. Significant variations in gap depth, up to an order of magnitude, are found with different β. In terms of width, a gap is at its narrowest around β = 1, approximately 10%–20% narrower compared to the isothermal case. When β ∼ 100, it can be ∼20% wider, and higher viscosity enhances this effect. We derive possible masses of the gas gap-opening planets in AS 209, HD 163296, MWC 480, and HL Tau, accounting for the uncertainties in the local thermal relaxation timescale.

Surveys of exoplanet host stars are valuable tools for assessing population level trends in exoplanets, and their outputs can include stellar ages, activity, and rotation periods. We extracted chromospheric activity measurements from the California-Kepler Survey Gaia survey spectra in order to probe connections between stellar activity and fundamental stellar properties. Building on the California Kepler Survey's legacy of 1189 planet host star stellar properties including temperature, surface gravity metallicity, and isochronal age, we add measurements of the Ca ii H and K lines as a proxy for chromospheric activity for 879 planet hosting stars. We used these chromospheric activity measurements to derive stellar rotation periods. We find a discrepancy between photometrically derived and activity-derived rotation periods for stars on the Rossby Ridge. These results support the theory of weakened magnetic braking. We find no evidence for metallicity-dependent activity relations, within the metallicity range of −0.2 to +0.3 dex. With our single epoch spectra we identify stars that are potentially in Maunder minimum–like state using a combination of log({R}_{\mathrm{HK}}^{{\prime} }) and position below the main sequence. We do not yet have the multiyear time series needed to verify stars in Maunder minimum–like states. These results can help inform future theoretical studies that explore the relationship between stellar activity, stellar rotation, and magnetic dynamos.

Considering the average data taking and analysis uptime of 91.7% after all selection cuts, this is equivalent to 10.735 yr of continuous data taking. In order to test the most conservative neutrino production scenario, the selection cuts were optimized for a model based on an 8.8 solar mass progenitor collapsing to an O–Ne–Mg core. Conservative assumptions on the effects of neutrino oscillations in the exploding star were made. The final selection cut was set to ensure that the probability to detect such a supernova within the Milky Way exceeds 99%. No such neutrino burst was found in the data after performing a blind analysis. Hence, a 90% C.L. upper limit on the rate of core-collapse supernovae out to distances of ≈25 kpc was determined to be 0.23 yr−1. For the more distant Magellanic Clouds, only high neutrino luminosity supernovae will be detectable by IceCube, unless external information on the burst time is available. We determined a model-independent limit by parameterizing the dependence on the neutrino luminosity and the energy spectrum.

<div> Lyα halo, Lyα emitters, stacking, spectroscopic observations, contamination rate
总结:
本文使用Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam对约3300个Lyα辐射体(LAEs)进行堆叠观测，鉴定了一个z=2.2-2.3的Lyα晕(LAH)。通过分光观测和数据处理，确定样本的污染率较低(8%)。利用中值堆叠方法，发现LAH在2σ显著水平下延伸至约100kpc，在表面亮度水平约为10-20 erg s-1 cm-2 arcsec-2时可能延伸至约200kpc。比较不同的红移、领域和选择方法，发现本文的LAH在约25-100kpc半径范围内更亮。进一步分析表明，更高的Lyα发射光度、较小的等效宽度和更亮的UV星等会导致更广泛的LAH。结果表明，质量更大的LAEs通常拥有更广泛的LAHs。 <div>
In this paper, we present a Lyα halo (LAH) identified by stacking ∼3300 Lyα emitters (LAEs) at z = 2.2–2.3. We carry out imaging observations and data reduction with Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam. Our total survey area is ∼12 deg2 and the imaging depths are 25.5–27.0 mag. Using the imaging data, we select 1240 and 2101 LAE candidates at z = 2.2 and 2.3, respectively. We carry out spectroscopic observations of our LAE candidates and data reduction with Magellan/IMACS to estimate the contamination rate of our LAE candidates. We find that the contamination rate of our sample is low (8%). We stack our LAE candidates with a median stacking method to identify the LAH at z = 2. We show that our LAH is detected until ∼100 kpc at the 2σ significance level and likely extended to ∼200 kpc at a surface brightness level of ∼10−20 erg s−1 cm−2 arcsec−2. Compared to those of previous studies, our LAH is brighter at radii of ∼25–100 kpc, which is not likely caused by the contamination in our sample but by the different redshifts, fields, and selection methods instead. To investigate how central galaxies affect surrounding LAHs, we divide our LAEs into subsamples based on the Lyα luminosity (LLyα), rest-frame Lyα equivalent width (EW0), and UV magnitude (Muv). We stack the subsamples and find that higher LLyα, smaller EW0, and brighter Muv cause more extended halos. Our results suggest that more massive LAEs generally have more extended LAHs.

HDF850.1 is the brightest submillimeter galaxy (SMG) in the Hubble Deep Field. It is known as a heavily dust-obscured star-forming galaxy embedded in an overdense environment at z = 5.18. With nine-band NIRCam images at 0.8–5.0 μm obtained through the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey, we detect and resolve the rest-frame UV–optical counterpart of HDF850.1, which splits into two components because of heavy dust obscuration in the center. The southern component leaks UV and Hα photons, bringing the galaxy ∼100  times above the empirical relation between infrared excess and UV continuum slope (IRX–βUV). The northern component is higher in dust attenuation and thus fainter in UV and Hα surface brightness. We construct a spatially resolved dust-attenuation map from the NIRCam images, well matched with the dust continuum emission obtained through millimeter interferometry. The whole system hosts a stellar mass of 1010.8±0.1M⊙ and star formation rate (SFR) of 102.8±0.2M⊙ yr−1, placing the galaxy at the massive end of the star-forming main sequence at this epoch. We further confirm that HDF850.1 resides in a complex overdense environment at z = 5.17–5.30, which hosts another luminous SMG at z = 5.30 (GN10). The filamentary structures of the overdensity are characterized by 109 Hα-emitting galaxies confirmed through NIRCam slitless spectroscopy at 3.9–5 μm, of which only eight were known before the JWST observations. Given the existence of a similar galaxy overdensity in the GOODS-S field, our results suggest that 50% ± 20% of the cosmic star formation at z = 5.1–5.5 occur in protocluster environments.

The discovery and timing follow up of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are necessary not just for their usefulness in pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) but also for investigating their own intriguing properties. In this work, we provide the findings of the decade-long timing of four MSPs discovered by the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT), including their timing precision, model parameters, and newly detected proper motions. We compare the timing results for these MSPs before and after the GMRT upgrade in 2017 and characterize the improvement in timing precision due to the bandwidth upgrade. We discuss the suitability of these four GMRT MSPs as well as the usefulness of the decade-long timing data for PTA experiments. These data may aid in the global effort to improve the signal-to-noise ratios of recently detected signature of gravitational waves in cross-correlation statistics of residuals of MSPs.

<div> 星系、恒星质量、光谱能量分布、星形成史、宇宙早期<br />
总结:<br />
本研究表明，在大爆炸后的头十亿年内形成的星系的恒星质量推断存在根本的不确定性，这是由于星系综合光谱中来自早期星形成的信息丢失。尽管早期星形成对高红移系统的总恒星质量贡献很大，但在探测时期的持续星形成会盖过早期爆发的残留光，导致恒星质量的准确测定受到影响。因此，在恒星质量上可以预期存在数量级的不确定性。通过在宇宙背景下进行宇宙学模拟，我们证明了这一潜在问题。具体来说，我们进行了两种具有显著不同恒星反馈模型的宇宙学模拟，这些模型涵盖了星形成史爆发程度的显著范围。我们通过三维尘埃辐射传输计算模拟了这些模型星系在z=7时的模拟光谱，然后使用prospector光谱拟合软件对这些光谱进行了反向拟合。我们发现了z>7星系推导的恒星质量的不确定性，这促使我们发展新的技术和/或先验知识来模拟早期宇宙中的星形成史。 <div>
We demonstrate that the inference of galaxy stellar masses via spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting techniques for galaxies formed in the first billion years after the Big Bang carries fundamental uncertainties owing to the loss of star formation history (SFH) information from the very first episodes of star formation in the integrated spectra of galaxies. While this early star formation can contribute substantially to the total stellar mass of high-redshift systems, ongoing star formation at the time of detection outshines the residual light from earlier bursts, hampering the determination of accurate stellar masses. As a result, order-of-magnitude uncertainties in stellar masses can be expected. We demonstrate this potential problem via direct numerical simulation of galaxy formation in a cosmological context. In detail, we carry out two cosmological simulations with significantly different stellar feedback models, which span a significant range in SFH burstiness. We compute the mock SEDs for these model galaxies at z = 7 via calculations of 3D dust radiative transfer, and then backward fit these SEDs with prospector SED fitting software. The uncertainties in derived stellar masses that we find for z &gt; 7 galaxies motivate the development of new techniques and/or priors for SFH to model star formation in the early Universe.

<div> 关键词: Galactic conformity, DESI One-Percent Survey, SHAM method, ELG clustering, redshift space<br />
总结:<br />
研究发现了星系一致性现象，即具有特定物理特性的星系与相邻星系具有相关性，暗示可能存在因果关系。采用原始亚哈洛匹配方法，提出了简明的一致性模型，改善了ELG和暗物质晕的连接关系。模型表明，在中心星系是ELG的暗物质晕中，卫星ELG的数量将提高约5倍。通过该模型，可以准确描述ELG在整个红移范围内的聚类现象。预期该方法可用于生成适用于DESI的高质量ELG光锥模拟。 <div>
Galactic conformity is the phenomenon whereby a galaxy of a certain physical property is correlated with its neighbors of the same property, implying a possible causal relationship. The observed auto correlations of emission-line galaxies (ELGs) from the highly complete DESI One-Percent Survey exhibit a strong clustering signal on small scales, providing clear evidence for the conformity effect of ELGs. Building upon the original subhalo abundance-matching (SHAM) method developed by Gao et al., we propose a concise conformity model to improve the ELG–halo connection. In this model, the number of satellite ELGs is boosted by a factor of ∼5 in the halos whose central galaxies are ELGs. We show that the mean ELG satellite number in such central halos is still smaller than 1 and that the model does not significantly increase the overall satellite fraction. With this model, we can well recover the ELG auto correlations to the smallest scales explored with the current data (i.e., rp &gt; 0.03 Mpc h−1 in real space and at s &gt; 0.3 Mpc h−1 in redshift space), while the cross correlations between luminous red galaxies and ELGs are nearly unchanged. Although our SHAM model has only eight parameters, we further verify that it can accurately describe the ELG clustering in the entire redshift range from z = 0.8 to 1.6. We therefore expect that this method can be used to generate high-quality ELG lightcone mocks for DESI.

<title>Magnetohydrodynamic Perspective on the Disappearance of Mercury’s Bow Shock by Helios Data Exploration</title>

<div> 太阳风，水星，磁流体力学，鞘震，观测数据
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章主要探讨了太阳风对水星鞘震的影响。研究发现，由于水星靠近太阳，太阳风的快模马赫数较低，导致水星的鞘震可能会消失。观测分析表明，快模马赫数较低的太阳风事件通常发生在太阳活动周期的上升和最大阶段，大约35%的事件发生在日冕物质抛射的主体内，约58%的事件与日冕物质抛射无关。理论和数值模拟结果显示，当水星遭遇快模马赫数≤1.5的太阳风时，其鞘震会变得更远、更扁平甚至消失。此外，计算表明，水星的鞘震在极端太阳风条件下可能变成一个具有向上凸起结构的慢模冲击波。 <div>
In the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) perspective, the planet’s bow shock would disappear when the fast-mode Mach number (MF) of the solar wind is less than one. Compared to Earth, Mercury is subject to a lower MF solar wind due to its proximity to the Sun, resulting in a higher possibility of the disappearance of its bow shock. To examine the variability of Mercury’s bow shock in response to the solar wind properties, analyses of the observations by the Helios spacecraft at 0.30–0.50 au during 1975–1983, covering solar cycle 21, together with the theoretical solutions and MHD simulations are conducted in this study. Our observational analyses show that more solar wind data with extremely low fast-mode Mach numbers (say, MF ≤ 1.5) are observed during the rising and maximum phases and are characterized by a significantly low proton number density. It is also found that approximately 35% of the extremely low fast-mode Mach number solar wind events (MF ≤ 1.5) occur within the main body of interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs), while about 58% of them are unrelated to ICMEs. Three of these events are selected to demonstrate that the occurrences of the solar wind with MF ≤ 1.5 may not be necessarily affected by ICMEs. Our theoretical and numerical results indicate that when Mercury encounters the solar wind with MF ≤ 1.5, its bow shock would move farther away, become flattened, and even disappear. Furthermore, our calculations suggest that Mercury’s bow shock would become a slow-mode shock with a concave-upward structure under such extreme solar wind conditions.

<title>A Direct Comparison between the Use of Double Gray and Multiwavelength Radiative Transfer in a General Circulation Model with and without Radiatively Active Clouds</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Inhomogeneous cloud formation and wavelength-dependent phenomena are expected to shape hot Jupiter atmospheres. We present a general circulation model with multiwavelength “picket fence” radiative transfer and radiatively active, temperature-dependent clouds, and compare the results to those of a double gray routine. The double gray method inherently fails to model polychromatic effects in hot Jupiter atmospheres, while picket fence captures these non-gray aspects and performs well compared to fully wavelength-dependent methods. We compare both methods with radiatively active clouds and cloud-free models, assessing the limitations of the double gray method. Although there are broad similarities, the picket fence models have larger dayside–nightside temperature differences, nonisothermal upper atmospheres, and multiwavelength effects in the presence of radiatively active clouds. We model the well-known hot Jupiters HD 189733 b and HD 209458 b. For the hotter HD 209458 b, the picket fence method prevents clouds from thermostating dayside temperatures, resulting in hotter upper atmospheres and the dissipation of dayside clouds. Differences in the temperature structures are then associated with nuanced differences in the circulation patterns and clouds. Models of the cooler HD 189733 b have global cloud coverage, regardless of the radiative transfer scheme, whereas there are larger differences in the models of HD 209458 b, particularly in the extent of the partial cloud coverage on its dayside. This results in minor changes to the thermal and reflected light phase curves of HD 189733 b, but more significant differences for the picket fence and double gray versions of HD 209458 b.

<title>Unobscured Central Broad-line Regions in Type-1.9 AGN SDSS J1241+2602</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Strong evidence is reported to support unobscured broad-line regions (BLRs) in Type-1.9 active galactic nucleus (AGN) SDSS J1241+2602 with reliable broad Hα but no broad Hβ. Commonly, the disappearance of broad Hβ can be explained by the AGN unified model, in which heavily obscured BLRs are expected in Type-1.9 AGNs. Here, based on properties of two kinds of BH masses, the virial BH mass and the BH mass obtained through the MBH–σ relation, an independent method is proposed to test whether there are unobscured central BLRs in a Type-1.9 AGN. By the reliable measurement of stellar velocity dispersion of about 110 ± 12 km s −1 through the host galaxy absorption features in SDSS J1241+2602, the BH mass obtained through the MBH–σ relation is consistent with the virial BH mass (3.43 ± 1.25) × 107 M⊙ determined through properties of the observed broad Hα without considering the effects of obscurations in SDSS J1241+2602. Meanwhile, if considering heavily obscured BLRs in SDSS J1241+2602, the reddening-corrected virial BH mass is tens of times larger than the value expected from MBH–σ, leading SDSS J1241+2602 to be an outlier in the MBH–σ space with a confidence level higher than 5σ. Therefore, unobscured BLRs are preferred in the Type-1.9 AGN SDSS J1241+2602. The results indicate that it is necessary to check whether unobscured central BLRs are common in Type-1.9 AGNs when testing the unified model of AGNs through properties of Type-1.9 AGNs.

<title>A Machine Learning Approach to Understanding the Physical Properties of Magnetic Flux Ropes in the Solar Wind at 1 au</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Interplanetary magnetic flux ropes (MFRs) are commonly observed structures in the solar wind, categorized as magnetic clouds (MCs) and small-scale MFRs (SMFRs) depending on whether they are associated with coronal mass ejections. We apply machine learning to systematically compare SMFRs, MCs, and ambient solar wind plasma properties. We construct a data set of 3-minute averaged sequential data points of the solar wind’s instantaneous bulk fluid plasma properties using about 20 years of measurements from Wind. We label samples by the presence and type of MFRs containing them using a catalog based on Grad–Shafranov (GS) automated detection for SMFRs and NASA's catalog for MCs (with samples in neither labeled non-MFRs). We apply the random forest machine learning algorithm to find which categories can be more easily distinguished and by what features. MCs were distinguished from non-MFRs with an area under the receiver-operator curve (AUC) of 94% and SMFRs with an AUC of 89%, and had distinctive plasma properties. In contrast, while SMFRs were distinguished from non-MFRs with an AUC of 86%, this appears to rely solely on the 〈B〉 &gt; 5 nT threshold applied by the GS catalog. The results indicate that SMFRs have virtually the same plasma properties as the ambient solar wind, unlike the distinct plasma regimes of MCs. We interpret our findings as additional evidence that most SMFRs at 1 au are generated within the solar wind. We also suggest that they should be considered a salient feature of the solar wind’s magnetic structure rather than transient events.

<title>The Diffusion and Scattering of Accelerating Particles in Compressible MHD Turbulence</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We numerically study the diffusion and scattering of cosmic rays (CRs) together with their acceleration processes in the framework of the modern understanding of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. Based on the properties of compressible MHD turbulence obtained from observations and numerical experiments, we investigate the interaction of CRs with plasma modes. We find that (1) the gyroradius of particles exponentially increases with the acceleration timescale; (2) the momentum diffusion presents the power-law relationship with the gyroradius in the strong turbulence regime, and shows a plateau in the weak turbulence regime implying a stochastic acceleration process; (3) the spatial diffusion is dominated by the parallel diffusion in the sub-Alfvénic regime, while it is dominated by the perpendicular diffusion in the super-Alfvénic one; (4) as for the interaction of CRs with plasma modes, the particle acceleration is dominated by the fast mode in the high β case, while in the low β case, it is dominated by the fast and slow modes; and (5) in the presence of acceleration, magnetosonic modes still play a critical role in the diffusion and scattering processes of CRs, which is in good agreement with earlier theoretical predictions.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We used 29 high-resolution line-of-sight magnetograms acquired with the Goode Solar Telescope (GST) in a quiet-Sun area to extrapolate a series of potential field configurations and study their time variations. The study showed that there are regions that consistently exhibit changes in loop connectivity, whereas other vast areas do not show such changes. Analysis of the topological features of the potential fields indicates that the photospheric footprint of the separatrix between open- and closed-loop systems closely matches the roots of rapid blue- and redshifted excursions, which are disk counterparts of type II spicules. There is a tendency for the footpoints of the observed Hα features to be cospatial with the footpoints of the loops that most frequently change their connectivity, while the area occupied by the open fields that did not show any significant and persistent connectivity changes is void of prominent jet and spicular activity. We also detected and tracked magnetic elements using the Southwest Automatic Magnetic Identification Suite and GST magnetograms, which allowed us to construct artificial magnetograms and calculate the corresponding potential field configurations. Analysis of the artificial data showed tendencies similar to those found for the observed data. The present study suggests that a significant amount of chromospheric activity observed in the far wings of the Hα spectral line may be generated by reconnecting closed-loop systems and canopy fields consisting of “open” field lines.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the updated open-source code Complete History of Interaction-Powered Supernovae (CHIPS) that can be applied to modeling supernovae (SNe) arising from an interaction with the massive circumstellar medium (CSM) as well as the formation process of the CSM. Our update mainly concerns extensions to hydrogen-poor SNe from stripped progenitors, targeting the modeling of interaction-powered SNe Ibc, such as Type Ibn and Icn SNe. We successfully reproduce the basic properties of the light curves of these types of SNe that occur after the partial eruption of the outermost layer with a mass of 0.01–0.1 M⊙ at ≲1 year before explosion. We also find that the luminosity of the observed precursors can be naturally explained by the outburst that creates the dense CSM, given that the energy of the outburst is efficiently dissipated by collision with an external material, possibly generated by a previous mass eruption. We discuss possible scenarios causing eruptive mass loss based on our results.

<title>Apparent Effect of Dust Extinction on the Observed Outflow Velocity of Ionized Gas in Galaxy Mergers</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this study, we examine photoionization outflows during the late stages of galaxy mergers, with a specific focus on the relation between the observed velocity of outflowing gas and the apparent effects of dust extinction. We used the N-body/smoothed particle hydrodynamics code ASURA for galaxy merger simulations. These simulations concentrated on identical galaxy mergers featuring supermassive black holes of 108M⊙ and gas fractions of 30% and 10%. From the simulation data, we derived velocity and velocity dispersion diagrams for the active galactic nuclei (AGN)-driven ionized outflowing gas. Our findings show that high-velocity outflows with velocity dispersions of 500 km s−1 or greater can be observed in the late stages of galactic mergers. Particularly, in buried AGNs, both the luminosity-weighted outflow velocity and velocity dispersion increase owing to the apparent effects of dust extinction. Owing to these effects, velocity–velocity dispersion diagrams display a noticeable blue-shifted tilt in models with higher gas fractions. Crucially, this tilt is not influenced by the AGN luminosity but emerges from the observational impacts of dust extinction. Our results imply that the observed high-velocity [O iii] λ5007 outflow exceeding 1000 km s−1 in buried AGNs may be linked to the dust extinction that occurs during the late stages of gas-rich galaxy mergers.

We present results of [C ii] 158 μm emission line observations, and report the spectroscopic redshift confirmation of a strongly lensed (μ ∼ 20) star-forming galaxy, MACS0308-zD1 at z = 6.2078 ± 0.0002. The [C ii] emission line is detected with a signal-to-noise ratio &gt;6 within the rest-frame UV-bright clump of the lensed galaxy (zD1.1) and exhibits multiple velocity components; the narrow [C ii] has a velocity full width half maximum (FWHM) of 110 ± 20 km s−1, while broader [C ii] is seen with an FWHM of 230 ± 50 km s−1. The broader [C ii] component is blueshifted (−80 ± 20 km s−1) with respect to the narrow [C ii] component, and has a morphology that extends beyond the UV-bright clump. We find that, while the narrow [C ii] emission is most likely associated with zD1.1, the broader component is possibly associated with a physically distinct gas component from zD1.1 (e.g., outflowing or inflowing gas). Based on the nondetection of λ158μm dust continuum, we find that MACS0308-zD1's star formation activity occurs in a dust-free environment indicated by a strong upper limit of infrared luminosity ≲9 × 108L⊙. Targeting this strongly lensed faint galaxy for follow-up Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and JWST observations will be crucial to characterize the details of typical galaxy growth in the early Universe.

<title>Probing Disk Ice Content and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Emission through Multiband MagAO+Clio Images of HD 141569</title>

We present resolved images of the inner disk component around HD 141569A using the Magellan adaptive optics system with the Clio2 1–5 μm camera, offering a glimpse of a complex system thought to be in a short evolutionary phase between protoplanetary and debris disk stages. We use a reference star along with the Karhunen–Loéve image projection (KLIP) algorithm for point-spread function subtraction to detect the disk inward to about 0.″24 (∼25 au assuming a distance of 111 pc) at high signal-to-noise ratios at L^{\prime} (3.8 μm), Ls (3.3 μm), and narrowband Ice (3.1 μm). We identify an arc or spiral arm structure at the southeast extremity, consistent with previous studies. We implement forward modeling with a simple disk model within the framework of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler to better constrain the geometrical attributes and photometry using our KLIP-reduced disk images. We then leverage these modeling results to facilitate a comparison of the measured brightness in each passband to find a reduction in scattered light from the disk in the Ice filter, implying significant absorption due to water ice in the dust. Additionally, our best-fit disk models exhibit peak brightness in the southwestern, back-scattering region of the disk, which we suggest to be possible evidence of 3.3 μm polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission. However, we point out the need for additional observations with bluer filters and more complex modeling to confirm these hypotheses.

<title>Chemodynamical Nature of the Anticenter Stream and Monoceros Ring</title>

In the epoch of deep photometric surveys, a large number of substructures—e.g., overdensities and streams—have been identified. With the help of astrometry and spectroscopy, the community has revealed a complex picture of our Milky Way (MW) after investigating their origins. The off-plane substructures the Anticenter Stream (ACS) and Monoceros Ring (MNC), once considered as dissolving dwarf galaxies, were later found to share similar kinematics and metallicity with the Galactic outer thin disk. In this work, we aim to chemically tag ACS and MNC with high-accuracy abundances from the APOGEE survey. By extrapolating chemical abundance trends in the outer thin-disk region (10 &lt; RGC &lt; 18 kpc, 0 &lt; ∣ZGC∣ &lt; 3 kpc), we found that ACS and MNC stars show consistent chemical abundances as the extrapolating values for 12 elements, including C, N, O, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Cr, Mn, Co, and Ni. The similar chemical patterns indicate that ACS and MNC have a similar star formation history as the MW outer thin disk, while we also excluded their dwarf galaxy association, as they are distinctive in multiple chemical spaces. The ages of ACS and MNC stars are consistent with the time of the first Sagittarius dSph passage, indicating their possible connection.

<title>Direct Formation of Massive Black Holes via Dynamical Collapse in Metal-enriched Merging Galaxies at z ∼ 10: Fully Cosmological Simulations</title>

We present the results of the first fully cosmological hydrodynamical simulations studying the merger-driven model for massive black hole (BH) seed formation via direct collapse. Using the zoom-in technique as well as particle splitting, we achieve a final spatial resolution of 2 pc. We show that the major merger of two massive galaxies at redshift z ∼ 8 results in the formation of a nuclear supermassive disk (SMD) of only 4 pc in radius, owing to a prodigious gas inflow sustained at 100–1000 M⊙ yr−1. The core of the merger remnant is metal-rich, well above solar abundance, and the SMD reaches a gaseous mass of 3 × 108M⊙ in less than a million years after the merger, despite a concurrent prominent nuclear starburst. Dynamical heating as gas falls into the deepest part of the potential well, and heating and stirring by supernova blastwaves, generate a turbulent multiphase interstellar medium, with a gas velocity dispersion exceeding 100 km s−1. As a result, only moderate fragmentation occurs in the inner 10–20 pc, despite the temperature falling below 1000 K. The SMD is Jeans-unstable as well as bar-unstable and will collapse further adiabatically, becoming warm and ionized. We show that the SMD, following inevitable contraction, will become general-relativistic-unstable and directly form a supermassive BH of mass in the range 106–108M⊙, essentially skipping the stage of BH seed formation. These results confirm that mergers between the most massive galaxies at z ∼ 8–10 can naturally explain the rapid emergence of bright high-redshift quasars.

<title>A Morphokinematic Study of the Enigmatic Emission Nebula NGC 6164/5 Surrounding the Magnetic O-type Star HD 148937</title>

HD 148937 is a peculiar massive star (Of?p) with a strong magnetic field (1 kG). The hourglass-shaped emission nebula NGC 6164/5 surrounds this star. This nebula is presumed to originate from episodic mass-loss events of the central O-type star, but the detailed formation mechanism is not yet well understood. Grasping its three-dimensional structure is essential to uncovering the origin of this nebula. Here we report the high-resolution multiobject spectroscopic observations of NGC 6164/5 using the GIRAFFE on the 8.2 m Very Large Telescope. Integrated intensity maps constructed from several spectral lines delineate well the overall shape of this nebula, such as the two bright lobes and the inner gas region. The position–velocity diagrams show that the two bright lobes are found to be redshifted and blueshifted, respectively, while the inner region has multiple layers. We consider a geometric model composed of a bilateral outflow harboring nitrogen-enriched knots and expanding inner shells. Its spectral features are then simulated by using a Monte Carlo radiative transfer technique for different sets of velocities. Some position–velocity diagrams from simulations are very similar to the observed ones. According to the model that best reproduces the observational data, the two bright lobes and the nitrogen-enriched knots are moving away from HD 148937 at about 120 km s−1. Their minimum kinematic age is estimated to be about 7500 yr. We discuss possible formation mechanisms of this nebula in the context of binary interaction.
