<div> 黑洞，中子星，超Eddington质量转移，高能中微子，超新鲜<br>
总结:
这篇文章讨论了由进化后主序星到黑洞或中子星伴星的超Eddington质量转移所引起的超星云膨胀，以及产生高能中微子的可能机制。研究指出，一些快速无线电暴（FRB）可能由这种短暂的喷射式超Eddington质量转移引擎驱动。根据模型计算，这些超新鲜可能产生的中微子排放量可以解释IceCube观测到的高能中微子弥散背景流的约25％，并且其时间平均中微子谱也与观测到的中微子谱相吻合。此外，这些超新鲜产生的中微子排放可能可延伸至>100 PeV，可以被未来的超高能中微子观测站所探测到。另外，超新鲜内的光学厚度会阻碍GeV–PeV能区的伽马射线逃逸，使得这些中微子源辐射的伽马射线相对较弱，与Fermi对各向同性伽马射线背景的观测结果相符。 <div>
Hypernebulae are inflated by accretion-powered winds accompanying hyper-Eddington mass transfer from an evolved post-main-sequence star onto a black hole or neutron star companion. The ions accelerated at the termination shock—where the collimated fast disk winds and/or jet collide with the slower, wide-angled wind-fed shell—can generate high-energy neutrinos via hadronic proton–proton reactions, and photohadronic (pγ) interactions with the disk thermal and Comptonized nonthermal background photons. It has been suggested that some fast radio bursts (FRBs) may be powered by such short-lived jetted hyper-accreting engines. Although neutrino emission associated with the millisecond duration bursts themselves is challenging to detect, the persistent radio counterparts of some FRB sources—if associated with hypernebulae—could contribute to the high-energy neutrino diffuse background flux. If the hypernebula birth rate follows that of stellar-merger transients and common envelope events, we find that their volume-integrated neutrino emission—depending on the population-averaged mass-transfer rates—could explain up to ∼25% of the high-energy diffuse neutrino flux observed by the IceCube Observatory and the Baikal Gigaton Volume Detector Telescope. The time-averaged neutrino spectrum from hypernebula—depending on the population parameters—can also reproduce the observed diffuse neutrino spectrum. The neutrino emission could in some cases furthermore extend to &gt;100 PeV, detectable by future ultra-high-energy neutrino observatories. The large optical depth through the nebula to Breit–Wheeler (γγ) interaction attenuates the escape of GeV–PeV gamma rays coproduced with the neutrinos, rendering these gamma-ray-faint neutrino sources, consistent with the Fermi observations of the isotropic gamma-ray background.

<div> 关键词: G106.3+2.7, 脉冲星风星云, gamma射线, 磁场, 多波段研究<br />
总结: <br />
G106.3+2.7被认为是一个复合超新星遗迹，具有类似回旋镖形状的脉冲星风星云和无线电波段的两个不同区域（“头”和“尾”）。最近在尾部发现了超高能量的γ射线发射，这表明G106.3+2.7是PeVatron候选星. 通过使用存档的无线电和Chandra数据，以及2020年的新NuSTAR X射线观测结果，我们对脉冲星J2229+6114周围100″范围内的Boomerang PWN进行了全面的多波段研究。 NuSTAR观测结果显示了脉冲星PSR J2229+6114的51.67毫秒自转周期和PWN辐射的能量谱，该辐射呈幂律模型，Γ值为1.52±0.06，直到20keV。与Kothes等人以前的无线电研究不同，根据（1）过去20年来X射线流量的稳定性，（2）脉冲星风星云的能量依赖性X射线尺寸和（3）多波段光谱能谱数据，我们更倾向于较低的PWN磁场（B∼3μG）和较大的距离（d∼8kpc）。我们的光谱能谱模型表明，脉冲星风星云目前正在被超新星逆冲击压缩，大约在1000年前被压缩。在这种情况下，头部区域应该是由早期被脉冲星注入的GeV-TeV电子形成，这些电子正在向低密度环境传播。 <div>
G106.3+2.7, commonly considered to be a composite supernova remnant (SNR), is characterized by a boomerang-shaped pulsar wind nebula (PWN) and two distinct (“head” and “tail”) regions in the radio band. A discovery of very-high-energy gamma-ray emission (Eγ &gt; 100 GeV) followed by the recent detection of ultrahigh-energy gamma-ray emission (Eγ &gt; 100 TeV) from the tail region suggests that G106.3+2.7 is a PeVatron candidate. We present a comprehensive multiwavelength study of the Boomerang PWN (100″ around PSR J2229+6114) using archival radio and Chandra data obtained two decades ago, a new NuSTAR X-ray observation from 2020, and upper limits on gamma-ray fluxes obtained by Fermi-LAT and VERITAS observatories. The NuSTAR observation allowed us to detect a 51.67 ms spin period from the pulsar PSR J2229+6114 and the PWN emission characterized by a power-law model with Γ = 1.52 ± 0.06 up to 20 keV. Contrary to the previous radio study by Kothes et al., we prefer a much lower PWN B-field (B ∼ 3 μG) and larger distance (d ∼ 8 kpc) based on (1) the nonvarying X-ray flux over the last two decades, (2) the energy-dependent X-ray size of the PWN resulting from synchrotron burn-off, and (3) the multiwavelength spectral energy distribution (SED) data. Our SED model suggests that the PWN is currently re-expanding after being compressed by the SNR reverse shock ∼1000 yr ago. In this case, the head region should be formed by GeV–TeV electrons injected earlier by the pulsar propagating into the low-density environment.

恒星质量和恒星金属丰度之间存在强烈的相关性，恒星金属丰度随着恒星质量的增加而单调增加，但在高质量星系中趋于平缓。高红移星系的平均α增强显示出它们尚未经历明显的Ia型超新星对铁的丰度增加。通过化学演化模型，发现随着恒星质量的增加，星系的质量卸载参数亦减小，并在恒星质量约为10^10.5太阳质量时趋于稳定，这可能表明在红移约为2.5时，恒星质量大于10^10.5太阳质量的星系可能出现由黑洞驱动的流出现象。 <br /><br />总结: 这篇文章研究了高红移星系的恒星质量和恒星金属丰度关系以及铁和氧的相关化学特征，发现恒星质量和恒星金属丰度呈现出明显的关联性，而高红移星系的平均α增强则显示它们尚未经历明显的Ia型超新星对铁的丰度增加。通过化学演化模型的研究，发现恒星质量的增加会导致星系的质量卸载参数减小，这可能表明在红移约为2.5时，恒星质量大于10^10.5太阳质量的星系可能出现由黑洞驱动的流出现象。 <div>
We present the stellar mass–stellar metallicity relation for 3491 star-forming galaxies at 2 ≲ z ≲ 3 using rest-frame far-ultraviolet spectra from the Lyα Tomography IMACS Survey (LATIS). We fit stellar population synthesis models from the Binary Population And Spectral Synthesis code (v2.2.1) to medium-resolution (R ∼ 1000) and high signal-to-noise (&gt;30 per 100 km s−1 over the wavelength range 1221–1800 Å) composite spectra of galaxies in bins of stellar mass to determine their stellar metallicity, primarily tracing Fe/H. We find a strong correlation between stellar mass and stellar metallicity, with stellar metallicity monotonically increasing with stellar mass at low masses and flattening at high masses (M* ≳ 1010.3M⊙). Additionally, we compare our stellar metallicity measurements with the gas-phase oxygen abundance of galaxies at similar redshift and estimate the average [α/Fe] ∼ 0.6. Such high α-enhancement indicates that high-redshift galaxies have not yet undergone significant iron enrichment through Type Ia supernovae. Moreover, we utilize an analytic chemical evolution model to constrain the mass loading parameter of galactic winds as a function of stellar mass. We find that as the stellar mass increases, the mass loading parameter decreases. The parameter then flattens or reaches a turning point at around M* ∼ 1010.5M⊙. Our findings may signal the onset of black-hole-driven outflows at z ∼ 2.5 for galaxies with M* ≳ 1010.5 M⊙.

<div> Hubble Space Telescope, ground-based surveys, progenitor detection, Legacy Survey of Space and Time, supernova

总结:<br />
本文探讨了使用地面广域调查数据来增加核心坍缩超新星（SN）前体星探测率的可能性。研究发现，通过结合前SN和晚期图像来搜索前体星的消失可以提高检测率。通过对ZTF数据进行搜索验证了这一概念。然后，通过模拟近距离SN的种群估算了Vera C. Rubin望远镜的LSST的前体探测率。研究还指出，亮宿主星系的背景会降低LSST灵敏度，预计在10年的调查中将检测到大约50个红超巨前体星和数个黄色和蓝色超巨前体星。此外，预计还将检测数百个前SN暴发。 <div>
The direct detection of core-collapse supernova (SN) progenitor stars is a powerful way of probing the last stages of stellar evolution. However, detections in archival Hubble Space Telescope images are limited to about one detection per year. Here, we explore whether we can increase the detection rate by using data from ground-based wide-field surveys. Due to crowding and atmospheric blurring, progenitor stars can typically not be identified in preexplosion images alone. Instead, we combine many pre-SN and late-time images to search for the disappearance of the progenitor star. As a proof of concept, we implement our search of ZTF data. For a few hundred images, we achieve limiting magnitudes of ∼23 mag in the g and r bands. However, no progenitor stars or long-lived outbursts are detected for 29 SNe within z ≤ 0.01, and the ZTF limits are typically several magnitudes less constraining than detected progenitors in the literature. Next, we estimate progenitor detection rates for the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) with the Vera C. Rubin telescope by simulating a population of nearby SNe. The background from bright host galaxies reduces the nominal LSST sensitivity by, on average, 0.4 mag. Over the 10 yr survey, we expect the detection of ∼50 red supergiant progenitors and several yellow and blue supergiants. The progenitors of Type Ib and Ic SNe will be detectable if they are brighter than −4.7 or −4.0 mag in the LSST i band, respectively. In addition, we expect the detection of hundreds of pre-SN outbursts depending on their brightness and duration.

<div> 关键词: DECaLS, 星系团，质量关系，星等离散度，超大质量黑洞

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了DECaLS剪切目录中的不同参数与斯隆数字化天文巡天中心星系的哈洛质量（Mh）之间的关系。结果表明，这些参数与Mh存在强烈的正相关关系，其中包括星际质量（M*）、星等离散度（σ*）、丰度匹配哈洛质量（MAM）和卫星速度离散度（σs）。Mh-M*和Mh-σ*的关系与星系团的丰度密切相关，而Mh-MAM和Mh-σs的关系则独立于此。研究还表明，σs是其中最佳的代理参数。此外，通过组合M*、σ*和MAM构建新的代理参数，可以最小化对丰度密度和星际发射率的依赖。最后，研究还探讨了Mh-超大质量黑洞（SMBH）质量的关系，并发现了SMBH快速线性生长阶段的迹象。同时发现Mh、M*和σ*之间的关联随着M*的变化而变化，表明不同的过程推动了星系和SMBH在不同阶段的生长。 <div>
Based on the DECaLS shear catalog, we study the scaling relations between halo mass (Mh) and various proxies for Sloan Digital Sky Survey central galaxies, including stellar mass (M*), stellar velocity dispersion (σ*), abundance-matching halo mass (MAM), and satellite velocity dispersion (σs), and their dependencies on galaxy and group properties. In general, these proxies all have strong positive correlations with Mh, consistent with previous studies. We find that the Mh–M* and Mh–σ* relations depend strongly on group richness (Nsat), while the Mh–MAM and Mh–σs relations are independent of it. Moreover, the dependence on the star formation rate (SFR) is rather weak in the Mh–σ* and Mh–σs relations, but very prominent in the other two. σs is thus the best proxy among them, and its scaling relation is in good agreement with hydrodynamical simulations. However, estimating σs accurately for individual groups/clusters is challenging because of interlopers and the requirement for sufficient satellites. We construct new proxies by combining M*, σ*, and MAM, and find that the proxy with 30% contribution from MAM and 70% from σ* can minimize the dependence on Nsat and the SFR. We obtain the Mh–supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass relation via the SMBH scaling relation and find indications for rapid and linear growth phases for the SMBH. We also find that correlations among Mh, M*, and σ* change with M*, indicating that different processes drive the growth of galaxies and SMBHs at different stages.

<div> 关键词: 核心坍缩超新星，双峰射电光度曲线，环绕恒星介质，同步辐射，快速冷却

总结:
核心坍缩超新星（CCSNe）的一些案例显示在爆炸几年内的双峰射电光度曲线。研究人员提出了一种新的机制来解释这种现象，即在同步辐射光谱能量分布的进化模型中引入快速和慢速冷却阶段，从而在观测频率下系统变得对同步辐射自吸收。当快速冷却转变为慢速冷却阶段时，射电光度曲线就会呈现双峰特征。研究人员还提出SN 2007bg作为这种双峰射电超新星的特例，并建议该模型可能成为评估超新星中电子加速特性的潜在手段。  <br /><br /> <div>
It is recognized that some core-collapse supernovae (SNe) show a double-peaked radio light curve within a few years since the explosion. A shell of circumstellar medium (CSM) detached from the SN progenitor has been considered to play a viable role in characterizing such a rebrightening of radio emission. Here, we propose another mechanism that can give rise to the double-peaked radio light curve in core-collapse SNe. The key ingredient in the present work is to expand the model for the evolution of the synchrotron spectral energy distribution (SED) to a generic form, including fast and slow cooling regimes, as guided by the widely accepted modeling scheme of gamma-ray burst afterglows. We show that even without introducing an additional CSM shell, the radio light curve would show a double-peaked morphology when the system becomes optically thin to synchrotron self-absorption at the observational frequency during the fast cooling regime. We can observe this double-peaked feature if the transition from the fast cooling to slow cooling regime occurs during the typical observational timescale of SNe. This situation is realized when the minimum Lorentz factor of injected electrons is initially large enough for the nonthermal electrons’ SED to be discrete from the thermal distribution. We propose SN 2007bg as a special case of double-peaked radio SNe that can be possibly explained by the presented scenario. Our model can serve as a potential diagnostic for electron acceleration properties in SNe.

<br /><br />总结:
TDEs在后星爆星系中过度表示，通过重新审视TDE率并考虑AGN盘的演变，发现TDE率在AGN转为非活跃阶段时会显著增强约2个数量级，这提供了对于TDE在后星爆星系中过度表示的解释。 <div>
Tidal disruption events (TDEs) provide a valuable probe for studying the dynamics of stars in the nuclear environments of galaxies. Recent observations show that TDEs are strongly overrepresented in post-starburst or “green valley” galaxies, although the underlying physical mechanism remains unclear. Considering the possible interaction between stars and active galactic nucleus (AGN) disks, the TDE rates can be greatly changed compared to those in quiescent galactic nuclei. In this work, we revisit TDE rates by incorporating an evolving AGN disk within the framework of “loss cone” theory. We numerically evolve the Fokker–Planck equations by considering star–disk interactions, in situ star formation in the unstable region of the outer AGN disk, and evolution of the accretion process of supermassive black holes. We find that the TDE rates are enhanced by about 2 orders of magnitude shortly after the AGN transitions into an inactive stage. During this phase, the accumulated stars rapidly scatter into the loss cone due to the disappearance of the inner standard thin disk. Our results provide an explanation for the overrepresentation of TDEs in post-starburst galaxies.

Recent observations of Her X-1 with NuSTAR (as well as with INTEGRAL, Swift, and Astrosat) have provided evidence that the nearly 20 yr-long decay of the cyclotron line energy since ∼1994 has ended and that a stable value has replaced the decay. Using the observations of the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (Insight-HXMT) performed between 2017 July and 2020 February, we analyze the spectra of Her X-1 in its main-on state, focusing on tracing the evolution of cyclotron line energy. While our analysis of eight main-on observations with Insight-HXMT (two in coordination with NuSTAR) shows significant differences with the results of NuSTAR, two earlier findings are confirmed: the positive correlation between the cyclotron line energy and the X-ray flux (source luminosity) and the constancy of the flux-normalized cyclotron line energy during 2017–2020—albeit with significant uncertainty about the absolute value.

<div> T Tauri stars, disk evolution, planet formation, accretion, stellar mass
<br /><br />总结:
这项研究研究了T Tauri恒星的盘演化时间尺度及其与吸积的关系。通过对数据的分析，发现了1077颗盘载T Tauri恒星候选者，其中有783颗新分类为传统T Tauri恒星或弱线T Tauri恒星。研究发现，M<0.35M☉的TTS在大约0.1百万年内就失去了它们的盘，而M>0.35M☉的TTS几乎所有盘都能存活超过0.1百万年，大部分能存活1百万年甚至20百万年。此外，发现了随着年龄增长，全盘TTSs与吸积TTSs的比例都呈现下降趋势，确认了全盘TTSs和吸积对非全盘TTSs的演化速度更快。最后，研究还发现较低质量恒星的吸积比率普遍低于较高质量恒星，确认了吸积与恒星质量的依赖关系。 <div>
The full disk, full of gas and dust, determines the upper limit of planet masses, and its lifetime is critical for planet formation, especially for giant planets. In this work, we studied the evolutionary timescales of the full disks of T Tauri stars (TTSs) and their relations to accretion. Combined with Gaia EDR3, Two Micron All Sky Survey, and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer data, 1077 disk-bearing TTS candidates were found in LAMOST DR8, and stellar parameters were obtained. Among them, 783 are newly classified by spectra as classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs; 169) or weak-lined T Tauri stars (WTTSs). Based on EW and FWHM of Hα, 157 TTSs in accretion were identified, with ∼82% also having full disks. For TTSs with M &lt; 0.35M☉, about 80% seem to already lose their full disks at ∼0.1 Myr, which may explain their lower mass, while the remaining 20% with full disks evolve at similar rates of non-full disks within 5 Myr, allowing enough time and material to form giant planets. The fraction of accreting TTSs to disk-bearing TTSs is stable at ∼10% and can last ∼5–10 Myr, suggesting that full disks and accretion evolve with similar rates as non-full disks. For TTSs with M &gt; 0.35 M☉, almost all full disks can survive more than 0.1 Myr, most for 1 Myr and some even for 20 Myr. For TTSs with M &gt; 0.35 M☉, almost all full disks can survive more than 0.1 Myr, most for 1 Myr, and some even for 20 Myr, which implies planets are more likely to be formed in their disks than those of M &lt; 0.35 M☉, and thus M dwarfs with M &gt; 0.35 M☉ can have more planets. The fraction of full-disk TTSs to disk-bearing TTSs decreases with age following the relation f ∝ t−0.35, and similar relations existed in the fraction of accreting TTSs and the fraction of full-disk CTTSs, suggesting faster full disks and accretion evolution than non-full disks. For full-disk stars, the ratio of accretion of lower-mass stars is systematically lower than that of higher-mass stars, confirming the dependence of accretion on stellar mass, which may be reflective of an observational bias in the detection of accretion levels, with the lower-mass stars crossing below the detection threshold earlier than higher-mass stars.

Supermassive primordial stars with masses exceeding ∼105M⊙ that form in atomically cooled halos are the leading candidates for the origin of high-redshift quasars at z &gt; 6. Recent numerical simulations, however, find that multiple accretion disks can form within a halo, each of which can potentially host a supermassive star. We investigate the formation and evolution of secondary supermassive stars in atomically cooled halos, including strong variations in their accretion histories driven by gravitational interactions between their disks and those surrounding the primary supermassive stars in each halo. We find that all secondary disks produce long-lived supermassive stars under sustained rapid accretion. We also find, however, that the majority of secondary supermassive stars do undergo at least one protracted quiescent accretion phase, during which time they thermally relax and may become powerful sources of ionizing feedback. In many halos, the two satellite disks collide, suggesting that the two stars can come into close proximity. This may induce additional mass exchange between them, leading to a great diversity of possible outcomes. These range from coevolution as main-sequence stars to main sequence—black hole pairs and black hole—black hole mergers. We discuss the likely outcome for these binary interactions based on the evolutionary state of both supermassive stars at the end of our simulations, as well as prospects for their future detection by current and next-generation facilities.

这篇论文强调了测量冷星表面暗斑覆盖范围的重要性，以了解磁活动如何随旋转速率和对流区深度而变化。其中，利用分子带作为冷星表面暗斑的重要指标，可以准确评估恒星表面的暗斑范围。作者使用原子线和钛氧化物带的倒转过程，同时进行多普勒成像(DI)分析，得到了精确的表面斑点分布。此外，他们还首次在文献中利用高分辨谱线探索了色球活动指标。观测期间，发现色球发射与光球斑点覆盖之间存在相关性，除了可能的耀斑事件。作者通过TESS光度法检测出频繁的耀斑活动。他们还引入了一种基于Python的开源DI代码SpotDIPy，利用最大熵方法进行单星表面重建，并对比了DoTS代码的模拟结果，验证了两种代码的一致性。 <br /><br />总结: 这篇论文强调了测量冷星表面暗斑覆盖范围的重要性。利用分子带作为冷星表面暗斑的重要指标，可以准确评估恒星表面的暗斑范围。作者同时进行了多普勒成像分析和色球活动指标探索，并通过TESS光度法检测出频繁的耀斑活动。他们还引入了一种基于Python的开源DI代码SpotDIPy，验证了两种代码的一致性。 <div>
Measuring the coverage of dark spots on cool stars is important to understanding how stellar magnetic activity scales with the rotation rate and convection zone depth. In this respect, it is crucial to infer surface magnetic patterns on G and K stars, to reveal solar-like stellar dynamos in action. Molecular bands serve as invaluable indicators of cool spots on the surfaces of stars, as they play a crucial role in enabling accurate assessments of the extent of spot coverage across the stellar surface. Therefore, more reliable surface images can be obtained considering the inversion of atomic lines with molecular bands. In this context, we simultaneously carry out Doppler imaging (DI) using atomic lines as well as titanium oxide band profiles of PW And (K2 V) and also investigate chromospheric activity indicators for the first time in the literature, using high-resolution spectra. The surface spot distribution obtained from the inversion process represents both atomic line and TiO-band profiles quite accurately. The chromospheric emission is also correlated with photospheric spot coverage, except during a possible flare event during the observations. We detect frequent flare activity, using TESS photometry. We also introduce a new open-source, Python-based DI code SpotDIPy that allows performing surface reconstructions of single stars using the maximum entropy method. We test the code by comparing surface reconstruction simulations with the extensively used DoTS code. We show that the surface brightness distribution maps reconstructed via both codes using the same simulated data are consistent with each other.

总结:
该研究探讨了高斯过程（GPs）作为一种机器学习算法在重建哈勃参数H(z)方面的前景，考虑了即将到来的引力波观测任务eLISA和Einstein Telescope。研究假设了各种宇宙学背景模型，并利用实际生成的目录，非参数地利用GPs重建了Hubble参数。研究重点讨论了早期和晚期先验对H(z)重建的影响，进而对哈勃常数（H0）的影响。分析表明，GPs在特定任务的观测窗口内对宇宙膨胀历史的重建是相当稳健的。该研究进一步证实，eLISA和ET都能够提供对H(z)和H0的约束，这些约束与当前数据集的推断相竞争。特别地，研究发现，eLISA大约持续10年，观测到大约80个明亮的引力波事件时，将能够像大约持续3年的ET运行观测大约1000个明亮的引力波事件一样准确地约束H0。预计，在更长的eLISA任务持续时间（例如大约15年，有大约120个事件）内，精确度会有进一步提高。最后，针对每个模型，讨论了这些未来的引力波观测任务在解决哈勃张力中可能发挥的作用。 <br /><br /> <div>
We study the prospects of Gaussian processes (GPs), a machine-learning (ML) algorithm, as a tool to reconstruct the Hubble parameter H(z) with two upcoming gravitational-wave (GW) missions, namely, the evolved Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (eLISA) and the Einstein Telescope (ET). Assuming various background cosmological models, the Hubble parameter has been reconstructed in a nonparametric manner with the help of a GP using realistically generated catalogs for each mission. The effects of early-time and late-time priors on the reconstruction of H(z), and hence on the Hubble constant (H0), have also been focused on separately. Our analysis reveals that a GP is quite robust in reconstructing the expansion history of the Universe within the observational window of the specific missions under consideration. We further confirm that both eLISA and ET would be able to provide constraints on H(z) and H0, which would be competitive to those inferred from current data sets. In particular, we observe that an eLISA run of a ∼10 yr duration with ∼80 detected bright siren events would be able to constrain H0 as precisely as a ∼3 yr ET run assuming ∼1000 bright siren event detections. Further improvement in precision is expected for longer eLISA mission durations such as a ∼15 yr time frame having ∼120 events. Lastly, we discuss the possible role of these future GW missions in addressing the Hubble tension, for each model, on a case-by-case basis.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章主要介绍了M矮星的活动随时间的演化，特别关注了它们的磁活动以及X-UV辐射，这对于研究外层大气和宿主外行星的适居性至关重要。研究发现M矮星的活动会随着时间而有所下降，这可能成为确定M矮星年龄的重要因素。文章还讨论了M矮星活动与外行星大气流失机制的关联以及不同的磁活动机制。 <div>
The vast majority of stars in the nearby stellar neighborhood are M dwarfs. Their low masses and luminosities result in slow rates of nuclear evolution and minimal changes to the stars’ observable properties, even along astronomical timescales. However, they possess relatively powerful magnetic dynamos and resulting X-ray to UV (X–UV) activity, compared to their bolometric luminosities. This magnetic activity does undergo an observable decline over time, potentially making it a key age determinant for M dwarfs. Observing this activity is important for studying the outer atmospheres of these stars, but also for comparing the behaviors of different spectral type subsets of M dwarfs; e.g., those with partially versus fully convective interiors. Beyond stellar astrophysics, understanding the X–UV activity of M dwarfs over time is a key component when studying the atmospheres and habitability of any hosted exoplanets. Earth-sized exoplanets, in particular, are more commonly found orbiting M dwarfs than any other stellar type, and thermal escape (driven by the M dwarf X–UV activity) is believed to be the dominant atmospheric loss mechanism for these planets. Utilizing recently calibrated M dwarf age–rotation relationships, also constructed as part of the Living with a Red Dwarf program, we have analyzed the evolution of M dwarf activity over time, in terms of coronal (X-ray), chromospheric (Lyα, and Ca ii), and overall X–UV (5–1700 Å) emissions. The activity–age relationships presented here will be useful for studying exoplanet habitability and atmospheric loss, and also for studying the different dynamo and outer atmospheric heating mechanisms at work in M dwarfs.

光学光度曲线的早期阶段受到汤姆逊散射和超新星喷射物中的化学混合的影响。研究发现，考虑汤姆逊散射会导致光度峰值明显降低，并且初期光学光度曲线出现了持续几天的平台特征。此外，化学混合对模拟结果和观测数据之间的差异也起到了重要作用，表明简单的方法可能会引入很大的不确定性。总结:光学光度曲线受汤姆逊散射和化学混合的影响；汤姆逊散射降低了光度峰值；模拟结果出现了持续几天的平台特征；化学混合对模拟结果和观测数据之间的差异起到了重要作用。 <div>
Previous numerical simulations of double-peaked Type IIb supernova (SN IIb) light curves have demonstrated that the radius and mass of the hydrogen-rich envelope of the progenitor star can significantly influence the brightness and timescale of the early-time light curve around the first peak. In this study, we investigate how Thomson scattering and chemical mixing in the SN ejecta affect the optical light curves during the early stages of the SNe IIb using radiation hydrodynamics simulations. By comparing the results from two different numerical codes (i.e., STELLA and SNEC), we find that the optical brightness of the first peak can be reduced by more than a factor of 3 as a result of the effect of Thomson scattering that causes the thermalization depth to be located below the Rosseland mean photosphere, compared to the corresponding case where this effect is ignored. We also observe a short-lived plateau-like feature lasting for a few days in the early-time optical light curves of our models, in contrast to typical observed SNe IIb that show a quasi-linear decrease in optical magnitudes after the first peak. A significant degree of chemical mixing between the hydrogen-rich envelope and the helium core in SN ejecta is required to reconcile this discrepancy between the model prediction and observation. Meanwhile, to properly reproduce the first peak, a significant mixing of 56Ni into the hydrogen-rich outermost layers should be restricted. Our findings indicate that inferring the SN IIb progenitor structure from a simplified approach that ignores these two factors may introduce substantial uncertainty.

<title>Low-frequency Internal Gravity Waves Are Pseudo-incompressible</title>

<div> 内部重力波, 伪不可压缩, 频率极限, 位势扰动, 非绝热层

内部重力波在低频极限下自然是伪不可压缩的。在这种极限下, 一些anelastic近似形式无法正确再现内部重力波的行为。伪不可压缩近似假设压力的波动在连续方程中很小，而在非绝热层，这两种近似方法是相同的，但在稳定层中，它们之间的差异很大，只有伪不可压缩近似仍然有效。 <br /><br />总结: 内部重力波在低频极限下是伪不可压缩的，伪不可压缩近似假设压力的波动很小，适用于稳定层。与非绝热层的区别。 <div>
Starting from the fully compressible fluid equations in a plane-parallel atmosphere, we demonstrate that linear internal gravity waves are naturally pseudo-incompressible in the limit that the wave frequency ω is much less than that of surface gravity waves, i.e., \omega \ll \sqrt{{{gk}}_{h}}, where g is the gravitational acceleration and kh is the horizontal wavenumber. We accomplish this by performing a formal expansion of the wave functions and the local dispersion relation in terms of a dimensionless frequency \varepsilon =\omega /\sqrt{{{gk}}_{h}}. Further, we show that, in this same low-frequency limit, several forms of the anelastic approximation, including the Lantz–Braginsky–Roberts formulation, poorly reproduce the correct behavior of internal gravity waves. The pseudo-incompressible approximation is achieved by assuming that Eulerian fluctuations of the pressure are small in the continuity equation—whereas, in the anelastic approximation, Eulerian density fluctuations are ignored. In an adiabatic stratification, such as occurs in a convection zone, the two approximations become identical. However, in a stable stratification, the differences between the two approximations are stark and only the pseudo-incompressible approximation remains valid.

<div> JWST, NIRSpec, 红移, 宇宙星系形成率, 紫外光度函数
总结：<br /><br />这篇论文利用JWST/NIRSpec采集的光谱数据独立确认了16个红移为z=8.61-11.40的星系，并且发现了一个z=4.91的明亮干扰物。结合文献中的其他9个星系，共确认了25个星系，使用这些数据得出了紫外光度函数的确定性和下限，显示出对z∼12有轻微的红移演化。同时也得出了宇宙星系形成率密度的下限，证实了z∼12存在高星系形成率密度，支持了之前的光度研究结果。此外，作者还提出了一些观测策略，以有效地排除未来JWST项目中的低红移干扰因素。 <div>
We present pure spectroscopic constraints on the UV luminosity functions and cosmic star formation rate (SFR) densities from 25 galaxies at zspec = 8.61–13.20. By reducing the JWST/NIRSpec spectra taken in multiple programs of Early Release Observation, Early Release Science, General Observer, and Director’s Discretionary Time observations with our analysis technique, we independently confirm 16 galaxies at zspec = 8.61–11.40, including new redshift determinations, and a bright interloper at zspec = 4.91 that was claimed as a photometric candidate at z ∼ 16. In conjunction with nine galaxies at redshifts up to zspec = 13.20 in the literature, we make a sample of 25 spectroscopically confirmed galaxies in total and carefully derive the best estimates and lower limits of the UV luminosity functions. These UV luminosity function constraints are consistent with the previous photometric estimates within the uncertainties and indicate mild redshift evolution toward z ∼ 12, showing tensions with some theoretical models of rapid evolution. With these spectroscopic constraints, we obtain firm lower limits of the cosmic SFR densities and spectroscopically confirm a high SFR density at z ∼ 12 beyond the constant star formation efficiency models, which supports earlier claims from the photometric studies. While there are no spectroscopically confirmed galaxies with very large stellar masses violating the ΛCDM model due to the removal of the bright interloper, we confirm star-forming galaxies at zspec = 11–13 with stellar masses much higher than model predictions. Our results indicate possibilities of high star formation efficiency (&gt;5%), a hidden active galactic nucleus, a top-heavy initial mass function (possibly with Population III), and large scatter/variance. Having these successful and unsuccessful spectroscopy results, we suggest observational strategies for efficiently removing low-redshift interlopers for future JWST programs.

<div> Gravitational-wave emission, binary black hole systems, distribution estimation, population analysis, kernel density estimation
<br /><br />总结:
本文研究了通过引力波发射检测到的二进制黑洞系统，提出了一种基于核密度估计的自洽迭代方法来估计完整的二进制质量分布。研究发现，主要质量具有与以前调查一致的局部极大值，而次要质量分布具有部分独立的结构，并且与幂律和常数函数的q不一致。与大多数先前的调查不同，我们发现次要质量对几乎相等质量的二进制的偏好较小；相反，次要质量在略低于主要质量的地方具有自己的“光谱线”，并且我们观察到在∼10 M⊙峰值附近的主要和次要质量之间的反相关。 <div>
Binary black hole (BBH) systems detected via gravitational-wave emission are a recently opened astrophysical frontier with many unknowns and uncertainties. Accurate reconstruction of the binary distribution with as few assumptions as possible is desirable for inference of formation channels and environments. Most population analyses have, though, assumed a power law in binary mass ratio q, and/or assumed a universal q distribution regardless of primary mass. Methods based on kernel density estimation allow us to dispense with such assumptions and directly estimate the joint binary mass distribution. We deploy a self-consistent iterative method to estimate this full BBH mass distribution, finding local maxima in primary mass consistent with previous investigations and a secondary mass distribution with a partly independent structure, inconsistent both with a power law and with a constant function of q. We find a weaker preference for near-equal-mass binaries than in most previous investigations; instead, the secondary mass has its own “spectral lines” at slightly lower values than the primary, and we observe an anticorrelation between primary and secondary masses around the ∼10 M⊙ peak.
