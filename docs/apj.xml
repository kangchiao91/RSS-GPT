2020mot是典型的UV/光学潮汐撕裂事件（TDE），在一个平静的宿主中没有无线电或X射线特征。我们发现了i波段过剩和亮度衰减过程中的重新变亮，这可能是由TDE的两次连续尘埃回声引起的。我们按照van Velzen等人的方法对我们的观测进行建模，并发现近红外光变曲线可以通过∼0.1 pc内的稀薄尘埃的同心环解释，这个尺度在SMBH附近已被推测到的尘埃中是最小的。我们发现尘埃覆盖因子大约为fc ≤ 2%，远低于活动星系核尘埃环的发现。这些结果突显了将近红外观测纳入高密度瞬变研究中，TDE揭示黑洞周围环境的潜力。 <br /><br />总结: TDE在平静宿主中无无线电或X射线特征，观测到i波段过剩和重新变亮，可能是由两次尘埃回声引起的，建模结果显示近红外光变曲线可以用稀薄尘埃的同心环解释，进一步揭示黑洞周围环境。 <div>
AT 2020mot is a typical UV/optical tidal disruption event (TDE) with no radio or X-ray signatures in a quiescent host. We find an i-band excess and rebrightening along the decline of the light curve which could be due to two consecutive dust echoes from the TDE. We model our observations following van Velzen et al. and find that the near-infrared light curve can be explained by concentric rings of thin dust within ∼0.1 pc of a ∼6 × 106 M⊙ supermassive black hole (SMBH), among the smallest scales at which dust has been inferred near SMBHs. We find dust covering factors of order fc ≤ 2%, much lower than found for dusty tori of active galactic nuclei. These results highlight the potential of TDEs for uncovering the environments around black holes when including near-infrared observations in high-cadence transient studies.

<div> 磁螺度，磁闭合系统，磁通量，相对磁螺度，自螺度，相互螺度

相对磁螺度的理论发展主要集中在磁闭合系统内，对于磁闭合系统来说，边界没有磁通量通过。Berger & Field和Finn & Antonsen将磁螺度的定义扩展到相对磁螺度，适用于磁通量可以通过边界的磁开放系统。Berger用两个规范不变项表示相对磁螺度，描述了闭合在内部的磁场的自螺度以及穿过边界的磁场和闭合在内部的磁场之间的相互螺度。基于这一事实，我们将Berger对相对磁螺度的表达式扩展到了八个规范不变量，同时表征这些自螺度和相互螺度，并将它们归因于电流源J in和/或J∗ in，从而解开这些缠绕的链接的来源。我们将这八个项组成了关于内部和外部螺度（自螺度）以及内部-外部螺度（相互螺度）的新表达式，基于它们的来源领域。文章还讨论了这些链接对解释磁能的影响，并提出了用于追踪穿过边界的磁场演变的新边界可观测量。 <br /><br />总结: 磁螺度是用来测量体积内的磁场链接的物理量，文章讨论了磁闭合系统和相对磁螺度的概念，提出了八个规范不变量来描述磁螺度，并解释了其对磁能解释的影响。同时还提出了用于追踪边界磁场演变的边界可观测量。 <div>
Magnetic helicity, H, measures magnetic linkages in a volume. The early theoretical development of helicity focused on magnetically closed systems in bounded by . For magnetically closed systems, , no magnetic flux threads the boundary, . Berger & Field and Finn & Antonsen extended the definition of helicity to relative helicity, , for magnetically open systems where magnetic flux may thread the boundary. Berger expressed this relative helicity as two gauge-invariant terms that describe the self-helicity of the magnetic field that closes inside and the mutual helicity between the magnetic field that threads the boundary and the magnetic field that closes inside . The total magnetic field that permeates entangles magnetic fields that are produced by current sources J in with magnetic fields that are produced by current sources J∗ in . Building on this fact, we extend Berger's expressions for relative magnetic helicity to eight gauge-invariant quantities that simultaneously characterize both of these self and mutual helicities and attribute their origins to currents J in and/or J∗ in , thereby disentangling the domain of origin for these entangled linkages. We arrange these eight terms into novel expressions for internal and external helicity (self) and internal-external helicity (mutual) based on their domain of origin. The implications of these linkages for interpreting magnetic energy are discussed and new boundary observables are proposed for tracking the evolution of the field that threads the boundary.

该研究利用WSRT对NGC 6946进行了λ13厘米极化观测，研究了近侧宿主磁场。观测结果表明，该星系的λ13厘米极化展现出类似于λ18–22厘米或λ3和λ6厘米的二维形态，但需要更完整的频率覆盖来解释星系西南象限的极化间隙。研究利用WSRT、Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array和Effelsberg望远镜的观测数据，对湍流和一致的磁场进行了拟合模型，结果支持了一种多层湍流磁离子介质的假设，且与目前对边视星系的观测结果一致。研究还限制了同步辐射薄盘和厚盘（高度分别为300 pc和1.4 kpc）、热厚盘和星系晕（高度分别为1 kpc和5 kpc）的物理特性。该研究的首选模型显示，在距离中平面1 kpc以内存在颗粒状和高度湍流的介质，以及在星系晕中存在着较低程度的法拉第淡化。在星系晕中，研究估计了正规磁场强度为0.4–2.2 μG，湍流和总磁场强度约为6 μG，导致法拉第色散σRM = 4–48 rad m−2。这项研究展示了现代射电望远镜的先进能力如何为宇宙磁场研究开辟了新的领域。

We present λ13 cm polarization observations of the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 6946 with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) to examine the nearside halo magnetic fields. Despite λ13 cm exhibiting similar two-dimensional morphology as observed at longer (λ18–22 cm) or shorter (λ3 and λ6 cm) wavelengths, more complete frequency coverage will be required to explain the gap in polarization in the southwest quadrant of the galaxy. We fit models of the turbulent and coherent line-of-sight magnetic fields to the fractional degree of linearly polarized emission at λ3, λ6, λ13, λ18, and λ22 cm from observations taken with the WSRT, Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, and Effelsberg telescopes. The results favor a multilayer turbulent magneto-ionized medium consistent with current observations of edge-on galaxies. We constrain the physical properties of the synchrotron-emitting thin and thick disks (scale heights of 300 pc and 1.4 kpc, respectively) along with the thermal thick disk and halo (scale heights of 1 and 5 kpc, respectively). Our preferred model indicates a clumpy and highly turbulent medium within 1 kpc of the midplane, and a diffuse extraplanar layer with a substantially lower degree of Faraday depolarization. In the halo, we estimate a regular magnetic field strength of 0.4–2.2 μG and that turbulence and a total magnetic field strength of ∼6 μG result in a Faraday dispersion of σRM = 4–48 rad m−2. This work is an example of how the advanced capabilities of modern radio telescopes are opening a new frontier for the study of cosmic magnetism.

<div> LIGO/Virgo, compact object mergers, secular eccentricity oscillations, Lidov-Kozai mechanism, relativistic phase space diffusion
总结: LIGO/Virgo探测到的紧凑对象合并给双星演化和合并理论提出了挑战。一种有前途的产生合并的方法是通过由外部扰动器驱动的视向离心率振荡，可能是第三伴星或恒星团潮汐场。然而，简单的理论模型不考虑外部轨道时间尺度上的扰动扭矩的波动，可能加速合并。在通过任意球对称星团势能扰动的测试粒子四极限制中重新考虑了这些短时间尺度波动的影响，特别是包括1pN广义相对论的内部轨道近日点章动。我们发现了一个新效应，相对论相空间扩散（RPSD），它可以在外部轨道时间尺度上将双星跳到一个全新的动力学轨迹上，违反了DA积分守恒的近似。这种效应即使在分级三星系统中也会发生，但直到现在才被揭示出来。 <div>
The LIGO/Virgo detections of compact object mergers have posed a challenge for theories of binary evolution and coalescence. One promising avenue for producing mergers dynamically is through secular eccentricity oscillations driven by an external perturber, be it a tertiary companion (as in the Lidov–Kozai, LK, mechanism) or the tidal field of the stellar cluster in which the binary orbits. The simplest theoretical models of these oscillations use a “doubly averaged” (DA) approximation, averaging both over the binary’s internal Keplerian orbit and its “outer” barycentric orbit relative to the perturber. However, DA theories do not account for fluctuations of the perturbing torque on the outer orbital timescale, which are known to increase a binary’s eccentricity beyond the maximum DA value, potentially accelerating mergers. Here we reconsider the impact of these short-timescale fluctuations in the test-particle quadrupolar limit for binaries perturbed by arbitrary spherical cluster potentials (including LK as a special case), in particular including 1pN general relativistic (GR) apsidal precession of the internal orbit. Focusing on the behavior of the binary orbital elements around peak eccentricity, we discover a new effect, relativistic phase space diffusion (RPSD), in which a binary can jump to a completely new dynamical trajectory on an outer orbital timescale, violating the approximate conservation of DA integrals of motion. RPSD arises from an interplay between secular behavior at extremely high eccentricity, short-timescale fluctuations, and rapid GR precession, and can change the subsequent secular evolution dramatically. This effect occurs even in hierarchical triples, but has not been uncovered until now.

We report results of an in-depth numerical investigation of three-dimensional projection effects that could influence the observed loop-like structures in an optically thin solar corona. Several archetypal emitting geometries are tested, including collections of luminous structures with circular cross sections of fixed and random size, and light-emitting structures with highly anisotropic cross sections, as well as two-dimensional stochastic current density structures generated by fully developed magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. A comprehensive set of statistical signatures is used to compare the line-of-sight (LOS) integrated emission signals predicted by the constructed numerical models with the loop profiles observed by the extreme ultraviolet telescope on board the flight 2.1 of the High-Resolution Coronal Imager (Hi-C). The results suggest that typical cross-sectional emission envelopes of the Hi-C loops are unlikely to have high eccentricity, and that the observed loops cannot be attributed to randomly oriented quasi-two-dimensional emitting structures, some of which would produce anomalously strong optical signatures due to an accidental LOS alignment, as expected in the ''coronal veil“ scenario proposed recently by Malanushenko et al. The possibility of apparent loop-like projections of very small (close to the resolution limit) or very large (comparable with the size of an active region) light-emitting sheets remains open, but the intermediate range of scales commonly associated with observed loop systems is most likely filled with true quasi-one-dimensional (roughly axisymmetric) structures embedded into the three-dimensional coronal volume.

总结:
研究发现在离银河系附近形成的矮星系倾向于在其暗物质的质量下拥有更高的恒星质量，比较孤立的矮星系在高密度环境中也倾向于生长更快，更早地形成恒星。观测预测表明这些趋势表现在更孤立的矮星系中具有更低的停止形成恒星速率，更高的氢原子分数和更蓝的颜色。整体而言，这项研究将有助于我们更好地了解局部星系群中形成的矮星系在不同环境中的演化过程。 <div>
We are entering an era in which we will be able to detect and characterize hundreds of dwarf galaxies within the Local Volume. It is already known that a strong dichotomy exists in the gas content and star formation properties of field dwarf galaxies versus satellite dwarfs of larger galaxies. In this work, we study the more subtle differences that may be detectable in galaxies as a function of distance from a massive galaxy, such as the Milky Way. We compare smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations of dwarf galaxies formed in a Local Volume-like environment (several megaparsecs away from a massive galaxy) to those formed nearer to Milky Way–mass halos. We find that the impact of environment on dwarf galaxies extends even beyond the immediate region surrounding Milky Way–mass halos. Even before being accreted as satellites, dwarf galaxies near a Milky Way–mass halo tend to have higher stellar masses for their halo mass than more isolated galaxies. Dwarf galaxies in high-density environments also tend to grow faster and form their stars earlier. We show observational predictions that demonstrate how these trends manifest in lower quenching rates, higher H i fractions, and bluer colors for more isolated dwarf galaxies.

本文使用Lyα吸收轮廓来探测星际气体泡和太阳圈层对氢墙和太阳尾的吸收。通过比较具有长“彗星状”尾巴和短“新月饼状”尾巴的蝶形模型的模拟和观测Lyα吸收轮廓，可以探索太阳圈层内和附近的中性氢。两个模型对于鼻部目标（比如半人马α星和36蛇夫座）的Lyα轮廓几乎相同。然而，向尾部目标（HD 35296）观察到了Lyα轮廓的差异。虽然新月饼模型减少了太阳尾长度，但仍然观察到了明显的顺风太阳风吸收，只比彗星模型浅了5%，速度偏移了4 km/s。这意味着不需要扩展的尾巴模型来复现太阳圈层的Lyα吸收观察。更精细的观测光栅可以解决这一速度偏移。此外，当使用较高的星际介质（ISM）中性和等离子体密度以及较低的磁场（∣BLISM∣ = 3.2 μG, αBV ≈ 40°）时，发现与观测到的Lyα轮廓更好的一致性。没有一个模型能同时在所有方向上达成一致。此外，我们发现在对星际介质条件最不确定的情况下（np,LISM, nH,LISM, TLISM, BLISM），BLISM对氢墙结构和Lyα轮廓的影响最显著。<br /><br />总结: 本文利用Lyα吸收轮廓研究了太阳圈层的结构，并发现新月饼和彗星状的尾部模型对于大部分方向上的Lyα轮廓具有相似的效果，但在某些方向上存在差异。研究表明，不需要扩展的尾部模型来复现太阳圈层的观测结果，并且较高的星际介质密度和较低的磁场可以更好地模拟观测所得的Lyα轮廓。此外，本研究强调了磁场对氢墙结构和Lyα轮廓的重要影响。 <div>
Lyα absorption profiles have been used to detect astrospheres and heliospheric absorption from the hydrogen wall and heliotail. Using magnetohydrodynamic models of the heliosphere, we can compare simulated to observed Lyα profiles to probe the neutral hydrogen within and near the heliosphere. There is an ongoing controversy whether the heliosphere has a long “comet-like” tail or a short “croissant-like” tail. Here we present the first Lyα absorption investigation using a croissant-like heliosphere. With identical boundary conditions we compare the BU model, which presents a croissant-like tail, and the Moscow model, which presents a comet-like tail. The BU and Moscow models present nearly identical Lyα profiles toward nose targets (α Cen and 36 Oph). Differences in Lyα profiles are shown toward the tail target (HD 35296). Despite the shortened heliotail of the croissant model, significant downwind heliosheath absorption is seen, just 5% shallower and shifted by 4 km s−1. This implies that an extended tail model is not required to reproduce the heliosheath Lyα absorption observations. Finer observation gratings may be able to resolve this shift. Additionally, when using higher interstellar medium (ISM) neutral and plasma densities and lower magnetic field (∣BLISM∣ = 3.2 μG, αBV ≈ 40°) than in the Moscow model, we find better agreement with observed Lyα profiles. None of the models presented show agreement in all directions simultaneously. Furthermore, we show that for the ISM conditions with the least certainty (np,LISM, nH,LISM, TLISM, BLISM), BLISM has the most significant effect on the structure of the hydrogen wall and Lyα profiles.

<br />总结:<br />本研究对银河系的两个超微弱矮星系Eri IV和Cen I进行了光谱分析。通过使用IMACS/Magellan光谱仪，确定了Eri IV和Cen I的成员星数量，并测量了它们的速度、金属丰度和其他属性。研究发现Eri IV是目前已知的金属含量最低的星系之一，并且具有略微右偏的金属丰度分布。Cen I的金属丰度较低，且金属丰度分布较宽。研究还探讨了这两个星系的固有运动、轨道和宇宙物理J因子，结果表明Eri IV在间接探测暗物质方面具有很好的潜力。研究还指出没有发现Cen I或Eri IV受潮汐剥离的明显证据。综合来说，本研究的测量确认了Eri IV和Cen I是以暗物质为主导的星系，并且具有与其他已知超微弱矮星系相一致的属性。Eri IV的低金属丰度、右偏金属丰度分布和高J因子使其成为进一步研究的特别有趣的候选星系。 <div>
We present a spectroscopic analysis of Eridanus IV (Eri IV) and Centaurus I (Cen I), two ultrafaint dwarf galaxies of the Milky Way. Using IMACS/Magellan spectroscopy, we identify 28 member stars of Eri IV and 34 member stars of Cen I. For Eri IV, we measure a systemic velocity of , and velocity dispersion . Additionally, we measure the metallicities of 16 member stars of Eri IV. We find a metallicity of , and resolve a dispersion of σ[Fe/H]=0.20 ± 0.09. The mean metallicity is marginally lower than all other known ultrafaint dwarf galaxies, making it one of the most metal-poor galaxies discovered thus far. Eri IV also has a somewhat unusual right-skewed metallicity distribution. For Cen I, we find a velocity vsys = 44.9 ± 0.8 km s−1, and velocity dispersion . We measure the metallicities of 27 member stars of Cen I, and find a mean metallicity [Fe/H] = −2.57 ± 0.08, and metallicity dispersion . We calculate the systemic proper motion, orbit, and the astrophysical J-factor for each system, the latter of which indicates that Eri IV is a good target for indirect dark matter detection. We also find no strong evidence for tidal stripping of Cen I or Eri IV. Overall, our measurements confirm that Eri IV and Cen I are dark-matter-dominated galaxies with properties largely consistent with other known ultrafaint dwarf galaxies. The low metallicity, right-skewed metallicity distribution, and high J-factor make Eri IV an especially interesting candidate for further follow-up.

Binary and dual active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are an important observational tool for studying the formation and dynamical evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes. An entirely new method for identifying possible AGN pairs makes use of the exquisite positional accuracy of Gaia to detect astrometrically variable quasars, in tandem with the high spatial resolution of the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). We present a new pilot study of radio observations of 18 quasars (0.8 ≤ z ≤ 2.9), selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR16Q and matched with the Gaia DR3. All 18 targets are identified by their excess astrometric noise in Gaia. We targeted these 18 quasars with the VLA at 2–4 GHz (S band) and 8–12 GHz (X band), providing resolutions of 0.″65 and 0.″2, respectively, in order to constrain the origin of this variability. We combine these data with ancillary radio survey data and perform radio spectral modeling. The new observations are used to constrain the driver of the excess astrometric noise. We find that ∼44% of the target sample is likely to be either candidate dual AGN or gravitationally lensed quasars. Ultimately, we use this new strategy to help identify and understand this sample of astrometrically variable quasars, demonstrating the potential of this method for systematically identifying kiloparsec-scale dual quasars.

本研究引入了一种新的蒙特卡洛代码GNC，用于研究包括多种质量组成在内的星团在星系中心的超大质量黑洞附近的动力学弛豫。方法基于能量和角动量空间中的二维福克-普朗克方程，允许多种质量成分的演化，包括恒星和致密天体。通过加权方法，有效提高了稀有粒子结果的统计精度。本文首次发表了我们的方法的基本版本，着重研究了二体弛豫和损失锥效应。通过与先前研究的比较，我们在弛豫过程、能量和角动量分布、密度分布和损失锥消耗速率方面得到了一致的结果。我们不断观察到星团内切向各向异性的发展，而外部区域则倾向于保持近各向同性特征。GNC对于探索星系核中的各种有趣现象具有巨大的潜力，包括相对论性恒星动力学，提供了详细而富有洞察力的结果。 <div>
In this study we present a novel Monte Carlo code, referred to as GNC, which enables the investigation of dynamical relaxation in clusters comprising multiple mass components in the vicinity of supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies. Our method is based on two-dimensional Fokker–Planck equations in the energy and angular momentum space, and allows the evolution of multiple mass components, including stars and compact objects. The code demonstrates remarkable flexibility in incorporating additional complex dynamics. By employing a weighting method, we effectively enhance the statistical accuracy of rare particle results. In this initial publication, we present the fundamental version of our method, focusing on two-body relaxations and loss cone effects. Through comparisons with previous studies, we establish consistent outcomes in terms of relaxation processes, energy and angular momentum distributions, density profiles, and loss cone consumption rates. We consistently observe the development of tangential anisotropy within the cluster, while the outer regions tend to retain near-isotropic characteristics. GNC holds great promise for exploring a wide range of intriguing phenomena within galactic nuclei, including relativistic stellar dynamics, providing detailed and insightful outcomes.

本文报告了2012年7月5日21:42的耀斑事件SOL2012-07-05T21:42，观察到在一个太阳黑子的日珥-斑晕边界出现了约3分钟周期的增强振荡现象，这一振荡在色球和日冕通道中均有观察到。在耀斑前后观察到频率的变化，耀斑前存在大约200秒的可变边日辐射，而耀斑后在相同位置观察到了180秒的加强振荡。不同通道观察到的相位差异表明了从高温到低温通道的振荡。在理论上，频率变化与磁场倾角和色球温度的变化密切相关。通过对该区域性质的分析发现，频率变化是由于磁场倾角轻微减小相对于局部垂直所导致的。此外，我们推测增强的3分钟振荡与额外的加热有关，可能是由于耀斑的极紫外晚期阶段的向下流造成的。 <div>
Three-minute oscillations are a common phenomenon in the solar chromosphere above a sunspot. Oscillations can be affected by the energy release process related to solar flares. In this paper, we report on an enhanced oscillation in flare event SOL2012-07-05T21:42 with a period of around 3 minutes that occurred at the location of a flare ribbon at a sunspot umbral–penumbral boundary and was observed in both chromospheric and coronal passbands. An analysis of this oscillation was carried out using simultaneous ground-based observations from the Goode Solar Telescope at the Big Bear Solar Observatory and space-based observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory. A frequency shift was observed before and after the flare, with the running penumbral wave that was present with a period of about 200 s before the flare coexisting with a strengthened oscillation with a period of 180 s at the same locations after the flare. We also found a phase difference between different passbands, with the oscillation occurring from high-temperature to low-temperature passbands. Theoretically, the change in frequency was strongly dependent on the variation of the inclination of the magnetic field and the chromospheric temperature. Following an analysis of the properties of the region, we found the frequency change was caused by a slight decrease of the magnetic inclination angle with respect to the local vertical. In addition, we suggest that the enhanced 3 minute oscillation was related to the additional heating, maybe due to the downflow, during the EUV late phase of the flare.

We present the first results from Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observations as a part of the Fundamental Reference Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) Monitoring Experiment, a program to understand the relationship between AGN accretion physics and wavelength-dependent position as a function of time. With this VLA survey, we investigate the radio properties from a volume-complete sample of 25 hard X-ray-selected AGNs using the VLA in its wideband mode. We observed the targets in the A-array configuration at 4–12 GHz with all polarization products. In this work, we introduce our calibration and imaging methods for this survey, and we present our results and analysis for the radio-quiet AGN NGC 4388. We calibrated and imaged these data using the multiterm, multifrequency synthesis imaging algorithm to determine its spatial, spectral, and polarization structure across a continuous 4–12 GHz band. In the AGN, we measure a broken power law spectrum with α = − 0.06 below a break frequency of 7.3 GHz and α = − 0.34 above. We detect polarization at subarcsecond resolution across both the AGN and a secondary radio knot. We compare our results to ancillary data and find that the VLA radio continuum is likely due to AGN winds interacting with the local interstellar medium that gets resolved away at subparsec spatial scales as probed by the Very Long Baseline Array. A well-known ionization cone to the southwest of the AGN appears likely to be projected material onto the underside of the disk of the host galaxy.

<title>Ring Gap Structure around Class I Protostar WL 17</title>

WL 17 is a Class I object and was considered to have a ring–hole structure. We analyzed the structure around WL 17 to investigate the detailed properties of this object. We used Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array archival data, which have a higher angular resolution than previous observations. We investigated the WL 17 system with the 1.3 mm dust continuum and 12CO and C18O (J = 2–1) line emissions. The dust continuum emission showed a clear ring structure with inner and outer edges of ∼11 and ∼21 au, respectively. In addition, we detected an inner disk of <5 au radius enclosing the central star within the ring, the first observation of this structure. Thus, WL 17 has a ring–gap structure, not a ring–hole structure. We did not detect any marked emission in either the gap or inner disk, indicating that there is no sign of a planet, circumplanetary disk, or binary companion. We identified the source of both blueshifted and redshifted outflows based on the 12CO emission, which is clearly associated with the disk around WL 17. The outflow mass ejection rate is ∼3.6 × 10−7M⊙ yr−1 and the dynamical timescale is as short as ∼104 yr. The C18O emission showed that an inhomogeneous infalling envelope, which can induce episodic mass accretion, is distributed in the region within ∼1000 au from the central protostar. With these new findings, we can constrain the scenarios of planet formation and dust growth in the accretion phase of star formation.

<title>A Comparative Study between M30 and M92: M92 is a Merger Remnant with a Large Helium Enhancement</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We perform a comparative study of the ex situ second-parameter pair globular clusters (GCs) M30 and M92, having similar metallicities but different horizontal branch morphologies. We obtain similar mean primordial carbon abundances for both clusters. However, M92 shows a large dispersion in carbon due to a more extended C–N anticorrelation, while M30 exhibits a higher primordial nitrogen abundance, suggesting that they have different chemical enrichment histories. Our new results confirm our previous result that M92 is a metal-complex GC showing a bimodal metallicity distribution. We also find that the metal-rich group of stars in M92 shows a helium enhancement as large as ΔY ∼ 0.05 from the red giant branch bump V magnitudes, which can also be supported by (i) a lack of bright red giant branch stars, (ii) synthetic evolutionary horizontal branch population models and (iii) the more extended spatial distribution due to different degree of the diffusion process from their lower masses. We reinterpret the [Eu/Fe] measurements by others, finding that the two metallicity groups of stars in M92 have significantly different [Eu/Fe] abundances with small scatters. This strongly suggests that they formed independently out of well-mixed interstellar media in different environments. We suggest that M92 is a more complex system than a normal GC, most likely a merger remnant of two GCs or an even more complex system. In the Appendix, we address the problems with the recently developed color–temperature relations and the usage of broadband photometry in the populational taggings.

<title>An ALMA Spectroscopic Survey of the Brightest Submillimeter Galaxies in the SCUBA-2-COSMOS Field (AS2COSPEC): Physical Properties of z = 2–5 Ultra- and Hyperluminous Infrared Galaxies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report the physical properties of the 18 brightest (S870 μm = 12.4–19.2 mJy) and not strongly lensed 870 μm–selected dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs), also known as submillimeter galaxies (SMGs), in the COSMOS field. This sample is part of an ALMA band 3 spectroscopic survey (AS2COSPEC), and spectroscopic redshifts are measured in 17 of them at z = 2–5. We perform spectral energy distribution analyses and deduce a median total infrared luminosity of LIR = (1.3 ± 0.1) × 1013L⊙, infrared-based star formation rate (SFR) of SFRIR = 1390 ± 150 M⊙ yr−1, stellar mass of M* = (1.4 ± 0.6) × 1011M⊙, dust mass of Mdust = (3.7 ± 0.5) × 109M⊙, and molecular gas mass of Mgas = (αCO/0.8)(1.2 ± 0.1) × 1011M⊙, suggesting that they are one of the most massive, ISM-enriched, and actively star-forming systems at z = 2–5. In addition, compared to less massive and less active galaxies at similar epochs, SMGs have comparable gas fractions; however, they have a much shorter depletion time, possibly caused by more active dynamical interactions. We determine a median dust emissivity index of β = 2.1 ± 0.1 for our sample, and by combining our results with those from other DSFG samples, we find no correlation of β with redshift or infrared luminosity, indicating similar dust grain compositions across cosmic time for infrared luminous galaxies. We also find that AS2COSPEC SMGs have one of the highest dust-to-stellar mass ratios, with a median of 0.02 ± 0.01, significantly higher than model predictions, possibly due to too-strong active galactic nucleus feedback implemented in the model. Finally, our complete and uniform survey enables us to put constraints on the most massive end of the dust and molecular gas mass functions.

<title>Disentangling Multiple Emitting Components in Molecular Observations with Nonnegative Matrix Factorization</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Molecular emission from the galactic and extragalactic interstellar medium (ISM) is often used to determine the physical conditions of the dense gas. However, even from spatially resolved regions, the observed molecules do not necessarily arise from a single component. Disentangling multiple gas components is often a degenerate problem in radiative transfer studies. In this paper, we investigate the use of the nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) approach as a means to recover gas components from a set of blended line intensity maps of molecular transitions that may trace different physical conditions. We run a series of experiments on synthetic data sets designed to replicate conditions in two very different environments: galactic pre-stellar cores and the ISM in high-redshift galaxies. We find that the NMF algorithm often recovers the multiple components resembling those used in the data-generating process, provided that the different components have similar column densities. When NMF fails to recover all the individual components it does however group together the most similarly emitting ones. We further found that initialization and regularisation are key factors in the efficiency of the NMF algorithm.

The High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) started observing the extremely powerful long-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB) GRB 221009A starting 53 hr after the triggering event. The H.E.S.S. collaboration carried out observations on 2022 October 11, 12, and 17 under poor atmospheric conditions, without detecting significant very-high-energy photons from the source and computed the upper limits of the fluxes for the different nights. We study these flux upper limits by using the photohadronic model and show that the interaction of high-energy protons with synchrotron seed photons in the forward-shock region of the GRB jet exhibits behavior compatible with the upper limits computed by the H.E.S.S. collaboration.

<title>Using the Two-point Correlation Function to Understand the Assembly Histories of Milky Way–like Galaxies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The two-point correlation function (2PCF) is a powerful statistical tool to measure galaxy clustering. Although 2PCF has also been used to study the clustering of stars on subparsec to kiloparsec scales, its physical implication is not clear. In this study, we use the Illustris-TNG50 simulation to study the connection between the 2PCF of accreted halo stars and the assembly histories of Milky Way-mass galaxies. We find, in general, that the 2PCF signal increases with the increase in galactocentric radii, r, and with the decrease in the pair separations. Galaxies that assemble late on average have stronger 2PCF signals. With z1/4, z1/2, and z3/4 defined as the redshifts when galaxies accreted one-fourth, half, and three-fourths of their ex situ stellar mass today, we find they all show the strongest correlations with the 2PCF signals at r < ∼ 0.2R200. z3/4 shows the strongest correlations than those of z1/4 or z1/2. However, the correlations have large scatters. The 2PCFs in the velocity space show weaker correlations with the galaxy formation times within ∼0.35R200 than real-space 2PCFs, and the scatter is considerably large. Both the real- and velocity-space 2PCFs correlate with the assembly histories of the host dark matter halos as well. Within 0.3R200, the real-space 2PCF shows stronger correlations with the galaxy formation histories than with the halo formation histories. We conclude that it is difficult to use 2PCF alone to precisely predict the formation times or assembly histories of galaxies.

<div> 关键词: 黑洞旋转, 磁化极盘, 伽马射线暴, 赤道维度, 質量增加率
总结:<br /><br />这篇论文研究了新形成的黑洞在质量增加和角动量抽取的影响下，旋转的演化过程。通过磁化极盘模型的应用，发现黑洞如果吸积初始质量的20%，维度旋转将不可避免地达到小值a ≲ 0.2。在这种旋转下，研究人员发现该模型能够复制典型伽马射线暴喷流的能量和功率。推测出延迟的磁化极盘启动可以产生高功率的喷流，但最终旋转仍然会保持在较低水平。这些结果与通过引力波探测得出的二元黑洞合并产生的黑洞旋转低的结论一致。在另一篇论文中，观测伽马射线暴的结果被用来限制了新生黑洞的旋转为a ≃ 0.2。 <div>
The spin of a newly formed black hole (BH) at the center of a massive star evolves from its natal value due to two competing processes: accretion of gas angular momentum that increases the spin and extraction of BH angular momentum by outflows that decreases the spin. Ultimately, the final, equilibrium spin is set by a balance between both processes. In order for the BH to launch relativistic jets and power a γ-ray burst (GRB), the BH magnetic field needs to be dynamically important. Thus, we consider the case of a magnetically arrested disk (MAD) driving the spin evolution of the BH. By applying the semianalytic MAD BH spin evolution model of Lowell et al. to collapsars, we show that if the BH accretes ∼20% of its initial mass, its dimensionless spin inevitably reaches small values, a ≲ 0.2. For such spins, and for mass accretion rates inferred from collapsar simulations, we show that our semianalytic model reproduces the energetics of typical GRB jets, Ljet ∼ 1050 erg s−1. We show that our semianalytic model reproduces the nearly constant power of typical GRB jets. If the MAD onset is delayed, this allows powerful jets at the high end of the GRB luminosity distribution, Ljet ∼ 1052 erg s−1, but the final spin remains low, a ≲ 0.3. These results are consistent with the low spins inferred from gravitational wave detections of binary BH mergers. In a companion paper by Gottlieb et al., we use GRB observations to constrain the natal BH spin to be a ≃ 0.2.

The abundance of bright galaxies at z > 8 can provide key constraints on models of galaxy formation and evolution, as the predicted abundance varies greatly when different physical prescriptions for gas cooling and star formation are implemented. We present the results of a search for bright z ∼ 9–10 galaxies selected from pure parallel Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging programs. We include 132 fields observed as part of the Brightest of Reionizing Galaxies survey, the Hubble Infrared Pure Parallel Imaging Extragalactic Survey, and the WFC3 Infrared Spectroscopic Parallel survey. These observations cover a total of 620 arcmin2, about 70% of which is also covered with Spitzer Space Telescope infrared imaging. We identify 13 candidate galaxies in the range 8.3 < z < 11 with 24.5 < mH < 26.5 (−22.9 < MUV < −21.2), 11 of which constitute new discoveries. This sample capitalizes on the uncorrelated nature of pure parallel observations to overcome cosmic variance and leverages a full multiwavelength selection process to minimize contamination without sacrificing completeness. We perform detailed completeness and contamination analyses, and present measurements of the bright end of the UV luminosity function using a pseudobinning technique. We find a number density consistent with results from Finkelstein et al. and other searches in HST parallel fields. These bright candidates likely reside in overdensities, potentially representing some of the earliest sites of cosmic reionization. These new candidates are excellent targets for follow up with JWST, and four of them will be observed with the NIRSpec prism in Cycle 1.

<div> AGNs, ionized outflows, energy transfer, radiation force, SED
<br /><br />总结:
本文研究了活动星系核（AGN）的电离射流，发现能量和动量从AGN辐射传递到等离子体。辐射非常能量强劲，在距离等离子体较远的帕塞克尺度上能够导致流出。但在更靠近黑洞的地方，重力主导热能，气体处于所谓的“冷”状态，只有磁场或辐射力才能导致流出。研究表明，温度小于4×105K时，线辐射变得低效。同时，热驱动也开始与线驱动相当。此外，通过流体模拟，还说明了流出特性在从线驱动到热驱动的转变中的变化，以及它们对流出参数和SED的依赖。 <div>
Observations of ionized outflows from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) provide evidence of energy and momentum transfer from the AGN radiation to the plasma. The AGN radiation is very energetic. Therefore, at distances of parsec scale, where gravity is relatively weak, energy transfer alone can lead to outflow. Much closer to the black hole, gravity dominates thermal energy and the gas is in the so-called “cold” regime. Only magnetic or radiation forces can lead to outflow. However, it is unclear when the radiation force is efficient in overcoming gravity because of its dependence on the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the radiation and opacity. In this work, we survey the parameter space of radiation forces due to spectral lines resulting from blackbody SEDs with temperatures ranging from ∼104 to 106 K. The objective was to identify the radiation temperature above which line driving becomes inefficient. We find that the temperature ≲4 × 105 K marks such a transition. We also self-consistently calculate heating and cooling balance to estimate gas temperature and identify the transition where thermal driving becomes comparable to line driving. We summarize hydrodynamical simulations of radial outflows to illustrate how wind properties change during the transition from line to thermal driving and their dependence on outflow parameters and SED.

总结: 研究使用深度窄带成像技术观测了近邻螺旋星系M101，得出了其全面星际物质的恒星年龄信息。研究表明，M101存在辐射状恒星年龄梯度，同时在相对不受干扰的主盘区域发现了恒星年龄随螺旋臂距离的增加而逐渐变老的现象，这与动力学理论中大尺度冲击场景相符合。更出人意料的是，在外盘区域也发现了类似的模式，这超出了主要螺旋模式的共转半径范围。研究人员提出M101可能存在着动态或瞬变的螺旋模式，这些模式通过模式耦合形成了连贯的螺旋结构。这一情景将内向星系形成的辐射年龄梯度与动态螺旋臂理论中预测的跨臂年龄梯度结合起来，对整个星系的发展过程起到了一定的解释作用。<br /><br /> <div>
Using deep, narrowband imaging of the nearby spiral galaxy M101, we present stellar age information across the full extent of the disk of M101. Our narrowband filters measure age-sensitive absorption features such as the Balmer lines and the slope of the continuum between the Balmer break and 4000 Å break. We interpret these features in the context of inside-out galaxy formation theories and dynamical models of spiral structure. We confirm the galaxy’s radial age gradient, with the mean stellar age decreasing with radius. In the relatively undisturbed main disk, we find that stellar ages get progressively older with distance across a spiral arm, consistent with the large-scale shock scenario in a quasi-steady spiral wave pattern. Unexpectedly, we find the same pattern across spiral arms in the outer disk as well, beyond the corotation radius of the main spiral pattern. We suggest that M101 has a dynamic, or transient, spiral pattern with multiple pattern speeds joined together via mode coupling to form coherent spiral structure. This scenario connects the radial age gradient inherent to inside-out galaxy formation with the across-arm age gradients predicted by dynamic spiral arm theories across the full radial extent of the galaxy.

Shear instabilities can be the source of significant amounts of turbulent mixing in stellar radiative zones. Past attempts at modeling their effects (either theoretically or using numerical simulations) have focused on idealized geometries, where the shear is either purely vertical or purely horizontal. In stars, however, the shear can have arbitrary directions with respect to gravity. In this work, we use direct numerical simulations to investigate the nonlinear saturation of shear instabilities in a stably stratified fluid, where the shear is sinusoidal in the horizontal direction and either constant or sinusoidal in the vertical direction. We find that in the parameter regime studied here (nondiffusive, fully turbulent flow), the mean vertical shear does not play any role in controlling the dynamics of the resulting turbulence, unless its Richardson number is smaller than 1 (approximately). As most stellar radiative regions have a Richardson number much greater than 1, our result implies that the vertical shear can essentially be ignored in the computation of the vertical mixing coefficient associated with shear instabilities for the purpose of stellar evolution calculations, even when it is much larger than the horizontal shear (as in the solar tachocline, for instance).

The δT maps are dominated by coherent radial structures that move slowly (v ≪ c) inward and outward, which conflicts with the idea that disk variability is driven only by reverberation. Instead, these slow-moving temperature fluctuations are likely due to variability intrinsic to the disk. We test how modifying the input lightcurves by smoothing and subtracting them changes the resulting δT maps and find that most of the temperature fluctuations exist over relatively long timescales (hundreds of days). We show how detrending active galactic nucleus (AGN) lightcurves can be used to separate the flux variations driven by the slow-moving temperature fluctuations from those driven by reverberation. We also simulate contamination of the continuum emission from the disk by continuum emission from the broad-line region (BLR), which is expected to have spectral features localized in wavelength, such as the Balmer break contaminating the U band. We find that a disk with a smooth temperature profile cannot produce a signal localized in wavelength and that any BLR contamination should appear as residuals in our model lightcurves. Given the observed residuals, we estimate that only ∼20% of the variable flux in the U and u lightcurves can be due to BLR contamination. Finally, we discus how these maps not only describe the data but can make predictions about other aspects of AGN variability.

<div> PSB galaxies, size-mass relation, star formation history, MaNGA, spectroscopy<br />
<br />总结:<br />本研究利用 MaNGA 的最终数据发布版进行了对本地宇宙中后爆发星系（PSB）的大小-质量关系（SMR）和近期恒星形成历史（SFH）的研究。研究包括489个PSB星系，其中94个中心PSB区域的cPSB星系，85个环状PSB区域的rPSB星系，以及310个不规则PSB区域的iPSB星系。与类似星形成率、红移和质量的对照星系相比，所有类型的PSB样本都显示出类似的SMR，除了中心PSB星系cPSB具有中等质量处较小的尺寸。在星形成序列（iPSB-SF）中的iPSB星系显示出Dn（4000）、EW（HδA）和EW（Hα）无/弱梯度，与该类型星系的全局星形成状态一致；而寂静的iPSB（iPSB-Q）样本显示出Dn（4000）负梯度和EW（HδA）正梯度，表明内部区域具有年龄更老的恒星群。而cPSB和rPSB样本则显示出Dn（4000）正梯度和EW（HδA）负梯度，表明内部区域具有年轻的恒星群。这些结果表明，四种类型的PSB星系可以在演化路径上大致分为两类：（1）iPSB-SF和iPSB-Q，其SMR和SFH与对照星系相似，倾向于内部向外熄灭过程；（2）rPSB和cPSB，这两种类型可能是同一事件的不同阶段，并且可能是由于融合等瓦解事件所驱动的外向内熄灭过程，随着熄灭的进行，结构更加紧凑。 <div>
We study the size–mass relation (SMR) and recent star formation history (SFH) of post-starburst (PSB) galaxies in the local Universe using spatially resolved spectroscopy from the final data release of MaNGA. Our sample includes 489 PSB galaxies: 94 cPSB galaxies with central PSB regions, 85 rPSB galaxies with ringlike PSB regions, and 310 iPSB galaxies with irregular PSB regions. When compared to control galaxies of similar star formation rate, redshift, and mass, a similar SMR is found for all types of PSB samples except the cPSB galaxies, which have smaller sizes at intermediate masses ( ). The iPSB galaxies in the star-forming sequence (iPSB-SF) show no/weak gradients in Dn(4000), EW(HδA), and EW(Hα), consistent with the global star-forming status of this type of galaxy, while the quiescent iPSB (iPSB-Q) sample shows negative gradients in Dn(4000) and positive gradients in EW(HδA), indicating older stellar populations in the inner regions. Both the cPSB and rPSB samples show positive gradients in Dn(4000) and negative gradients in EW(HδA), indicating younger stellar populations in the inner regions. These results imply that the four types of PSB galaxies can be broadly divided into two distinct categories in terms of evolutionary pathway: (1) iPSB-SF and iPSB-Q, which have SMRs and SFHs similar to control galaxies, preferring an inside-out quenching process, and (2) rPSB and cPSB, which appear to be different stages of the same event and likely to follow the outside-in quenching process driven by disruption events such as mergers that result in a more compact structure as quenching proceeds.

<div> 关键词: 太阳耀斑, 太阳物质抛射, 磁环境, 先兆活动, 断裂模型
总结:
太阳大规模耀斑和物质抛射的理解需要对整个系统的演变进行详细的研究，包括包围源区的磁环境以及事件发生前的先兆活动的搜索。通过结合来自太阳动力学观测卫星（SDO）和STEREO-B太空船的立体观测，我们能够观察到2011年10月1日NOAA活跃区（AR）11305发生的一个丝状物质抛射、M1.2级爆发性耀斑和日冕物质抛射（CME）前几个小时的情况。我们发现在被抛射的丝状物质的东南方有两次明显的先兆性日冕变暗。在爆发期间，CME以相当大的速度向变暗区域迅速蔓延。我们利用SDO/Helioseismic和磁场观测仪（HMI）数据重建了系统的磁环境，并发现在变暗区域附近存在一个零点。活跃区11305与附近的AR 11302和11306以及其他衰减活跃区的联系十分复杂。先兆性的变暗伴随着环向上升的回环和朝零点方向的东南运动，以及朝远离的方向的东北和西南运动。这些运动和变暗与零点处持续的磁重连一致，因此在上升和东南移动时清除了AR 11305上方的拉紧磁场。最终，丝状物质以爆炸方式向零点抛射。我们得出结论，太阳耀斑的断裂模型对此事件提供了令人信服的解释。此外，我们推测先兆性的变暗可能比目前认识的要频繁得多。 <div>
Understanding large-scale solar eruptions requires detailed investigation of the entire system’s evolution, including the magnetic environment enveloping the source region and searches for precursor activity prior to event onset. We combine stereoscopic observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and STEREO-B spacecraft for several hours before a filament ejection, M1.2-class eruptive flare, and coronal mass ejection (CME) originating in NOAA active region (AR) 11305 on 2011 October 1. Two episodes of significant preeruption coronal dimming that occurred well to the southeast of the ejected filament are identified. The CME subsequently took off with a substantial component of velocity toward the dimming, which became very pronounced during eruption. We used SDO/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) data to reconstruct the magnetic environment of the system and found that it contains a null point near the dimming region. AR 11305 had quite complex connections to nearby ARs 11302 and 11306, as well as to other regions of decayed AR flux. The intensifying and spatially expanding precursor dimming was accompanied by southeastward rising motions of loops toward the null point and northeastward and southwestward motions of loops retracting away. These motions and the dimming are consistent with persistent magnetic reconnection occurring at the null point as it moved upward and southeastward, thereby removing a strapping magnetic field high above AR 11305. Eventually, the filament was ejected explosively toward the null point. We conclude that the breakout model for solar eruptions provides a compelling account of this event. Furthermore, we conjecture that preeruption dimmings may be much more frequent than currently recognized.

年轻、巨大的星团可能是能够加速银河系宇宙射线（CRs）至107–109 GeV（在“膝部”和“踝部”之间）范围内的候选者。通过考虑CR在星团周围的扩散、传播过程中的相互作用损失以及老式超新星遗迹对粒子的再加速效应，我们展示了一种银河系CR传输模型。我们提出了一种可能的模型，即利用观测到的银河系平面上年轻星团的分布，来解释CR中不同核的产生过程。我们的模型要求CR的源谱具有指数截断为5×107Z GeV（50Z PeV）的特性，并且来自于这些星团，同时还需要约占风动力学能量的5%来加速。最后，我们讨论了在考虑星团作为银河系“第二成分”CR的自然加速器时，实现这些要求的可能性和相关的不确定性。<br /><br />总结:年轻、巨大的星团可能是加速银河系宇宙射线的候选者，通过考虑CR的传输、再加速效应和观测到的星团分布来阐述了这一可能性。该模型需要CR的源谱具有特定的特征，并且需要一定比例的能量来加速。最后讨论了这一模型的可能性和不确定性。 <div>
We show that massive, young star clusters may be possible candidates that can accelerate Galactic cosmic rays (CRs) in the range of 107–109 GeV (between the “knee” and “ankle”). Various plausible scenarios, such as acceleration at the wind termination shock and supernova shocks inside these young star clusters, have been proposed, since it is difficult to accelerate particles up to the 107–109 GeV range in the standard paradigm of CR acceleration in supernova remnants. We consider a model for the production of different nuclei in CRs from massive stellar winds using the observed distribution of young star clusters in the Galactic plane. We present a detailed calculation of CR transport in the Galaxy, taking into account the effect of diffusion, interaction losses during propagation, and particle reacceleration by old supernova remnants to determine the all-particle CR spectrum. Using the maximum energy estimate from the Hillas criterion, we argue that a young, massive star cluster can accelerate protons up to a few tens of PeV. Upon comparison with the observed data, our model requires a CR source spectrum with an exponential cutoff of 5 × 107Z GeV (50 Z PeV) from these clusters, together with a CR injection fraction of ∼5% of the wind kinetic energy. We discuss the possibility of achieving these requirements in star clusters, as well as the associated uncertainties, in the context of considering star clusters as the natural accelerator of the “second component” of Galactic CRs.

<div> 长周期，无线电发射，中子星，白矮星，磁场
总结:<br /><br />最近发现了两个无线电发射源，周期分别为18分钟和21分钟。它们的明亮无线电发射类似于无线电磁体，但其长周期和在其他波长上的检测缺乏挑战了中子星的解释。相反，长旋转周期在白矮星中很常见，但尽管有预测，从孤立的磁性白矮星中未曾明确观测到偶极无线电发射。研究人员对这些长周期对象进行了调查，作为孤立中子星或白矮星的偶极无线电发射源，并发现两种情况都对我们对通过对偶极磁层中的对产生无线电发射的理解构成重大挑战。他们进行了基于两种图像中的偶极自旋衰减的群体合成模拟，假设不同的初始周期分布、质量、半径、束流分数和磁场预测，以评估超长脉冲星数量对其影响。在中子星场景中，根据任何物理上合理的（甚至是极端的）周期演化假设，我们不指望有大量超长周期脉冲星存在。另一方面，在白矮星情景中，我们可以轻松容纳大量长周期无线电发射源。然而，无法轻松解释这两种场景中产生如此明亮的相干无线电发射的机制。 <div>
The nature of two recently discovered radio emitters with unusually long periods of 18 minutes (GLEAM-X J1627–52) and 21 minutes (GPM J1839–10) is highly debated. Their bright radio emission resembles that of radio magnetars, but their long periodicities and lack of detection at other wavelengths challenge the neutron star (NS) interpretation. In contrast, long rotational periods are common in white dwarfs (WDs) but, although predicted, dipolar radio emission from isolated magnetic WDs has never been unambiguously observed. In this work, we investigate these long-period objects as potential isolated NS or WD dipolar radio emitters and find that both scenarios pose significant challenges to our understanding of radio emission via pair production in dipolar magnetospheres. We also perform population-synthesis simulations based on dipolar spin-down in both pictures, assuming different initial-period distributions, masses, radii, beaming fractions, and magnetic field prescriptions, to assess their impact on the ultra-long pulsar population. In the NS scenario, we do not expect a large number of ultra-long-period pulsars under any physically motivated (or even extreme) assumptions for the period evolution. On the other hand, in the WD scenario, we can easily accommodate a large population of long-period radio emitters. However, no mechanism can easily explain the production of such bright coherent radio emission in either scenarios.

<title>Energy-dependent Analyses of the Gamma-Ray Emission from HESS J1857+026 with Fermi-LAT</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report the discovery of the energy-dependent morphology of the GeV gamma-ray emission from HESS J1857+026 with more than 13 yr of Fermi Large Area Telescope data. The GeV gamma-ray emission from this region is composed of two extended components. The hard component with an index of 1.74 ± 0.07 in the energy range of 0.5–500 GeV is spatially coincident with HESS J1857+026, and its 68% containment radius varies from ∼0.°44 below 40 GeV to ∼0.°30 above 140 GeV. The hard GeV gamma-ray spectrum and the energy-dependent morphology of HESS J1857+026 make it favor a pulsar wind nebula origin, which is associated with the energetic pulsar PSR J1856+0245. The soft component with an index of 2.70 ± 0.16 and another extended gamma-ray source detected in this region, 4FGL J1857.9+0313e, with an index of 2.55 ± 0.07, are spatially coincident with two molecular clumps in the northeast and southwest of HESS J1857+026, which favors the hadronic process, and the protons could be accelerated by the hypothetical supernova remnant associated with PSR J1856+0245.

<title>A New Population of Mid-infrared-selected Tidal Disruption Events: Implications for Tidal Disruption Event Rates and Host Galaxy Properties</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Most tidal disruption events (TDEs) are currently found in time-domain optical and soft X-ray surveys, both of which are prone to significant obscuration. The infrared (IR), however, is a powerful probe of dust-enshrouded environments; hence, we recently performed a systematic search of NEOWISE mid-IR data for nearby, obscured TDEs within roughly 200 Mpc. We identified 18 TDE candidates in galactic nuclei, using difference imaging to uncover nuclear variability among significant host galaxy emission. These candidates were selected based on the following IR light-curve properties: (1) LW2 ≳ 1042 erg s−1 at peak; (2) fast rise, followed by a slow, monotonic decline; (3) no significant prior variability; and (4) no evidence for active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity in Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) colors. The majority of these sources showed no variable optical counterpart, suggesting that optical surveys indeed miss numerous obscured TDEs. Using narrow-line ionization levels and variability arguments, we identified six sources as possible underlying AGN, yielding a total of 12 TDEs in our gold sample. This gold sample yields a lower limit on the IR-selected TDE rate of (2.0 ± 0.3) × 10−5 galaxy−1 yr−1 ((1.3 ± 0.2) × 10−7 Mpc−3 yr−1), which is comparable to optical and X-ray TDE rates. The IR-selected TDE host galaxies do not show a green valley overdensity nor as a preference for quiescent, Balmer strong galaxies, which are both overrepresented in optical and X-ray TDE samples. This IR-selected sample represents a new population of dusty TDEs that have historically been missed by optical and X-ray surveys and helps alleviate tensions between observed and theoretical TDE rates and the so-called missing energy problem.

We develop a new method for spatially mapping a lower limit on the mass fraction of the cold neutral medium by analyzing the amplitude structure of , the Fourier transform of Tb(v), the spectrum of the brightness temperature of the H i 21 cm line emission with respect to the radial velocity v. This advances a broader effort exploiting 21 cm emission line data alone (without absorption line data, τ) to extract integrated properties of the multiphase structure of the H i gas and to map each phase separately. Using toy models, we illustrate the origin of interference patterns seen in . Building on this, a lower limit on the cold gas mass fraction is obtained from the amplitude of at high kv. Tested on a numerical simulation of thermally bi-stable turbulence, the lower limit from this method has a strong linear correlation with the “true” cold gas mass fraction from the simulation for a relatively low cold gas mass fraction. At a higher mass fraction, our lower limit is lower than the “true” value, because of a combination of interference and opacity effects. Comparison with absorption surveys shows a similar behavior, with a departure from linear correlation at NH I ≳ 3–5 × 1020 cm−2. Application to the DRAO Deep Field from DHIGLS reveals a complex network of cold filaments in the Spider, an important structural property of the thermal condensation of the H i gas. Application to the HI4PI survey in the velocity range −90 < v < 90 km s−1 produces a full sky map of a lower limit on the mass fraction of the cold neutral medium at 16.′2 resolution. Our new method has the ability to extract a lower limit on the cold gas mass fraction for massive amounts of emission line data alone with low computing time and memory, pointing the way to new approaches suitable for the new generation of radio interferometers.

<br /><br />总结:
本文扩展了ATMO 2020大气模型网格，以包括非太阳金属丰度和T矮星区的C/O比率。通过改变碳或氧元素丰度，发现这些元素的非太阳丰度可以基于H和K波段的形状来区分。通过比较这些新模型与三个基准晚期T矮星（GJ 570D、HD 3651B和Ross 458C）的Gemini近红外光谱仪（GNIRS）近红外（0.8–2.4 μm）中分辨率（R ≈ 1700）的光谱，发现在近红外光谱中存在模型-数据差异。排除了模型对分辨率的分子吸收表的假设的不足。最后，发现Ross 458C的GNIRS、SpeX和其他近红外光谱之间存在偏差，表明存在潜在的光谱变化。 <div>
Measurements of the C/O ratio in brown dwarfs are lacking, in part due to past models adopting solar C/O only. We have expanded the ATMO 2020 atmosphere model grid to include nonsolar metallicities and C/O ratios in the T dwarf regime. We change the C/O ratio by altering either the carbon or oxygen elemental abundances, and we find that nonsolar abundances of these elements can be distinguished based on the shapes of the H and K bands. We compare these new models with medium-resolution (R ≈ 1700), near-infrared (0.8–2.4 μm) Gemini Near-Infrared Spectrograph (GNIRS) spectra of three benchmark late-T dwarfs, GJ 570D, HD 3651B, and Ross 458C. We find solar C/O ratios and best-fitting parameters (Teff, , Z) broadly consistent with other analyses in the literature based on low-resolution (R ∼ 100) data. The model-data discrepancies in the near-infrared spectra are consistent across all three objects. These discrepancies are alleviated when fitting the Y, J, H, and K bands individually, but the resulting best-fit parameters are inconsistent and disagree with the results from the full spectrum. By examining the model atmosphere properties we find this is due to the interplay of gravity and metallicity on H2–H2 collisionally induced absorption. We therefore conclude that there are no significant issues with the molecular opacity tables used in the models at this spectral resolution. Instead, deficiencies are more likely to lie in the model assumptions regarding the thermal structures. Finally, we find a discrepancy between the GNIRS, SpeX, and other near-infrared spectra in the literature of Ross 458C, indicating potential spectroscopic variability.

总结:<br />这项研究利用宇宙N体模拟中的星系红移调查数据，构建了星系聚集统计的高斯过程模拟器，以约束宇宙学和星系偏置参数。除了标准统计学之外，还模拟了包括有关局部环境信息的统计学，这扩展了Aemulus III对红移空间畸变的模型。该研究发现，超越标准统计学的额外统计学可以显著提高对感兴趣的宇宙学参数的约束能力。此外，研究还发现小尺度（约6 h^-1 Mpc以下）包含与大尺度同样多的信息，密度敏感的统计学对约束占有分布参数和灵活的环境相关组装偏差模型也做出了贡献。这一分析证明了在小尺度模拟超越标准聚类统计学的潜力，以约束结构的增长作为对宇宙加速膨胀的检验。 <div>
There is untapped cosmological information in galaxy redshift surveys in the nonlinear regime. In this work, we use the Aemulus suite of cosmological N-body simulations to construct Gaussian process emulators of galaxy clustering statistics at small scales (0.1–50 h−1 Mpc) in order to constrain cosmological and galaxy bias parameters. In addition to standard statistics—the projected correlation function wp(rp), the redshift-space monopole of the correlation function ξ0(s), and the quadrupole ξ2(s)—we emulate statistics that include information about the local environment, namely the underdensity probability function PU(s) and the density-marked correlation function M(s). This extends the model of Aemulus III for redshift-space distortions by including new statistics sensitive to galaxy assembly bias. In recovery tests, we find that the beyond-standard statistics significantly increase the constraining power on cosmological parameters of interest: including PU(s) and M(s) improves the precision of our constraints on Ωm by 27%, σ8 by 19%, and the growth of structure parameter, fσ8, by 12% compared to standard statistics. We additionally find that scales below ∼6 h−1 Mpc contain as much information as larger scales. The density-sensitive statistics also contribute to constraining halo occupation distribution parameters and a flexible environment-dependent assembly bias model, which is important for extracting the small-scale cosmological information as well as understanding the galaxy–halo connection. This analysis demonstrates the potential of emulating beyond-standard clustering statistics at small scales to constrain the growth of structure as a test of cosmic acceleration.

这篇论文研究了在活动星系核盘中发生的二元黑洞合并的EM辐射。研究发现，剩余的BH将通过吸积磁化介质在盘中形成一个射流。我们探讨了射流 - 壳系统的三种辐射机制 - 射流突破辐射、盘壳冷却辐射和射流壳体冷却辐射，并发现射流壳体冷却辐射很可能在自己的频段内被检测到。我们预测了一个持续约O(103)秒的软X射线瞬变，作为EM对应体，GW触发后约O(10)天的时间延迟有助于跟进观测。因此，AGN盘中的BBH合并代表了一种新颖的多信使源。在未来，通过测量和定位GW的提高精度，再加上对这些相关EM信号的勤奋搜索，将有效地验证或限制BBH合并在AGN盘中的起源。 <br /><br />总结: <br />在活动星系核盘中发生的二元黑洞合并会产生EM辐射，包括射流、壳体系统的三种辐射机制，以及软X射线瞬变作为EM对应体的预测。这些发现对于验证或限制BBH合并在AGN盘中的起源有重要意义。 <div>
The disk of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) is widely regarded as a prominent formation channel of binary black hole (BBH) mergers that can be detected through gravitational waves (GWs). Besides, the presence of dense environmental gas offers the potential for an embedded BBH merger to produce electromagnetic (EM) counterparts. In this paper, we investigate EM emission powered by the kicked remnant of a BBH merger occurring within the AGN disk. The remnant BH will launch a jet via the accretion of a magnetized medium as it traverses the disk. The resulting jet will decelerate and dissipate energy into a lateral cocoon as it propagates. We explore three radiation mechanisms of the jet–cocoon system—jet breakout emission, disk cocoon cooling emission, and jet cocoon cooling emission—and find that the jet cocoon cooling emission is likely to be detected in its own frequency bands. We predict a soft X-ray transient, lasting for O(103) s, to serve as an EM counterpart, of which the time delay O(10) days after the GW trigger contributes to follow-up observations. Consequently, BBH mergers in the AGN disk represent a novel multimessenger source. In the future, enhanced precision in measuring and localizing GWs, coupled with diligent searches for such associated EM signals, will effectively validate or restrict the origin of BBH mergers in the AGN disk.

<div> 关键词: GDXE, X射线源, 光谱拟合, 超新星遗迹, Sgr A*<br />
总结: 
本文研究了银河系扩散X射线辐射的光谱特性以及可能的起源。研究发现，GDXE的X射线光谱主要由紧凑X射线源和扩散X射线源组成。在对GCXE、GRXE和GBXE的光谱拟合中发现了额外的数据超量，经过分析发现这些超量可能来自碰撞电离平衡等离子体。通过添加碰撞电离平衡超新星遗迹的假设，改善了GRXE和GBXE的光谱拟合情况。然而，GCXE的光谱仍然不可接受，进一步的分析显示额外的数据超量可能来自辐合等离子体超新星遗迹。最后，研究提出了一种将所有紧凑X射线源和扩散X射线源结合起来的光谱拟合方法，可以定量和全面地预测GDXE光谱的起源。这为我们深入理解银河系X射线辐射的起源提供了新的解释。 <div>
Galactic diffuse X-ray emission (GDXE) can be spatially segmented into Galactic center X-ray emission (GCXE), Galactic ridge X-ray emission (GRXE), and Galactic bulge X-ray emission (GBXE). The X-ray spectra of GDXE are expressed by the assembly of compact X-ray sources, which are either white dwarfs (WDs) or X-ray active stars consisting of binaries with late-type stars. WDs have either a strong magnetic field or a weak magnetic field. WDs and X-ray active stars are collectively called compact X-ray stars. However, spectral fittings by the assembly of all compact X-ray stars for GCXE, GRXE, and GBXE are rejected, leaving significant excess near the energies of the Kα, Heα, and Lyα lines. These excesses are found in the collisional ionization equilibrium (CIE) plasma. Thus, the spectra of GRXE and GBXE are improved by adding CIE supernova remnants (SNRs). However, the GCXE spectrum is still unacceptable, with significant data excess due to radiative recombination emission (recombining plasma (RP)). The GCXE fit is then significantly improved by adding aged RP-SNRs. Aged RP-SNRs are made by a past big flare of Sgr A* emitting either hard X-rays or low-energy cosmic rays. The big flares may excite Fe and Ni atoms in cold diffuse gas (cold matter (CM)) and emit fluorescent X-ray lines. The CIE-SNRs, RP-SNRs, and CM are called diffuse X-ray sources. This paper presents the spectral fits by the assembly of all the compact and diffuse X-ray sources together with high-quality spectra and a combined fit among all the GDXE of GCXE, GRXE, and GBXE. This provides the first scenario to quantitatively and comprehensively predict the origin of the GDXE spectra.

总结:
本文研究了高银纬处的星际尘埃对天文背景减除、产生弥散散射光以及软化类星体的紫外光谱的影响。作者使用氢柱密度（H i和H2）和远红外（FIR）估计的尘埃红化来评估星际“气尘比”NH/E(B − V)，发现在银河平面这一比值为6.0 ± 0.2（以1021 cm−2 mag−1为单位）。研究发现在低红化视线中，最近的Planck对E(B − V)的估计比Schlafly & Finkbeiner高12%，同时NH I在不同的射电望远镜测量时存在显著变化。在对51个测量了H i和H2的类星体进行研究后，发现使用Planck E(B − V)数据得到的平均比值为10.3 ± 0.4（所有速度的气体）和9.2 ± 0.3（仅低速气体）。高银纬处的H2分数普遍很小（平均为2%–3%），但在39个∣b∣ ≥ 40°的视线中有9个具有1%–17%的fH2。由于FIR推断的E(B − V)对模拟尘埃温度Td和发射指数β很敏感，在低E(B − V)时，气尘比具有大的、不对称的误差。研究发现在具有高速云的视线中，气尘比升高，而高速气体贡献了NH但几乎没有红化。在Complex C中，当排除高速气体时，比值下降了40%。作者预期在银河平面上方的低金属气体中将会观察到尘埃含量的减少，这是因为在冲击中颗粒被破坏，沉降到盘面，以及在热晕气体中的热喷发。 <div>
Interstellar dust at high Galactic latitudes can influence astronomical foreground subtraction, produce diffuse scattered light, and soften the UV spectra of quasars. In a sample of 94 sight lines toward quasars at high latitude and low extinction, we evaluate the interstellar “gas-to-dust ratio” NH/E(B − V), using hydrogen column densities (H i and H2) and far-IR (FIR) estimates of dust reddening. In the Galactic plane, this ratio is 6.0 ± 0.2 (in units of 1021 cm−2 mag−1). On average, recent Planck estimates of E(B − V) in low-reddening sight lines are 12% higher than those from Schlafly & Finkbeiner, and NH I exhibits significant variations when measured at different radio telescopes. In a sample of 51 quasars with measurements of both H i and H2 and 0.01 ≤ E(B − V) ≲ 0.1, we find mean ratios 10.3 ± 0.4 (gas at all velocities) and 9.2 ± 0.3 (low-velocity only) using Planck E(B − V) data. High-latitude H2 fractions are generally small (2%–3% on average), although nine of 39 sight lines at ∣b∣ ≥ 40° have fH2 of 1%–17%. Because FIR-inferred E(B − V) is sensitive to modeled dust temperature Td and emissivity index β, gas-to-dust ratios have large, asymmetric errors at low E(B − V). The ratios are elevated in sight lines with high-velocity clouds, which contribute NH but little reddening. In Complex C, the ratio decreases by 40% when high-velocity gas is excluded. Decreases in dust content are expected in low-metallicity gas above the Galactic plane, resulting from grain destruction in shocks, settling to the disk, and thermal sputtering in hot halo gas.

总结:<br /><br />这项研究对具有三个或更多行星参与平均运动共振的外行星系统进行了全面探索。他们发现许多行星具有高倾角状态，可能在潮汐耗散的影响下保持稳定。通过两个观察到的系统的案例研究，他们展示了这些高倾角状态可能是在最初的盘驱动轨道迁移阶段获得的。此外，他们发现TRAPPIST-1行星很可能具有零倾角状态。这些结果突出显示了共振链的轨道和自转状态对行星形成和演化早期阶段的重要性。 <div>
About a dozen exoplanetary systems have been discovered with three or more planets participating in a sequence of mean-motion resonances. The unique and complex architectures of these so-called “resonant chains” motivate efforts to characterize their planets holistically. In this work, we perform a comprehensive exploration of the spin-axis dynamics of planets in resonant chains. Planetary spin states are closely linked with atmospheric dynamics and habitability and are thus especially relevant to resonant chains like TRAPPIST-1, which hosts several temperate planets. Considering a set of observed resonant chains, we calculate the equilibrium states of the planetary axial tilts (“obliquities”). We show that high-obliquity states exist for ∼60% of planets in our sample, and many of these states can be stable in the presence of tidal dissipation. Using case studies of two observed systems (Kepler-223 and TOI-1136), we demonstrate how these high-obliquity states could have been attained during the initial epoch of disk-driven orbital migration that established the resonant orbital architectures. We show that the TRAPPIST-1 planets most likely have zero obliquities, with the possible exception of planet d. Overall, our results highlight that both the orbital and spin states of resonant chains are valuable relics of the early stages of planet formation and evolution.

Common envelope evolution (CEE) is vital for forming short-orbital-period compact binaries. It covers many objects, such as double compact merging binaries, Type Ia supernovae progenitors, binary pulsars, and X-ray binaries. Knowledge of the common envelope (CE) ejection efficiency still needs to be improved, though progress has been made recently. Short-orbital-period hot subdwarf B star (sdB) plus white dwarf (WD) binaries are the most straightforward samples with which to constrain CEE physics. We apply the known orbital period–WD mass relation to constrain the sdB progenitors of seven sdB+WD binaries with a known inclination angle. The average CE efficiency parameter is 0.32. This is consistent with previous studies. However, the CE efficiency need not be constant, but a function of the initial mass ratio, based on well-constrained sdB progenitor mass and evolutionary stage. Our results can be used as physical inputs for binary population synthesis simulations of related objects. A similar method can also be applied to study other short-orbital-period WD binaries.

二元中子星融合可能产生快速移动的准等向材料喷发，导致热辐射和产生重元素的喷晕发射。与环境的相互作用会产生外部冲击，可能在并合后几十年持续产生持久的无线电信号。与超新星喷发相比，喷晕喷发的质量相对较小，速度更高，其扩展最终可能导致喷发密度变得很低，介质颗粒可以自由穿过喷发。这可能导致一种不完全的扫描对星际介质。使用玩具模型，研究发现这种不完全的扫描可以显著减少晚期无线电辐射功率，无论二元中子星融合是否导致黑洞或中子星的形成。因此，我们的发现意味着先前报告的某些短暴射线爆发的无线电上限可能并不一定对这些短暴射线爆发中存在长寿命磁星遗留下严格的限制。<br /><br />总结: 本研究揭示了二元中子星融合产生的喷发对周围环境的影响，以及其对无线电辐射的潜在影响。研究发现，喷发可能导致一种不完全的扫描对星际介质，从而减少无线电辐射功率。这一发现意味着先前对短暴射线爆发的无线电上限并不一定能够限制其中是否存在长寿命磁星遗留。 <div>
The coalescence of binary neutron stars can yield the expulsion of a fast-moving, quasi-isotropic material, which may induce thermal radiation and give rise to kilonova emission. Moreover, the interaction between the ejected material and the surrounding environment generates an external shock, which can result in a long-lasting radio signal that persists for several decades following the merger. In contrast to supernova ejecta, the kilonova ejecta exhibits a relatively lesser mass and higher velocity, and its expansion may ultimately result in the ejecta density becoming so low that the medium particles can freely pass through the ejecta. It would thereby lead to a kind of incomplete sweeping on the interstellar medium. Employing a toy model, our investigation reveals that such incomplete sweeping may considerably diminish the late-time radio radiation power, irrespective of whether the binary neutron star merger results in the formation of a black hole or a neutron star. Our findings thus imply that the previously reported radio upper limits for certain short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) may not necessarily place stringent constraints on the presence of a long-lived magnetar remnant in these short GRBs.

总结:<br /><br />本文研究了暗物质子暗的影响以及与更为研究的星和黑洞引力透镜现象相比较。研究发现，星团密度梯度和子暗物质子的分布对图像特性起着重要作用，导致在集群的正负奇偶性两侧出现不对称的图像特性。此外，子暗物质子的镜像特征可以在距离巨大集群的临界曲线1″的范围内找到，此外，子暗物质子还会在集群的正奇偶性一侧造成大于0.1等星等的像素级流量变化，并且这些像素往往聚集在（否则看不见的）子暗物质子周围。 <div>
Dark matter subhalos with extended profiles and density cores, and globular star clusters of mass 106–108M⊙ that live near the critical curves in galaxy cluster lenses can potentially be detected through their lensing magnification of stars in background galaxies. In this work, we study the effect such subhalos have on lensed images, and compare to the case of more well-studied microlensing by stars and black holes near critical curves. We find that the cluster density gradient and the extended mass distribution of subhalos are important in determining image properties. Both lead to an asymmetry between the image properties on the positive- and negative-parity sides of the cluster that is more pronounced than in the case of microlensing. For example, on the negative-parity side, subhalos with cores larger than about 50 pc do not generate any images with magnification above ∼100 outside of the immediate vicinity of the cluster critical curve. We discuss these factors using analytical and numerical analysis, and exploit them to identify observable signatures of subhalos: Subhalos create pixel-to-pixel flux variations of ≳0.1 mag on the positive-parity side of clusters. These pixels tend to cluster around (otherwise invisible) subhalos. Unlike in the case of microlensing, signatures of subhalo lensing can be found up to 1″ away from the critical curves of massive clusters.

太阳活跃区13283在2023年4月21日发生了一次日冕物质抛射，引发了强烈的地磁风暴。研究显示，演化的磁场积聚了螺旋度，同时，辐合和抵消的磁场通量导致了螺旋度注入的改变，导致磁通绳的不稳定性和进一步的喷发。研究进一步表明，日冕物质抛射的形态显示磁通绳顶部出现了高达56°的顺时针旋转。这次日冕物质抛射的分析表明，日冕物质在喷发过程中的旋转是导致强烈地磁风暴的关键因素。通过多仪器、多波长观测和磁场观测，我们能够更好地理解太阳活动对地球的影响。 <br /><br /> <div>
Using multi-instrument and multiwavelength observations, we studied a coronal mass ejection (CME) that led to an intense geomagnetic storm on 2023 April 23. The eruption occurred on April 21 in solar active region (AR) 13283 near the disk center. The AR was in its decay stage, with fragmented polarities and a preexisting long filament channel a few days before the eruption. The study of the magnetic field evolution suggests that the flux rope (filament) was built up by monotonous helicity accumulation over several days, and furthermore, converging and canceling fluxes led to a change in helicity injection, resulting in an unstable nature of the magnetic flux rope (MFR) and its further eruption. Importantly, the CME morphology revealed that the MFR apex underwent a rotation of up to 56° in clockwise direction owing to its positive helicity. The CME decelerates in the field of view (FOV) of the Large Angle Spectrometric Coronagraph and has a plane-of-sky velocity of 1226 km s−1 at 20 R⊙. In the FOV of the Heliospheric Imager, the lateral expansion of the CME is tracked better than the earthward motion. This implies that the arrival time is difficult to assess. The in situ arrival of the interplanetary CME shock was at 07:30 UT on April 23, and a geomagnetic storm commenced at 08:30 UT. The flux rope fitting to the in situ magnetic field observations reveals that the magnetic cloud flux rope orientation is consistent with its near-Sun orientation, which has a strong negative Bz-component. The analysis of this study indicates that the near-Sun rotation of the filament during its eruption to the CME is the key to the negative Bz-component and consequently the intense geomagnetic storm.

The theoretical oscillation frequencies of even the best asteroseismic models of solar-like oscillators show significant differences from observed oscillation frequencies. Structure inversions seek to use these frequency differences to infer the underlying differences in stellar structure. While used extensively to study the Sun, structure inversion results for other stars have so far been limited. Applying sound speed inversions to more stars allows us to probe stellar theory over a larger range of conditions, as well as look for overall patterns that may hint at deficits in our current understanding. To that end, we present structure inversion results for 12 main-sequence solar-type stars with masses between 1 and 1.15 M⊙. Our inversions are able to infer differences in the isothermal sound speed in the innermost 30% by radius of our target stars. In half of our target stars, the structure of our best-fit model fully agrees with the observations. In the remainder, the inversions reveal significant differences between the sound speed profile of the star and that of the model. We find five stars where the sound speed in the core of our stellar models is too low and one star showing the opposite behavior. For the two stars in which our inversions reveal the most significant differences, we examine whether changing the microphysics of our models improves them and find that changes to nuclear reaction rates or core opacities can reduce, but do not fully resolve, the differences.

<title>Fluid Mixing during Phase Separation in Crystallizing White Dwarfs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Accurate models of cooling white dwarfs must treat the energy released as their cores crystallize. This phase transition slows the cooling by releasing latent heat and also gravitational energy, which results from phase separation: liquid C is released from the solid C/O core, driving an outward carbon flux. The Gaia color–magnitude diagram provides striking confirmation of this theory by revealing a mass-dependent overdensity of white dwarfs, indicating slowed cooling at the expected location. However, the observed overdensity is enhanced relative to the models. Additionally, it is associated with increased magnetism, suggesting a link between crystallization and magnetic field generation. Recent works aimed at explaining an enhanced cooling delay and magnetic field generation employ a uniform mixing prescription that assumes large-scale turbulent motions; we show here that these calculations are not self-consistent. We also show that thermohaline mixing is most likely efficient enough to provide the required chemical redistribution during C/O phase separation, and that the resulting velocities and mixing lengths are much smaller than previous estimates. These reduced fluid motions cannot generate measurable magnetic fields, suggesting any link with crystallization needs to invoke a separate mechanism. Finally, this mixing alters the chemical profiles, which in turn affects the frequencies of the pulsation modes.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The discovery in 2014 of the pulsation from the ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) M82 X-2 has changed our view of ULXs. Because of the relatively short baseline over which pulsations have been detected so far, M82 X-2's spin state had been assumed to be in an equilibrium state. Using Chandra and XMM-Newton archive data, we are able to investigate the pulsation of M82 X-2 back to 2005 and 2001. The newly determined spin frequencies clearly show a long-term spin-down trend. If this trend is caused by magnetic threading, we infer a dipolar magnetic field of ∼1.2 × 1013 G and that a mild beaming factor (∼4) is needed to match the braking torque with the mass accretion torque. On the other hand, there are NuSTAR observations showing instantaneous spin-down behaviors, which might favor a variable prograde/retrograde flow scenario for M82 X-2.

We present a method to estimate the detection expectations of host galaxies of long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) in the grizJHKL bands. It is found that given the same limiting magnitude in each band, the z band produces the largest number of overall LGRB hosts and low-mass hosts (M* ≤ 108M⊙) at mag. For the detection of high-redshift LGRB hosts (redshift ≥5), it is recommended to prioritize the L band, due to its good performance at both low and high limiting magnitudes. We specifically estimate the expectation of LGRB host detection with mag, which the James Webb Space Telescope can partially attain. We find that there may exist 116, 259, 277, 439, 266, 294, 274, and 316 LGRB hosts, including 0.54, 31, 28, 143, 12, 20, 14, and 35 low-mass ones in the grizJHKL bands and 13, 14, 15, 14, and 15 high-redshift ones in the zJHKL bands, for 15 yr Swift LGRBs with S ≥ 10−6 erg cm−2. The results show that the study of LGRB hosts under next-generation observational conditions holds significant potential, especially for low-mass host studies. However, it appears that the deeper sensitivities of galaxy telescopes may not significantly enhance statistical studies of high-redshift hosts. Strategies aimed at increasing the number of distant LGRB hosts may require the expansion of high-redshift LGRB detections.

中文：本研究利用JWST和MIRI观测了一个亮度较低的Ia型超新星2022xkq的中红外光谱，发现了独特的谱线特征以及通过模拟推断了爆炸的白矮星的质量和中心密度等物理参数。观测结果显示出了稳定镍的特征，强的[Ti ii]谱线以及在[Ar]和[Co]中的离子比例等。根据观测结果，我们推断SN 2022xkq与一个质量接近钱德拉谱极限的白矮星的延迟爆炸模型相符合，模型显示了中心区域几乎没有混合，有利于偏心碳燃烧和偏心爆炸的转变的解释。进一步的观测可能有助于揭示更多的物理过程。本研究充分展示了MIRI的全波段覆盖和详细模拟的结合应用在研究Ia型超新星物理过程上的潜力。 <br /><br />总结: 该研究观测了亮度较低的Ia型超新星2022xkq的中红外光谱，发现了独特的谱线特征，并通过模拟推断了爆炸的白矮星的质量和中心密度等物理参数。观测结果有助于揭示Ia型超新星物理过程的细节，为进一步的研究提供了重要参考。 <div>
We present a JWST mid-infrared (MIR) spectrum of the underluminous Type Ia Supernova (SN Ia) 2022xkq, obtained with the medium-resolution spectrometer on the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) ∼130 days post-explosion. We identify the first MIR lines beyond 14 μm in SN Ia observations. We find features unique to underluminous SNe Ia, including the following: isolated emission of stable Ni, strong blends of [Ti ii], and large ratios of singly ionized to doubly ionized species in both [Ar] and [Co]. Comparisons to normal-luminosity SNe Ia spectra at similar phases show a tentative trend between the width of the [Co iii] 11.888 μm feature and the SN light-curve shape. Using non-LTE-multi-dimensional radiation hydro simulations and the observed electron capture elements, we constrain the mass of the exploding WD. The best-fitting model shows that SN 2022xkq is consistent with an off-center delayed-detonation explosion of a near-Chandrasekhar mass WD ( ≈1.37 M⊙) of high central density (ρc ≥ 2.0 × 109 g cm−3) seen equator-on, which produced M(56Ni) =0.324 M⊙ and M(58Ni) ≥0.06 M⊙. The observed line widths are consistent with the overall abundance distribution; and the narrow stable Ni lines indicate little to no mixing in the central regions, favoring central ignition of subsonic carbon burning followed by an off-center deflagration-to-detonation transition beginning at a single point. Additional observations may further constrain the physics revealing the presence of additional species including Cr and Mn. Our work demonstrates the power of using the full coverage of MIRI in combination with detailed modeling to elucidate the physics of SNe Ia at a level not previously possible.

<div> AGNs, low-mass galaxies, quenching, environment, star formation
<br /><br />
这篇文章讨论了在低质量星系中发现的活动星系核（AGNs）可能在扑灭星形成中扮演的作用。研究使用斯隆数字化天空巡天IV的调查数据，发现低质量星系中有41个AGNs。研究还发现，低质量星系中的AGNs更可能是孤立的或位于低质量星系群中。这表明环境不是这些星系扑灭星形成的主要原因。然而，我们不能排除过去的合并可能。总结: 本研究使用SDSS数据发现了低质量星系中的AGNs并提出了环境不是扑灭星形成的主要原因的可能性。 <div>
The discovery of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in low-mass (M* ≤ 5 × 109 M⊙) galaxies has pushed forward the idea that AGN feedback may play a role in quenching star formation in the low-mass regime. In order to test whether AGNs can be a dominant quenching mechanism, we must first disentangle the effects of internal and external processes caused by a galaxy’s environment. We have used the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory survey to produce resolved Baldwin, Phillips, & Terlevich diagrams, and we find 41 AGNs (∼1.3%) in low-mass galaxies. We have studied the group richness (the number of group members) of our AGN and non-AGN samples as a proxy for determining the possible effect of the environment on the gas reservoir in these galaxies. We find that low-mass galaxies hosting AGNs are more likely to be found in isolation or in low-mass groups than galaxies in the non-AGN samples. This preference is even more clear when we split our samples into star-forming and quiescent subsamples. This suggests that environment is not the main cause of quenching in these galaxies, though we cannot rule out the possibility of past mergers.

<div> 关键词: Cassini RADAR, 泰坦卫星, 季节演变, 效应温度, 甲烷水文

总结:<br />
本研究利用卡西尼雷达记录的数据研究了泰坦卫星北极的两个区域，在整个任务结束时，发现尽管夏季到来，但Ligeia Mare的效应温度几乎下降了1K，而固体区域的温度则缓慢上升至2017年增加了1.4±0.3 K。这些观察可以通过春分后泰坦表面和海洋的蒸发冷却来解释。利用海洋环流模型，研究表明海面的冷却应该会引发海洋内部的对流，最终冷却整个被卡西尼辐射计感知的液柱，因此使得即使在蒸发期过去很久之后，深处的温度也会下降。总的来说，这项工作突显了甲烷水文在控制泰坦北极地区表面和水下温度中的关键作用。 <div>
From 2004 to 2017, the Cassini RADAR recorded the 2.2 cm thermal emission from Titan’s surface in its passive (radiometry) mode of operation. We use this data set to investigate the seasonal evolution of the effective temperature sensed by the microwave radiometer in two regions in the northern pole of the satellite: the sea Ligeia Mare, and its nearby solid terrains. We find that despite the arrival of summer at the end of the mission, the effective temperature of Ligeia Mare decreased by almost 1 K, while that of the solid region slowly increased until 2017 by 1.4 ± 0.3 K. These observations, as well as the lag in summer warming observed by Cassini’s Composite Infrared Spectrometer, can be explained by evaporative cooling in both the solid and liquid surfaces after the vernal equinox. It therefore supports the idea that the northern polar terrains are wet. Using an ocean circulation model, we show that the cooling of the sea surface should initiate convection in the sea’s interior, ultimately cooling the whole liquid column sensed by the Cassini radiometer and thus decreasing the temperature at depths even long after the evaporation period has ceased. Overall, this work highlights the key role of methane hydrology in controlling the surface and submarine temperatures in the boreal polar regions of Titan.

<div> AGB stars, SiO masers, Galactic plane, Milky Way, radial velocities
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了位于银河平面之外的恒星，通过观测SiO masers，揭示了这些恒星的形成历史。共观测了102颗恒星，发现了8颗新的SiO masers。通过测量maser速度，初步估算了宿主AGB星的径向速度。发现其中三颗星的径向速度明显偏离了银河圆形运动的预期值。更新后的距离和3D速度表明，其中一颗位于银河暗盘，一颗可能位于银河薄盘，其余六颗可能属于银河厚盘。 <div>
Studying stars that are located off the Galactic plane is important for understanding the formation history of the Milky Way. We searched for SiO masers toward off-plane O-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars from the catalog presented by Mauron et al. in order to shed light on the origins of these objects. A total of 102 stars were observed in the SiO J = 1−0, v = 1 and 2 transitions with the Effelsberg 100 m and Tianma 65 m telescopes. SiO masers were discovered in eight stars, all first detections. The measured maser velocities allow for initial estimates of the host AGB stars’ radial velocities. We find that the radial velocities of three stars (namely G068.881−24.615, G070.384−24.886, and G084.453−21.863) significantly deviate from the values expected from Galactic circular motion. The updated distances and 3D motions indicate that G068.881−24.615 is likely located in the Galactic halo, while G160.648−08.846 is probably located in the Galactic thin disk, and the other six stars are probably part of the Galactic thick disk.

总结:
中小M型矮星的光谱观测表明，其中7个耀斑显示了清晰的Hα线蓝翼不对称性，耀斑持续时间从20分钟到2.5小时不等，并且也在Hβ线上显示了蓝翼不对称性。某些耀斑还在软X射线光谱中观察到，估算出了耀斑磁场和耀斑环的长度。蓝移组分的视向速度范围从-73到-122 km/s。假设蓝移是由突出体喷发引起的，那么上升等离子体的质量估计在10^15到10^19克之间，大致符合太阳日冕物质喷发（CME）的耀斑能量和喷发质量关系。这些发现暗示了M型矮星上可能存在与太阳喷发相似的加速机制，可能会发展成CME。 <br /><br /> <div>
We conducted the time-resolved simultaneous optical spectroscopic and photometric observations of mid-M-dwarf flare stars YZ CMi, EV Lac, and AD Leo. Spectroscopic observations were obtained using Apache Point Observatory 3.5 m and Small and Moderate Aperture Research Telescope System 1.5 m telescopes during 31 nights. Among the 41 detected flares, seven flares showed clear blue wing asymmetries in the Hα line, with various correspondences in flare properties. The duration of the blue wing asymmetries range from 20 minutes to 2.5 hr, including a flare showing the shift from blue to red wing asymmetry. Blue wing asymmetries can be observed during both white-light and candidate non-white-light flares. All of the seven flares showed blue wing asymmetries also in the Hβ line, but there are large varieties on which other chromospheric lines showed blue wing asymmetries. One among the 7 flares was also observed with soft X-ray spectroscopy, which enabled us to estimate the flare magnetic field and length of the flare loop. The line-of-sight velocities of the blueshifted components range from –73 to –122 km s−1. Assuming that the blueshifts were caused by prominence eruptions, the mass of upward-moving plasma was estimated to be 1015–1019 g, which are roughly on the relation between flare energy and erupting mass expected from solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Although further investigations are necessary for understanding the observed various properties, these possible prominence eruptions on M-dwarfs could evolve into CMEs, assuming the similar acceleration mechanism with solar eruptions.

在研究前主序恒星演化过程中，测量YSO（年轻恒星对象）的性质是关键工具。通过比较观测辐射与现有YSO光谱能量分布（SEDs）计算的模板格点，常用来测量YSO的性质。然而，目前我们还没有完整的星际形成理论。本文呈现了无假设演化理论的新版Robitaille YSO SEDs模型集合，可用于更广泛的理论评估。我们还计算了包层质量、加权平均尘埃温度、盘稳定性和星周AV，并将SEDs与新的滤波器进行卷积。我们发现了模型中平均温度与微米波长亮度之间的相关性，并讨论了对前主序和原恒星核的质量测量的影响。此外，我们比较了不同观测类别和演化阶段YSO在红外颜色空间中的位置，并使用我们的模型量化了由于观测效应可能引起的类别和阶段混淆程度。我们向公众发布了更新的模型。 <br /><br />总结: 研究了测量YSO性质的方法，提出了新版无假设演化理论的YSO SEDs模型集合，计算了多个性质并与新的滤波器进行卷积。发现了模型中的关联性，并比较了不同YSO在红外色彩空间的位置。 <div>
Measured properties of young stellar objects (YSOs) are key tools for research into pre-main-sequence stellar evolution. YSO properties are commonly measured by comparing observed radiation to existing grids of template YSO spectral energy distributions (SEDs) calculated by radiative transfer. These grids are often sampled and constructed using simple models of mass assembly/accretion over time. However, because we do not yet have a complete theory of star formation, the choice of model sets the tracked parameters and range of allowed values. By construction, then, the assumed model limits the measurements that can be made using the grid. Radiative transfer models not constrained by specific accretion histories would enable assessment of a wider range of theories. We present an updated version of the Robitaille set (2017) of YSO SEDs, a collection of models with no assumed evolutionary theory. We outline our newly calculated properties: envelope mass, weighted-average dust temperature, disk stability, and circumstellar AV. We also convolve the SEDs with new filters, including JWST, and provide users the ability to perform additional convolutions. We find a correlation between the average temperature and millimeter-wavelength brightness of optically thin dust in our models and discuss its ramifications for mass measurements of pre- and protostellar cores. We also compare the positions of YSOs of different observational classes and evolutionary stages in IR color space and use our models to quantify the extent to which class and stage may be confused due to observational effects. Our updated models are released to the public.

这篇文章报告了使用SPHYNX和FLASH两种模拟代码对旋转20M⊙原恒星的三维恒星核心坍缩超新星模拟的研究。研究发现在跳跃后的第一个100毫秒内，出现两个重要的引力波信号，频率分别约为300赫兹和1.3千赫。这两个特征与来自原恒星变形的m = 1调制有关，该调制由低T/∣W∣不稳定引起。根据观察结果，300赫兹特征在初始角速度为1.0至4.0弧度每秒的模型中存在，而1.3千赫特征仅出现在1.5至3.5弧度每秒的更窄范围内。研究还观察到一个较弱但显著的更高阶模式的引力波特征，其初始峰频约为800赫兹，并逐渐增加至900-1000赫兹。因此，除了引力反弹信号外，检测300赫兹、1.3千赫以及更高阶模式，甚至相关的中微子的不对称发射，可以提供额外的诊断信息来估计坍缩核的初始角速度。<br /><br />总结: <br />核心坍缩超新星模拟产生了约300赫兹和1.3千赫的重要引力波特征，这与m = 1变形和低T/∣W∣不稳定有关。此外，还观察到了更高阶模式的引力波特征。这些结果为估计坍缩核的初始角速度提供了额外的诊断信息。 <div>
We present self-consistent three-dimensional core-collapse supernova simulations of a rotating 20M⊙ progenitor model with various initial angular velocities from 0.0 to 4.0 rad s−1 using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code SPHYNX and the grid-based hydrodynamics code FLASH. We identify two strong gravitational-wave features with peak frequencies of ∼300 Hz and ∼1.3 kHz in the first 100 ms postbounce. We demonstrate that these two features are associated with the m = 1 deformation from the proto-neutron star (PNS) modulation induced by the low-T/∣W∣ instability, regardless of the simulation code. The 300 Hz feature is present in models with an initial angular velocity between 1.0 and 4.0 rad s−1, while the 1.3 kHz feature is only present in a narrower range, from 1.5 to 3.5 rad s−1. We show that the 1.3 kHz signal originates from the high-density inner core of the PNS, and the m = 1 deformation triggers a strong asymmetric distribution of electron antineutrinos. In addition to the 300 Hz and 1.3 kHz features, we also observe one weaker but noticeable gravitational-wave feature from higher-order modes in the range between 1.5 and 3.5 rad s−1. Its initial peak frequency is around 800 Hz, and it gradually increases to 900–1000 Hz. Therefore, in addition to the gravitational bounce signal, the detection of the 300 Hz, 1.3 kHz, the higher-order mode, and even the related asymmetric emission of neutrinos could provide additional diagnostics for estimating the initial angular velocity of a collapsing core.

总结:
A2744是一个由JWST提供数据支持的高分辨率自由形式质量模型。该模型结合了弱引力透镜和强引力透镜数据集，创造了迄今为止单个星团最严格的强引力透镜约束，同时也是迄今为止密度最高的弱引力透镜约束。质量重建显示出一个等腰三角形结构，完美地跟踪了最亮的星团星系。通过MARS算法，我们的质量模型显示出更低的多重像散射参数，远远低于以前的研究。我们还公开了质量和放大地图。 <div>
We present a new high-resolution free-form mass model of A2744 that combines both weak-lensing (WL) and strong-lensing (SL) data sets from JWST. The SL data set comprises 286 multiple images, presenting the most extensive SL constraint to date for a single cluster. The WL data set, employing photo-z selection, yields a source density of , marking the densest WL constraint ever. The combined mass reconstruction enables the highest-resolution mass map of A2744 within the ∼1.8 Mpc × 1.8 Mpc reconstruction region to date, revealing an isosceles triangular structure with two legs of ∼1 Mpc and a base of ∼0.6 Mpc. Although our algorithm, which is called MAximum-entropy ReconStruction (MARS), is entirely blind to the cluster galaxy distribution, the resulting mass reconstruction traces the brightest cluster galaxies remarkably well. The five strongest mass peaks coincide with the five most luminous cluster galaxies within ≲2″. We do not detect any unusual mass peaks that are not traced by the cluster galaxies, unlike the findings in previous studies. Our mass model shows the smallest scatter of SL multiple images in both source (∼0.″05) and image (∼0.″1) planes, which is lower than in previous studies by a factor of ∼4. Although MARS represents the mass field with an extremely large number of free parameters (∼300,000), it converges to a solution within a few hours because we use a deep-learning technique. We make our mass and magnification maps publicly available.

这篇文章分析了102个Ia型超新星（SNe Ia），这是迄今为止最大的样本，主要基于来自ZTF和ATLAS的归档数据。研究将SNe Ia分为内部集群样本和外部集群样本，并与类似红移的 quiescent 和 star-forming 宿主星系的场样本进行比较。研究发现，内部集群的SNe Ia有更高比例的快速演化天体（SALT3 x1 <−1），这意味着内部集群环境中存在一种本质上不同的SNe Ia种群。研究还表明，集群样本显示了明显的双峰x1分布，快速演化的天体在内部集群中占主导地位，而在星形成星系中占较小比例。此外，研究发现了宇宙膨胀的残差中SN Ia标准化参数的微小差异。研究建议星体群的年龄驱使了所观察的分布，年龄最大的星体群几乎完全产生了快速演化的SNe Ia。

We present an analysis of 102 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in nearby (z < 0.1), x-ray-selected galaxy clusters. This is the largest such sample to date and is based on archival data primarily from ZTF and ATLAS. We divide our SNe Ia into an inner cluster sample projected within r500 of the cluster center and an outer cluster sample projected between r500 and 2 r500. We compare these to field samples of SNe Ia at similar redshifts in both quiescent and star-forming host galaxies. Based on SALT3 fits to the light curves, we find that the inner cluster SNe Ia have a higher fraction of fast-evolving objects (SALT3 x1 < −1) than the outer cluster or field quiescent samples. This implies an intrinsically different population of SNe Ia occurs in inner cluster environments, beyond known correlations based on host galaxy alone. Our cluster samples show a strongly bimodal x1 distribution with a fast-evolving component that dominates the inner cluster objects (≳75%) but is just a small fraction of SNe Ia in field star-forming galaxies (≲10%). We do not see strong evidence for variations in the color (SALT3 c) distributions among the samples and find only minor differences in SN Ia standardization parameters and Hubble residuals. We suggest that the age of the stellar population drives the observed distributions, with the oldest populations nearly exclusively producing fast-evolving SNe Ia.

总结: <br />
最近，在银河系中心的分子云中探测到了顺式-反式碳酸，表明更稳定但目前尚未观测到的顺式-顺式构型在红外特征上有较强的特点。虽然能量较高的顺式-反式碳酸已经在毫米和厘米波长被探测到，由于其较大的偶极矩，但顺式-顺式碳酸的振动结构更适合在微米波长观测到。两种构型的红外强度都较大，并且其中一些特征落在不被多环芳烃主导的区域。水特征可能会阻碍在2.75μm的氢化物拉伸附近的观测，但在5.5-6.0μm范围内的其他振动基频甚至倍频可能通过JWST数据被识别。这项研究利用高水平和准确基准的量子化学非谐程序计算了与实验相比异常精确的旋转光谱数据。这种性能意味着在该研究中计算的红外吸收甚至级联发射光谱特征应该是准确的，并将为各种天文环境中对碳酸酸构型的观测提供所需的参考。 <div>
With the recent radioastronomical detection of cis-trans-carbonic acid (H2CO3) in a molecular cloud toward the Galactic center, the more stable but currently unobserved cis-cis conformer is shown here to have strong IR features. While the higher-energy cis-trans-carbonic acid was detected at millimeter and centimeter wavelengths, owing to its larger dipole moment, the vibrational structure of cis-cis-carbonic acid is more amenable to its observation at micron wavelengths. Even so, both conformers have relatively large IR intensities, and some of these fall in regions not dominated by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Water features may inhibit observation near the 2.75 μm hydride stretches, but other vibrational fundamentals and even overtones in the 5.5–6.0 μm range may be discernible with JWST data. This work has employed high-level, accurately benchmarked quantum chemical anharmonic procedures to compute exceptionally accurate rotational spectroscopic data compared to experiment. Such performance implies that the IR absorption and even cascade emission spectral features computed in this work should be accurate and will provide the needed reference for observation of either carbonic acid conformer in various astronomical environments.

We report the finding of a new, local diffusion instability in a protoplanetary disk which can operate in a dust fluid, subject to mass diffusion, shear viscosity, and dust–gas drag, provided the diffusivity, viscosity, or both, decrease sufficiently rapidly with increasing dust surface mass density. We devise a vertically averaged, axisymmetric hydrodynamic model to describe a dense, midplane dust layer in a protoplanetary disk. The gas is modeled as a passive component, imposing an effective, diffusion-dependent pressure, mass diffusivity, and viscosity onto the otherwise collisionless dust fluid, via turbulence excited by the gas alone, or dust and gas in combination. In particular, we argue that such conditions are met when the dust–gas mixture generates small-scale turbulence through the streaming instability, as supported by recent measurements of dust mass diffusion slopes in simulations. We hypothesize that the newly discovered instability may be the origin of filamentary features, almost ubiquitously found in simulations of the streaming instability. In addition, our model allows for growing oscillatory modes, which operate in a similar fashion as the axisymmetric viscous overstability in dense planetary rings. However, it remains speculative if the required conditions for such modes can be met in protoplanetary disks.

<title>What is the Reynolds Number of the Solar Wind?</title>

The Reynolds number, Re, is an important quantity for describing a turbulent flow. It tells us about the bandwidth over which energy can cascade from large scales to smaller ones, prior to the onset of dissipation. However, calculating it for nearly collisionless plasmas like the solar wind is challenging. Previous studies have used formulations of an “effective” Reynolds number, expressing Re as a function of the correlation scale and either the Taylor scale or a proxy for the dissipation scale. We find that the Taylor scale definition of the Reynolds number has a sizable prefactor of approximately 27, which has not been employed in previous works. Drawing from 18 years of data from the Wind spacecraft at 1 au, we calculate the magnetic Taylor scale directly and use both the ion inertial length and the magnetic spectrum break scale as approximations for the dissipation scale, yielding three distinct Re estimates for each 12 hr interval. Average values of Re range between 116,000 and 3,406,000 within the general distribution of past work. We also find considerable disagreement between the methods, with linear associations of between 0.38 and 0.72. Although the Taylor scale method is arguably more physically motivated, due to its dependence on the energy cascade rate, more theoretical work is needed in order to identify the most appropriate way of calculating effective Reynolds numbers for kinetic plasmas. As a summary of our observational analysis, we make available a data product of 28 years of 1 au solar wind and magnetospheric plasma measurements from Wind.

<title>Gas Morphology of Milky Way–like Galaxies in the TNG50 Simulation: Signals of Twisting and Stretching</title>

We present an in-depth analysis of gas morphologies for a sample of 25 Milky Way–like galaxies from the IllustrisTNG TNG50 simulation. We constrain the morphology of cold, warm, hot gas, and gas particles as a whole using a local shell iterative method and explore its observational implications by computing the hard-to-soft X-ray ratio, which ranges between 10−3 and 10−2 in the inner ∼50 kpc of the distribution and 10−5–10−4 at the outer portion of the hot gas distribution. We group galaxies into three main categories: simple, stretched, and twisted. These categories are based on the radial reorientation of the principal axes of the reduced inertia tensor. We find that a vast majority (77%) of the galaxies in our sample exhibit twisting patterns in their radial profiles. Additionally, we present detailed comparisons between (i) the gaseous distributions belonging to individual temperature regimes, (ii) the cold gas distributions and stellar distributions, and (iii) the gaseous distributions and dark matter (DM) halos. We find a strong correlation between the morphological properties of the cold gas and stellar distributions. Furthermore, we find a correlation between gaseous distributions with a DM halo that increases with gas temperature, implying that we may use the warm–hot gaseous morphology as a tracer to probe the DM morphology. Finally, we show gaseous distributions exhibit significantly more prolate morphologies than the stellar distributions and DM halos, which we hypothesize is due to stellar and active galactic nucleus feedback.

<title>Can Emission Measure Distributions Derived from Extreme-ultraviolet Images Accurately Constrain High-temperature Plasma?</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad1837</link>

Measuring the relative amount of high-temperature, low emission measure (EM) plasma is considered to be a smoking-gun observation to constrain the frequency of plasma heating in coronal structures. Often, narrowband, extreme-ultraviolet images, such as those obtained by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), are used to determine the EM distribution, though the sensitivity to high-temperature plasma is limited. Conversely, the soft X-ray wavelength range offers multiple high-temperature diagnostics, including emission lines of N vii, O vii, O viii, Fe xvii, Ne ix, and Mg xi, which can provide tight constraints to the high-temperature plasma in the log T = 6.1–6.7 (∼1–5+ MK) range. The Marshall Grazing Incidence X-ray Spectrometer (MaGIXS), a slitless spectrograph launched on a NASA sounding rocket on 2021 July 30, resolved an X-ray-bright point in multiple emission lines in the soft X-ray wavelength range. Using coordinated observations of the same X-ray-bright point from SDO/AIA, we compare and contrast the EM distributions from the EUV image data, the X-ray spectra, and the combined EUV and X-ray data set. In this paper, we demonstrate that EM distributions from SDO/AIA data alone can overestimate the amount of high-temperature (log T > 6.4) plasma in the solar corona by a factor of 3–15. Furthermore, we present our effort to cross-calibrate Hinode/X-ray Telescope (XRT) response functions by comparing the observed XRT fluxes with the predicted ones from combined MaGIXS-1 + AIA EM analysis.

One of the primary outstanding questions in extragalactic astronomy is the formation and early evolution of the supermassive black holes that are seen in nearly every massive galaxy. Low-metallicity dwarf galaxies may offer the most representative local analogs to pristine early galaxies, making them a vital tool in probing black hole seed models through the study of the intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) possibly hosted therein; though these dwarf galaxies, and the IMBHs they may host, are typically not as well-studied in this context as their higher-metallicity and higher-mass counterparts. In this paper, we explore the X-ray properties of a sample of 37 low-metallicity dwarf galaxies using archival XMM observations, and we compare the properties of this population against a representative sample of higher-metallicity counterparts. We report the detection of 10 sources with 0.3–10 keV luminosity in excess of 1040 erg s−1 within the low-metallicity sample, which we highlight for followup as potential IMBH candidates. Finally, we discuss the differing multiwavelength scaling relations (e.g., LX–LW2, LX–star formation rate) between the two galaxy populations, as well as the sample’s LX as a function of metallicity.

<br /><br />总结:
这项研究使用了更新和显著增加的Cepheid和TRGB距离样本，覆盖了大范围的金属丰度，并搜索了Cepheid脉动变星振幅与H ii区域金属丰度之间的相关性。研究表明，Cepheid和TRGB距离刻度的零点非常吻合，并且在较近距离选择样本中几乎为零。然而，在较远的样本中，两个距离刻度之间存在更大的偏移。研究还发现，使用除去红化的W(V,VI)周期-光度关系时，Cepheid距离刻度没有显著的金属丰度依赖性。 <div>
Using an updated and significantly augmented sample of Cepheid and tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) distances to 28 nearby spiral and irregular galaxies, covering a wide range of metallicities, we have searched for evidence of a correlation of the zero-point of the Cepheid period–luminosity relation with H ii region (gas-phase) metallicities. Our analysis, for the 21 galaxies closer than 12.5 Mpc, results in the following conclusions: (1) The zero-points of the Cepheid and TRGB distance scales are in remarkably good agreement, with the mean offset in the zero-points of the most nearby distance-selected sample being close to zero, Δμo(Cepheid—TRGB) = −0.026 ± 0.015 mag (for an I-band TRGB zero-point of MI = −4.05 mag); however, for the more distant sample, there is a larger offset between the two distance scales, amounting to −0.073 ± 0.057 mag 〈Δμo〉 (Cepheids—TRGB) = −0.026 ± 0.015 mag, for an I-band TRGB zero-point of MI = −4.05 mag. (2) The individual differences, about that mean, have a measured scatter of ±0.068 mag. (3) We find no statistically significant evidence for a metallicity dependence in the Cepheid distance scale using the reddening-free W(V, VI) period–luminosity relation: Δμo(Cepheid − TRGB) = − 0.022( ± 0.015) × ([O/H] − 8.50) − 0.003(±0.007).

From the formation mechanisms of stars and compact objects to nuclear physics, modern astronomy frequently leverages surveys to understand populations of objects to answer fundamental questions. The population of dark and isolated compact objects in the Galaxy contains critical information related to many of these topics, but is only practically accessible via gravitational microlensing. However, photometric microlensing observables are degenerate for different types of lenses, and one can seldom classify an event as involving either a compact object or stellar lens on its own. To address this difficulty, we apply a Bayesian framework that treats lens type probabilistically and jointly with a lens population model. This method allows lens population characteristics to be inferred despite intrinsic uncertainty in the lens class of any single event. We investigate this method’s effectiveness on a simulated ground-based photometric survey in the context of characterizing a hypothetical population of primordial black holes (PBHs) with an average mass of 30M⊙. On simulated data, our method outperforms current black hole (BH) lens identification pipelines and characterizes different subpopulations of lenses while jointly constraining the PBH contribution to dark matter to ≈25%. Key to robust inference, our method can marginalize over population model uncertainty. We find the lower mass cutoff for stellar origin BHs, a key observable in understanding the BH mass gap, particularly difficult to infer in our simulations. This work lays the foundation for cutting-edge PBH abundance constraints to be extracted from current photometric microlensing surveys.

We present results from angular cross correlations between select samples of CHIME/FRB repeaters and galaxies in three photometric galaxy surveys, which have shown correlations with the first CHIME/FRB catalog containing repeating and nonrepeating sources: Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) × SCOS, DESI-BGS, and DESI-LRG. We find a statistically significant correlation (p-value &lt;0.001, after accounting for look-elsewhere factors) between a sample of repeaters with an extragalactic dispersion measure (DM) &gt; 395 pc cm−3 and WISE × SCOS galaxies with redshift z &gt; 0.275. We demonstrate that the correlation arises surprisingly because of a statistical association between FRB 20200320A (extragalactic DM ≈ 550 pc cm−3) and a galaxy group in the same dark matter halo at redshift z ≈ 0.32. We estimate that the host halo, along with an intervening halo at redshift z ≈ 0.12, accounts for at least ∼30% of the extragalactic DM. Our results strongly motivate incorporating galaxy group and cluster catalogs into direct host association pipelines for FRBs with \lesssim 1^{\prime} localization precision, effectively utilizing the two-point information to constrain FRB properties such as their redshift and DM distributions. In addition, we find marginal evidence for a negative correlation at 99.4% confidence limit between a sample of repeating FRBs with baseband data (median extragalactic DM = 354 pc cm−3) and DESI-LRG galaxies with redshift 0.3 ≤ z &lt; 0.45, suggesting that the repeaters might be more prone than apparent nonrepeaters to propagation effects in FRB–galaxy correlations due to intervening free electrons over angular scales ∼0.°5.

<br /><br />总结: 本研究基于GW170817/GRB 170817A多信使事件的观测和理论预测，探讨了双中子星合并产生的高能辐射对近处观测者的潜在威胁。研究发现，基准KNe参数下，余辉的X射线辐射可能对约1pc范围内的观测者构成致命威胁，而辐射观测者的伽马射线辐射可能对约4pc范围内的观测者构成威胁，而最大的威胁来自余辉爆炸产生的宇宙射线，可以对约11pc范围内的观测者构成致命威胁。KNe的威胁距离与超新星类似，但发生频率远低。然而，本研究依赖于有限的KNe数据，多信使观测将澄清这类事件可能带来的威胁。 <div>
Binary neutron star mergers produce high-energy emissions from several physically different sources, including a gamma-ray burst (GRB) and its afterglow, a kilonova (KN), and, at late times, a remnant many parsecs in size. Ionizing radiation from these sources can be dangerous for life on Earth-like planets when located too close. Work to date has explored the substantial danger posed by the GRB to on-axis observers; here we focus instead on the potential threats posed to nearby off-axis observers. Our analysis is based largely on observations of the GW170817/GRB 170817A multi-messenger event, as well as theoretical predictions. For baseline KN parameters, we find that the X-ray emission from the afterglow may be lethal out to ∼1 pc and the off-axis gamma-ray emission may threaten a range out to ∼4 pc, whereas the greatest threat comes years after the explosion, from the cosmic rays accelerated by the KN blast, which can be lethal out to distances up to ∼11 pc. The distances quoted here are typical, but the values have significant uncertainties and depend on the viewing angle, ejected mass, and explosion energy in ways we quantify. Assessing the overall threat to Earth-like planets, KNe have a similar kill distance to supernovae, but are far less common. However, our results rely on the scant available KN data, and multi-messenger observations will clarify the danger posed by such events.

总结:<br /><br />
从2017年11月10日到2018年5月15日，利用云南天文台的60厘米望远镜收集了BL Lac S5 0716+714的光学数据，包括g、r和i波段的21396个准同步多波段观测点。通过朗伯-斯卡格尔周期图法和加权小波Z变换法，首次发现了一个周期为44±6天的QPO信号，最终显著性为3.98σ。进一步分析表明，44天QPO信号可能是由喷流中速度为β的斑点的螺旋运动引起的，喷流中发射区域的视角经历周期性变化。此外，利用假设检验方法分析了流量分布，并确定双对数正态分布更适合；因此，在这个源中可能存在两个辐射迷你区域，因此这个44天的QPO信号可能叠加在更长期的突发之上。 <div>
By means of astronomical observation data from the 60 cm Telescope at Yunnan Observatory, optical data in the g, r, and i bands were collected for BL Lac S5 0716+714, spanning from 2017 November 10 to 2018 May 15. The original data set contains 21,396 quasi-simultaneous multiband points, with 7132 data points for each band. The Lomb–Scargle periodogram method and the weighted wavelet Z-transform method were used to search for a quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) signal in the data. For the first time, we report a QPO signal at 44 ± 6 days with a final significance of 3.98σ. Further analysis of the spectrum index reveals that the 44 day QPO signal is most likely explained by a helical motion of a blob with velocity β in the jet, where the viewing angle of the emission region in the jet undergoes periodic variations. In addition, we employed the hypothesis testing method (the null hypothesis) to analyze the flux distribution and determined that a double log-normal distribution provides a better fit; thus, there may be two radiative mini-regions within a jet in this source, so this 44 day QPO signal may be superimposed on a longer-term outburst.

总结:
Sh2-87 H ii region的研究使用了光学到射电波段的多波段数据集。通过Herschel柱密度图和近红外光度数据生成的消光图，揭示了云的丝状结构和非均匀分布。在该区域鉴定出13个I类和202个II类年轻恒星对象（YSOs），以及22个Hα发射源。进一步分析表明，该星团主要由典型年龄约3百万年、质量在0.1-6.0太阳质量范围内的低质量YSOs组成。发现进化型YSOs主要分布在丝状结构和云的外部，而近期的星形成活动主要集中在中心区域的离子化气体和星形成团块中。Sh2-87区域的整体星形成情景与全局分级坍缩模型相似，年轻的大质量恒星形成活动预期在中心核心区域，同时在丝状结构和云的外部分布着进化型低质量YSOs。 <div>
We present a detailed study of the Sh2-87 H ii region using a multiwavelength data set in optical to radio bands. A Herschel column density map revealed that the host cloud is filamentary in nature, and together they formed a central dense hub. The extinction map generated using near-infrared photometric data also signifies the nonuniform distribution of the cloud and reveals its filamentary nature. We estimated a sizable variable extinction over the region up to AV = 34.4 mag, with an average value of AV = 3.4 mag. Using the various infrared color–color criteria, we identified 13 Class I and 202 Class II young stellar objects (YSOs) and 22 Hα-emitting sources toward this region. Further analysis showed that the cluster is mainly composed of low-mass YSOs with a typical age of ∼3 Myr having masses in the range of 0.1–6.0 M⊙. The identified evolved YSOs (i.e., Class II YSOs) are primarily distributed along the filaments and in the outer parts of the cloud, while the recent star formation, inferred by the presence of Class I YSOs, ionized gas, and star-forming clumps, is observed in the hub region. The overall star formation scenario in the Sh2-87 region resembles the global hierarchical collapse model of star formation, where younger massive star formation activity is expected at the central hub along with the distribution of evolved low-mass YSOs in the filaments and the outer parts of the cloud.

研究团队在澳大利亚平方公里阵列探路者变量和慢变源调查中发现了一个年轻的、高度分散的脉冲星。通过对Parkes射电望远镜进行跟踪观测，他们确定了PSR J1032−5804，测得其周期为78.7毫秒，离散度测量为819 ± 4 pc cm−3，旋转度测量为−2000 ± 1 rad m−2，特征年龄为34.6千年。该脉冲星在3 GHz的脉冲散射时间尺度约为22毫秒，暗示其在1 GHz的时间尺度约为3845毫秒，这使得其成为已知的第三个最分散的脉冲星，解释了其在先前的脉冲星调查中未被检测到的原因。研究团队通过分析脉冲星的频谱能量分布以及多波段图像中的周围延伸辐射，发现了可能存在的脉冲星风星云和超新星遗迹。这些结果突显了从射电连续图像中识别极端分散脉冲星的可能性。持续进行的大规模射电连续巡天将为我们提供一个前所未有的机会，发现更多极端脉冲星（例如高度分散、高度间歇和高度加速），从而增进我们对脉冲星和星际介质特性的理解。
<br /><br />总结: 高度分散脉冲星的发现； Parkes射电望远镜的跟踪观测结果； 脉冲星的特征参数和脉冲散射时间尺度的测算； 脉冲星风星云和超新星遗迹的可能发现； 未来射电连续巡天将促进对极端脉冲星的发现。 <div>
We report the discovery of a young, highly scattered pulsar in a search for highly circularly polarized radio sources as part of the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder Variables and Slow Transients survey. In follow-up observations with the Parkes radio telescope, Murriyang, we identified PSR J1032−5804 and measured a period of 78.7 ms, a dispersion measure of 819 ± 4 pc cm−3, a rotation measure of −2000 ± 1  rad m−2, and a characteristic age of 34.6 kyr. We found a pulse scattering timescale at 3 GHz of ∼22 ms, implying a timescale at 1 GHz of ∼3845 ms, which is the third most scattered pulsar known and explains its nondetection in previous pulsar surveys. We discuss the identification of a possible pulsar wind nebula and supernova remnant in the pulsar’s local environment by analyzing the pulsar spectral energy distribution and the surrounding extended emission from multiwavelength images. Our result highlights the possibility of identifying extremely scattered pulsars from radio continuum images. Ongoing and future large-scale radio continuum surveys will offer us an unprecedented opportunity to find more extreme pulsars (e.g., highly scattered, highly intermittent, and highly accelerated), which will enhance our understanding of the characteristics of pulsars and the interstellar medium.

The SN is situated 1.5–2 kpc from the host-galaxy nucleus and appears in three different locations as a result of gravitational lensing by G165. These data can yield a value for Hubble’s constant using time delays from this multiply imaged SN Ia that we call “SN H0pe.” Over the cluster, we identified 21 image multiplicities, confirmed five of them using the Near-Infrared Spectrograph, and constructed a new lens model that gives a total mass within 600 kpc of (2.6 ± 0.3) × 1014M⊙. The photometry uncovered a galaxy overdensity coincident with the SN host galaxy. NIRSpec confirmed six member galaxies, four of which surround the SN host galaxy with relative velocity ≲900 km s−1 and projected physical extent ≲33 kpc. This compact galaxy group is dominated by the SN host galaxy, which has a stellar mass of (5.0 ± 0.1) × 1011M⊙. The group members have specific star formation rates of 2–260 Gyr−1 derived from the Hα-line fluxes corrected for stellar absorption, dust extinction, and slit losses. Another group centered on a strongly lensed dusty star-forming galaxy is at z = 2.24. The total (unobscured and obscured) SFR of this second galaxy group is estimated to be (≳ 100 M⊙ yr−1), which translates to a supernova rate of ∼1 SNe yr−1, suggesting that regular monitoring of this cluster may yield additional SNe.

<br />
SLSNe的研究利用哈勃空间望远镜进行了UV成像，发现SLSNe的偏移距离大部分符合指数分布，但偏移较大的情况较为突出。SLSNe偏移距离显著大于长软伽马射线暴(LGRBs)，甚至大于Ib/c型和II型超新星。此外，约37%的SLSNe发生在宿主星系最暗淡的区域，这与LGRBs和Ib/c型以及II型超新星形成鲜明对比。研究还发现，SLSNe的位置与红移、爆发和磁星发动机参数没有显著关系，这表明它们的前体星可能遵循不同的演化路径。研究者推测，SLSNe可能源于被破碎的双星系统抛射出的高速大质量恒星。 <br /><br />总结: SLSNe的研究表明它们的位置分布与其他超新星和伽马射线暴存在显著差异，推测其前体星可能来自被破碎的双星系统抛射出的高速大质量恒星。 <div>
We present an extensive Hubble Space Telescope rest-frame UV imaging study of the locations of Type I superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) within their host galaxies. The sample includes 65 SLSNe with detected host galaxies in the redshift range z ≈ 0.05–2. Using precise astrometric matching with SN images, we determine the distributions of the physical and host-normalized offsets relative to the host centers, as well as the fractional flux distribution relative to the underlying UV light distributions. We find that the host-normalized offsets of SLSNe roughly track an exponential disk profile, but exhibit an overabundance of sources with large offsets of 1.5–4 times their hosts' half-light radii. The SLSNe normalized offsets are systematically larger than those of long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs), and even Type Ib/c and Type II SNe. Furthermore, we find from a Monte Carlo procedure that about {37}_{-8}^{+6} \% of SLSNe occur in the dimmest regions of their host galaxies, with a median fractional flux value of 0.16, in stark contrast to LGRBs and Type Ib/c and Type II SNe. We do not detect any significant trends in the locations of SLSNe as a function of redshift, or as a function of explosion and magnetar engine parameters inferred from modeling of their optical light curves. The significant difference in SLSN locations compared to LGRBs (and normal core-collapse SNe) suggests that at least some of their progenitors follow a different evolutionary path. We speculate that SLSNe arise from massive runaway stars from disrupted binary systems, with velocities of ∼102 km s−1.

<div> Wolf–Rayet star, spectroscopic binary, Chandra X-ray observations, colliding wind binaries, orbital period

总结:
θ Mus是一个引人注目的光谱双星系统，由碳型Wolf–Rayet恒星和OV伴星组成，在约19天的轨道上运转。它还包括一个O-超巨星，如果与双星系统有引力约束，将具有数十年的轨道周期。θ Mus的X射线亮度高，是一个非热无线电源，与大质量碰撞风双星常见的现象相符。新的Chandra X射线观测发现，θ Mus的X射线辐射包括一个冷却的几乎稳定的、受吸收影响较小的等离子体成分，其延伸范围远离双星系统。还存在由Fe xxv辐射示踪的较热等离子体。在≈2-5 keV范围内观察到的通量在≤5年的时间尺度内显着下降。这种通量下降可以归因于对较热等离子体的吸收增加，后者可能位于短周期双星系统的受限风相互作用区域内。θ Mus的X射线辐射与WC+O双星γ2 Vel的类似，包括碳复合谱线，但是这两个系统都显示出挑战CW模型的异常线中心性质。 <div>
θ Mus is a remarkable spectroscopic binary (SB) consisting of a carbon-type Wolf–Rayet star and OV companion (WC6+O6–7V) in a ≈19 days orbit. In addition an O-supergiant is visually detected at a small offset of 46 mas and if gravitationally bound to the SB system would have an orbital period of many decades. θ Mus is X-ray bright and a nonthermal radio source as commonly observed in massive colliding wind (CW) binaries. We present new Chandra X-ray observations of θ Mus, which complement previous XMM-Newton observations. The X-ray emission consists of a cool, nearly steady, weakly absorbed plasma component with broad redshifted emission lines located in an extended region far from the SB system. Hotter plasma is also present traced by Fe xxv emission. The observed flux in the ≈2–5 keV range dropped significantly on a timescale of ≤5 yr. The flux decrease can be attributed to an increase in absorption toward the hotter plasma which is likely located in the confined wind interaction region of the short-period SB system. The X-ray emission of θ Mus is remarkably similar to the WC+O binary γ2 Vel including carbon recombination spectral lines but both systems show unusual line centroid properties that challenge CW models.

<div> 关键词: 极低金属贫的星系, 星系形成和演化, 暗能量光谱仪, 氧丰度, 演化学化学星系<br />
总结: <br />
本文利用暗能量光谱仪(DES)的早期数据，从中获得了223个红移z<1的极低金属贫的星系(XMPGs)的大样本。利用直接Te方法测定氧丰度，发现其中95个星系为确认的XMPGs，其余128个为候选XMPGs。这些XMPGs占DES观测星系总数的0.01%。大部分XMPGs具有约1/34太阳金属丰度、约1.5 × 10^7太阳质量的恒星质量和0.22太阳质量每年的星形成率。这些XMPGs主要分布在相对低密度的环境中，许多星系的恒星质量-金属丰度关系(MZRs)低于普通星系。通过与理论模拟的比较，发现XMPGs是高红移星形成星系的良好类比体。由于DESI调查的持续进行，这些XMPG种群的性质将得到更完整的大样本的进一步调查。 <div>
Extremely metal-poor galaxies (XMPGs) at relatively low redshift are excellent laboratories for studying galaxy formation and evolution in the early universe. Much effort has been spent on identifying them from large-scale spectroscopic surveys or spectroscopic follow-up observations. Previous work has identified a few hundred XMPGs. In this work, we obtain a large sample of 223 XMPGs at z &lt; 1 from the early data of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). The oxygen abundance is determined using the direct Te method based on the detection of the [O iii]λ4363 line. The sample includes 95 confirmed XMPGs based on the oxygen abundance uncertainty; the remaining 128 galaxies are regarded as XMPG candidates. These XMPGs are only 0.01% of the total DESI observed galaxies. Their coordinates and other properties are provided in the paper. The most XMPGs have an oxygen abundance of ∼1/34 Z⊙, a stellar mass of about 1.5 × 107M⊙, and a star formation rate of 0.22 M⊙ yr−1. The two most XMPGs present distinct morphologies suggesting different formation mechanisms. The local environmental investigation shows that XMPGs preferentially reside in relatively low-density regions. Many of them fall below the stellar mass–metallicity relations (MZRs) of normal star-forming galaxies. From a comparison of the MZR with theoretical simulations, it appears that XMPGs are good analogs to high-redshift star-forming galaxies. The nature of these XMPG populations will be further investigated in detail with larger and more complete samples from the ongoing DESI survey.

总结：<br />
本研究识别出250个双峰发射源（DPEs），并提供了这些DPEs的宽Hα发射线区域的光谱建模以及适配的黑洞吸积盘属性目录。随后对12个DPEs进行了跟踪光谱观测，并发现约50%的DPEs在长达10-20年的时间尺度上显示出红峰和蓝峰相对强度的显著变化。光谱建模得出的黑洞吸积盘参数分析表明，DPEs并不处于特殊的吸积状态，而是在合适的条件下观察到的普通广谱线AGNs。研究还包括了可能的超大质量黑洞双星候选者SDSSJ1430+2303，并讨论了其与ZTF调查中的发射盘AGN种群的光度和光谱变化一致性。 <br /><br />总结: <div>
About 3%–10% of Type I active galactic nuclei (AGNs) have double-peaked broad Balmer lines in their optical spectra originating from the motion of gas in their accretion disk. Double-peaked profiles arise not only in AGNs, but occasionally appear during optical flares from tidal disruption events and changing-state AGNs. In this paper, we identify 250 double-peaked emitters (DPEs) among a parent sample of optically variable broad-line AGNs in the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey, corresponding to a DPE fraction of 19%. We model spectra of the broad Hα emission-line regions and provide a catalog of the fitted accretion disk properties for the 250 DPEs. Analysis of power spectra derived from the 5 yr ZTF light curves finds that DPE light curves have similar amplitudes and power-law indices to other broad-line AGNs. Follow-up spectroscopy of 12 DPEs reveals that ∼50% display significant changes in the relative strengths of their red and blue peaks over long 10–20 yr timescales, indicating that broad-line profile changes arising from spiral arm or hotspot rotation are common among optically variable DPEs. Analysis of the accretion disk parameters derived from spectroscopic modeling provides evidence that DPEs are not in a special accretion state, but are simply normal broad-line AGNs viewed under the right conditions for the accretion disk to be easily visible. We include inspiraling supermassive black hole binary candidate SDSSJ1430+2303 in our analysis, and discuss how its photometric and spectroscopic variability is consistent with the disk-emitting AGN population in the ZTF survey.

<div> Chandra X-ray Observatory, M33, X-ray variability, high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs), monitoring survey
<br /><br />总结: 本研究利用Chandra X射线天文台对邻近的螺旋星系M33进行了为期五个纪元的监测调查，主要探究了时间间隔在两周至四个月之间的X射线变化。研究表征了55个核外明亮点源的X射线变化，其中许多被认为是高质量X射线双星（HMXBs）。在先前的M33 X射线目录中检测到了八个新的候选暂现源，并讨论了它们可能的性质。最终目录中包括了文献中确定的26个已知的HMXB候选者。通过包括这些源的档案X射线观测，我们将X射线光变曲线的基线延长了到21年。我们将源的检测和非检测时期与一系列模拟源的工作循环进行比较，推断出大多数检测到的源的工作循环>30%。我们发现只有四个源的检测模式与具有<30%工作循环一致。这种高工作循环的源比例对于HMXB群体来说是意外的，因此更频繁的X射线监测可能会揭示出更多的低工作循环HMXBs。 <div>
We present a new five-epoch Chandra X-ray Observatory monitoring survey of the nearby spiral galaxy M33 which probes X-ray variability with time sampling between two weeks and four months. We characterize the X-ray variability of 55 bright point sources outside of the nucleus, many of which are expected to be high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs). We detect eight new candidate transients not detected in previous X-ray catalogs of M33 and discuss their possible nature. The final catalog includes 26 known HMXB candidates identified in the literature. We extend the baseline of the X-ray light curves up to 21 yr by including archival X-ray observations of these sources. We compare the detection and nondetection epochs of the sources to suites of simulated source duty cycles and infer that most of our detected sources have duty cycles &gt;30%. We find only four sources whose detection patterns are consistent with having duty cycles below 30%. This large fraction of sources with high duty cycles is unexpected for a population of HMXBs; thus more frequent X-ray monitoring will likely reveal many more low duty cycle HMXBs in M33.

总结:
太阳是明亮的伽马射线源，由于宇宙射线与太阳气体的有声子作用而产生。文章介绍了一个简化的太阳磁场模型，用于捕捉与伽马射线产生相关的主要要素。此模型改进了先前的模型，能够合理地产生在1-200 GeV范围内由Fermi大面积望远镜观测到的硬谱和由高海拔水切可夫观测站（HAWC）在约103 GeV附近观测到的明显较软的谱线。文章指出，低能（≤10 GeV）的伽马射线主要产生在网络元素中，而高能（≳几十GeV）的伽马射线主要产生在网状结构之间的片状结构中。特别地，HAWC观测到的谱线变软是由于有限大小的网状结构对捕获和反射∼104 GeV宇宙射线的效果有限。该研究对理解太阳大气中的宇宙射线传输至关重要，并将为我们提供有关光球小尺度磁场的见解。 <br /><br /> <div>
The Sun is a bright gamma-ray source due to hadronic cosmic-ray interactions with solar gas. While it is known that incoming cosmic rays must generally first be reflected by solar magnetic fields to produce outgoing gamma rays, theoretical models have yet to reproduce the observed spectra. We introduce a simplified model of the solar magnetic fields that captures the main elements relevant to gamma-ray production. These are a flux tube, representing the network elements, and a flux sheet, representing the intergranular sheets. Both the tube and sheet have a horizontal size of order 100 km and serve as sites where cosmic rays are reflected and gamma rays are produced. While our simplified double-structure model does not capture all the complexities of the solar-surface magnetic fields, such as Alfvén turbulence from wave interactions or magnetic fluctuations from convection motions, it improves on previous models by reasonably producing both the hard spectrum seen by Fermi Large Area Telescope at 1–200 GeV and the considerably softer spectrum seen by the High Altitude Water Cherenkov Observatory (HAWC) at near 103 GeV. We show that lower-energy (≲10 GeV) gamma rays are primarily produced in the network elements and higher-energy (≳few × 10 GeV) gamma rays in the intergranular sheets. Notably, the spectrum softening observed by HAWC results from the limited effectiveness of capturing and reflecting ∼104 GeV cosmic rays by the finite-sized intergranular sheets. Our study is important for understanding cosmic-ray transport in the solar atmosphere and will lead to insights into small-scale magnetic fields at the photosphere.

总结:<br />
GW170817观测到了第一个二进制中子星合并的光学对应体，并且开启了多信使天体物理的新时代。结合引力波数据和光学对应体的信息揭示了关于合并系统性质的丰富信息。目前仅有一次GW事件观测到了kilonova，限制了我们对其起源和传播的精确理解。本文使用了条件变分自动编码器(CVAE)对两种不同时间长度的kilonova模型进行训练，可以快速准确地生成kilonova光变曲线。实施这一技术可以提供快速和可靠的结果，为多信使天体物理研究提供了新的工具。 <div>
The discovery of the optical counterpart, along with the gravitational waves (GWs) from GW170817, of the first binary neutron star merger has opened up a new era for multimessenger astrophysics. Combining the GW data with the optical counterpart, also known as AT 2017gfo and classified as a kilonova, has revealed the nature of compact binary merging systems by extracting enriched information about the total binary mass, the mass ratio, the system geometry, and the equation of state. Even though the detection of kilonovae has brought about a revolution in the domain of multimessenger astronomy, there has been only one kilonova from a GW-detected binary neutron star merger event confirmed so far, and this limits the exact understanding of the origin and propagation of the kilonova. Here, we use a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) trained on light-curve data from two kilonova models having different temporal lengths, and consequently, generate kilonova light curves rapidly based on physical parameters of our choice with good accuracy. Once the CVAE is trained, the timescale for light-curve generation is of the order of a few milliseconds, which is a speedup of the generation of light curves by 1000 times as compared to the simulation. The mean squared error between the generated and original light curves is typically 0.015 with a maximum of 0.08 for each set of considered physical parameters, while having a maximum of ≈0.6 error across the whole parameter space. Hence, implementing this technique provides fast and reliably accurate results.

TRAPPIST-1e行星的大气离子化，中性和离子化学以及大气生物标志的影响是本研究的关键点。通过模拟六种不同情境，发现类似卡林顿事件会大幅增加大气离子化并引起离子化学和光谱传输特征的显著变化。氮 dioxide含量大幅增加，水带深度减小，甲烷带减少，臭氧减少。这显示了必须考虑高能粒子效应，才能正确识别臭氧和甲烷等生物标志信号。另外，发现硝酸在湿润和枯落大气中的特征是不同的。总结：TRAPPIST-1e大气在强烈的恒星能量粒子事件下会出现显著变化，需要考虑高能粒子的影响才能准确识别生物标志信号。 <div>
Ongoing observing projects like the James Webb Space Telescope and future missions offer the chance to characterize Earth-like exoplanetary atmospheres. Thereby, M dwarfs are preferred targets for transit observations, for example, due to their favorable planet–star contrast ratio. However, the radiation and particle environment of these cool stars could be far more extreme than what we know from the Sun. Thus, knowing the stellar radiation and particle environment and its possible influence on detectable biosignatures—in particular, signs of life like ozone and methane—is crucial to understanding upcoming transit spectra. In this study, with the help of our unique model suite INCREASE, we investigate the impact of a strong stellar energetic particle event on the atmospheric ionization, neutral and ion chemistry, and atmospheric biosignatures of TRAPPIST-1e. Therefore, transit spectra for six scenarios are simulated. We find that a Carrington-like event drastically increases atmospheric ionization and induces substantial changes in ion chemistry and spectral transmission features: all scenarios show high event-induced amounts of nitrogen dioxide (i.e., at 6.2 μm), a reduction of the atmospheric transit depth in all water bands (i.e., at 5.5–7.0 μm), a decrease of the methane bands (i.e., at 3.0–3.5 μm), and depletion of ozone (i.e., at ∼9.6 μm). Therefore, it is essential to include high-energy particle effects to correctly assign biosignature signals from, e.g., ozone and methane. We further show that the nitric acid feature at 11.0–12.0 μm, discussed as a proxy for stellar particle contamination, is absent in wet-dead atmospheres.

利用JWST-CEERS数据，对宇宙早期（0.5–3亿年）质量巨大星系（M* > 10^9.5M⊙）中星形成的抑制进行了分析。通过使用先进的统计方法，对多维和相互关联的参数空间进行准确限制，确定了星系停止形成恒星的内在依赖性。在两种最先进的宇宙学模拟（IllustrisTNG和EAGLE）中，确定了关键的可验证预测，预测星系的停止形成恒星应该由早期宇宙中的超大质量黑洞质量所调控。在光度观测中，星系的重力潜能（ϕ*）被发现是超大质量黑洞质量的最佳替代品。在JWST-CEERS中，星系的停星潜能在所有时期（z = 0–8）都是质量巨大星系停止形成恒星的最具预测性的参数。这些结果强烈暗示了一个稳定的停星机制在宇宙历史上一直在起作用，与星系的中心重力潜能密切相关。在宇宙模型中，这种联系通过超大质量黑洞在深潜势井中形成和增长，随后通过混合的主动星系核反馈对星系进行停星解释。

2. 通过统计方法确定了停星与相关参数的内在依赖性。
3. 两种宇宙学模拟都预测了停星应该由超大质量黑洞质量调控。

We present an analysis of the quenching of star formation in massive galaxies (M* &gt; 109.5M⊙) within the first 0.5–3 Gyr of the Universe’s history utilizing JWST-CEERS data. We utilize a combination of advanced statistical methods to accurately constrain the intrinsic dependence of quenching in a multidimensional and intercorrelated parameter space. Specifically, we apply random forest classification, area statistics, and a partial correlation analysis to the JWST-CEERS data. First, we identify the key testable predictions from two state-of-the-art cosmological simulations (IllustrisTNG and EAGLE). Both simulations predict that quenching should be regulated by supermassive black hole mass in the early Universe. Furthermore, both simulations identify the stellar potential (ϕ*) as the optimal proxy for black hole mass in photometric data. In photometric observations, where we have no direct constraints on black hole masses, we find that the stellar potential is the most predictive parameter of massive galaxy quenching at all epochs from z = 0–8, exactly as predicted by simulations for this sample. The stellar potential outperforms stellar mass, galaxy size, galaxy density, and Sérsic index as a predictor of quiescence at all epochs probed in JWST-CEERS. Collectively, these results strongly imply a stable quenching mechanism operating throughout cosmic history, which is closely connected to the central gravitational potential in galaxies. This connection is explained in cosmological models via massive black holes forming and growing in deep potential wells, and subsequently quenching galaxies through a mix of ejective and preventative active galactic nucleus feedback.

Fukui et al. quantified the hadronic and leptonic gamma-rays in the young TeV gamma-ray shell-type supernova remnant (SNR) RX J1713.7-3946 (RX J1713), and demonstrated that gamma rays are a combination of hadronic and leptonic gamma-ray components with a ratio of ∼6: 4 in gamma-ray counts Ng. This discovery, which adopted a new methodology of multi-linear gamma-ray decomposition, was the first quantification of the two gamma-ray components. In the present work, we applied the same methodology to another TeV gamma-ray shell-type SNR RX J0852.0-4622 (RXJ0852) in 3D space characterized by (the interstellar proton column density Np)-(the nonthermal X-ray count Nx)-[Ng], and quantified the hadronic and leptonic gamma-ray components as having a ratio of ∼5:5 in Ng. The present work adopted the fitting of two/three flat planes in 3D space instead of a single flat plane, which allowed suppression of the fitting errors. This quantification indicates that hadronic and leptonic gamma-rays are of the same order of magnitude in these two core-collapse SNRs, verifying the significant hadronic gamma-ray components. We argue that the target interstellar protons, in particular their spatial distribution, are essential in any attempts to identify the type of particles responsible for gamma-ray emission. The present results confirm that cosmic-ray (CR) energy ≲100 TeV is compatible with a scheme in which SNRs are the dominant source of these Galactic CRs.

<div> 非线性引力演化导致观测到的宇宙密度场中出现强烈的非线性，导致功率谱协方差中出现正的非对角相关性。这导致了功率谱中的信息饱和，例如，来自非线性功率谱的中微子质量约束比其线性对应物低约2倍，z = 0。本文探讨了非线性重构方法如何改善非线性宇宙场中的宇宙信息。通过将非线性重构应用于Quijote模拟中的冷暗物质场，我们发现，非线性重构可以显著改善宇宙参数的约束，几乎达到线性理论极限。对于中微子质量，结果仅比线性功率谱低12％，即理论最佳结果。这使非线性重构成为从当前和即将到来的星系调查中提取中微子信息的高效而有用的方法。<br /><br />总结:
1. 非线性引力演化导致宇宙密度场中出现强烈的非线性，功率谱协方差中出现正的非对角相关性。
2. 非线性重构方法可以改善非线性宇宙场中的宇宙信息。
3. 运用非线性重构到Quijote模拟的冷暗物质场，可显著改善宇宙参数的约束，几乎达到线性理论极限。

5. 非线性重构是一种高效且有用的方法，可从当前和即将到来的星系调查中提取中微子信息。 <div>
Nonlinear gravitational evolution induces strong nonlinearities in the observed cosmological density fields, leading to positive off-diagonal correlations in the power spectrum covariance. This has caused the information saturation in the power spectrum, e.g., the neutrino mass constraints from the nonlinear power spectra are lower than their linear counterparts by a factor of ∼2 at z = 0. In this paper, we explore how nonlinear reconstruction methods improve the cosmological information from nonlinear cosmic fields. By applying nonlinear reconstruction to cold dark matter fields from the Quijote simulations, we find that nonlinear reconstruction can improve the constraints on cosmological parameters significantly, nearly reaching the linear theory limit. For neutrino mass, the result is only 12% lower than the linear power spectrum, i.e., the theoretical best result. This makes nonlinear reconstruction an efficient and useful method to extract neutrino information from current and upcoming galaxy surveys.

总结: 
本文使用了一种新的技术来利用Wolf-Rayet星的恒星风产生的He iiλ1640和λ4686发射线来测量尘埃红移。研究发现，He ii线的红移倾向于更高，而UV连续谱的红移倾向于更低，需要更大的样本量来确认这一趋势。这可能表明一个年龄序列，探测到不同阶段的尘埃清除。此外，广泛的He ii线也已经在比我们的样本更遥远的星系中检测到，为估算距离约100 Mpc的最年轻恒星群的尘埃红移提供了机会。 He ii线比较容易测量，因此可能为测量星系属性提供了一种有效的途径。 <br /><br /> <div>
The ability to determine galaxy properties such as masses, ages, and star formation rates robustly is critically limited by the ability to measure dust attenuation accurately. Dust reddening is often characterized by comparing observations to models of either nebular recombination lines or the UV continuum. Here, we use a new technique to measure dust reddening by exploiting the He iiλ1640 and λ4686 emission lines originating from the stellar winds of Wolf–Rayet stars. The intrinsic line ratio is determined by atomic physics, enabling an estimate of the stellar reddening similar to how the Balmer lines probe gas-emission reddening. The He ii line ratio is measured from UV and optical spectroscopy using the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on board the Hubble Space Telescope for eight nearby galaxies hosting young massive star clusters. We compare our results to dust reddening values estimated from UV spectral slopes and from Balmer line ratios and find tentative evidence for systematic differences. The reddening derived from the He ii lines tends to be higher, whereas that from the UV continuum tends to be lower. A larger sample size is needed to confirm this trend. If confirmed, this may indicate an age sequence probing different stages of dust clearing. Broad He ii lines have also been detected in galaxies more distant than in our sample, providing the opportunity to estimate the dust reddening of the youngest stellar populations out to distances of ∼100 Mpc.

<div> 关键词: 核心坍缩超新星, 弱爆炸, 重力影响, 天体物理学, X射线暴

总结:
核心坍缩超新星的爆炸能量可能有所不同，当爆炸能量较低时，初始冲击波速度可能会减速至与母体速度接近。这会导致重力对爆炸流体动力学的影响，并可能导致冲击波在母体星内大半径处停滞。研究人员通过发展一种微扰方法来模拟这种弱爆炸的特殊属性，并得出结论，如果爆炸能量低于临界值，冲击波将在母体内停滞。该模型在与流体力学模拟结果的对比中表现出良好的一致性，准确预测了冲击波位置、速度以及停滞位置。这些结果对于黑洞形成和新发现的快速X射线暴（FXTs）具有重要影响。特别是，研究人员推测“幻影冲击波突破”——即星体外层冲破停滞冲击波——可以产生X射线爆发，但不会有随后的光学/紫外线迹象，类似于FXTs。该模型还预测了X射线爆发的上升时间td和平均光子能量kT之间存在反相关关系，大致为T∝{t}_{{\rm{d}}}^{-5/8}。 <div>
Observations and theory suggest that core-collapse supernovae can span a range of explosion energies, and when sub-energetic the shockwave initiating the explosion can decelerate to speeds comparable to the escape speed of the progenitor. In these cases, gravity will complicate the explosion hydrodynamics and conceivably cause the shock to stall at large radii within the progenitor star. To understand these unique properties of weak explosions, we develop a perturbative approach for modeling the propagation of an initially strong shock into a time-steady, infalling medium in the gravitational field of a compact object. This method writes the shock position and the post-shock velocity, density, and pressure as series solutions in the (time-dependent) ratio of the freefall speed to the shock speed, and predicts that the shock stalls within the progenitor if the explosion energy is below a critical value. We show that our model agrees very well with hydrodynamic simulations, and accurately predicts (for example) the time-dependent shock position and velocity and the radius at which the shock stalls. Our results have implications for black hole formation and the newly detected class of fast X-ray transients (FXTs). In particular, we propose that a “phantom shock breakout”—where the outer edge of the star falls through a stalled shock—can yield a burst of X-rays without a subsequent optical/UV signature, similar to FXTs. This model predicts the rise time of the X-ray burst, td, and the mean photon energy, kT, are anticorrelated, approximately as T\propto {t}_{{\rm{d}}}^{-5/8}.

We examine the evolution of ion-beam Weibel instability at strong collisionless shocks in weakly magnetized media. We find that a finite background magnetic field substantially affects both the linear and nonlinear phases of the instability, depending on whether the background electrons behave magnetized or not. Particle-in-cell simulations for magnetized electrons identify a dynamo-like mechanism of magnetic field amplification, which eventually leads to spontaneous magnetic reconnection. We conclude that this scenario is applicable to typical young supernova remnant shocks.

本文研究了帕克太阳探测器第四次相遇中的一次离子尺度波事件，其中包括左手偏振突然过渡为强烈的右手偏振，伴随着阿尔法粒子和质子速度分布函数中的明显核心束结构。线性稳定性分析表明，左手偏振波主要由质子核心种群中的质子回旋不稳定性驱动，并且右手偏振波主要由次要阿尔法束种群中的火管样不稳定性驱动。左手偏振到右手偏振的突然转变是由质子核心温度各向异性降低引起的。作者发现线性理论预测的不稳定波模式的频率和极化与磁场谱中观测到的非常吻合。这项工作深入了解了哪些确切的不稳定可能在内太阳系的波－粒子相互作用中起作用并调节能量转移，同时也强调了次要阿尔法种群可能作为一个很少考虑的自由能源的来源，可用于产生波动活动。 <div>
Ion-scale wave events or wave storms in the solar wind are characterized by enhancements in magnetic field fluctuations as well as coherent magnetic field polarization signatures at or around the local ion cyclotron frequencies. In this paper, we study in detail one such wave event from Parker Solar Probe's (PSP) fourth encounter, consisting of an initial period of left-handed (LH) polarization abruptly transitioning to a strong period of right-handed (RH) polarization, accompanied by a clear core beam structure in both the alpha and proton velocity distribution functions. A linear stability analysis shows that the LH-polarized waves are anti-sunward propagating Alfvén/ion cyclotron waves primarily driven by a proton cyclotron instability in the proton core population, and the RH polarized waves are anti-sunward propagating fast magnetosonic/whistler waves driven by a firehose-like instability in the secondary alpha beam population. The abrupt transition from LH to RH is caused by a drop in the proton core temperature anisotropy. We find very good agreement between the frequencies and polarizations of the unstable wave modes as predicted by linear theory and those observed in the magnetic field spectra. Given the ubiquity of ion-scale wave signatures observed by PSP, this work gives insight into which exact instabilities may be active and mediating energy transfer in wave–particle interactions in the inner heliosphere, as well as highlighting the role a secondary alpha population may play as a rarely considered source of free energy available for producing wave activity.

Cen A hosts the closest active galactic nucleus to the Milky Way, which makes it an ideal target for investigating the dynamical processes in the vicinity of accreting supermassive black holes. In this paper, we present 14 Chandra HETGS spectra of the nucleus of Cen A that were observed throughout 2022. We compared them with each other, and contrasted them against the two previous Chandra HETGS spectra from 2001. This enabled an investigation into the spectral changes occurring on timescales of months and 21 years. All Chandra spectra could be well fitted by an absorbed power law with a strong and narrow Fe Kα line, a leaked power-law feature at low energies, and Si and S Kα lines that could not be associated with the central engine. The flux of the continuum varied by a factor of 2.74 ± 0.05 over the course of the observations, whereas the Fe line only varied by 18.8% ± 8.8%. The photon index increased over 21 years, and the hydrogen column density varied significantly within a few months as well. The Fe Kα line was found at a lower energy than expected from the Cen A redshift, amounting to an excess velocity of {326}_{-94}^{+84}\,\mathrm{km}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1} relative to Cen A. We investigated warped accretion disks, bulk motion, and outflows as possible explanations of this shift. The spectra also featured ionized absorption lines from Fe xxv and Fe xxvi, describing a variable inflow.

Despite their shared origin, members of globular clusters display star-to-star variations in composition. The observed pattern of element abundances is unique to these stellar environments and cannot be fully explained by any proposed mechanism. It remains unclear whether stars form with chemical heterogeneity or inherit it from interactions with other members. These scenarios may be differentiated by the dependence of chemical spread on stellar mass; however, obtaining a sufficiently large mass baseline requires abundance measurements on the lower main sequence, which is too faint for spectroscopy even in the nearest globular clusters. We developed a stellar modeling method to obtain precise chemical abundances for stars near the end of the main sequence from multiband photometry, and we applied it to the globular cluster 47 Tucanae. The computational efficiency is attained by matching chemical elements to the model components that are most sensitive to their abundance. We determined [O/Fe] for ∼5000 members below the main-sequence knee at the level of accuracy, comparable to the spectroscopic measurements of evolved members in the literature. The inferred distribution disfavors stellar interactions as the origin of chemical spread; however, an accurate theory of accretion is required to draw a more definitive conclusion. We anticipate that future observations of 47 Tucanae with the James Webb Space Telescope will extend the mass baseline of our analysis into the substellar regime. Therefore, we present predicted color–magnitude diagrams and mass–magnitude relations for the brown dwarf members of 47 Tucanae.

The field of space science places significant emphasis on deep space exploration, with a particular focus on asteroids as a potential hazard to humanity. Inverting their physical characteristics from photometric observations is essential for uncovering their origins and evolution. This article attempts to present a solution to the challenging task of estimating the physical properties of binary asteroids, which are common in near-Earth asteroids larger than 200 meters. A novel model for binary asteroids is proposed, which integrates orbital and rotational motions to simulate brightness variations based on two Cellinoid shapes. The model combines the projection and occultation effects of the shapes to generate the simulated brightness. The inversion of determining physical properties is optimized based on the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm through a simulation process involving several parameter corrections. Finally, the performance of the proposed model is demonstrated through numerical experiments and applications to two real binary asteroids, namely, asteroid (317) Roxane and asteroid (624) Hektor. The derived results are nearly identical to those from other publications, which confirms that the proposed model provides reliable and accurate estimations of the physical properties of binary asteroids. Additionally, this method has a potential application in supporting the development of effective strategies for the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) project, the first planetary defense experiment in space undertaken by humans.

We present results from long-term monitoring of frequency-dependent eclipses of the radio emission from PSR J1544+4937, which is a black widow spider millisecond pulsar (MSP) in a compact binary system. The majority of such systems often exhibit relatively long-duration radio eclipses caused by ablated material from their companion stars. With the wide spectral bandwidth of the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope, we present the first systematic study of temporal variation of eclipse cutoff frequency. With decade-long monitoring of 39 eclipses for PSR J1544+4937, we notice significant changes in the observed cutoff frequency ranging from 343 ± 7 to ≥740 MHz. We also monitored changes in eclipse cutoff frequency on timescales of tens of days and observed a maximum change of ≥315 MHz between observations that were separated by 22 days. In addition, we observed a change of ∼47 MHz in eclipse cutoff frequency between adjacent orbits, i.e., on timescales of ∼2.9 hr. We infer that such changes in the eclipse cutoff frequency depict an eclipse environment for the PSR J1544+4937 system that is dynamically evolving, where, along with the change in electron density, the magnetic field could also be varying. We also report a significant correlation between the eclipse cutoff frequency and the mass-loss rate of the companion. This study provides the first direct evidence of mass-loss rate affecting the frequency-dependent eclipsing in a spider MSP.

本研究利用Leike等人的3D尘埃地图，结合其约1 pc空间分辨率，生成了太阳附近分子云的均匀目录。通过精确的距离测量，我们消除了质量、大小和密度方面的许多不确定性，对65个云的性质进行了真实的3D空间测量。目录中的云总共包含1.1×105太阳质量，跨越116-440 pc的距离范围，并包括文献中已广泛研究的十几个云。除了在3D体积密度空间推导云的性质外，我们还通过将3D云投影到2D“天空”视图上，创建了2D尘埃消光图。我们分别测量了2D云和3D云的性质。我们比较了遵循Larson定律的云的质量和大小之间的比例关系。我们发现我们的2D投影质量-大小关系M∝r2.1符合Larson的第三关系，但我们的3D推导性质导致了约一个数量级更大的比例关系：M∝r2.9。验证了理论和数值模拟的预测，我们的结果表明，质量-大小关系对于定义云的面密度或体积密度敏感，因为质量在2D中按照面积缩放（M∝r2），在3D中按照体积缩放（M∝r3）。我们的结果表明，分子云的表面密度和体积密度在2D和3D中大致保持恒定，这与在云的质量预算中占主导地位的低密度、较大体积充填气体对云的预期情况相符。 <br /><br />总结: 本研究利用Leike等人的3D尘埃地图，对太阳附近的分子云进行了全面的研究，得出了关于云的质量-大小关系的新发现，对分子云的性质提供了更精确的认识。 <div>
We dendrogram the Leike et al. 3D dust map, leveraging its ∼1 pc spatial resolution to produce a uniform catalog of molecular clouds in the solar neighborhood. Using accurate distances, we measure the properties of 65 clouds in true 3D space, eliminating much of the uncertainty in mass, size, and density. Clouds in the catalog contain a total of 1.1 × 105M☉, span distances of 116−440 pc, and include a dozen well-studied clouds in the literature. In addition to deriving cloud properties in 3D volume density space, we create 2D dust extinction maps from the 3D data by projecting the 3D clouds onto a 2D “Sky” view. We measure the properties of the 2D clouds separately from the 3D clouds. We compare the scaling relation between the masses and sizes of clouds following Larson. We find that our 2D projected mass–size relation, M ∝ r2.1, agrees with Larson's Third Relation, but our 3D derived properties lead to a scaling relation of about one order larger: M ∝ r2.9. Validating predictions from theory and numerical simulations, our results indicate that the mass–size relation is sensitive to whether column or volume density is used to define clouds, since mass scales with area in 2D (M ∝ r2) and with volume in 3D (M ∝ r3). Our results imply a roughly constant column and volume density in 2D and 3D, respectively, for molecular clouds, as would be expected for clouds where the lower density, larger volume-filling gas dominates the cloud mass budget.

We present a star formation rate function (SFRF) at z ∼ 6 based on star formation rates (SFRs) derived by spectral energy distribution fitting on data from rest-frame UV to optical wavelengths of galaxies in the CANDELS GOODS-South and North fields. The resulting SFRF shows an excess compared to the previous estimations by using rest-frame UV luminosity functions (LFs) corrected for the dust attenuation and is comparable to that estimated from a far-infrared LF. This suggests that the number density of dust-obscured intensively star-forming galaxies at z ∼ 6 has been underestimated in the previous approach based only on rest-frame UV observations. We parameterize the SFRF using the Schechter function and obtain the best-fit parameter of the characteristic SFR (SFR*) when the faint-end slope and characteristic number density are fixed. The best-fit SFR* at z ∼ 6 is comparable to that at z ∼ 2, when the cosmic star formation activity reaches its peak. Together with SFRF estimations with a similar approach using rest-frame UV to optical data, the SFR* is roughly constant from z ∼ 2 to ∼6 and may decrease above z ∼ 6. Since the SFR* is sensitive to the high-SFR end of the SFRF, this evolution of SFR* suggests that the high-SFR end of the SFRF grows rapidly during the epoch of reionization and reaches a similar level observed at z ∼ 2.

<div> Stochastic fluctuations, Intensities, Polarization, Modulation, Depolarization
总结:<br /><br />本文利用统计模型来研究正交偏振模式强度的随机波动对脉冲星的无线电发射调制和去极化的影响。推导了Stokes参数、线性偏振、偏振位置角和分数偏振的分布表达式，当模式强度遵循相同或不同的概率分布时。研究了模式之间的过渡情况。当模式强度遵循相同的分布时，分数线偏振和调制指数在过渡点上是对称的。当模式强度遵循不同的分布时，对称性被破坏。在模式强度分布相同且调制指数较小时，分数线偏振是最小的，并且模式出现的频率在过渡点上迅速改变。还量化了在给定调制指数条件下通过模式的同时出现所能达到的最低分数线偏振的下限。 <div>
A statistical model is used to determine how stochastic fluctuations in the intensities of orthogonal polarization modes contribute to the modulation and depolarization of pulsar radio emission. General expressions for the distributions of the Stokes parameters, linear polarization, polarization position angle, and fractional polarization are derived when the mode intensities follow the same or different probability distributions. The transition between modes is examined. When the mode intensities follow the same distribution, the fractional linear polarization and modulation index are symmetric about the transition. The symmetry is disrupted when the mode intensities follow different distributions. The fractional linear polarization is minimum and the mode frequency of occurrence changes rapidly at transitions where the mode intensity distributions are the same and the modulation index is small. A lower limit on the fractional linear polarization that can be attained via the simultaneous occurrence of the modes as a function of modulation index is quantified.

这篇文章讨论了恒星质量黑洞与恒星之间的接近相遇事件，通过使用平滑粒子流体力学代码PHANTOM进行了水动力学模拟。研究发现，在某些情况下，恒星的质量会慢慢被黑洞剥离，这被称为“渐进潮汐瓦解事件”。同时，研究还发现了一种新型的快速明亮的瞬变事件，即低偏心率微潮汐瓦解事件，与典型的偏心率微潮汐瓦解事件有明显不同的引力加速率和轨道演变。总结：<br /><br /> <div>
Close encounters between stellar-mass black holes (BHs) and stars occur frequently in dense star clusters and in the disks of active galactic nuclei. Recent studies have shown that in highly eccentric close encounters, the star can be tidally disrupted by the BH in a microtidal disruption event (microTDE), resulting in rapid mass accretion and possibly bright electromagnetic signatures. Here we consider a scenario in which the star might approach the stellar-mass BH in a gradual, nearly circular inspiral, under the influence of dynamical friction in a circum-binary gas disk or three-body interactions in a star cluster. We perform hydrodynamics simulations of this scenario using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code PHANTOM. We find that under certain circumstances (for initial eccentricity e0 ≳ 0.4 and penetration factor β = 1, or e0 &lt; 0.4 and β ≲ 0.67), the mass of the star is slowly stripped away by the BH. We call this gradual tidal disruption a “tidal-peeling event.” Additionally, we discover that some low-eccentricity microTDEs (e0 &lt; 0.4 and β = 1) are a new form of fast luminous transients similar to parabolic microTDEs. Depending on the initial distance and eccentricity of the encounter, these low-eccentricity microTDEs might exhibit significant accretion rates and orbital evolution distinct from those of a typical (eccentric) microTDE.

这项研究分析了太阳活动区产生日冕质量抛射（CME）的能力与光球直接电流与返程电流的比值∣DC/RC∣的关系。研究发现，具有∣DC/RC∣> 1.63和PIL剪切角> 45°（平均值分别为3.2°和68°）的喷发性耀斑源区往往具有更高的CME产生潜力，而对于困禁性耀斑源区，这两个量的平均值要小一些（分别为2.2°和68°），但存在重叠区域。此外，研究还发现一些特定的困禁性耀斑源区具有∣DC/RC∣接近于1的情况，PIL剪切角很低，且没有明显的EDC签名，因此不太可能产生CME。研究结论指出，∣DC/RC∣和PIL剪切角在评估CME产生潜力方面具有几乎相同的效果，比文献中提出的其他代理变量更有效。此外，研究还讨论了对∣DC/RC∣计算和结果解释进行细致考量的特定案例，并提出可以通过纳入日冕测量指标如衰减指数来改进光球CME产生潜力的代理变量。 <br /><br />总结: 这项研究分析了光球直接电流与返程电流比值（∣DC/RC∣）以及PIL剪切角与太阳活动区产生日冕质量抛射（CME）的关系，揭示了它们在评估CME产生潜力方面的重要性，以及如何进一步改进这些代理变量的方法。 <div>
It has been suggested that the ratio of photospheric direct to return current, ∣DC/RC∣, may be a better proxy for assessing the ability of solar active regions to produce a coronal mass ejection (CME) than others such as the amount of shear along the polarity inversion line (PIL). To test this conjecture, we measure both quantities prior to eruptive and confined flares of varying magnitude. We find that eruptive-flare source regions have ∣DC/RC∣ &gt; 1.63 and PIL shear above 45° (average values of 3.°2 and 68°, respectively), tending to be larger for stronger events, while both quantities are on average smaller for confined-flare source regions (2.°2 and 68°, respectively), albeit with substantial overlap. Many source regions, especially those of eruptive X-class flares, exhibit elongated direct currents (EDCs) bracketing the eruptive PIL segment, which typically coincide with areas of continuous PIL shear above 45°. However, a small subset of confined-flare source regions have ∣DC/RC∣ close to unity, very low PIL shear (&lt;38°), and no clear EDC signatures, rendering such regions less likely to produce a CME. A simple quantitative analysis reveals that ∣DC/RC∣ and PIL shear are almost equally good proxies for assessing CME-productivity, comparable to other proxies suggested in the literature. We also show that an inadequate selection of the current-integration area typically yields a substantial underestimation of ∣DC/RC∣, discuss specific cases that require careful consideration for ∣DC/RC∣ calculation and interpretation of the results, and suggest improving photospheric CME-productivity proxies by incorporating coronal measures such as the decay index.

Intrigued by recent high-energy study results for nearby galaxies with γ-ray emission and in particular NGC 1068 that has been detected as a neutrino-emitting source by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, we conduct a detailed analysis of the γ-ray data of the galaxies NGC 1068 and NGC 253, obtained with the Large Area Telescope on board the Fermi γ-ray Space Telescope. By checking their possible spectral features and then constructing light curves in the corresponding energy ranges, we identify spectral-change activity from NGC 1068 in the ≥2 GeV energy range and long-term, statistically significant changes for NGC 253 in the ≥5 GeV energy range. In the former, the emission appears harder in two half-year periods than in the otherwise “quiescent” state. In the latter, an ∼two-fold decrease in the detection significance after MJD = 57023 is clearly revealed by the test-statistic maps we obtain. Considering the previous studies carried out and the various models proposed for the γ-ray emissions of the two sources, we discuss the implications of our findings. We suspect that a jet (or outflow) in NGC 1068 might contribute to the γ-ray emission. The nature of the long-term statistically significant changes for NGC 253 is not clear, but since the part of the GeV emission may be connected to the very-high-energy (VHE) emission from the center of the galaxy, it could be further probed with VHE observations.

<div> 关键词: 金属丰富，旋转双重不稳定超新星，质量范围，56Ni质量，质量损失历史

这篇论文重新探讨了与小麦哲伦星云、大麦哲伦星云（LMC）、和0.1太阳金属丰度一致的金属丰富旋转双重不稳定超新星（PISNe）模型。通过计算多个模型，我们打算澄清PISNe的质量范围和喷射出的56Ni质量，以及母体的质量损失历史。我们发现选择Wolf-Rayet（WR）质量损失率是很重要的，我们采用了最近提出的Sander & Vink的速率，它覆盖了PISNe前体的质量范围。我们发现慢速旋转降低了PISN范围，因为旋转混合导致了核心质量的增加。另一方面，当我们假设观测到的OB星的典型旋转速度时，质量损失增加变得更加显著，最终恒星的质量低于非旋转模型。因此，对于这些快速旋转模型，亮度超新星（SN）的典型质量范围，其56Ni质量高于10M⊙，分别为LMC和0.1Z⊙金属丰度，超过400和350M⊙。有趣的是，与以往的研究不同，我们发现大多数情况下是富氧的母体。这种富氧的母体可能与最近确定的PISN候选SN2018ibb一致。He-丰富的母体仅在相对暗淡和金属贫（Z ≲ 0.1Z⊙）的PISNe中出现。我们还讨论了金属丰富PISNe的黑洞质量间隙，并展示了间隙的上限低于III类群体的情况。

<br /><br />总结: 本研究重新探讨了金属丰富旋转双重不稳定超新星（PISNe）模型，以及与小麦哲伦星云、大麦哲伦星云（LMC）、和0.1太阳金属丰度一致的质量范围和地方。特别地，与之前研究不同的是发现了富氧的母体，这一发现与最近确定的PISN候选SN2018ibb相符。同时还讨论了金属丰富PISNe的黑洞质量间隙。 <div>
In this paper, we revisit metal-enriched rotating pair-instability supernovae (PISNe) models for metallicities consistent with the Small Magellanic Cloud, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and 0.1Z⊙. By calculating multiple models, we intend to clarify mass ranges and the ejected 56Ni masses from the PISNe, and mass-loss histories for progenitors. We find that the choice of the Wolf–Rayet (WR) mass-loss rates is important, and we adopt the recently proposed rate of Sander &amp; Vink, which covers the mass ranges for PISNe progenitors. We show that slow rotation lowers the PISN range because the core mass increases by rotational mixing. On the other hand, when we assume a typical rotation speed for observed OB stars, the mass-loss increase becomes more significant, and the final stellar masses are lower than in nonrotating models. As a result, the typical mass range for bright supernovae (SNe), with a 56Ni mass higher than 10M⊙ for these fast-rotating models is more than 400 and 350M⊙ for LMC and 0.1Z⊙ metallicities, respectively. It is interesting that unlike in previous works, we find oxygen-rich progenitors for most cases. This O-rich progenitor may be consistent with the recently identified PISN candidate SN2018ibb. He-rich progenitors are seen only for relatively dim and metal-poor (Z ≲ 0.1Z⊙) PISNe. We also discuss the black hole mass gap for metal-enriched PISNe, and we show that the upper bound for the gap is lower than in the Population III case.

总结: 
这篇文章使用零β假设进行数据约束模拟，研究了2012年5月5日太阳活动区11474中一个丝状物的强烈旋转和失败喷发的机制。他们发现两个磁流体扭曲构造在系统中，并且提出了一个可能的逆向旋转的猜测。模拟结果与观测特征吻合，包括约130°的丝状物大角度旋转、受限的喷发和耀斑丝状物振子。他们还发现了与观测中的丝状物和热通道对应的两个磁流体扭曲构造，它们在模拟中都经历了受限的喷发。他们指出MFR1的旋转与轴向的剪切场分量有关，并且MFR1的扭结和螺旋度的时间演化是可能逆转旋转的线索。相互作用也对大角度旋转和喷发失败起到了作用。 <div>
We perform a data-constrained simulation with the zero-β assumption to study the mechanisms of strong rotation and failed eruption of a filament in active region 11474 on 2012 May 5 observed by Solar Dynamics Observatory and Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory. The initial magnetic field is provided by nonlinear force-free field extrapolation, which is reconstructed by the regularized Biot–Savart laws and magnetofrictional method. Our simulation reproduces most observational features very well, e.g., the filament large-angle rotation of about 130°, the confined eruption, and the flare ribbons, allowing us to analyze the underlying physical processes behind observations. We discover two flux ropes in the sigmoid system, an upper flux rope (MFR1) and a lower flux rope (MFR2), which correspond to the filament and hot channel in observations, respectively. Both flux ropes undergo confined eruptions. MFR2 grows by tether-cutting reconnection during the eruption. The rotation of MFR1 is related to the shear-field component along the axis. The toroidal field tension force and the nonaxisymmetry forces confine the eruption of MFR1. We also suggest that the mutual interaction between MFR1 and MFR2 contributes to the large-angle rotation and the eruption failure. In addition, we calculate the temporal evolution of the twist and writhe of MFR1, which is a hint of probable reversal rotation.

<title>On the Role of Alfvénic Fluctuations as Mediators of Coherence within Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections: Investigation of Multi-spacecraft Measurements at 1 au</title>

<div> 关键词: ICMEs, Alfvénic fluctuations, coherence, magnetic field correlation, solar wind<br />
总结:<br />
本研究探讨了Alfvénic fluctuations（AFs）在行星际日冕物质抛射（ICMEs）的一致性中的作用。研究发现，大约65%的ICME鞘和90%的磁场喷发物（MEs）展现出延伸的AFs。交叉螺旋度表明太阳风和行星际来源的AFs可能在1天文单位处的ICME中共存。AFs主要集中在激波的下游和MEs的背部。磁场在ICME鞘内的相关性较差，而在MEs的前后，大多数磁场分量的相关性也减弱。AFs也与较低的磁场相关性相关联。这表明ICME的一致性可能不是通过Alfvén波来介导，这意味着一致性尺度可能比先前预测的更小，或者磁场相关性并不是一致性的衡量标准。 <div>
Interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) are defined as “coherent” if they are capable of responding to external perturbations in a collective manner. This implies that information must be able to propagate across ICME structures, and if this is not the case, single-point in situ measurements cannot be considered as indicative of global ICME properties. Here, we investigate the role of Alfvénic fluctuations (AFs) as mediators of ICME coherence. We consider multipoint magnetic field and plasma measurements of 10 ICMEs observed by the ACE and Wind spacecraft at 1 au at longitudinal separations of 0.5°–0.7°. For each event, we analyze the Alfvénicity in terms of the residual energy and cross helicity of fluctuations, and the coherence in terms of the magnetic correlation between Wind and ACE. We find that ∼65% and 90% of ICME sheaths and magnetic ejecta (MEs), respectively, present extended AFs covering at least 20% of the structure. Cross helicity suggests AFs of solar and interplanetary origin may coexist in the ICME population at 1 au. AFs are mainly concentrated downstream of shocks and in the back of MEs. The magnetic field is poorly correlated within sheaths, while the correlation decreases from the front to the back of the MEs for most magnetic field components. AFs are also associated with lower magnetic field correlations. This suggests either that ICME coherence is not mediated by Alfvén waves, implying that the coherence scale may be smaller than previously predicted, or that the magnetic field correlation is not a measure of coherence.

Ultralight scalar fields and their noninteracting class, i.e., the so-called fuzzy dark matter (FDM), are dark matter candidates introduced to solve the small-scale problems of the standard cold dark matter. In this paper, we investigate whether the physics of FDM, particularly the quantum pressure that leads to the suppression of structure formation on small scales, could leave significant imprints on the large-scale statistics of matter fluctuations. For this purpose, we utilize the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structures (EFT of LSS), wherein small-scale physics is integrated and represented on large scales by only a set of free parameters. These parameters can be determined by fitting them into the cosmological simulations. By fitting the EFT predictions to the simulation data, we determine the value of the speed of sound as a quantitative measure of how UV physics affects large-scale perturbation. We use the Gadget-2 code to study the evolution of 5123 particles in a box with a side length 250 h−1 Mpc. We exploit the suppressed FDM initial power for the FDM universe and perform N-body simulation sufficient to produce accurate—enough for our purpose—results on large scales. In particular, we perform three FDM simulations with different masses and compare their sound speed with the standard cold dark matter (CDM) simulation. We found no difference between the FDM and CDM sound speeds beyond the confidence intervals. However, a consistently increasing trend can be seen in the sound speed for lower masses. This result suggests further investigations using higher-resolution simulations.

We present a comprehensive study of the kinematic properties of the different Galactic disk populations, as defined by the chemical abundance ratios and stellar ages, across a large disk volume (4.5 ≤ R ≤ 15.0 kpc and ∣Z∣ ≤ 3.0 kpc), by using the LAMOST-Gaia red clump sample stars. We determine the median velocities for various spatial and population bins, finding large-scale bulk motions; for example, the wave-like behavior in radial velocity, the north–south discrepancy in azimuthal velocity and the warp signal in vertical velocity, and the amplitudes and spatial dependences of these bulk motions show significant variations for different mono-age and mono-abundance populations. The global spatial behaviors of the velocity dispersions clearly show a signal of spiral arms and a signal of the disk perturbation event within 4 Gyr, as well as disk flaring in the outer region (i.e., R ≥ 12 kpc), mostly for young or alpha-poor stellar populations. Our detailed measurements of age/[α/Fe]-velocity dispersion relations for different disk volumes indicate that young/α-poor populations are likely to originate from dynamic heating by both giant molecular clouds and spiral arms, while old/α-enhanced populations require an obvious contribution from other heating mechanisms, such as merger and accretion, or are born in the chaotic mergers of gas-rich systems and/or turbulent interstellar medium.

<div> 磁通绳, 数值模拟, 太阳喷发, 地磁风暴, 数据驱动建模

总结:<br /><br />本文研究了磁通绳的数值模拟，通过结合时间依赖磁摩擦方法和热力学磁流体动力学模型，成功地再现了观测到的磁通绳的形成和受限喷发，并揭示了观测背后的物理细节。对于活跃区的长期演化过程，模拟结果表明，由于碰撞剪切引起的磁通绳的形成起着至关重要的作用，导致磁自由能和螺旋度显著增加。在喷发阶段，磁通绳在喷发过程中的变形会导致向下张力的增加，从而抑制其进一步上升。这一发现可能揭示了为什么一些环状不稳定的磁通绳在大角度旋转后会导致失败的喷发。此外，我们发现扭曲的磁通在受限喷发期间会积累，这可能导致随后的喷发耀斑的产生。 <div>
Magnetic flux ropes are a bundle of twisted magnetic field lines produced by internal electric currents, which are responsible for solar eruptions and are the major drivers of geomagnetic storms. As such, it is crucial to develop a numerical model that can capture the entire evolution of a flux rope, from its birth to death, in order to predict whether adverse space weather events might occur or not. In this paper, we develop a data-driven modeling that combines a time-dependent magnetofrictional approach with a thermodynamic magnetohydrodynamic model. Our numerical modeling successfully reproduces the formation and confined eruption of an observed flux rope, and unveils the physical details behind the observations. Regarding the long-term evolution of the active region, our simulation results indicate that the flux cancellation due to collisional shearing plays a critical role in the formation of the flux rope, corresponding to a substantial increase in magnetic free energy and helicity. Regarding the eruption stage, the deformation of the flux rope during its eruption can cause an increase in the downward tension force, which suppresses it from further rising. This finding may shed light on why some torus-unstable flux ropes lead to failed eruptions after large-angle rotations. Moreover, we find that twisted fluxes can accumulate during confined eruptions, which would breed the subsequent eruptive flares.

总结:
本文使用时间域模拟木星观测来测试和开发Simons Observatory Small Aperture Telescopes的光束重建管道。该方法依赖于一个地图制作程序，用于估计和减去相关的大气噪声，以及一个旨在补偿地图制作程序引起的偏差的光束拟合代码。我们针对四个不同频段的重建性能进行了测试，测试了各种算法参数、大气条件和输入光束。我们还展示了重建质量与可用观测次数的关系，并研究了不同的校准策略如何影响光束不确定性。对于所有考虑的情况，我们发现在多极范围ℓ = 30-700时，拟合结果与输入光束模型之间存在∼1.5%的误差，并在多极范围ℓ = 50-200时存在∼0.5%的误差。最后，我们使用谐波域分量分离算法来验证我们分析中观察到的光束重建误差和偏差对Simons Observatory r测量的影响不大。 <br /><br /> <div>
We use time-domain simulations of Jupiter observations to test and develop a beam reconstruction pipeline for the Simons Observatory Small Aperture Telescopes. The method relies on a mapmaker that estimates and subtracts correlated atmospheric noise and a beam fitting code designed to compensate for the bias caused by the mapmaker. We test our reconstruction performance for four different frequency bands against various algorithmic parameters, atmospheric conditions, and input beams. We additionally show the reconstruction quality as a function of the number of available observations and investigate how different calibration strategies affect the beam uncertainty. For all of the cases considered, we find good agreement between the fitted results and the input beam model within an ∼1.5% error for a multipole range ℓ = 30–700 and an ∼0.5% error for a multipole range ℓ = 50–200. We conclude by using a harmonic-domain component separation algorithm to verify that the beam reconstruction errors and biases observed in our analysis do not significantly bias the Simons Observatory r-measurement

这篇文章讨论了两种模型对伽马射线暴的描述，发现基于多色黑体函数和多色黑体函数加非热成分的模型具有类似的定性结论。然而，多色黑体函数模型可能提供了更合理的物理解释，暗示了伽马射线暴的射流结构和几何展宽对观测光谱的影响。然而，这些方法可能对于纯热火球和轻微磁化混合射流的区分不够敏感，需要其他信息来提供更多证据。因此，建议对GRB 221022B的光球辐射来自热射流，其中解离由于随时间增加的洛伦兹因子引起的内部冲击机制造成，这使得其快速辐射显示了典型的热到非热的演化。 <br /><br />总结: 本研究比较了两种对伽马射线暴的描述模型，发现多色黑体函数模型可能提供了更合理的物理解释。然而，对于射流性质的确定，可能需要其他信息来提供更多证据。 <div>
Some quasi-thermal (QT)-dominated gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) could be well described by a multicolor blackbody (mBB) function or a combined model of a BB plus a nonthermal (NT) component. In this analysis, two QT radiation-dominated bursts with known emission properties (GRB 210610B, likely from a hybrid jet, and GRB 210121A, with a spectrum consistent with nondissipative photospheric emission from a pure hot fireball) are used to make a comparison between these two models. To diagnose the magnetization properties of the central engine, the “top-down” approach proposed by Gao and Zhang is adopted. It is found that diagnoses based on these two models provide similar conclusions qualitatively; however, the model with mBB (or mBB+NT) may give more reasonable physical explanations. This implies that impacts from the GRB jet structure and geometrical broadening on the observed spectrum should be considered. However, conservatively, these methods may be not sensitive enough to distinguish between a pure hot fireball and a mildly magnetized hybrid jet. Some other information is necessary to provide more evidence when determining the jet properties for similar GRBs. Based on these considerations, we suggest that the photospheric emission of GRB 221022B is from a hot jet, where dissipation is caused by an internal shock mechanism due to the increasing Lorentz factor with time, which makes its prompt emission display typical evolution from thermal to NT.

<div> Parker Solar Probe, observation, solar radio burst, weak, kinetic scale
总结:<br /><br />本研究报告了Parker Solar Probe（PSP）在第二次接触阶段通过低密度磁通道时检测到的一种弱太阳射电爆发（SRB）。这些弱SRB具有较低的起始频率（约20 MHz）和窄的频率范围（从几十MHz到几百kHz）。它们的动态谱显示出一个明显的演化特征，即中间相对漂移速率从0.01 s-1以上迅速下降至0.01 s-1以下。基于太阳冕等离子体的常见经验模型分析表明，这些弱SRB源自于约1.1-6.1个太阳半径的太阳风加速区，其等离子体的β值较低，其源的运动速度typical是∼vA（Alfvén速度），明显低于有效激发SRB所需的快电子的运动速度。我们提出，孤立的动力阿尔文波可能负责产生这些小尺度的弱SRB，称为孤立波辐射。 <div>
The Parker Solar Probe (PSP) provides us with an unprecedentedly close approach to the observation of the Sun and hence the possibility of directly understanding the elementary process that occurs on the kinetic scale of particles' collective interaction in solar coronal plasmas. We report a type of weak solar radio burst (SRB) that was detected by PSP when it passed a low-density magnetic channel during its second encounter phase. These weak SRBs have a low starting frequency of ∼20 MHz and a narrow frequency range from a few tens of MHz to a few hundred kHz. Their dynamic spectra display a strongly evolving feature of the intermediate relative drift rate decreasing rapidly from above 0.01 s−1 to below 0.01 s−1. Analyses based on common empirical models of solar coronal plasmas indicate that these weak SRBs originate from a heliocentric distance of ∼1.1–6.1 RS (the solar radius), a typical solar wind acceleration region with a low-β plasma, and that their sources have a typical motion velocity of ∼vA (Alfvén velocity) obviously lower than that of the fast electrons required to effectively excite SRBs. We propose that solitary kinetic Alfvén waves with kinetic scales could be responsible for the generation of these small-scale weak SRBs, called solitary wave radiation.

总结: 通过对16个cool core星系团和星系团组成的样本进行研究，发现30%–38%的星系团/组中存在着超过45°的错位现象。研究排除了投影效应和环境扰动对错位的主要影响，发现了更倾向于较大错位（约90°）而非较小错位（45° ≤ ΔΨ ≤ 70°）的趋势，并且发现了喷流方向改变可能发生在1到几十兆年的时间尺度内。研究得出结论，错位更有可能与喷流轴的实际重新定位有关，讨论了几种可能导致这些显著变化的引擎机制。 <br /><br />总结: <div>
Recent observations of galaxy clusters and groups with misalignments between their central active galactic nucleus jets and X-ray cavities, or with multiple misaligned cavities, have raised concerns about the jet–bubble connection in cooling cores, and the processes responsible for jet realignment. To investigate the frequency and causes of such misalignments, we construct a sample of 16 cool core galaxy clusters and groups. Using Very Long Baseline Array radio data, we measure the parsec-scale position angle of the jets, and compare it with the position angle of the X-ray cavities detected in Chandra data. Using the overall sample and selected subsets, we consistently find that there is a 30%–38% chance to find a misalignment larger than ΔΨ = 45° when observing a cluster/group with a detected jet and at least one cavity. We determine that projection may account for an apparently large ΔΨ only in a fraction of objects (∼35%), and given that gas dynamical disturbances (such as sloshing) are found in both aligned and misaligned systems, we exclude environmental perturbation as the main driver of cavity–jet misalignment. Moreover, we find that large misalignments (up to ∼90°) are favored over smaller ones (45° ≤ ΔΨ ≤ 70°), and that the change in jet direction can occur on timescales between one and a few tens of Myr. We conclude that misalignments are more likely related to actual reorientation of the jet axis, and we discuss several engine-based mechanisms that may cause these dramatic changes.

We present radio and X-ray studies of A3444 and MS1455.0+2232, two galaxy clusters with radio minihalos in their cool cores. A3444 is imaged using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) at 333, 607, and 1300 MHz and the Very Large Array at 1435 MHz. Most of the minihalo is contained within r &lt; 120 kpc, but a fainter extension, stretching out to 380 kpc southwest of the center, is detected at 607 MHz. Using Chandra, we detect four X-ray sloshing cold fronts: three in the cool core at r = 60, 120, and 230 kpc, and a fourth one at r = 400 kpc—in the region of the southwestern radio extension—suggesting that the intracluster medium (ICM) is sloshing on a cluster-wide scale. The radio emission is contained within the envelope defined by these fronts. We also analyzed archival 383 MHz GMRT and Chandra observations of MS 1455.0+2232, which exhibits a known minihalo with its bright part delineated by cold fronts inside the cool core, but with a faint extension beyond the core. Similarly to A3444, we find a cold front at r ∼ 425 kpc, containing the radio emission. Thus the entire diffuse radio emission seen in these clusters appears to be related to large-scale sloshing of the ICM. The radio spectrum of the A3444 minihalo is a power law with a steep index α = 1.0 ± 0.1. The spectrum steepens with increasing distance from the center, as expected if the minihalo originates from reacceleration of relativistic particles by the sloshing-induced turbulence in the ICM.

The J-region Asymptotic Giant Branch (JAGB) method is a standard candle that leverages the constant luminosities of color-selected, carbon-rich AGB stars, measured in the near-infrared at 1.2 μm. The Chicago-Carnegie Hubble Program has obtained JWST imaging of the SN Ia host galaxies NGC 7250, NGC 4536, and NGC 3972. With these observations, the JAGB method can be studied for the first time using JWST. Lee et al. demonstrated the JAGB magnitude is optimally measured in the outer disks of galaxies, because in the inner regions the JAGB magnitude can vary significantly due to a confluence of reddening, blending, and crowding effects. However, determining where the “outer disk” lies can be subjective. Therefore, we introduce a novel method for systematically selecting the outer disk. In a given galaxy, the JAGB magnitude is first separately measured in concentric regions, and the “outer disk” is then defined as the first radial bin where the JAGB magnitude stabilizes to a few hundredths of a magnitude. After successfully employing this method in our JWST galaxy sample, we find the JAGB stars are well segregated from other stellar populations in color–magnitude space, and have observed dispersions about their individual F115W modes of σN7250 = 0.32 mag, σN4536 = 0.34 mag, and σN3972 = 0.35 mag. These measured dispersions are similar to the scatter measured for the JAGB stars in the LMC using 2MASS data (σ = 0.33 mag). In conclusion, the JAGB stars as observed with JWST clearly demonstrate their considerable power both as high-precision extragalactic distance indicators and as SN Ia supernova calibrators.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The presence of supermassive black holes with M ∼ 109M⊙ hosted by the luminous quasars at cosmological redshift z ≥ 6 is still an open problem in astrophysical cosmology. Here we study the formation of massive black holes at high redshift (z ≫ 7) through Hoyle–Lyttleton–Bondi accretion of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) onto a 20 M⊙ seed black hole moving with a velocity ∼100 km s−1 inside the short, mean-free path region of an SIDM halo. We consider observational constraints on a specific SIDM cross section, σ/mdm = (0.1–5) cm2 g−1. Formation timescale of massive black holes with M = (103–108) M⊙ is calculated for the universal Navarro–Frenk–White (NFW) profile, singular isothermal sphere (SIS), other power-law profiles with a cusp index 2.19 ≤ γ ≤ 2.5 of accreted dark matter, and modified-core isothermal profiles. The ambient sound speed is taken as Cs = (10–100) km s−1. It is found that an NFW profile with halo concentration C = 4.75–32.58 estimated at z = 20 and 30 for halo masses M200 = (1012–1014) M⊙ favors formation of massive black holes with M = (103–108) M⊙ at high redshift, well before quasar epoch. In this profile, these black holes grow within timescales (0.1–69) Myr at z = 16–20. For the SIS profile, the black hole formation timescales are short compared to NFW. For power-law profiles, massive black holes with M = (106–108) M⊙ grow within a few tens to 100 Myr (z = 5–30). For modified-core isothermal profiles, the timescale of massive black hole formation is in the range (0.79–464.08) Myr (z = 8–30).

This work studies the relationship between accretion-disk size and quasar properties, using a sample of 95 quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Reverberation Mapping Project with measured lags between the g and i photometric bands. Our sample includes disk lags that are both longer and shorter than predicted by the Shakura and Sunyaev model, requiring explanations that satisfy both cases. Although our quasars each have one lag measurement, we explore the wavelength-dependent effects of diffuse broad-line region (BLR) contamination through our sample’s broad redshift range, 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 1.2. We do not find significant evidence of variable diffuse Fe ii and Balmer nebular emission in the rms spectra, nor from Anderson–Darling tests of quasars in redshift ranges with and without diffuse nebular emission falling in the observed-frame filters. Contrary to previous work, we do not detect a significant correlation between the measured continuum and BLR lags in our luminous quasar sample, similarly suggesting that our continuum lags are not dominated by diffuse nebular emission. Similar to other studies, we find that quasars with larger-than-expected continuum lags have lower 3000 Å luminosities, and we additionally find longer continuum lags with lower X-ray luminosities and black hole masses. Our lack of evidence for diffuse BLR contribution to the lags indicates that the anticorrelation between continuum lag and luminosity is not likely to be due to the Baldwin effect. Instead, these anticorrelations favor models in which the continuum lag increases in lower-luminosity active galactic nuclei, including scenarios featuring magnetic coupling between the accretion disk and X-ray corona, and/or ripples or rims in the disk.

总结:<br /><br /> 这项研究针对质量为100到200太阳质量的旋转原始恒星进行了新的演化模型计算。他们考虑了恒星自转、脉动驱动的质量损失和辐射风等因素，并和初始金属丰度Z = 0和Z = 0.0002进行了比较。他们发现部分模型会在引力波不稳定阶段产生成功的伽马射线爆发（GRB），而另一部分模型则会直接坍缩成黑洞，产生喷射驱动的超新星事件。这些研究成果有望帮助我们更好地理解恒星演化和宇宙中的GRB和黑洞形成，对于探索宇宙中的恒星形成和演化具有重要意义。 <div>
We calculate new evolutionary models of rotating primordial very massive stars, with initial mass from 100 M⊙ to 200 M⊙, for two values of the initial metallicity Z = 0 and Z = 0.0002. For the first time in this mass range, we consider stellar rotation and pulsation-driven mass loss, along with radiative winds. The models evolve from the zero-age main sequence until the onset of pair-instability. We discuss the main properties of the models during their evolution and then focus on the final fate and the possible progenitors of jet-driven events. All tracks that undergo pulsational-pair instability produce successful gamma-ray bursts (GRB) in the collapsar framework, while those that collapse directly to black holes (BH) produce jet-driven supernova events. In these latter cases, the expected black hole mass changes due to the jet propagation inside the progenitor, resulting in different models that should produce BH within the pair-instability black hole mass gap. Successful GRBs predicted here from zero metallicity, and very metal-poor progenitors, may be bright enough to be detected even up to redshift ∼20 using current telescopes such as the Swift-BAT X-ray detector and the JWST.

总结:<br />
这篇文章讨论了对大质量早期星系（ETGs）初始质量函数（IMF）的不同探测方法所得到的结果存在矛盾。研究构建了Schwarzschild模型，使用MUSE和SINFONI观测，发现了动力学证据表明ETGs的质量光比率ϒ向中心增加。研究发现恒定ϒ模型可能会高估星系的质量。在大多数情况下，总动力学质量最小值出现在大约1千光年处，并且对IMF的监管提供最强的限制。在主体区域，发现了类似于银河系的IMF，而在中心区域，发现了具有增加质量归一化的区域，但比之前的研究所暗示的要温和一些，仍然指向了类似于Salpeter IMF的情况。 <div>
Evidence from different probes of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) of massive early-type galaxies (ETGs) has repeatedly converged on IMFs more bottom heavy than in the Milky Way (MW). This consensus has come under scrutiny due to often contradictory results from different methods on the level of individual galaxies. In particular, a number of strong lensing probes are ostensibly incompatible with a non-MW IMF. Radial gradients of the IMF—related to gradients of the stellar mass-to-light ratio ϒ—can potentially resolve this issue. We construct Schwarzschild models allowing for ϒ-gradients in seven massive ETGs with MUSE and SINFONI observations. We find dynamical evidence that ϒ increases toward the center for all ETGs. The gradients are confined to subkiloparsec scales. Our results suggest that constant-ϒ models may overestimate the stellar mass of galaxies by up to a factor of 1.5. For all except one galaxy, we find a radius where the total dynamical mass has a minimum. This minimum places the strongest constraints on the IMF outside the center and appears at roughly 1 kpc. We consider the IMF at this radius characteristic for the main body of each ETG. In terms of the IMF mass-normalization α relative to a Kroupa IMF, we find on average an MW-like IMF 〈αmain〉 = 1.03 ± 0.19. In the centers, we find concentrated regions with increased mass normalizations that are less extreme than previous studies suggested, but still point to a Salpeter-like IMF, 〈αcen〉 = 1.54 ± 0.15.

<div> Dark Energy Survey, dwarf galaxies, search, Local Volume, NGC 55
总结: 本研究使用Dark Energy Survey (DES)的数据进行了对太阳系至0.3至2Mpc外淡淡星系的系统广域搜索。搜索并未发现新的外围星系，但发现了一候选矮星系，距离为2.2Mpc，可能是地方星系NGC 55的卫星。该矮星系具有极低的表面亮度和巨大的扩散，表明可能受到其宿主的潮汐相互作用的影响。通过合成星系，研究得出了对于距离在0.3至2.0Mpc处的矮星系的检测效率，并且估计了发现的候选矮星系的绝对视星等和半光半径。 <div>
We report results from a systematic wide-area search for faint dwarf galaxies at heliocentric distances from 0.3 to 2 Mpc using the full 6 yr of data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES). Unlike previous searches over the DES data, this search specifically targeted a field population of faint galaxies located beyond the Milky Way virial radius. We derive our detection efficiency for faint, resolved dwarf galaxies in the Local Volume with a set of synthetic galaxies and expect our search to be complete to MV ∼ (−7, −10) mag for galaxies at D = (0.3, 2.0) Mpc. We find no new field dwarfs in the DES footprint, but we report the discovery of one high-significance candidate dwarf galaxy at a distance of {2.2}_{-0.12}^{+0.05}\,\mathrm{Mpc}, a potential satellite of the Local Volume galaxy NGC 55, separated by 47′ (physical separation as small as 30 kpc). We estimate this dwarf galaxy to have an absolute V-band magnitude of -{8.0}_{-0.3}^{+0.5}\,\mathrm{mag} and an azimuthally averaged physical half-light radius of {2.2}_{-0.4}^{+0.5}\,\mathrm{kpc}, making this one of the lowest surface brightness galaxies ever found with \mu =32.3\,\mathrm{mag}\,{\mathrm{arcsec}}^{-2}. This is the largest, most diffuse galaxy known at this luminosity, suggesting possible tidal interactions with its host.

总结: <br />
本研究观察到了与电子涡旋相关的亚离子尺度磁隆（MHu)与DF的关联，通过加强磁场的三个分量。MHu中存在径向电场，显示双极变化，主要归因于电子对流项。在MHu前部，存在明显的能量转换（J·E∼−0.3 nW m−3），伴随着电磁能量的流入和流出。DF的其他区域存在相反的能量转换。此外，MHu中还观察到了宽带平行的静电波。这些发现为我们提供了对DF的动力尺度过程的洞察。<br /><br /> <div>
As the plasma boundary between two distinct plasma populations, dipolarization fronts (DFs) host abundant kinetic-scale substructures that change their normal directions and thus cause their deformation. However, studies on such deformation caused by an electron vortex have been lacking. Here, we present novel observations of a subion-scale magnetic hump (MHu) associated with an oblique electron vortex at a DF through strengthening three components of the magnetic field. A radial electric field in the MHu, showing bipolar variation, is also associated with the electron vortex as it is mainly ascribed to the electron convection term. There is apparent energy conversion (\overrightarrow{J}\cdot \overrightarrow{E}∼−0.3 nw m−3) from the particles to the electromagnetic field in the MHu’s leading part, which is accompanied by inflow and outflow of electromagnetic energy (nonzero {\rm{\nabla }}\cdot \overrightarrow{S}). The other regions of the DF host opposite energy conversion (\overrightarrow{J}\cdot \overrightarrow{E} &gt; 0). Broadband parallel electrostatic waves are also observed in the MHu. Our study provides insights into the kinetic-scale processes at DFs.

<br /><br />总结:
本文对太阳型恒星的软X射线耀斑进行了统计研究。使用了Chandra Source Catalog Release 2.0和Gaia Data Release 3等数据源，开发了一套方法来识别和分类恒星软X射线耀斑并估算其特性。主要结果包括：耀斑能量范围在10^33到10^37之间，大多数为超级耀斑，并且发现耀斑持续时间与能量呈正相关关系；恒星耀斑能量的频率分布与其他波段和其他类型的恒星相似，表明软X射线波段辐射机制可能是全波段辐射能量的恒定分数。 <div>
The statistical characteristics of stellar flares at optical bands have received extensive study, but they remain to be studied at soft X-ray bands, in particular for solar-type stars. Here, we present a statistical study of soft X-ray flares on solar-type stars, which can help in understanding the multiwavelength behaviors of stellar flares. We mainly use Chandra Source Catalog Release 2.0, which includes a number of flaring stars with denoted variability, and Gaia Data Release 3, which includes the necessary information for classifying stars. We also develop a set of methods for identifying and classifying stellar soft X-ray flares and estimating their properties. A detailed statistical investigation of 129 flare samples on 103 nearby solar-type stars as selected yields the following main results. (1) The flare energy emitted at the soft X-ray band in our sample ranges from ∼1033 to ∼1037 erg, and the majority of them are superflares, with the most energetic one having energy of {6.0}_{-4.7}^{+3.2}\times {10}^{37}\ \mathrm{erg}. (2) The flare duration is related to its energy as formulated by {T}_{\mathrm{duration},\mathrm{SXR}}\propto {E}_{\mathrm{flare},\mathrm{SXR}}^{\ 0.201\pm 0.024}, which is different from those derived at optical and near-IR bands, indicating distinct radiation mechanisms at different bands. (3) The frequency distribution of stellar flares as a function of energy is formulated as {{dN}}_{\mathrm{flare}}/{{dE}}_{\mathrm{flare},\mathrm{SXR}}\propto {E}_{\mathrm{flare},\mathrm{SXR}}^{\ -1.77}, which is similar to the results found at other bands and on other types of stars, indicating that the energy emitted at the soft X-ray band could be a constant fraction of the full-band bolometric energy.

研究利用13CO谱学数据从GRS、FUGIN和SEDIGSM调查中与银河系涡旋臂相关的六个巨型丝状结构中的磁场结构，采用速度梯度技术（VGT）。与尘埃极化发射不同，VGT允许我们使用速度信息来区分前景和背景，并可可靠地确定磁场的方向。大多数情况下，我们发现磁场与丝状结构保持一致，并与盘面平行。所得的结果暗示银河剪切可能塑造了这些丝状结构。磁场在我们分析的分辨率下可以保持正常方向，这表明即使在湍流通过时间短于剪切时间的情况下，湍流运动也不能有效地破坏磁场的规则定向。在一些丝状结构中发现的间断可能是由包括丝状结构重组、引力坍缩和恒星反馈在内的过程所引起的。

<br /><br />总结:
1. 研究利用13CO数据研究了六个与银河系涡旋臂相关的巨型丝状结构中的磁场结构。
2. VGT技术可以可靠地确定磁场的方向，并区分前景和背景。
3. 大多数情况下，磁场与丝状结构保持一致，并与盘面平行，这可能是银河剪切的结果。

We study the magnetic field structures in six giant filaments associated with the spiral arms of the Milky Way by applying the velocity gradient technique (VGT) to the 13CO spectroscopic data from the GRS, FUGIN, and SEDIGSM surveys. Unlike dust-polarized emission, the VGT allows us to separate the foreground and background using the velocity information, from which the orientation of the magnetic field can be reliably determined. We find that in most cases the magnetic fields stay aligned with the filament bodies, which are parallel to the disk midplane. Among these, G29, G47, and G51 exhibit smooth magnetic fields, and G24, G339, and G349 exhibit discontinuities. The fact that most filaments have magnetic fields that stay aligned with the Galactic disk midplane suggests that Galactic shear may be responsible for shaping the filaments. The fact that the magnetic field can stay regular at the resolution of our analysis (≲10 pc), where the turbulence crossing time is short compared to the shear time, suggests that turbulent motion cannot effectively disrupt the regular orientation of the magnetic field. The discontinuities found in some filaments can be caused by processes including filament reassembly, gravitational collapse, and stellar feedback.

<div> Prestellar core, Filamentary structure, Nucleus, Density, CO depletion

总结:
在Orion分子云3（OMC-3）区域内研究了G208-N2前恒星核的内部结构。通过Atacama大型毫米/亚毫米阵列，发现尘埃连续辐射呈丝状结构，长度约5000天文单位，平均H2体积密度约为6×107cm−3。在丝状结构的顶端发现一个半径约150-200天文单位，质量约为0.1太阳质量的核心。核心的中心密度约为2×109cm−3，径向密度剖面为r−1.87±0.11。该核心的密度缩放约为奇异等温球体（SIS）的3.7倍，这以及非常低的维里参数0.39表明重力在核心内部处于主导地位。然而，没有CO流的迹象局限在这个核心区域内。丝状结构由N2D+ 3-2发射追踪，但不是由C18O 2-1发射追踪，这意味着由于高密度和低温度而导致显著的CO耗尽。指向核心的N2D+也显示出衰减的特征。这可能意味着父分子N2的耗竭，或者存在着能够使CO在非常小的区域升华的内嵌非常低辐射的中心源。G208-N2中的核心被认为是处于首次静水压核（FHSC）形成边缘的前恒星核，或者是FHSC的候选者。 <div>
The internal structure of the prestellar core G208.68-19.02-N2 (G208-N2) in the Orion Molecular Cloud 3 (OMC-3) region has been studied with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The dust continuum emission revealed a filamentary structure with a length of ∼5000 au and an average H2 volume density of ∼6 × 107 cm−3. At the tip of this filamentary structure, there is a compact object, which we call a nucleus, with a radius of ∼150–200 au and a mass of ∼0.1 M⊙. The nucleus has a central density of ∼2 × 109 cm−3 with a radial density profile of r−1.87±0.11. The density scaling of the nucleus is ∼3.7 times higher than that of the singular isothermal sphere (SIS). This as well as the very low virial parameter of 0.39 suggests that the gravity is dominant over the pressure everywhere in the nucleus. However, there is no sign of CO outflow localized to this nucleus. The filamentary structure is traced by the N2D+ 3–2 emission, but not by the C18O 2–1 emission, implying the significant CO depletion due to high density and cold temperature. Toward the nucleus, the N2D+ also shows the signature of depletion. This could imply either the depletion of the parent molecule, N2, or the presence of the embedded very-low luminosity central source that could sublimate the CO in the very small area. The nucleus in G208-N2 is considered to be a prestellar core on the verge of first hydrostatic core (FHSC) formation or a candidate for the FHSC.

总结:<br />
这篇文章利用气流悬浮系统在还原大气中进行了RP球粒的再现实验，发现自然RP球粒中的铁分配系数DFe要高于实验再现的结果，表明在高温下球粒形成后，玻璃基质中的铁被移除。实验中发现玻璃基质中形成了许多小的铁金属包裹体，证实了自然RP球粒中DFe增加的过程。因此，RP球粒的DFe可以用来限制球粒形成过程中的冷却速率和氧化还原状态。 <div>
Reproduction experiments of radial pyroxene (RP) chondrules were carried out using an Ar–H2 or Ar gas-jet levitation system in a reducing atmosphere in order to simulate chondrule formation in the protoplanetary disk. The experiments reproduced RP-chondrule textures, consisting of sets of thin pyroxene crystals and mesostasis glass between crystals. However, iron partition coefficients between pyroxene and glassy mesostasis (DFe =Fe mol%pyroxene/Fe mol%mesostasis) in natural RP chondrules were much higher than that in the experimentally reproduced RP chondrules. The high DFe in natural RP chondrules suggests that iron was removed from the mesostasis melt at high temperatures after the growth of pyroxene crystals. We found that many small iron-metal inclusions had formed in the mesostasis glass, indicating that FeO in the high-temperature melt of mesostasis was reduced to metallic iron, and iron in the mesostasis diffused into the newly formed metal inclusions. The formation of the iron-metal inclusions in the mesostasis was reproduced by our experiments in a reducing atmosphere, confirming that DFe in natural RP chondrules increased after the growth of RP crystals. Therefore, the DFe of RP chondrules can be an indicator to constrain cooling rates and redox states during chondrule formation.

<br /><br />
总结: 该研究使用Cloudy模拟了氧、氖等物种的禁区线排放，以追踪原行星盘的风。他们采用了参数化的磁热风模型，这些模型在一定程度上与光蒸发和磁离心风的特征相似，且受到了近期理论研究的青睐。他们发现，可行的风参数可以产生线的宽窄低速成分，而传统的风模型往往难以做到这一点。此外，线的亮度、蓝移、宽度以及这些随着吸积光度和盘倾角的趋势与观测结果一致。 <div>
Emission in forbidden lines of oxygen, neon, and other species are commonly used to trace winds from protoplanetary disks. Using Cloudy, we calculate such emission for parametrized wind models of the magnetothermal type, following Bai et al. These models share characteristics with both photoevaporative and magnetocentrifugal winds, which can be regarded as end members, and are favored by recent theoretical research. Both broad and narrow low-velocity components of the lines can be produced with plausible wind parameters, something that traditional wind models have difficulty with. Line luminosities, blueshifts, and widths, as well as trends of these with accretion luminosity and disk inclination, are in general accordance with observations.

通过对90个年轻移动星团、昴星团和母牛座中的晚期M型和L型矮星进行低分辨率近红外光谱和BT-Settl模型大气的统一前向建模分析，研究了这些矮星的有效温度、表面重力、半径和质量。得到的观测参数与基于演化模型计算得到的参数存在系统性偏差，特别是在M-L谱型边界附近的物体。研究发现模型光谱有过度预测J-和H-带的峰值流量，表明模型大气中包含的尘埃含量不足以匹配观测。通过在BT-Settl模型光谱中引入类似于星际介质的红化定律，发现模型和观测谱的拟合得到了很大改善，而M-L转变处的红化系数最大。这项工作对BT-Settl模型大气进行了系统的研究，是迄今为止最大的Late-M和L型棕矮星的光谱分析。 
<br /><br />总结: Late-M和L型矮星通过低分辨率近红外光谱和BT-Settl模型大气的前向建模进行了详细分析。观测参数与基于演化模型计算得到的参数存在系统性偏差，尤其是在M-L谱型边界处。对模型光谱引入红化定律可以极大改善模型和观测谱的拟合，表明模型大气中的尘埃含量不足以匹配观测。这项工作是对BT-Settl模型大气最大的系统研究，也是迄今为止最大的Late-M和L型棕矮星的光谱分析。 <div>
We present a uniform forward-modeling analysis of 90 late-M and L dwarfs in nearby young (∼10–200 Myr) moving groups, the Pleiades, and the Hyades using low-resolution (R ≈ 150) near-infrared (0.9–2.4 μm) spectra and the BT-Settl model atmospheres. We derive the objects’ effective temperatures, surface gravities, radii, and masses by comparing our spectra to the models using a Bayesian framework with nested sampling and calculate the same parameters using evolutionary models. Assuming the evolutionary-based parameters are more robust, our spectroscopically inferred parameters from BT-Settl exhibit two types of systematic behavior for objects near the M-L spectral type boundary. Several objects are clustered around Teff ≈ 1800 K and \mathrm{log}g\approx 5.5 dex, implying impossibly large masses (150–1400 MJup), while others are clustered around Teff ≳ 3000 K and \mathrm{log}g\lesssim 3.0 dex, implying unphysically low masses and unreasonably young ages. We find the fitted BT-Settl model spectra tend to overpredict the peak J- and H-band flux for objects located near the M-L boundary, suggesting the dust content included in the model atmospheres is insufficient to match the observations. By adding an interstellar medium–like reddening law to the BT-Settl model spectra, we find the fits between models and observed spectra are greatly improved, with the largest reddening coefficients occurring at the M-L transition. This work delivers a systematic examination of the BT-Settl model atmospheres and constitutes the largest spectral analysis of benchmark late-M- and L-type brown dwarfs to date.

总结:<br />
研究了位于z = 4.3的高红移星系团SPT2349−56，通过射电观测探测到了其中的射电活动星系核（AGN）。AGN的射电亮度远高于预期，表明其可能受到形成最亮星系团星系的驱动。与其他样本和高红移强射电星系相比较结果。研究发现，射电活动AGN可能给星系团内介质提供了强大的反馈作用。 <div>
We have observed the z = 4.3 protocluster SPT2349−56 with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) with the aim of detecting radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGNs) among the ∼30 submillimeter (submm) galaxies (SMGs) identified in the structure. We detect the central complex of submm sources at 2.2 GHz with a luminosity of L2.2  = (4.42 ± 0.56)  ×  1025 W Hz−1. MeerKAT and the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder also detect the source at 816 MHz and 888 MHz, respectively, constraining the radio spectral index to α = −1.45 ± 0.16, implying L1.4,rest  = (2.2 ± 0.2) × 1026 W Hz−1. The radio observations do not have sufficient spatial resolution to uniquely identify one of the three Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) galaxies as the AGN, however the ALMA source properties themselves suggest a likely host. This radio luminosity is ∼100× higher than expected from star formation, assuming the usual far-infrared–radio correlation, indicating an AGN driven by a forming brightest cluster galaxy. None of the SMGs in SPT2349−56 show signs of AGNs in any other diagnostics available to us, highlighting the radio continuum as a powerful probe of obscured AGNs. We compare these results to field samples of radio sources and SMGs, along with the 22 gravitationally lensed SPT-SMGs also observed in the ATCA program, as well as powerful radio galaxies at high redshifts. The (3.3 ± 0.7) ×  1038 W of power from the radio-loud AGN sustained over 100 Myr is comparable to the binding energy of the gas mass of the central halo, and similar to the instantaneous energy injection from supernova feedback from the SMGs in the core region. The SPT2349−56 radio-loud AGNs may be providing strong feedback on a nascent intracluster medium.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Kilonovae are likely a key site of heavy r-process element production in the Universe, and their optical/infrared spectra contain insights into both the properties of the ejecta and the conditions of the r-process. However, the event GW170817/AT2017gfo is the only kilonova so far with well-observed spectra. To understand the diversity of absorption features that might be observed in future kilonovae spectra, we use the TARDIS Monte Carlo radiative transfer code to simulate a suite of optical spectra spanning a wide range of kilonova ejecta properties and r-process abundance patterns. To identify the most common and prominent absorption lines, we perform dimensionality reduction using an autoencoder, and we find spectra clusters in the latent space representation using a Bayesian Gaussian Mixture model. Our synthetic kilonovae spectra commonly display strong absorption by strontium 38Sr ii, yttrium 38Y ii, and zirconium 40Zr i–ii, with strong lanthanide contributions at low electron fractions (Ye ≲ 0.25). When a new kilonova is observed, our machine-learning framework will provide context on the dominant absorption lines and key ejecta properties, helping to determine where this event falls within the larger “zoo” of kilonovae spectra.

We present individual star formation histories (SFHs) of ∼3000 massive galaxies (log(M*/M⊙) &gt; 10.5) from the Large Early Galaxy Astrophysics Census spectroscopic survey at a lookback time of ∼7 billion yr and quantify the population trends leveraging 20 hr deep-integrated spectra of these ∼1800 star-forming and ∼1200 quiescent galaxies at 0.6 &lt; z &lt; 1.0. Essentially all galaxies at this epoch contain stars of age &lt;3 Gyr, in contrast with older massive galaxies today, facilitating better recovery of previous generations of star formation at cosmic noon and earlier. We conduct spectrophotometric analysis using parametric and nonparametric Bayesian stellar population synthesis modeling tools—Bagpipes and Prospector—to constrain the median SFHs of this mass complete sample and characterize population trends. A consistent picture arises for the late-time stellar mass growth when quantified as t50 and t90, corresponding to the age of the Universe when galaxies formed 50% and 90% of their total stellar mass, although the two methods disagree at the earliest formation times (e.g., t10). Our results reveal trends in both stellar mass and stellar velocity dispersion as in the local Universe—low-mass galaxies with shallower potential wells grow their stellar masses later in cosmic history compared to high-mass galaxies. Unlike local quiescent galaxies, the median duration of late-time star formation (τSF,late = t90–t50) does not consistently depend on the stellar mass. This census sets a benchmark for future deep spectrophotometric studies of the more distant Universe.

We present JCMT POL-2 850 μm dust polarization observations and Mimir H-band stellar polarization observations toward the starless core L 1512. We detect the highly ordered core-scale magnetic field traced by the POL-2 data, of which the field orientation is consistent with the parsec-scale magnetic fields traced by Planck data, suggesting the large-scale fields thread from the low-density region to the dense core region in this cloud. The surrounding magnetic field traced by the Mimir data shows a wider variation in the field orientation, suggesting there could be a transition of magnetic field morphology at the envelope-scale. L 1512 was suggested to be presumably older than 1.4 Myr in a previous study via time-dependent chemical analysis, hinting that the magnetic field could be strong enough to slow the collapse of L 1512. In this study, we use the Davis–Chandrasekhar–Fermi method to derive a plane-of-sky magnetic field strength (Bpos) of 18 ± 7 μG and an observed mass-to-flux ratio (λobs) of 3.5 ± 2.4, suggesting that L 1512 is magnetically supercritical. However, the absence of significant infall motion and the presence of an oscillating envelope are inconsistent with the magnetically supercritical condition. Using a virial analysis, we suggest the presence of a hitherto hidden line-of-sight magnetic field strength of ∼27 μG with a mass-to-flux ratio (λtot) of ∼1.6, in which case both magnetic and kinetic pressures are important in supporting the L 1512 core. On the other hand, L 1512 may have just reached supercriticality and will collapse at any time.

<title>Testing the Polarization of Gravitational-wave Background with the LISA-TianQin Network</title>

While general relativity predicts only two tensor modes for gravitational-wave (GW) polarization, general metric theories of gravity allow for up to four additional modes, including two vector and two scalar modes. Observing the polarization modes of GWs could provide a direct test of the modified gravity. The stochastic GW background (SGWB), which can be detected by space-based laser-interferometric detectors at design sensitivity, will provide an opportunity to directly measure alternative polarization. In this paper, we investigate the performance of the LISA-TianQin network for detecting alternative polarizations of stochastic backgrounds, and propose a method to separate different polarization modes. First, we generalize the small antenna approximation to compute the overlap reduction functions for the SGWB with arbitrary polarization, which is suitable for any time-delay interferometry combination. Then we analyze the detection capability of LISA-TianQin for the SGWB with different polarizations. Based on the orbital characteristics of LISA-TianQin, we propose a method to distinguish different polarization modes from their mixed data. Finally, simulation tests are performed to verify the effectiveness of the method. The results of the simulations demonstrate that LISA-TianQin, when employing our proposed method, has the ability to differentiate between various polarization modes, with a specific emphasis on the ability to distinguish between the breathing and longitudinal modes.

<title>Atmospheric Escape From Three Terrestrial Planets in the L 98-59 System</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A critically important process affecting the climate evolution and potential habitability of an exoplanet is atmospheric escape, in which high-energy radiation from a star drives the escape of hydrogen atoms and other light elements from a planet’s atmosphere. L 98-59 is a benchmark system for studying such atmospheric processes, with three transiting terrestrial-sized planets receiving Venus-like instellations (4–25 S⊕) from their M3 host star. We use the VPLanet model to simulate the evolution of the L 98-59 system and the atmospheric escape of its inner three small planets, given different assumed initial water quantities. We find that, regardless of their initial water content, all three planets accumulate significant quantities of oxygen due to efficient water photolysis and hydrogen loss. All three planets also receive enough strong X-ray and extreme-ultraviolet flux to drive rapid water loss, which considerably affects their developing climates and atmospheres. Even in scenarios of low initial water content, our results suggest that the JWST will be sensitive to observations of retained oxygen on the L 98-59 planets in its future scheduled observations, with planets b and c being the most likely targets to possess an extended atmosphere. Our results constrain the atmospheric evolution of these small rocky planets, and they provide context for current and future observations of the L 98-59 system to generalize our understanding of multiterrestrial planet systems.

<title>Investigation of Periodic Modulation Behaviors from Pulsar J2022+5154</title>

We have carried out a detailed study of individual pulse emission from the pulsar J2022+5154 (B2021+51), observed at 2250 MHz using the Jiamusi 66 m radio telescope. We have investigated the modulations in single-pulse behavior using fluctuation spectral analysis, which shows the presence of two prominent periodicities, around 5 and 40 rotation periods, respectively. The shorter periodicity is associated with the phenomenon of subpulse drifting. In the absence of aliasing, the emission pattern is demonstrated to consist of eight subbeams, which rotate around the magnetic axis in about 45 periods. In addition to subpulse drifting, the pulsar also shows the presence of periodic amplitude modulation with a longer periodicity in the single-pulse sequence. The pulsar joins a select group that shows the presence of periodic phase-modulated drifting as well as amplitude-modulated drifting. This provides further evidence for the two phenomena being distinct from each other with different physical origins.

<title>The Age Distribution of Stellar Orbit Space Clumps</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad0f99</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The orbit distribution of young stars in the Galactic disk is highly structured, from well-defined clusters to streams of stars that may be widely dispersed across the sky, but are compact in orbital action-angle space. The age distribution of such groups can constrain the timescales over which conatal groups of stars disperse into the “field.” Gaia data have proven powerful in identifying such groups in action-angle space, but the resulting member samples are often too small and have too narrow a color–magnitude diagram (CMD) coverage to allow robust age determinations. Here, we develop and illustrate a new approach that can estimate robust stellar population ages for such groups of stars. This first entails projecting the predetermined action-angle distribution into the 5D space of positions, parallaxes, and proper motions, where much larger samples of likely members can be identified over a much wider range of the CMD. It then entails isochrone fitting that accounts for: (a) widely varying distances and reddenings; (b) outliers and binaries; (c) sparsely populated main-sequence turnoffs, by incorporating the age information of the low-mass main sequence; and (d) the possible presence of an intrinsic age spread in the stellar population. When we apply this approach to 92 nearby stellar groups identified in 6D orbit space, we find that they are predominantly young (≲1 Gyr), mono-age populations. Many groups are established (known) localized clusters with possible tidal tails, while others tend to be widely dispersed and manifestly unbound. This new age-dating tool offers a stringent approach to understanding on which orbits stars form in the solar neighborhood and how quickly they disperse into the field.

<title>Recurrently Propagating Intensity Disturbances along Polar Plumes Observed in White Light and Extreme Ultraviolet</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad11d2</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We study properties of intensity disturbances along polar coronal rays that are associated with plumes below. For this, we draw azimuth–time images of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emission of 171 Å band observed by the SDO/AIA and white light (WL) observed by the SOHO/LASCO C2 in 2020 July. From the azimuth–time image, we define two tracks in which the EUV intensities were recurrently enhanced during two weeks. The two EUV tracks are rooted at 78.°8 and 81.°4 latitudes, but their projected azimuth angles are changed with time as the Sun rotates. Coherent WL tracks at different altitudes are determined by scaling the azimuth angles of the EUV tracks, accounting for the effect of inclination of coronal rays. From this, we construct time–distance images of WL intensities along WL tracks, whose projected azimuth angle changes along time and altitude, but the intensities are correlated with the EUV intensities measured below. The time–distance images of WL show repeated and inclined intensity features. The propagation speeds in the altitude range 2.3–6 solar radii are calculated to be 159 ± 8 km s−1 and 300 ± 24 km s−1. The EUV and WL intensities are found to be coherent at 1–2 day periods. It is also found that dynamic burst events along the EUV track are responsible for the enhanced emission. We conclude that the variation of the WL intensity along the polar coronal rays is related with the evolution of the EUV intensity below.

<title>Investigating Extreme Scattering Events by Volumetric Ray-tracing</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad11d6</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Extreme scattering events (ESEs) are observed as dramatic (&gt;50%) drops in flux density that occur over an extended period of weeks to months. Discrete plasma lensing structures are theorized to scatter the radio waves produced by distant sources such as pulsars, causing the signature decrease in flux density and characteristic caustic spikes in ESE light curves. While plasma lens models in the extant literature have reproduced key features of ESE light curves, they have all faced the problem of being highly overdense and overpressured relative to the surrounding interstellar medium by orders of magnitude. We model ESEs by numerically ray tracing through analytic, volumetric plasma lens models by solving the eikonal equation. Delaunay triangulation connecting the rays approximates the wave front, generating a mapping from the observer plane to the source plane to account for multiple imaging. This eikonal method of ray tracing is tested against known analytic solutions and is then applied to a three-dimensional Gaussian-distributed electron volume density lens and a filament model inspired by Grafton et al. We find convergence of our numerical results with established analytic solutions, validating our numerical method, and reproduce ESE-like light curves. Our numerical ray-tracing method lends itself well to exploring the lensing effects of volumetric turbulence as well as sheet-like lenses, which is currently in progress.

<title>Modeling Solar Oscillation Power Spectra. III. Spatiotemporal Spectra of Solar Granulation Velocity Field as Seen in HMI Velocity Measurements</title>

We suggest a physically motivated model of the uncorrelated background, which can be used to improve the accuracy of helioseismic frequency measurements when the background contributes significantly to the formation of spectral lines of acoustic resonances. The basic assumption of our model is that the correlation length of the convective motions is small compared with the horizontal wavelength R⊙/ℓ of the observations, where ℓ is the degree of the spherical harmonic Yℓm(θ, φ). When applied to solar power spectra at frequencies below acoustic resonances, the model reveals a distinct sensitivity to solar rotation: advection of the convective velocity pattern brings spatial correlations in the apparent stochastic velocity field (temporal correlations in the corotating frame induce spatial correlations in the inertial frame). The induced spatiotemporal correlations manifest themselves as an antisymmetric component in the dependence of the convective noise power on azimuthal order m, which allows us to address the solar differential rotation. With 360 days of data obtained by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory, we measure three components of the rotation rate as a function of latitude using only ℓ = 300. This result indicates that the model suggests a new way of measuring solar subsurface rotation. This approach can complement traditional measurements based on correlation tracking.

<title>Black Hole Ultracompact X-Ray Binaries as Galactic Low-frequency Gravitational Wave Sources: The He Star Channel</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad12d3</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Black hole (BH) ultracompact X-ray binaries (UCXBs) are potential Galactic low-frequency gravitational wave (GW) sources. As an alternative channel, BH UCXBs can evolve from BH+He star binaries. In this work, we perform a detailed stellar evolution model for the formation and evolution of BH UCXBs evolving from the He star channel to diagnose their detectability as low-frequency GW sources. Our calculations found that some nascent BH+He star binaries after the common-envelope (CE) phase could evolve into UCXB-LISA sources with a maximum GW frequency of ∼5 mHz, which can be detected in a distance of 10 kpc (or 100 kpc). Once BH+He star systems become UCXBs through mass transfer, they would emit X-ray luminosities of ∼1038 erg s−1, making them ideal multimessenger objects. If the initial He-star masses are ≥0.7 M⊙, those systems are likely to experience two Roche lobe overflows, and the X-ray luminosity can reach a maximum of 3.5 × 1039 erg s−1 in the second mass-transfer stage. The initial He-star masses and initial orbital periods of progenitors of Galactic BH UCXB-LISA sources are in the range of 0.32–2.9 M⊙ and 0.02–0.19 days, respectively. Nearly all BH+He star binaries in the above parameter space can evolve into GW sources whose chirp masses can be accurately measured. Employing a population synthesis simulation, we predict the birthrate and detection number of Galactic BH UCXB-LISA sources evolving from the He star channel are R = 2.2 × 10−6 yr−1 and 33 for an optimistic CE parameter, respectively.

<title>FRAMEx. V. Radio Spectral Shape at Central Subparsec Region of Active Galactic Nuclei</title>

We present results from the Very Long Baseline Array multifrequency (1.6, 4.4, 8.6, and 22 GHz), high-sensitivity (∼25 μJy beam−1), subparsec-scale (&lt;1 pc) observations and spectral energy distributions for a sample of 12 local active galactic nuclei (AGNs), a subset from our previous volume-complete sample with hard-X-ray (14–195 keV) luminosities above 1042 erg s−1, out to a distance of 40 Mpc. All 12 of the sources presented here were detected in the C (4.4 GHz) and X (8.6 GHz) bands, 75% in the L band (1.6 GHz), and 50% in the K band (22 GHz). Most sources showed compact, resolved/slightly resolved, central subparsec-scale radio morphology, except for a few with extended outflow-like features. A couple of sources have an additional component that may indicate the presence of a dual-core, single or double-sided jet or a more intricate feature, such as radio emission resulting from interaction with the nearby interstellar medium. The spectral slopes are mostly gigahertz-peaked or curved, with a few showing steep, flat, or inverted spectra. We found that at the subparsec scale, the gigahertz-peaked spectra belong to the low-accreting, radio-loud AGNs, with a tendency to produce strong outflows, possibly small-scale jets, and/or have a coronal origin. In contrast, flat/inverted spectra suggest compact radio emission from the central regions of highly accreting AGNs, possibly associated with radio-quiet AGNs producing winds/shocks or nuclear star formation in the vicinity of black holes.

<title>The CO Outflow Components Ejected by a Recent Accretion Event in B335</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Protostellar outflows often present a knotty appearance, providing evidence of sporadic accretion in stellar mass growth. To understand the direct relation between mass accretion and ejection, we analyze the contemporaneous accretion activity and associated ejection components in B335. B335 has brightened in the mid-IR by 2.5 mag since 2010, indicating increased luminosity, presumably due to an increased mass accretion rate onto the protostar. Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of 12CO emission in the outflow reveal high-velocity emission, estimated to have been ejected 4.6–2 yr before the ALMA observations and consistent with the jump in mid-IR brightness. The consistency in timing suggests that the detected high-velocity ejection components are directly linked to the most recent accretion activity. We calculated the kinetic energy, momentum, and force for the ejection component associated with the most recent accretion activity and found that, at least, about 1.0% of the accreted mass has been ejected. More accurate information on the jet inclination and the temperature of the ejected gas components will better constrain the ejected mass induced by the recently enhanced accretion event.

<title>Infrared Emission of Specific Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Molecules: Cyanonaphthalenes</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The unidentified infrared emission features at 3.3, 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.3, and 12.7 μm are ubiquitously seen in a wide variety of astrophysical regions and commonly attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules. However, the unambiguous identification of any individual, specific PAH molecules has proven elusive until very recently, when two isomers of cyanonapthalene, which consists of two fused benzene rings and substitutes a nitrile (–CN) group for a hydrogen atom, were discovered in the Taurus Molecular Cloud, based on their rotational transitions at radio frequencies. To facilitate the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to search for cyanonapthalenes in astrophysical regions, we model the vibrational excitation of cyanonapthalenes and calculate their infrared emission spectra in a number of representative astrophysical regions. The model emission spectra and intensities will allow JWST to quantitatively determine or place an upper limit on the abundances of cyanonapthalenes.

<title>Polarized X-Rays Detected from the Anomalous X-Ray Pulsar 1E 2259+586</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs) and soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs) are believed to be associated with magnetars, which have extremely strong magnetic fields. Recently, with the operation of the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE), the polarization information of two AXPs and one SGR have been investigated. In this work, we report the observational results of the fourth magnetar, 1E 2259+586, with IXPE, and perform a joint analysis with observations from Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer. We find that the emission from 1E 2259+586 is linearly polarized, with a polarization degree (5.3% ± 1.3%) and a polarization angle −77° ± 7° in the 2–8 keV energy range. Additionally, both the polarization degree and polarization angle exhibit variability with the pulse phase, and there is a hint of anticorrelation between the polarization degree and the flux, which is similar to AXP 1RXS J170849.0-400910. The phase-dependent polarization angle displays a sinusoidal profile and can be well fitted with the rotating vector model, indicating that the magnetic dipole field dominated the magnetic structure of the pulsar, and the variation in the polarization angle was modulated by the pulsar’s rotation.

<div> 年轻恒星对象，尘埃输运，磁流体力学模拟，尘埃颗粒，质量流失率
总结:
年轻的0/I型恒星对象中的低尘埃不透明度谱指数（β < 1）被解释为这些环境中存在（次）毫米尘埃颗粒的迹象。密度条件和坍缩包围气壳的寿命已被证明不利于固体颗粒的生长达到毫米尺寸。作为一种替代方案，磁流体力学模拟表明原恒星喷流和流出可能会将颗粒从星周盘中抬升并扩散到包围气壳中。我们重新解释了CALYPSO样本中的0/I型源的可用数据，并展示了内部包围中测得的β1–3毫米值与其喷流和流出的质量流失率之间存在着一种负相关关系的初步证据，支持了这两者之间的联系。我们讨论了从盘到内部包围中进行尘埃输运可能对行星形成的几个方面产生的影响。最后，我们呼吁更准确地测量这些相关量，并将这项工作扩展到更大的样本中，以进一步测试这种输运情景。 <div>
Low dust opacity spectral indices (β &lt; 1) measured in the inner envelopes of class 0/I young stellar objects (age ∼104–5 yr) have been interpreted as the presence of (sub-)millimeter dust grains in these environments. The density conditions and the lifetimes of collapsing envelopes have proven unfavorable for the growth of solids up to millimeter sizes. As an alternative, magnetohydrodynamical simulations suggest that protostellar jets and outflows might lift grains from circumstellar disks and diffuse them in the envelope. We reframe available data for the CALYPSO sample of Class 0/I sources and show tentative evidence for an anticorrelation between the value of β1–3 mm measured in the inner envelope and the mass-loss rate of their jets and outflows, supporting a connection between the two. We discuss the implications that dust transport from the disk to the inner envelope might have for several aspects of planet formation. Finally, we urge for more accurate measurements of both correlated quantities and the extension of this work to larger samples, necessary to further test the transport scenario.

We present a search for host galaxy associations for the third set of repeating fast radio burst (FRB) sources discovered by the CHIME/FRB Collaboration. Using the ∼1′ CHIME/FRB baseband localizations and probabilistic methods, we identify potential host galaxies of two FRBs, 20200223B and 20190110C at redshifts of 0.06024(2) and 0.12244(6), respectively. We also discuss the properties of a third marginal candidate host galaxy association for FRB 20191106C with a host redshift of 0.10775(1). The three putative host galaxies are all relatively massive, fall on the standard mass–metallicity relationship for nearby galaxies, and show evidence of ongoing star formation. They also all show signatures of being in a transitional regime, falling in the green valley, which is between the bulk of star-forming and quiescent galaxies. The plausible host galaxies identified by our analysis are consistent with the overall population of repeating and nonrepeating FRB hosts while increasing the fraction of massive and bright galaxies. Coupled with these previous host associations, we identify a possible excess of FRB repeaters whose host galaxies have Mu − Mr colors redder than the bulk of star-forming galaxies. Additional precise localizations are required to confirm this trend.

这篇论文介绍了使用现代和复杂的优化方法对日食时间变化进行全面分析的有效策略，具体包括一套工具，用于研究日食双星中的周期变化机制，如光时效应、Applegate 机制和质量传递。研究团队首次使用存档和新的TESS数据跨越了75年，重新审视了最新的ETV。初步分析发现，TZ Bootis的TESS数据首次揭示了第二个双星的存在，与先前的光谱数据和Gaia DR3的天文测量结果相吻合。他们考虑了ETV的最可信情景：两个恒星周围伴星，最小质量分别为M3=0.5 M☉和M4=0.14 M☉，轨道高偏心率e3=0.70和e4=0.82，周期分别为P3=38年和P4=20年，以及主体的长达24年的磁活动和长期的周期增加（dP/dt=1.2×10−8天/年），解释为次体向主体的保守质量传递率dM1/dt=3.7×10−9天/年。需要进一步进行光谱观测、第二对的分析建模以及对两对的ETV分析，以研究系统的四重性质。<br /><br />总结: 该研究使用先进的优化方法对ETV进行了全面分析，首次发现了TZ Bootis中存在第二个双星的证据，并提出了两个潜在的恒星周围伴星的情景，以及进行了解释性质量传递率的估算。继续的观测和分析有望揭示该系统的四重性质。 <div>
We present an effective strategy for extensive analysis of eclipsing time variations (ETVs) using modern and sophisticated optimization methods that comprise a set of tools to investigate period variability mechanisms in eclipsing binary stars such as the light-time effect, the Applegate mechanism, and mass transfer. We implement these methods for the first time assuming that the above mechanisms can act simultaneously in the puzzling W UMa–type binary star TZ Bootis by using archival and new TESS data spanning 75 yr and reexamining the up-to-date ETVs. Preliminary analysis of the TESS data revealed for the first time the presence of a second binary in agreement with previous spectroscopic data and astrometric results from Gaia DR3. We consider the most credible scenario for the ETV: two stellar circumbinary companions of minimum masses M3 = 0.5 M☉ and M4 = 0.14 M☉ in highly eccentric orbits e3 = 0.70 and e4 = 0.82 with periods P3 = 38 yr and P4 = 20 yr along with a 24 yr magnetic activity of the secondary component and a long-term period increase (dP/dt = 1.2 × 10−8 days yr−1), interpreted as a conservative mass transfer from the secondary to the primary component at a rate of dM1/dt = 3.7 × 10−9 days yr−1. Further spectroscopic observations, analytical modeling of the second pair, and ETV analysis of both pairs are needed to investigate the quadruple nature of the system.

<div> 关键词: 天文数据，机器学习，主动星系核，巴莱克星座对象，数据分析

总结: 
本研究通过深入数据分析，提出了一种名为分形维度-逆离散小波变换（FDIDWT）的新方法，用于在大容量的天文数据中识别主动星系核（AGN）候选者和巴莱克星座对象（BL Lac）或平谱射电类星体（FSRQ）候选者。通过将原始数据转换为低维度并突出特征的转换数据集，结合使用改进的轻量级MatchboxConv1D模型，成功实现了对4FGL_DR3不确定源中AGN和BL Lac/FSRQ候选者的识别任务，并具有很高的准确性。此外，该方法还具有发现相对较弱变化和相对较暗的源的优势。 <div>
In the forthcoming era of big astronomical data, it is a burden to find target sources from ground-based and space-based telescopes. Although machine-learning methods have been extensively utilized to address this issue, the incorporation of in-depth data analysis can significantly enhance the efficiency of identifying target sources when dealing with massive volumes of astronomical data. In this work, we focused on the task of finding active galactic nucleus (AGN) candidates and identifying BL Lacertae objects (BL Lac) or flat spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) candidates from the 4FGL_DR3 uncertain sources. We studied the correlations among the attributes of the 4FGL_DR3 catalog and proposed a novel method, named fractal dimension–inverse discrete wavelet transform (FDIDWT), to transform the original data. The transformed data set is characterized as low-dimensional and feature-highlighted, with the estimation of correlation features by fractal dimension theory and the multi-resolution analysis by inverse discrete wavelet transform (IDWT). Combining the FDIDWT method with an improved lightweight MatchboxConv1D model, we accomplished two missions: (1) to distinguish the AGNs from others (non-AGNs) in the 4FGL_DR3 uncertain sources with an accuracy of 96.65% ± 1.32%, namely Mission A; and (2) to classify blazar candidates of uncertain type into BL Lacs or FSRQs with an accuracy of 92.03% ± 2.2%, namely Mission B. There are 1354 AGN candidates in Mission A, and 482 BL Lacs candidates and 128 FSRQ candidates were found in Mission B. The results show a high consistency of greater than 98% with the results in previous works. In addition, our method has the advantage of finding less variable and relatively faint sources than ordinary methods.

<div> 关键词: Globular clusters, millisecond pulsars, dynamical interaction, N-body models, gravitational collapse<br />
<br />
Globular clusters (GCs)是特别高效形成毫秒脉冲星的地方。在这些脉冲星中，大约一半缺乏伴星，这个比例比银河系场中的要高得多。在一些最密集的GCs中，特别是那些经历了核心崩溃的GCs中，这个比例进一步增加，这表明动态相互作用过程起着关键作用。我们首次创建了能够重现类似银河系GCs中单脉冲星与双脉冲星的比例的N体模型。我们特别关注NGC 6752，这是一个典型的核心崩溃星团，观测到许多毫秒脉冲星。先前的研究表明，在最密集的星团中，中子星双星破碎率增加可能解释了这些系统中单个脉冲星的过多。在这里，我们证明双星破碎是无效的，相反，我们提出两个额外的动态过程起主导作用：（1）中子星对主序星团的潮汐破碎和（2）重型白矮星双星合并残余物的引力坍缩。通过这些过程形成的中子星也可能与最近在外星系GC中观测到的快速射电暴发有关。<br /><br />总结:GCs是形成毫秒脉冲星的高效地方，但一半以上缺乏伴星。N体模型能重现银河系GCs中的现象。NGC 6752是一个典型的核心崩溃星团，关于双脉冲星的过多有新的解释。双星破碎无效，而潮汐破碎和白矮星合并引起的中子星形成可能引起快速射电暴发。 <div>
Globular clusters (GCs) are particularly efficient at forming millisecond pulsars. Among these pulsars, about half lack a companion star, a significantly higher fraction than in the Galactic field. This fraction increases further in some of the densest GCs, especially those that have undergone core collapse, suggesting that dynamical interaction processes play a key role. For the first time, we create N-body models that reproduce the ratio of single-to-binary pulsars in Milky Way–like GCs. We focus especially on NGC 6752, a typical core-collapsed cluster with many observed millisecond pulsars. Previous studies suggested that an increased rate of neutron star binary disruption in the densest clusters could explain the overabundance of single pulsars in these systems. Here, we demonstrate that binary disruption is ineffective and instead we propose that two additional dynamical processes play dominant roles: (1) tidal disruption of main-sequence stars by neutron stars and (2) gravitational collapse of heavy white dwarf binary merger remnants. Neutron stars formed through these processes may also be associated with fast radio bursts similar to those observed recently in an extragalactic GC.

总结:
本文使用HAWC探测器收集的数据分析了银河平面区域的太子电子伏特弥散辐射。研究显示，这种辐射的光谱与观测到的宇宙射线具有相似的指数。与DRAGONbase模型相比，HAWC GDE流量高出约2倍，这可能是未解决的源（如脉冲星风星云和太子电子伏特半球）或银河射线通量从局部测量的射线通量偏差所致。这些发现有助于我们更好地理解银河系中太子电子伏特弥散辐射的性质。<br /><br /> <div>
Galactic gamma-ray diffuse emission (GDE) is emitted by cosmic rays (CRs), ultra-relativistic protons, and electrons, interacting with gas and electromagnetic radiation fields in the interstellar medium. Here we present the analysis of teraelectronvolt diffuse emission from a region of the Galactic plane over the range in longitude of l ∈ [43°, 73°], using data collected with the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) detector. Spectral, longitudinal, and latitudinal distributions of the teraelectronvolt diffuse emission are shown. The radiation spectrum is compatible with the spectrum of the emission arising from a CR population with an index similar to that of the observed CRs. When comparing with the DRAGONbase model, the HAWC GDE flux is higher by about a factor of 2. Unresolved sources such as pulsar wind nebulae and teraelectronvolt halos could explain the excess emission. Finally, deviations of the Galactic CR flux from the locally measured CR flux may additionally explain the difference between the predicted and measured diffuse fluxes.

该研究通过离散偶极近似来计算20种不同凸形状的粒子在不同波长和不同粒径下的偏振截面。结果显示，一些形状可以被排除，因为它们在远红外和亚毫米波段提供的偏振太少或太多。通过实验确定了观察到的星光偏振所需的最小长宽比。另外，发现10微米波长偏振和光学偏振的比值几乎不受颗粒形状影响，这表明颗粒形状的不确定性不能解释对Cyg OB2-12预测和观测到的10微米偏振之间的差异。<br /><br />总结: 该研究使用离散偶极近似计算了不同凸形状粒子的偏振截面，发现一些形状不适合产生所需的偏振，同时发现颗粒形状的不确定性不能解释观测结果。 <div>
Aligned interstellar grains produce polarized extinction (observed at wavelengths from the far-ultraviolet to the mid-infrared) and polarized thermal emission (observed at far-infrared and submm wavelengths). The grains must be quite nonspherical, but the actual shapes are unknown. The relative efficacy for aligned grains to produce polarization at optical versus infrared wavelengths depends on particle shape. The discrete dipole approximation is used to calculate polarization cross sections for 20 different convex shapes, for wavelengths from 0.1 to 100 μm, and grain sizes aeff from 0.05 to 0.3 μm. Spheroids, cylinders, square prisms, and triaxial ellipsoids are considered. Minimum aspect ratios required by the observed starlight polarization are determined. Some shapes can also be ruled out because they provide too little or too much polarization at far-infrared and submm wavelengths. The ratio of 10 μm polarization to integrated optical polarization is almost independent of grain shape, varying by only ±8% among the viable convex shapes; thus, at least for convex grains, uncertainties in grain shape cannot account for the discrepancy between predicted and observed 10 μm polarization toward Cyg OB2-12.

<br /><br />总结: <br />Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam观测了近似2.2的Lyα发射线光度函数；研究报告了Lyα光度函数的最佳拟合Schechter函数参数；通过对样本进行采样并剔除可能引起宇宙方差测量偏差的区域，计算了σg；研究调查了σg与调查体积V之间的关系，并拟合了简单的幂律关系；最后，实测结果与模拟预测比较，发现LAEs的宇宙方差可能大于普通星系的宇宙方差。 <div>
Cosmic variance introduces significant uncertainties into galaxy number density properties when surveying the high-redshift Universe with a small volume. Such uncertainties produce the field-to-field variance σg of galaxy numbers in observational astronomy, which significantly affects the luminosity function (LF) measurement of Lyα emitters (LAEs). For most previous Lyα LF studies, σg is often adopted from predictions by cosmological simulations, but barely confirmed by observations. Measuring cosmic variance requires a huge sample over a large volume, exceeding the capabilities of most astronomical instruments. In this study, we demonstrate an observational approach for measuring the cosmic variance contribution for z ≈ 2.2 Lyα LFs. The LAE candidates are observed using the narrow band and broad band of the Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam in eight independent fields, making the total survey area ≃11.62 deg2 and a comoving volume of ≃8.71 × 106 Mpc3. We report a best-fit Schechter function with parameters α = −1.75 (fixed), {L}_{\mathrm{Ly}\alpha }^{* }={5.95}_{-0.96}^{+1.22}\times {10}^{42} erg s−1, and {\phi }_{\mathrm{Ly}\alpha }^{* }={5.26}_{-1.27}^{+1.65} × 10−4 Mpc−3 for the overall Lyα LFs. After clipping out the regions that may bias the cosmic variance measurements, we calculate σg by sampling LAEs within multiple pointings on the field image. We investigate the relation between σg and survey volume V, and fit a simple power-law {\sigma }_{g}=k\times {\left(\tfrac{V}{{10}^{5}\,{\mathrm{Mpc}}^{3}}\right)}^{\beta }. We find best-fit values of -{1.399}_{-0.156}^{+0.160} for β and {1.249}_{-0.193}^{+0.213} for k. We compare our measurements with predictions from simulations and find that the cosmic variance of LAEs is likely larger than that of general star-forming galaxies.

总结:<br /><br />本研究使用升级版巨型米波射电望远镜（uGMRT）对六颗明亮的脉冲星进行观测，测量了其散射弧特性，包括频率和时间的演变。观测覆盖频率范围从300到750 MHz，能够对频率、曲率、带宽和时间尺度等参数进行更准确的测量和比较。研究发现散射弧的不对称性与曲率存在强相关性，并发现了可能支持某一散射屏幕在一周左右时间内主导信号传播的证据。此外，观测还发现一些脉冲星的散射弧存在明显的曲率不对称性，表明其视线上存在折射现象。对于一些脉冲星还发现了先前研究中出现的多重散射弧和平坦的小弧特征。升级后的GMRT射电望远镜在未来的脉冲星散射研究中展现了良好的潜力。 <div>
We use the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) to measure scintillation arc properties in six bright canonical pulsars with simultaneous dual-frequency coverage. These observations, at frequencies from 300 to 750 MHz, allowed for detailed analysis of arc evolution across frequency and epoch. We perform more robust determinations of frequency dependence for arc curvature, scintillation bandwidth, and scintillation timescale, and comparison between arc curvature and pseudo-curvature than allowed by single-frequency-band-per-epoch measurements, which we find to agree with theory and previous literature. We find a strong correlation between arc asymmetry and arc curvature, which we have replicated using simulations, and attribute to a bias in the Hough transform approach to scintillation arc analysis. Possible evidence for an approximately week-long timescale over which a given scattering screen dominates signal propagation was found by tracking visible scintillation arcs in each epoch in PSR J1136+1551. The inclusion of a 155-minute observation allowed us to resolve the scale of scintillation variations on short timescales, which we find to be directly tied to the amount of interstellar medium sampled over the observation. Some of our pulsars showed either consistent or emerging asymmetries in arc curvature, indicating instances of refraction across their lines of sight. Significant features in various pulsars, such as multiple scintillation arcs in PSR J1136+1551 and flat arclets in PSR J1509+5531, that have been found in previous works, were also detected. The simultaneous multiple-band observing capability of the upgraded GMRT shows excellent promise for future pulsar scintillation work.

The Herschel Gould Belt Survey showed that stars form in dense filaments in nearby molecular clouds. Recent studies suggest that massive filaments are bound by the slow shocks caused by accretion flows onto the filaments. The slow shocks are known to be unstable to corrugation deformation of the shock front. Corrugation instability could convert the accretion flow's ram pressure into turbulent pressure that influences the width of the filament, which, according to theory, determines the self-gravitational fragmentation scale and core mass. In spite of its importance, the effect of slow-shock instability on star-forming filaments has not been investigated. In addition, the linear dispersion relation obtained from ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) analysis shows that the most unstable wavelength of shock corrugation is infinitesimally small. In the scale of dense filaments, the effect of ambipolar diffusion can suppress the instability at small scales. This study investigates the influence of ambipolar diffusion on the instability of the slow shock. We perform two-dimensional MHD simulations to examine the linear growth of the slow-shock instability, considering the effect of ambipolar diffusion. The results demonstrate that the most unstable scale of slow-shock instability is approximately 5 times the length scale of ambipolar diffusion ℓAD calculated using post-shock variables, where ℓAD corresponds to the scale where the magnetic Reynolds number for ambipolar diffusivity is unity.

总结:
太阳辐射提供了估算太阳冠层不同物理参数的独特诊断手段，但在射电波段成像太阳冠层的高动态范围结构十分具有挑战性。MeerKAT射电望远镜在880-1670 MHz频段提供了高保真频谱图像，在与模拟图像的比较中表现出极好的形态相似性。观测结果显示，在约900 MHz以下，MeerKAT可以恢复整个太阳盘的大角度尺度的辐射通量。然而，在更高的频率下，缺失的通量可高达50%，但可以进行估算和修正。MeerKAT的太阳观测有望带来许多新的研究，开启大量未被探索的领域，并为未来的Square Kilometre Array-Mid望远镜的太阳科学研究铺平道路。 <div>
Solar radio emissions provide several unique diagnostics to estimate different physical parameters of the solar corona, which are otherwise simply inaccessible. However, imaging the highly dynamic solar coronal emissions spanning a large range of angular scales at radio wavelengths is extremely challenging. At gigahertz frequencies, MeerKAT radio telescope is possibly globally the best-suited instrument at present for providing high-fidelity spectroscopic snapshot solar images. Here, we present the first published spectroscopic images of the Sun made using the observations with MeerKAT in the 880–1670 MHz band. This work demonstrates the high fidelity of spectroscopic snapshot MeerKAT solar images through a comparison with simulated radio images at MeerKAT frequencies. The observed images show extremely good morphological similarities with the simulated images. Our analysis shows that below ∼900 MHz MeerKAT images can recover essentially the entire flux density from the large angular-scale solar disk. Not surprisingly, at higher frequencies, the missing flux density can be as large as ∼50%. However, it can potentially be estimated and corrected for. We believe once solar observation with MeerKAT is commissioned, it will enable a host of novel studies, open the door to a large unexplored phase space with significant discovery potential, and also pave the way for solar science with the upcoming Square Kilometre Array-Mid telescope, of which MeerKAT is a precursor.

<div> 边缘-on原行星盘，James Webb Space Telescope（JWST），IRAS40302+2247，反射星云，内倾区域

总结：<br /><br /> 这篇文章介绍了对IRAS40302+2247嵌入式年轻恒星周围边缘-on原行星盘的James Webb Space Telescope（JWST）成像结果。研究发现，源结构显示两个由暗区隔开的反射星云。源范围由∼4.4微米和较短波长处的扩展丝状包层主导，在7.7微米和更长波长时过渡到来自盘本身的更紧凑的散射光束。暗区厚度随波长变化不显著，这表明盘的上层存在中等大小（∼10微米）的颗粒。研究发现，IRAS40302最亮的星云在12.8和21微米之间切换。文章还探讨了内部倾斜区域对边缘-on盘的一般外观的影响，并发现包括内倾斜区域的盘的辐射传递模型可以再现最亮星云的倒转。此外，模型预测了特定方向的强烈侧向不对称性。观察到的许多边缘-on原行星盘显示出这种侧向不对称性，这表明大部分原行星盘可能存在内倾区域。星际斑点也可能引起侧向不对称性，但这种不对称性的预期变化周期明显较短。变化性研究可以帮助我们测试这些不对称性起源的主要情景。 <div>
We present James Webb Space Telescope imaging from 2 to 21 μm of the edge-on protoplanetary disk around the embedded young star IRAS04302+2247. The structure of the source shows two reflection nebulae separated by a dark lane. The source extent is dominated by the extended filamentary envelope at ∼4.4 μm and shorter wavelengths, transitioning at 7.7 μm and longer wavelengths to more compact lobes of scattered light from the disk itself. The dark lane thickness does not vary significantly with wavelength, which we interpret as an indication for intermediate-sized (∼10 μm) grains in the upper layers of the disk. Intriguingly, we find that the brightest nebula of IRAS40302 switches side between 12.8 and 21 μm. We explore the effect of a tilted inner region on the general appearance of edge-on disks. We find that radiative transfer models of a disk including a tilted inner region can reproduce an inversion in the brightest nebula. In addition, for specific orientations, the model predicts strong lateral asymmetries, which can occur for more than half possible viewing azimuths. A large number of edge-on protoplanetary disks observed in scattered light show such lateral asymmetries (15/20), which suggests that a large fraction of protoplanetary disks might host a tilted inner region. Stellar spots may also induce lateral asymmetries, which are expected to vary over a significantly shorter timescale. Variability studies of edge-on disks would allow us to test the dominant scenario for the origin of these asymmetries.

总结:<br />
这篇文章研究了小型高速云的金属含量，发现这些云的氧金属含量均≤0.17 Z⊙，因此不可能源自银河系的盘。其中有两个云的金属含量与麦哲伦星流相似，表明它们是麦哲伦星系的碎片。另外三个云的金属含量较低，可能是气态小暗物质晕或受到拉伸相互作用的矮星系的气体剥离。这些结果表明，小型高速云不一定都存在于银河系内部晕或麦哲伦星系，而可能追踪更远的结构。 <div>
High-velocity clouds (HVCs) are multiphase gas structures whose velocities (∣vLSR∣ ≥ 100 km s−1) are too high to be explained by Galactic disk rotation. While large HVCs are well characterized, compact and small HVCs (with H i angular sizes of a few degrees) are poorly understood. Possible origins for such small clouds include Milky Way (MW) halo gas or fragments of the Magellanic System, but neither their origin nor their connection to the MW halo has been confirmed. We use new Hubble Space Telescope/Cosmic Origins Spectrograph UV spectra and Green Bank Telescope H i spectra to measure the metallicities of five small HVCs in the southern Galactic sky projected near the Magellanic System. We build a set of distance-dependent Cloudy photoionization models for each cloud and calculate their ionization-corrected metallicities. All five small HVCs have oxygen metallicities ≤0.17 Z⊙, indicating they do not originate in the disk of the MW. Two of the five have metallicities of 0.16–0.17 Z⊙, similar to the Magellanic Stream, suggesting these clouds are fragments of the Magellanic System. The remaining three clouds have much lower metallicities of 0.02–0.04 Z⊙. While the origin of these low-metallicity clouds is unclear, they could be gaseous minihalos or gas stripped from dwarf galaxies by ram pressure or tidal interactions. These results suggest that small HVCs do not all reside in the inner MW halo or the Magellanic System, but instead can trace more distant structures.

<div> Ursa Major III, UNIONS 1, Milky Way, satellite, spectroscopy
总结:
通过UNIONS调查发现了银河系中亮度最低的卫星Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1，其被估计具有+2.2 mag的绝对V带星等，相当于总星体质量约16M⊙。经过Keck II/DEIMOS随访光谱学确认了其存在，并识别出了11个径向速度成员，其中8个有Gaia的完整天文测量数据，并根据它们的 proper motions 确定了它们的共同运动。根据这11个径向速度成员，我们得出了一个固有速度离散度约为3.7 km s−1，但一些注意事项目前阻碍了这个值被解释为潜在重力势。 Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1 的存在可能被二元星体膨胀了这个测量值，因此认为它是一个进行多次观测的高优先级候选目标，以了解这个非常微弱卫星的真实性质。 <div>
We present the discovery of Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1, the least luminous known satellite of the Milky Way, which is estimated to have an absolute V-band magnitude of +{2.2}_{-0.3}^{+0.4} mag, equivalent to a total stellar mass of {16}_{-5}^{+6}M⊙. Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1 was uncovered in the deep, wide-field Ultraviolet Near Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS) and is consistent with an old (τ &gt; 11 Gyr), metal-poor ([Fe/H] ∼ −2.2) stellar population at a heliocentric distance of ∼10 kpc. Despite its being compact (rh = 3 ± 1 pc) and composed of few stars, we confirm the reality of Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1 with Keck II/DEIMOS follow-up spectroscopy and identify 11 radial velocity members, eight of which have full astrometric data from Gaia and are co-moving based on their proper motions. Based on these 11 radial velocity members, we derive an intrinsic velocity dispersion of {3.7}_{-1.0}^{+1.4} km s−1 but some caveats preclude this value from being interpreted as a direct indicator of the underlying gravitational potential at this time. Primarily, the exclusion of the largest velocity outlier from the member list drops the velocity dispersion to {1.9}_{-1.1}^{+1.4} km s−1, and the subsequent removal of an additional outlier star produces an unresolved velocity dispersion. While the presence of binary stars may be inflating the measurement, the possibility of a significant velocity dispersion makes Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1 a high-priority candidate for multi-epoch spectroscopic follow-ups to deduce the true nature of this incredibly faint satellite.

<div> 太阳耀斑，M类和X类，射电爆发，多点定位，统计分析
<br /><br />在本研究中，我们使用四颗太空探测器的数据对太阳耀斑和射电爆发进行了综合研究。我们介绍和验证了两种用于定位射电爆发的方法，并通过分析单个射电爆发事件的结果，并将其与传统的射电三角定位技术进行比较，证明了这些方法的有效性。此外，我们对2020年至2022年间与M级和X级太阳耀斑相关的17次射电爆发进行了统计研究。我们的研究结果表明，太阳耀斑的强度与经度可能存在相关性，东边缘耀斑往往比西边缘耀斑要弱。我们还观察到射电爆发经度出现向东的系统漂移，这可能与局部密度梯度的向极性分量有关。我们的研究结果强调了太阳耀斑强度与射电爆发特性之间的强相关性，加深了我们对太阳耀斑和射电爆发之间关系的理解。
<br /><br />总结: 太阳耀斑和射电爆发的关联关系进行了综合研究，提出并验证了两种射电爆发定位方法，对17次射电爆发进行了统计分析，发现太阳耀斑的强度和经度可能存在相关性，以及射电爆发经度出现向东的系统漂移。这些研究结果提升了我们对太阳活动过程的理解。 <div>
We present a comprehensive study of type III radio bursts and their association with solar flares of magnitude M1.0 and larger, as observed by four widely separated spacecraft (Parker Solar Probe, Solar Orbiter, STEREO-A, and Wind). Our main focus is the introduction and validation of two methods for localizing radio bursts using the available multispacecraft data. The first method utilizes intensity fitting with a circular Gaussian distribution, while the second method is based on the time arrival of radio bursts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods through the analysis of a single type III burst event and compare their results with the traditional radio triangulation technique. Furthermore, we conduct a statistical study of 17 type III bursts associated with M- and X-class solar flares in years 2020–2022. Our findings suggest a possible correlation between solar flare intensities and longitudes, with east limb flares tending to be weaker than west limb flares. We also observe a systematic drift of radio burst longitudes toward the east, potentially explained by a poleward component of the local density gradient. Our results suggest a strong correlation between solar flare intensities and radio burst properties, enhancing our understanding of the relationship between solar flares and type III radio bursts.

<div> GRAPES-3, mid-altitude, near-equatorial, cosmic-ray observations, small-scale angular-scale anisotropies
<br />总结:
GRAPES-3 是一个位于中纬度（2200米）和赤道附近（纬度11.°4N）的空气阵列，与北半球和南半球的实验重叠，用于观测宇宙射线。该研究分析了2013年1月1日至2016年12月31日期间GRAPES-3实验收集的37亿个宇宙射线事件样本，其中能量中值约为16TeV，用于研究小尺度（<60°）角尺度各向异性。研究发现了两个结构A和B，它们与预期的宇宙射线各向同性分布存在显著偏差。这些结果与Milagro、ARGO-YBJ和HAWC的观测结果一致。这些观测结果有望更好地理解宇宙射线的来源、传播以及银河系中的磁结构。 <div>
GRAPES-3 is a mid-altitude (2200 m) and near-equatorial (11.°4N) air shower array, overlapping in its field of view for cosmic-ray observations with experiments that are located in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. We analyze a sample of 3.7 × 109 cosmic-ray events collected by the GRAPES-3 experiment between 2013 January 1 and 2016 December 31 with a median energy of ∼16 TeV for study of small-scale (&lt;60°) angular-scale anisotropies. We observed two structures, labeled A and B, that deviate from the expected isotropic distribution of cosmic rays in a statistically significant manner. Structure A spans 50°–80° in R.A. and from −15° to 30° in decl. The relative excess observed in structure A is at the level of (6.5 ± 1.3) × 10−4 with a statistical significance of 6.8 standard deviations. Structure B is observed in the R.A. range 110°–140° and at decl. from −10° to 30°. The relative excess observed in this region is at the level of (4.9 ± 1.4) × 10−4 with a statistical significance of 4.7 standard deviations. These structures are consistent with those reported by Milagro, ARGO-YBJ, and HAWC. These observations could provide a better understanding of the sources of cosmic rays, their propagation, and the magnetic structures in our Galaxy.

<title>An Updated Mass–Radius Analysis of the 2017–2018 NICER Data Set of PSR J0030+0451</title>

<div> PSR J0030+0451, NICER, mass, radius, XMM-Newton
<br />
通过NICER观测，第一次推断出PSR J0030+0451的质量和半径，并对描述密集物质的状态方程进行了限制。使用升级后的分析框架重新分析了NICER数据，并结合XMM-Newton数据进行了联合分析，发现了后验面的多模结构。包括XMM-Newton数据的约束排除了先前发现的主要解决方案，而是支持了新的和更复杂的模型。这些模型显示出推断出的质量和半径取决于所假定的模型，并指向了温度梯度的存在和需要考虑这一点。得出的推断质量和半径分别为∼[1.4 M⊙, 11.5 km]和∼[1.7 M⊙, 14.5 km]。这些发现是对先前研究的拓展，并且对于理解PSR J0030+0451的物理性质非常重要。
<br /><br />总结: PSR J0030+0451的质量和半径在1.4-1.7M⊙和11.5-14.5km之间，新的分析方法揭示了质量和半径的多模结构，需要考虑温度梯度的存在。 <div>
In 2019 the NICER collaboration published the first mass and radius inferred for PSR J0030+0451, thanks to NICER observations, and consequent constraints on the equation of state characterizing dense matter. Two independent analyses found a mass of ∼1.3–1.4 M⊙ and a radius of ∼13  km. They also both found that the hot spots were all located on the same hemisphere, opposite to the observer, and that at least one of them had a significantly elongated shape. Here we reanalyze, in greater detail, the same NICER data set, incorporating the effects of an updated NICER response matrix and using an upgraded analysis framework. We expand the adopted models and also jointly analyze XMM-Newton data, which enables us to better constrain the fraction of observed counts coming from PSR J0030+0451. Adopting the same models used in previous publications, we find consistent results, although with more stringent inference requirements. We also find a multimodal structure in the posterior surface. This becomes crucial when XMM-Newton data is accounted for. Including the corresponding constraints disfavors the main solutions found previously, in favor of the new and more complex models. These have inferred masses and radii of ∼[1.4 M⊙, 11.5 km] and ∼[1.7 M⊙, 14.5 km], depending on the assumed model. They display configurations that do not require the two hot spots generating the observed X-rays to be on the same hemisphere, nor to show very elongated features, and point instead to the presence of temperature gradients and the need to account for them.

<title>The Dependence of the Structure of Planet-opened Gaps in Protoplanetary Disks on Radiative Cooling</title>

<div> 关键词: density waves, protoplanetary disks, cooling timescale, gap depth, thermal relaxation timescale

在这篇文章中，研究了行星对原行星盘中密度波的影响，以及行星如何打开环形气体间隙。研究发现，间隙的深度受到了密度波带来的角动量演化的影响。文章使用Athena++模拟了盘行星相互作用的过程，并将冷却过程视为热力学松弛过程。研究建立了间隙深度和宽度与行星质量、Shakura-Sunyaev粘度、盘高度和热松弛时间尺度的定量关系。研究还发现，当热松弛时间尺度与局部动力学时间尺度相同时，间隙打开最弱。不同的热松弛时间尺度会导致间隙深度显著变化。研究还推导了AS 209、HD 163296、MWC 480和HL Tau中间隙打开行星的可能质量，考虑到局部热松弛时间尺度的不确定性。

<br /><br />总结:
本文研究了行星对原行星盘中密度波和间隙的影响，建立了间隙深度和宽度与多个因素的定量关系，并推导了几个具体天体中间隙打开行星的可能质量。 <div>
Planets can excite density waves and open annular gas gaps in protoplanetary disks. The depth of gaps is influenced by the evolving angular momentum carried by density waves. While the impact of radiative cooling on the evolution of density waves has been studied, a quantitative correlation to connect gap depth with the cooling timescale is lacking. To address this knowledge gap, we employ the grid-based code Athena++ to simulate disk-planet interactions, treating cooling as a thermal relaxation process. We establish quantitative dependencies of steady-state gap depth (Equation 36) and width (Equation 41) on planetary mass, Shakura–Sunyaev viscosity, disk scale height, and thermal relaxation timescale (β). We confirm previous results that gap opening is the weakest when the thermal relaxation timescale is comparable to the local dynamical timescale. Significant variations in gap depth, up to an order of magnitude, are found with different β. In terms of width, a gap is at its narrowest around β = 1, approximately 10%–20% narrower compared to the isothermal case. When β ∼ 100, it can be ∼20% wider, and higher viscosity enhances this effect. We derive possible masses of the gas gap-opening planets in AS 209, HD 163296, MWC 480, and HL Tau, accounting for the uncertainties in the local thermal relaxation timescale.

总结: <br />
这篇文章讨论了如何从外行星的宿主恒星中提取信息以研究外行星的星球水平趋势。通过提取加州Kepler调查Gaia调查光谱中的铬层活动测量值，研究人员得出了恒星活动和基本恒星性质之间的联系。他们发现了一些恒星自转周期的差异，并支持了恒星磁制动减弱的理论。此外，他们还发现了铬层活动与金属丰度之间的关系，并且能够识别可能处于莫德林极小状态的恒星。这些结果对未来的理论研究提供了重要信息，可以探讨恒星活动、恒星自转和磁力发电机之间的关系。<br /> <div>
Surveys of exoplanet host stars are valuable tools for assessing population level trends in exoplanets, and their outputs can include stellar ages, activity, and rotation periods. We extracted chromospheric activity measurements from the California-Kepler Survey Gaia survey spectra in order to probe connections between stellar activity and fundamental stellar properties. Building on the California Kepler Survey's legacy of 1189 planet host star stellar properties including temperature, surface gravity metallicity, and isochronal age, we add measurements of the Ca ii H and K lines as a proxy for chromospheric activity for 879 planet hosting stars. We used these chromospheric activity measurements to derive stellar rotation periods. We find a discrepancy between photometrically derived and activity-derived rotation periods for stars on the Rossby Ridge. These results support the theory of weakened magnetic braking. We find no evidence for metallicity-dependent activity relations, within the metallicity range of −0.2 to +0.3 dex. With our single epoch spectra we identify stars that are potentially in Maunder minimum–like state using a combination of log({R}_{\mathrm{HK}}^{{\prime} }) and position below the main sequence. We do not yet have the multiyear time series needed to verify stars in Maunder minimum–like states. These results can help inform future theoretical studies that explore the relationship between stellar activity, stellar rotation, and magnetic dynamos.

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory has been continuously taking data to search for { \mathcal O }(0.5\mbox{--}10) s long neutrino bursts since 2007. Even if a Galactic core-collapse supernova is optically obscured or collapses to a black hole instead of exploding, it will be detectable via the { \mathcal O }(10) MeV neutrino burst emitted during the collapse. We discuss a search for such events covering the time between 2008 April 17 and 2019 December 31. Considering the average data taking and analysis uptime of 91.7% after all selection cuts, this is equivalent to 10.735 yr of continuous data taking. In order to test the most conservative neutrino production scenario, the selection cuts were optimized for a model based on an 8.8 solar mass progenitor collapsing to an O–Ne–Mg core. Conservative assumptions on the effects of neutrino oscillations in the exploding star were made. The final selection cut was set to ensure that the probability to detect such a supernova within the Milky Way exceeds 99%. No such neutrino burst was found in the data after performing a blind analysis. Hence, a 90% C.L. upper limit on the rate of core-collapse supernovae out to distances of ≈25 kpc was determined to be 0.23 yr−1. For the more distant Magellanic Clouds, only high neutrino luminosity supernovae will be detectable by IceCube, unless external information on the burst time is available. We determined a model-independent limit by parameterizing the dependence on the neutrino luminosity and the energy spectrum.

总结:
本文使用Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam对约3300个Lyα辐射体(LAEs)进行堆叠观测，鉴定了一个z=2.2-2.3的Lyα晕(LAH)。通过分光观测和数据处理，确定样本的污染率较低(8%)。利用中值堆叠方法，发现LAH在2σ显著水平下延伸至约100kpc，在表面亮度水平约为10-20 erg s-1 cm-2 arcsec-2时可能延伸至约200kpc。比较不同的红移、领域和选择方法，发现本文的LAH在约25-100kpc半径范围内更亮。进一步分析表明，更高的Lyα发射光度、较小的等效宽度和更亮的UV星等会导致更广泛的LAH。结果表明，质量更大的LAEs通常拥有更广泛的LAHs。 <div>
In this paper, we present a Lyα halo (LAH) identified by stacking ∼3300 Lyα emitters (LAEs) at z = 2.2–2.3. We carry out imaging observations and data reduction with Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam. Our total survey area is ∼12 deg2 and the imaging depths are 25.5–27.0 mag. Using the imaging data, we select 1240 and 2101 LAE candidates at z = 2.2 and 2.3, respectively. We carry out spectroscopic observations of our LAE candidates and data reduction with Magellan/IMACS to estimate the contamination rate of our LAE candidates. We find that the contamination rate of our sample is low (8%). We stack our LAE candidates with a median stacking method to identify the LAH at z = 2. We show that our LAH is detected until ∼100 kpc at the 2σ significance level and likely extended to ∼200 kpc at a surface brightness level of ∼10−20 erg s−1 cm−2 arcsec−2. Compared to those of previous studies, our LAH is brighter at radii of ∼25–100 kpc, which is not likely caused by the contamination in our sample but by the different redshifts, fields, and selection methods instead. To investigate how central galaxies affect surrounding LAHs, we divide our LAEs into subsamples based on the Lyα luminosity (LLyα), rest-frame Lyα equivalent width (EW0), and UV magnitude (Muv). We stack the subsamples and find that higher LLyα, smaller EW0, and brighter Muv cause more extended halos. Our results suggest that more massive LAEs generally have more extended LAHs.

HDF850.1 is the brightest submillimeter galaxy (SMG) in the Hubble Deep Field. It is known as a heavily dust-obscured star-forming galaxy embedded in an overdense environment at z = 5.18. With nine-band NIRCam images at 0.8–5.0 μm obtained through the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey, we detect and resolve the rest-frame UV–optical counterpart of HDF850.1, which splits into two components because of heavy dust obscuration in the center. The southern component leaks UV and Hα photons, bringing the galaxy ∼100  times above the empirical relation between infrared excess and UV continuum slope (IRX–βUV). The northern component is higher in dust attenuation and thus fainter in UV and Hα surface brightness. We construct a spatially resolved dust-attenuation map from the NIRCam images, well matched with the dust continuum emission obtained through millimeter interferometry. The whole system hosts a stellar mass of 1010.8±0.1M⊙ and star formation rate (SFR) of 102.8±0.2M⊙ yr−1, placing the galaxy at the massive end of the star-forming main sequence at this epoch. We further confirm that HDF850.1 resides in a complex overdense environment at z = 5.17–5.30, which hosts another luminous SMG at z = 5.30 (GN10). The filamentary structures of the overdensity are characterized by 109 Hα-emitting galaxies confirmed through NIRCam slitless spectroscopy at 3.9–5 μm, of which only eight were known before the JWST observations. Given the existence of a similar galaxy overdensity in the GOODS-S field, our results suggest that 50% ± 20% of the cosmic star formation at z = 5.1–5.5 occur in protocluster environments.

The discovery and timing follow up of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are necessary not just for their usefulness in pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) but also for investigating their own intriguing properties. In this work, we provide the findings of the decade-long timing of four MSPs discovered by the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT), including their timing precision, model parameters, and newly detected proper motions. We compare the timing results for these MSPs before and after the GMRT upgrade in 2017 and characterize the improvement in timing precision due to the bandwidth upgrade. We discuss the suitability of these four GMRT MSPs as well as the usefulness of the decade-long timing data for PTA experiments. These data may aid in the global effort to improve the signal-to-noise ratios of recently detected signature of gravitational waves in cross-correlation statistics of residuals of MSPs.

<div> 星系、恒星质量、光谱能量分布、星形成史、宇宙早期<br />
总结:<br />
本研究表明，在大爆炸后的头十亿年内形成的星系的恒星质量推断存在根本的不确定性，这是由于星系综合光谱中来自早期星形成的信息丢失。尽管早期星形成对高红移系统的总恒星质量贡献很大，但在探测时期的持续星形成会盖过早期爆发的残留光，导致恒星质量的准确测定受到影响。因此，在恒星质量上可以预期存在数量级的不确定性。通过在宇宙背景下进行宇宙学模拟，我们证明了这一潜在问题。具体来说，我们进行了两种具有显著不同恒星反馈模型的宇宙学模拟，这些模型涵盖了星形成史爆发程度的显著范围。我们通过三维尘埃辐射传输计算模拟了这些模型星系在z=7时的模拟光谱，然后使用prospector光谱拟合软件对这些光谱进行了反向拟合。我们发现了z>7星系推导的恒星质量的不确定性，这促使我们发展新的技术和/或先验知识来模拟早期宇宙中的星形成史。 <div>
We demonstrate that the inference of galaxy stellar masses via spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting techniques for galaxies formed in the first billion years after the Big Bang carries fundamental uncertainties owing to the loss of star formation history (SFH) information from the very first episodes of star formation in the integrated spectra of galaxies. While this early star formation can contribute substantially to the total stellar mass of high-redshift systems, ongoing star formation at the time of detection outshines the residual light from earlier bursts, hampering the determination of accurate stellar masses. As a result, order-of-magnitude uncertainties in stellar masses can be expected. We demonstrate this potential problem via direct numerical simulation of galaxy formation in a cosmological context. In detail, we carry out two cosmological simulations with significantly different stellar feedback models, which span a significant range in SFH burstiness. We compute the mock SEDs for these model galaxies at z = 7 via calculations of 3D dust radiative transfer, and then backward fit these SEDs with prospector SED fitting software. The uncertainties in derived stellar masses that we find for z &gt; 7 galaxies motivate the development of new techniques and/or priors for SFH to model star formation in the early Universe.

<div> 关键词: Galactic conformity, DESI One-Percent Survey, SHAM method, ELG clustering, redshift space<br />
总结:<br />
研究发现了星系一致性现象，即具有特定物理特性的星系与相邻星系具有相关性，暗示可能存在因果关系。采用原始亚哈洛匹配方法，提出了简明的一致性模型，改善了ELG和暗物质晕的连接关系。模型表明，在中心星系是ELG的暗物质晕中，卫星ELG的数量将提高约5倍。通过该模型，可以准确描述ELG在整个红移范围内的聚类现象。预期该方法可用于生成适用于DESI的高质量ELG光锥模拟。 <div>
Galactic conformity is the phenomenon whereby a galaxy of a certain physical property is correlated with its neighbors of the same property, implying a possible causal relationship. The observed auto correlations of emission-line galaxies (ELGs) from the highly complete DESI One-Percent Survey exhibit a strong clustering signal on small scales, providing clear evidence for the conformity effect of ELGs. Building upon the original subhalo abundance-matching (SHAM) method developed by Gao et al., we propose a concise conformity model to improve the ELG–halo connection. In this model, the number of satellite ELGs is boosted by a factor of ∼5 in the halos whose central galaxies are ELGs. We show that the mean ELG satellite number in such central halos is still smaller than 1 and that the model does not significantly increase the overall satellite fraction. With this model, we can well recover the ELG auto correlations to the smallest scales explored with the current data (i.e., rp &gt; 0.03 Mpc h−1 in real space and at s &gt; 0.3 Mpc h−1 in redshift space), while the cross correlations between luminous red galaxies and ELGs are nearly unchanged. Although our SHAM model has only eight parameters, we further verify that it can accurately describe the ELG clustering in the entire redshift range from z = 0.8 to 1.6. We therefore expect that this method can be used to generate high-quality ELG lightcone mocks for DESI.

<div> 太阳风，水星，磁流体力学，鞘震，观测数据
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章主要探讨了太阳风对水星鞘震的影响。研究发现，由于水星靠近太阳，太阳风的快模马赫数较低，导致水星的鞘震可能会消失。观测分析表明，快模马赫数较低的太阳风事件通常发生在太阳活动周期的上升和最大阶段，大约35%的事件发生在日冕物质抛射的主体内，约58%的事件与日冕物质抛射无关。理论和数值模拟结果显示，当水星遭遇快模马赫数≤1.5的太阳风时，其鞘震会变得更远、更扁平甚至消失。此外，计算表明，水星的鞘震在极端太阳风条件下可能变成一个具有向上凸起结构的慢模冲击波。 <div>
In the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) perspective, the planet’s bow shock would disappear when the fast-mode Mach number (MF) of the solar wind is less than one. Compared to Earth, Mercury is subject to a lower MF solar wind due to its proximity to the Sun, resulting in a higher possibility of the disappearance of its bow shock. To examine the variability of Mercury’s bow shock in response to the solar wind properties, analyses of the observations by the Helios spacecraft at 0.30–0.50 au during 1975–1983, covering solar cycle 21, together with the theoretical solutions and MHD simulations are conducted in this study. Our observational analyses show that more solar wind data with extremely low fast-mode Mach numbers (say, MF ≤ 1.5) are observed during the rising and maximum phases and are characterized by a significantly low proton number density. It is also found that approximately 35% of the extremely low fast-mode Mach number solar wind events (MF ≤ 1.5) occur within the main body of interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs), while about 58% of them are unrelated to ICMEs. Three of these events are selected to demonstrate that the occurrences of the solar wind with MF ≤ 1.5 may not be necessarily affected by ICMEs. Our theoretical and numerical results indicate that when Mercury encounters the solar wind with MF ≤ 1.5, its bow shock would move farther away, become flattened, and even disappear. Furthermore, our calculations suggest that Mercury’s bow shock would become a slow-mode shock with a concave-upward structure under such extreme solar wind conditions.

<title>A Direct Comparison between the Use of Double Gray and Multiwavelength Radiative Transfer in a General Circulation Model with and without Radiatively Active Clouds</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Inhomogeneous cloud formation and wavelength-dependent phenomena are expected to shape hot Jupiter atmospheres. We present a general circulation model with multiwavelength “picket fence” radiative transfer and radiatively active, temperature-dependent clouds, and compare the results to those of a double gray routine. The double gray method inherently fails to model polychromatic effects in hot Jupiter atmospheres, while picket fence captures these non-gray aspects and performs well compared to fully wavelength-dependent methods. We compare both methods with radiatively active clouds and cloud-free models, assessing the limitations of the double gray method. Although there are broad similarities, the picket fence models have larger dayside–nightside temperature differences, nonisothermal upper atmospheres, and multiwavelength effects in the presence of radiatively active clouds. We model the well-known hot Jupiters HD 189733 b and HD 209458 b. For the hotter HD 209458 b, the picket fence method prevents clouds from thermostating dayside temperatures, resulting in hotter upper atmospheres and the dissipation of dayside clouds. Differences in the temperature structures are then associated with nuanced differences in the circulation patterns and clouds. Models of the cooler HD 189733 b have global cloud coverage, regardless of the radiative transfer scheme, whereas there are larger differences in the models of HD 209458 b, particularly in the extent of the partial cloud coverage on its dayside. This results in minor changes to the thermal and reflected light phase curves of HD 189733 b, but more significant differences for the picket fence and double gray versions of HD 209458 b.

<title>Unobscured Central Broad-line Regions in Type-1.9 AGN SDSS J1241+2602</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Strong evidence is reported to support unobscured broad-line regions (BLRs) in Type-1.9 active galactic nucleus (AGN) SDSS J1241+2602 with reliable broad Hα but no broad Hβ. Commonly, the disappearance of broad Hβ can be explained by the AGN unified model, in which heavily obscured BLRs are expected in Type-1.9 AGNs. Here, based on properties of two kinds of BH masses, the virial BH mass and the BH mass obtained through the MBH–σ relation, an independent method is proposed to test whether there are unobscured central BLRs in a Type-1.9 AGN. By the reliable measurement of stellar velocity dispersion of about 110 ± 12 km s −1 through the host galaxy absorption features in SDSS J1241+2602, the BH mass obtained through the MBH–σ relation is consistent with the virial BH mass (3.43 ± 1.25) × 107 M⊙ determined through properties of the observed broad Hα without considering the effects of obscurations in SDSS J1241+2602. Meanwhile, if considering heavily obscured BLRs in SDSS J1241+2602, the reddening-corrected virial BH mass is tens of times larger than the value expected from MBH–σ, leading SDSS J1241+2602 to be an outlier in the MBH–σ space with a confidence level higher than 5σ. Therefore, unobscured BLRs are preferred in the Type-1.9 AGN SDSS J1241+2602. The results indicate that it is necessary to check whether unobscured central BLRs are common in Type-1.9 AGNs when testing the unified model of AGNs through properties of Type-1.9 AGNs.

<title>A Machine Learning Approach to Understanding the Physical Properties of Magnetic Flux Ropes in the Solar Wind at 1 au</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Interplanetary magnetic flux ropes (MFRs) are commonly observed structures in the solar wind, categorized as magnetic clouds (MCs) and small-scale MFRs (SMFRs) depending on whether they are associated with coronal mass ejections. We apply machine learning to systematically compare SMFRs, MCs, and ambient solar wind plasma properties. We construct a data set of 3-minute averaged sequential data points of the solar wind’s instantaneous bulk fluid plasma properties using about 20 years of measurements from Wind. We label samples by the presence and type of MFRs containing them using a catalog based on Grad–Shafranov (GS) automated detection for SMFRs and NASA's catalog for MCs (with samples in neither labeled non-MFRs). We apply the random forest machine learning algorithm to find which categories can be more easily distinguished and by what features. MCs were distinguished from non-MFRs with an area under the receiver-operator curve (AUC) of 94% and SMFRs with an AUC of 89%, and had distinctive plasma properties. In contrast, while SMFRs were distinguished from non-MFRs with an AUC of 86%, this appears to rely solely on the 〈B〉 &gt; 5 nT threshold applied by the GS catalog. The results indicate that SMFRs have virtually the same plasma properties as the ambient solar wind, unlike the distinct plasma regimes of MCs. We interpret our findings as additional evidence that most SMFRs at 1 au are generated within the solar wind. We also suggest that they should be considered a salient feature of the solar wind’s magnetic structure rather than transient events.

<title>The Diffusion and Scattering of Accelerating Particles in Compressible MHD Turbulence</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We numerically study the diffusion and scattering of cosmic rays (CRs) together with their acceleration processes in the framework of the modern understanding of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. Based on the properties of compressible MHD turbulence obtained from observations and numerical experiments, we investigate the interaction of CRs with plasma modes. We find that (1) the gyroradius of particles exponentially increases with the acceleration timescale; (2) the momentum diffusion presents the power-law relationship with the gyroradius in the strong turbulence regime, and shows a plateau in the weak turbulence regime implying a stochastic acceleration process; (3) the spatial diffusion is dominated by the parallel diffusion in the sub-Alfvénic regime, while it is dominated by the perpendicular diffusion in the super-Alfvénic one; (4) as for the interaction of CRs with plasma modes, the particle acceleration is dominated by the fast mode in the high β case, while in the low β case, it is dominated by the fast and slow modes; and (5) in the presence of acceleration, magnetosonic modes still play a critical role in the diffusion and scattering processes of CRs, which is in good agreement with earlier theoretical predictions.

<title>Using Potential Field Extrapolations to Explore the Origin of Type II Spicules</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We used 29 high-resolution line-of-sight magnetograms acquired with the Goode Solar Telescope (GST) in a quiet-Sun area to extrapolate a series of potential field configurations and study their time variations. The study showed that there are regions that consistently exhibit changes in loop connectivity, whereas other vast areas do not show such changes. Analysis of the topological features of the potential fields indicates that the photospheric footprint of the separatrix between open- and closed-loop systems closely matches the roots of rapid blue- and redshifted excursions, which are disk counterparts of type II spicules. There is a tendency for the footpoints of the observed Hα features to be cospatial with the footpoints of the loops that most frequently change their connectivity, while the area occupied by the open fields that did not show any significant and persistent connectivity changes is void of prominent jet and spicular activity. We also detected and tracked magnetic elements using the Southwest Automatic Magnetic Identification Suite and GST magnetograms, which allowed us to construct artificial magnetograms and calculate the corresponding potential field configurations. Analysis of the artificial data showed tendencies similar to those found for the observed data. The present study suggests that a significant amount of chromospheric activity observed in the far wings of the Hα spectral line may be generated by reconnecting closed-loop systems and canopy fields consisting of “open” field lines.

<title>Simulating Hydrogen-poor Interaction-powered Supernovae with CHIPS</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the updated open-source code Complete History of Interaction-Powered Supernovae (CHIPS) that can be applied to modeling supernovae (SNe) arising from an interaction with the massive circumstellar medium (CSM) as well as the formation process of the CSM. Our update mainly concerns extensions to hydrogen-poor SNe from stripped progenitors, targeting the modeling of interaction-powered SNe Ibc, such as Type Ibn and Icn SNe. We successfully reproduce the basic properties of the light curves of these types of SNe that occur after the partial eruption of the outermost layer with a mass of 0.01–0.1 M⊙ at ≲1 year before explosion. We also find that the luminosity of the observed precursors can be naturally explained by the outburst that creates the dense CSM, given that the energy of the outburst is efficiently dissipated by collision with an external material, possibly generated by a previous mass eruption. We discuss possible scenarios causing eruptive mass loss based on our results.

<title>Apparent Effect of Dust Extinction on the Observed Outflow Velocity of Ionized Gas in Galaxy Mergers</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad0dfc</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad0dfc</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this study, we examine photoionization outflows during the late stages of galaxy mergers, with a specific focus on the relation between the observed velocity of outflowing gas and the apparent effects of dust extinction. We used the N-body/smoothed particle hydrodynamics code ASURA for galaxy merger simulations. These simulations concentrated on identical galaxy mergers featuring supermassive black holes of 108M⊙ and gas fractions of 30% and 10%. From the simulation data, we derived velocity and velocity dispersion diagrams for the active galactic nuclei (AGN)-driven ionized outflowing gas. Our findings show that high-velocity outflows with velocity dispersions of 500 km s−1 or greater can be observed in the late stages of galactic mergers. Particularly, in buried AGNs, both the luminosity-weighted outflow velocity and velocity dispersion increase owing to the apparent effects of dust extinction. Owing to these effects, velocity–velocity dispersion diagrams display a noticeable blue-shifted tilt in models with higher gas fractions. Crucially, this tilt is not influenced by the AGN luminosity but emerges from the observational impacts of dust extinction. Our results imply that the observed high-velocity [O iii] λ5007 outflow exceeding 1000 km s−1 in buried AGNs may be linked to the dust extinction that occurs during the late stages of gas-rich galaxy mergers.

<title>The Extended [C ii] under Construction? Observation of the Brightest High-z Lensed Star-forming Galaxy at z = 6.2</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present results of [C ii] 158 μm emission line observations, and report the spectroscopic redshift confirmation of a strongly lensed (μ ∼ 20) star-forming galaxy, MACS0308-zD1 at z = 6.2078 ± 0.0002. The [C ii] emission line is detected with a signal-to-noise ratio &gt;6 within the rest-frame UV-bright clump of the lensed galaxy (zD1.1) and exhibits multiple velocity components; the narrow [C ii] has a velocity full width half maximum (FWHM) of 110 ± 20 km s−1, while broader [C ii] is seen with an FWHM of 230 ± 50 km s−1. The broader [C ii] component is blueshifted (−80 ± 20 km s−1) with respect to the narrow [C ii] component, and has a morphology that extends beyond the UV-bright clump. We find that, while the narrow [C ii] emission is most likely associated with zD1.1, the broader component is possibly associated with a physically distinct gas component from zD1.1 (e.g., outflowing or inflowing gas). Based on the nondetection of λ158μm dust continuum, we find that MACS0308-zD1's star formation activity occurs in a dust-free environment indicated by a strong upper limit of infrared luminosity ≲9 × 108L⊙. Targeting this strongly lensed faint galaxy for follow-up Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and JWST observations will be crucial to characterize the details of typical galaxy growth in the early Universe.

<title>Probing Disk Ice Content and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Emission through Multiband MagAO+Clio Images of HD 141569</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present resolved images of the inner disk component around HD 141569A using the Magellan adaptive optics system with the Clio2 1–5 μm camera, offering a glimpse of a complex system thought to be in a short evolutionary phase between protoplanetary and debris disk stages. We use a reference star along with the Karhunen–Loéve image projection (KLIP) algorithm for point-spread function subtraction to detect the disk inward to about 0.″24 (∼25 au assuming a distance of 111 pc) at high signal-to-noise ratios at L^{\prime} (3.8 μm), Ls (3.3 μm), and narrowband Ice (3.1 μm). We identify an arc or spiral arm structure at the southeast extremity, consistent with previous studies. We implement forward modeling with a simple disk model within the framework of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler to better constrain the geometrical attributes and photometry using our KLIP-reduced disk images. We then leverage these modeling results to facilitate a comparison of the measured brightness in each passband to find a reduction in scattered light from the disk in the Ice filter, implying significant absorption due to water ice in the dust. Additionally, our best-fit disk models exhibit peak brightness in the southwestern, back-scattering region of the disk, which we suggest to be possible evidence of 3.3 μm polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission. However, we point out the need for additional observations with bluer filters and more complex modeling to confirm these hypotheses.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In the epoch of deep photometric surveys, a large number of substructures—e.g., overdensities and streams—have been identified. With the help of astrometry and spectroscopy, the community has revealed a complex picture of our Milky Way (MW) after investigating their origins. The off-plane substructures the Anticenter Stream (ACS) and Monoceros Ring (MNC), once considered as dissolving dwarf galaxies, were later found to share similar kinematics and metallicity with the Galactic outer thin disk. In this work, we aim to chemically tag ACS and MNC with high-accuracy abundances from the APOGEE survey. By extrapolating chemical abundance trends in the outer thin-disk region (10 &lt; RGC &lt; 18 kpc, 0 &lt; ∣ZGC∣ &lt; 3 kpc), we found that ACS and MNC stars show consistent chemical abundances as the extrapolating values for 12 elements, including C, N, O, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Cr, Mn, Co, and Ni. The similar chemical patterns indicate that ACS and MNC have a similar star formation history as the MW outer thin disk, while we also excluded their dwarf galaxy association, as they are distinctive in multiple chemical spaces. The ages of ACS and MNC stars are consistent with the time of the first Sagittarius dSph passage, indicating their possible connection.

<title>Direct Formation of Massive Black Holes via Dynamical Collapse in Metal-enriched Merging Galaxies at z ∼ 10: Fully Cosmological Simulations</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad11cf</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the results of the first fully cosmological hydrodynamical simulations studying the merger-driven model for massive black hole (BH) seed formation via direct collapse. Using the zoom-in technique as well as particle splitting, we achieve a final spatial resolution of 2 pc. We show that the major merger of two massive galaxies at redshift z ∼ 8 results in the formation of a nuclear supermassive disk (SMD) of only 4 pc in radius, owing to a prodigious gas inflow sustained at 100–1000 M⊙ yr−1. The core of the merger remnant is metal-rich, well above solar abundance, and the SMD reaches a gaseous mass of 3 × 108M⊙ in less than a million years after the merger, despite a concurrent prominent nuclear starburst. Dynamical heating as gas falls into the deepest part of the potential well, and heating and stirring by supernova blastwaves, generate a turbulent multiphase interstellar medium, with a gas velocity dispersion exceeding 100 km s−1. As a result, only moderate fragmentation occurs in the inner 10–20 pc, despite the temperature falling below 1000 K. The SMD is Jeans-unstable as well as bar-unstable and will collapse further adiabatically, becoming warm and ionized. We show that the SMD, following inevitable contraction, will become general-relativistic-unstable and directly form a supermassive BH of mass in the range 106–108M⊙, essentially skipping the stage of BH seed formation. These results confirm that mergers between the most massive galaxies at z ∼ 8–10 can naturally explain the rapid emergence of bright high-redshift quasars.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
HD 148937 is a peculiar massive star (Of?p) with a strong magnetic field (1 kG). The hourglass-shaped emission nebula NGC 6164/5 surrounds this star. This nebula is presumed to originate from episodic mass-loss events of the central O-type star, but the detailed formation mechanism is not yet well understood. Grasping its three-dimensional structure is essential to uncovering the origin of this nebula. Here we report the high-resolution multiobject spectroscopic observations of NGC 6164/5 using the GIRAFFE on the 8.2 m Very Large Telescope. Integrated intensity maps constructed from several spectral lines delineate well the overall shape of this nebula, such as the two bright lobes and the inner gas region. The position–velocity diagrams show that the two bright lobes are found to be redshifted and blueshifted, respectively, while the inner region has multiple layers. We consider a geometric model composed of a bilateral outflow harboring nitrogen-enriched knots and expanding inner shells. Its spectral features are then simulated by using a Monte Carlo radiative transfer technique for different sets of velocities. Some position–velocity diagrams from simulations are very similar to the observed ones. According to the model that best reproduces the observational data, the two bright lobes and the nitrogen-enriched knots are moving away from HD 148937 at about 120 km s−1. Their minimum kinematic age is estimated to be about 7500 yr. We discuss possible formation mechanisms of this nebula in the context of binary interaction.

Magnetic reconnection, a fundamental plasma process transforming magnetic field energy into particle energy, is ubiquitous in space and responsible for many explosive phenomena, such as solar flares and gamma-ray bursts. Recent numerical theories have predicted that reconnection fronts far from the primary reconnection region can host secondary reconnection in three-dimensional scenarios, different from the conventional two-dimensional diagram where only one X-line stands to sustain reconnection. In this study, we provide direct observational evidence for ongoing secondary reconnection in the reconnection front via the unprecedentedly high-cadence data from NASA’s MMS mission. The secondary reconnection is identified by the presence of an X-line, a super-Alfvénic electron jet, and nonideal energy dissipation. Different from the primary ion–electron reconnection, the secondary reconnection is electron-only, with its X-line quasi-perpendicular to the primary X-line. Hence reconnection, when evolving from local to global scales, becomes essentially three-dimensional with different patterns developed. These results provide crucial insights into understanding cross-scale energy transport driven by reconnection in space plasmas.

<title>Assessing the Observability of Deep Meridional Flow Cells in the Solar Interior</title>

Meridional circulation regulates the Sun’s interior dynamics and magnetism. While it is well accepted that meridional flows are poleward at the Sun’s surface, helioseismic observations have yet to provide a definitive answer for the depth at which those flows return to the equator, or the number of circulation cells in depth. Here, we explore the observability of multiple circulation cells stacked in radius. Specifically, we examine the seismic signature of several meridional flow profiles by convolving time–distance averaging kernels with mean flows obtained from a suite of 3D hydrodynamic simulations. At mid and high latitudes, we find that weak flow structures in the deep convection zone can be obscured by signals from the much stronger surface flows. This contamination of 1–2 m s−1 is caused by extended side lobes in the averaging kernels, which produce a spurious equatorward signal with flow speeds that are 1 order of magnitude stronger than the original flow speeds in the simulations. At low latitudes, the flows in the deep layers of the simulations are stronger (&gt;2 m s−1) and multiple cells across the convection zone can produce a sufficiently strong signal to survive the convolution process. Now that meridional flows can be measured over two decades of data, the uncertainties arising from convective noise have fallen to a level where they are comparable in magnitude to the systematic biases caused by nonlocal features in the averaging kernels. Hence, these systematic errors are beginning to influence current helioseismic deductions and need broader consideration.

<title>Constraints on Solar Wind Density and Velocity Based on Coronal Tomography and Parker Solar Probe Measurements</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad1506</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Previous work has established an empirical relationship between densities gained from coronal rotational tomography near the ecliptic plane with solar wind outflow speeds at heliocentric distance r0 = 8R⊙. This work aims to include solar wind acceleration, and thus velocity profiles out to 1 au. Inner boundary velocities are given as a function of normalized tomographic densities, ρN, as {V}_{0}=\left(75\ast {e}^{-\left[5.2* {\rho }_{N}\right]}+108\right), and typically range from 100 to 180  km s−1. The subsequent acceleration is defined as V(r)={V}_{0}\left(1+{\alpha }_{\mathrm{IP}}\left[1-{e}^{\left(-\left[r-{r}_{0}\right]/{r}_{{\rm{H}}}\right)}\right]\right), with αIP ranging between 1.75 and 2.7, and rH between 50 and 35 R⊙ dependent on V0. These acceleration profiles approximate the distribution of in situ measurements by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and other measurements at 1 au. Between 2018 November and 2021 September these constraints are applied using the HUXt model and give good agreement with in situ observations at PSP, with a ∼6% improvement compared with using a simpler constant acceleration model previously considered. Given the known tomographical densities at 8 R⊙, we extrapolate density to 1 au using the model velocities and assuming mass flux conservation. Extrapolated densities agree well with OMNI measurements. Thus coronagraph-based estimates of densities define the ambient solar wind outflow speed, acceleration, and density from 8 R⊙ to at least 1 au. This sets a constraint on more advanced models, and a framework for forecasting that provides a valid alternative to the use of velocities derived from magnetic field extrapolations.

<div> Galactic globular cluster, Australia Telescope Compact Array, radio continuum survey, radio source, X-ray source
<br />总结: 本研究对47 Tucanae星团进行了超深度射电连续波观测，获得了迄今为止最深的星团射电图像。研究发现了一个与星团中心位置重合的微弱无线电源ATCA J002405.702-720452.361，并且可能与微弱X射线源有关。通过无线电、X射线、光学和紫外数据分析，排除了背景活跃星系核、色球活跃双星或白矮星双星等解释，认为该源可能是未发现的毫秒脉冲星或微弱的黑洞吸积体。如果X射线源与无线电源相关联，则黑洞活动基本平面表明黑洞质量约为54-6000太阳质量，表明这可能是中等质量黑洞或重型恒星质量黑洞。 <div>
We present the results of an ultradeep radio continuum survey, containing ∼480 hr of observations, of the Galactic globular cluster 47 Tucanae with the Australia Telescope Compact Array. This comprehensive coverage of the cluster allows us to reach rms noise levels of 1.19 μJy beam−1 at 5.5 GHz, 940 nJy beam−1 at 9 GHz, and 790 nJy beam−1 in a stacked 7.25 GHz image. This is the deepest radio image of a globular cluster and the deepest image ever made with the Australia Telescope Compact Array. We identify ATCA J002405.702-720452.361, a faint (6.3 ± 1.2 μJy at 5.5 GHz, 5.4 ± 0.9 μJy at 9 GHz), flat-spectrum (α = −0.31 ± 0.54) radio source that is positionally coincident with the cluster center and potentially associated with a faint X-ray source. No convincing optical counterpart was identified. We use radio, X-ray, optical, and UV data to show that explanations involving a background active galactic nucleus, a chromospherically active binary, or a binary involving a white dwarf are unlikely. The most plausible explanations are that the source is an undiscovered millisecond pulsar or a weakly accreting black hole. If the X-ray source is associated with the radio source, the fundamental plane of black-hole activity suggests a black hole mass of ∼54–6000 M⊙, indicating an intermediate-mass black hole or a heavy stellar-mass black hole.

We report the discovery of three Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite Objects of Interest (TOI) with signatures of pulsation, observed in more than one sector. Our main goal is to explore how large is the variety of classical pulsators such as δ Sct, γ Dor, RR Lyrae and Cepheid among TOI pulsators. The analysis reveals two stars with signatures of δ Sct and one of γ Dor, out of a sample of 3901 TOIs with available light curves (LCs). To date, there is a very scarce number of known pulsating stars hosting planets. The present finding also emerges as an exciting laboratory for studying different astrophysical phenomena, including the effects of star–planet interaction on pulsation and timing detection of planetary companions. We have also identified 16 TOI stars with periodicities and LCs morphology compatible with different classical pulsating classes, but for most of them, the dominant frequency signals originate from contaminating sources.

We present the Cardinal mock galaxy catalogs, a new version of the Buzzard simulation that has been updated to support ongoing and future cosmological surveys, including the Dark Energy Survey (DES), DESI, and LSST. These catalogs are based on a one-quarter sky simulation populated with galaxies out to a redshift of z = 2.35 to a depth of mr = 27. Compared to the Buzzard mocks, the Cardinal mocks include an updated subhalo abundance matching model that considers orphan galaxies and includes mass-dependent scatter between galaxy luminosity and halo properties. This model can simultaneously fit galaxy clustering and group–galaxy cross-correlations measured in three different luminosity threshold samples. The Cardinal mocks also feature a new color assignment model that can simultaneously fit color-dependent galaxy clustering in three different luminosity bins. We have developed an algorithm that uses photometric data to further improve the color assignment model and have also developed a novel method to improve small-scale lensing below the ray-tracing resolution. These improvements enable the Cardinal mocks to accurately reproduce the abundance of galaxy clusters and the properties of lens galaxies in the DES data. As such, these simulations will be a valuable tool for future cosmological analyses based on large sky surveys.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章使用IRAM 30 m 望远镜对Sagittarius B2区域进行了观测，检测到了与生命起源密切相关的肽类分子。研究利用旋转图解法得出了HCONH2的激发温度和柱密度的空间分布，并推导出了CH3CONH2的柱密度。结果表明，在Sgr B2的分子包层中，激发温度的范围为6到46K。通过计算得出CH3CONH2/HCONH2和HCONH2/HNCO的丰度比，发现CH3CONH2在Sgr B2的西北部区域相对于HCONH2有所增加。此外，还检测到了H13CONH2，得出了12C/13C的比值为28.7。研究还使用了一个时变化的化学模型来解释HCONH2和CH3CONH2的丰度，最佳拟合结果表明尘埃温度为53-56K。需要在模型中包括更多的化学反应以解释观测到的丰度。 <div>
Peptide-like molecules, which have a close connection with the origin of life, have been detected in the Universe. Mapping observations of HCONH2 and CH3CONH2, two of the simplest peptide-like molecules, are performed toward the Sagittarius B2 (Sgr B2) complex with the IRAM 30 m telescope. Seven transitions of HCONH2 and five transitions of CH3CONH2 are used in the analysis. The spatial distributions of the excitation temperature and column density of HCONH2 in the molecular envelope of Sgr B2 are obtained by rotation diagrams. Assuming the same excitation temperature of HCONH2, the column densities of CH3CONH2 are also calculated. The results show that the excitation temperature ranges from 6 to 46 K in the molecular envelope of Sgr B2. The abundance ratios between HCONH2 and CH3CONH2 are calculated to explore the relationship between them, as are those between HCONH2 and HNCO. The abundance ratio of CH3CONH2/HCONH2 varies from 10% to 20%, while that of HCONH2/HNCO ranges from 1.5% to 10%. CH3CONH2 is enhanced with respect to HCONH2 in the northwest region of Sgr B2. One transition of H13CONH2 is detected toward 12 positions of Sgr B2, from which a 12C/13C ratio of 28.7 is obtained. A time-dependent chemical model with a short-duration X-ray burst is used to explain the observed abundances of HCONH2 and CH3CONH2, with the best-fitting result at Tdust = 53–56 K. More chemical reactions are required to be included in the model since the modeled abundance is lower than the observed one at the observed Tdust.

The very-high-energy γ-ray source HESS J1809-193 has been detected by the LHAASO and HAWC observatory beyond 100 TeV energy. It is an interesting candidate for exploring the underlying mechanisms of γ-ray production due to the presence of supernova remnants, pulsars, and molecular clouds close to it. We have considered the injection of the energetic cosmic rays from a past explosion, whose reminiscent may be SNR G011.0-00.0, which is located within the extended γ-ray source HESS J1809-193. We explain the multiwavelength data from the region of HESS J1809-193 with synchrotron, inverse Compton, and bremsstrahlung emission of cosmic-ray electrons and secondary γ-ray production in interactions of cosmic-ray protons with the cold protons in the local molecular clouds within a time-dependent framework including the diffusion loss of cosmic rays. The observational data have been modeled with the secondary photons produced by the time-evolved cosmic-ray spectrum assuming the age of the explosion is 4500 yr.

这篇论文旨在回答Alfvén波湍流加热在太阳大气模型中的物理过程如何展开在一个活动区的个体等离子体环中。通过对波耗散和反射、温度分布、加热比例定律和沿着环的能量平衡进行全面的统计调查，提供了对太阳下层大气能量分配的深入见解。研究表明，我们的3D全球模型与Alfvén波湍流加热的基于物理现象的公式得出的加热速率从环的脚点到顶部呈指数下降，这是过去文献中经验性假设的结果。还进行了对活动区的详细差分发射度（DEM）分析，并且与Hinode/极紫外成像光谱仪观测得到的DEM曲线相比，模拟结果良好。这是第一项使用高数值分辨率检验我们AWSoM模型的详细活动区能量学特性的工作，并进一步展示了低频Alfvén波湍流加热在产生活动区内实际等离子体性质和能量学方面的能力。 <div>
The coronal heating problem has been a major challenge in solar physics, and a tremendous amount of effort has been made over the past several decades to solve it. In this paper, we aim at answering how the physical processes behind the Alfvén wave turbulent heating adopted in the Alfvén Wave Solar atmosphere Model (AWSoM) unfold in individual plasma loops in an active region (AR). We perform comprehensive investigations in a statistical manner on the wave dissipation and reflection, temperature distribution, heating scaling laws, and energy balance along the loops, providing in-depth insights into the energy allocation in the lower solar atmosphere. We demonstrate that our 3D global model with a physics-based phenomenological formulation for the Alfvén wave turbulent heating yields a heating rate exponentially decreasing from loop footpoints to top, which had been empirically assumed in the past literature. A detailed differential emission measure (DEM) analysis of the AR is also performed, and the simulation compares favorably with DEM curves obtained from Hinode/Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer observations. This is the first work to examine the detailed AR energetics of our AWSoM model with high numerical resolution and further demonstrates the capabilities of low-frequency Alfvén wave turbulent heating in producing realistic plasma properties and energetics in an AR.

总结: 本文介绍了MIST项目，其旨在通过仿真观测研究土壤和MIST波束直达性对探测宇宙黎明时期的全球21厘米信号的影响。结果表明，单层土壤模型可以比较容易地恢复信号，而双层模型则更具挑战性，其中对底层土壤电导率较高的模型需要进行波束色散校正。这些结果将有助于选择有利于探测宇宙黎明信号的观测点。 <div>
The Mapper of the IGM Spin Temperature (MIST) is a new ground-based, single-antenna, radio experiment attempting to detect the global 21 cm signal from the Dark Ages and Cosmic Dawn. A significant challenge in this measurement is the frequency dependence, or chromaticity, of the antenna beam directivity. MIST observes with the antenna above the soil and without a metal ground plane, and the beam directivity is sensitive to the electrical characteristics of the soil. In this paper, we use simulated observations with MIST to study how the detection of the global 21 cm signal from Cosmic Dawn is affected by the soil and the MIST beam directivity. We simulate observations using electromagnetic models of the directivity computed for single- and two-layer models of the soil. We test the recovery of the Cosmic Dawn signal with and without beam chromaticity correction applied to the simulated data. We find that our single-layer soil models enable a straightforward recovery of the signal even without chromaticity correction. Two-layer models increase the beam chromaticity and make the recovery more challenging. However, for the model in which the bottom soil layer has a lower electrical conductivity than the top layer, the signal can be recovered even without chromaticity correction. For the other two-layer models, chromaticity correction is necessary for the recovery of the signal, and the accuracy requirements for the soil parameters vary between models. These results will be used as a guideline to select observation sites that are favorable for the detection of the Cosmic Dawn signal.

In this paper we explore the idea of using multi-spacecraft observations of Jovian electrons to measure the 3D distribution of these particles in the inner heliosphere. We present simulations of Jovian electron intensities along selected spacecraft trajectories for 2021 and compare these, admittedly qualitatively, to these measurements. Using the data–model comparison we emphasize how such a study can be used to constrain the transport parameters in the inner heliosphere, and how this can lead to additional insight into energetic particle transport. Model results are also shown along the expected trajectories of selected spacecraft, including the off-ecliptic phase of the Solar Orbiter mission from 2025 onward. Lastly, we revisit the use of historical data and discuss upcoming missions that may contribute to Jovian electron measurements.

Our analysis yields the chromospheric differential rotation rate Ω(θ) = (14.61 ± 0.04–2.18 ± 0.37 {\sin }^{2}\theta -1.10\pm 0.61{\sin }^{4}\theta )^\circ day−1. These results suggest the chromospheric plages exhibit an equatorial rotation rate 1.59% faster than the photosphere when compared with the differential rotation rate measured using sunspots and also a smaller latitudinal gradient compared to the same. To compare our results to those from other observatories, we have applied our method on a small sample of Ca ii K data from Rome, Meudon, and Mount Wilson observatories, which support our findings from KoSO data. Additionally, we have not found any significant north–south asymmetry or any systematic variation in chromospheric differential rotation over the last century.

<div> 星系、环境影响、星体形成率、星体形成主序、质量抑制<br />
<br />
在这项研究中，我们使用完整质量的样本对低于4的红移z的约170k个星系进行了环境对星体形成活动的影响的系统研究。在z < 1时，我们发现所有星系的平均星体形成率（SFR）随着环境密度的增加而减少。然而，当我们只考虑星体形成星系时，平均SFR在z < 1时与环境无关。在z > 2时，我们观察到所有星系的SFR与环境密度之间存在明显的正相关关系。另一方面，星系的恒星质量在所有红移下除了z < 1的星体形成星系外都明显随环境增加。在z < 2时，隐化星系的比例随着环境密度的增加而增加，并且在z∼1附近确认了形态密度关系的存在。我们还发现在z > 1时，环境抑制可忽略，而质量抑制是所有红移下巨大星系的主要抑制机制。基于这些结果，我们认为恒星质量调节的物理过程可能是星系星体形成活动的主要驱动力。在低红移（z < 1）时，由于其较高质量，巨大星系主要被抑制，导致正常的SFR-密度关系。在高红移（z > 2）时，大多数星系都是紧密遵循星体形成主序的星体形成星系，它们在不同环境中的恒星质量差异自然导致SFR-密度关系的逆转。<br /><br />总结: 该研究使用了COSMOS2020目录中的大样本数据，发现了星系星体形成活动与环境密度的关系在不同红移下的变化规律。在低红移时，星体形成率与环境密度呈负相关，主要受到质量抑制的影响；而在高红移时，星体形成率与环境密度呈正相关，主要受到质量抑制和环境影响的共同作用。这一研究为我们了解星系形成演化过程提供了重要的参考。 <div>
We present a systematic study of the environmental impact on star formation activities of galaxies using a mass-complete sample of ∼170k galaxies at z &lt; 4 from the latest COSMOS2020 catalog. At z &lt; 1, we find that the mean star formation rate (SFR) of all galaxies decreases with increasing density of the environment. However, when we only consider star-forming galaxies, the mean SFR becomes independent of the environment at z &lt; 1. At z &gt; 2, we observe a clear positive correlation between the SFR and the density of the environment for all the galaxies. On the other hand, the stellar mass of the galaxies increases significantly with the environment at all redshifts except for star-forming galaxies at z &lt; 1. The fraction of quiescent galaxies increases with increasing density of the environment at z &lt; 2, and the morphology–density relation is confirmed to be present up to z ∼ 1. We also find that environmental quenching is negligible at z &gt; 1, whereas mass quenching is the dominant quenching mechanism for massive galaxies at all redshifts. Based on these results, we argue that stellar mass-regulated physical processes might be the major driving force for star formation activities of galaxies. At low redshift (z &lt; 1) massive galaxies are quenched primarily due to their high mass, resulting in a normal SFR–density relation. At high redshift (z &gt; 2) most of the galaxies are star-forming ones tightly following the star-forming main sequence, and the difference in their stellar mass in different environments naturally leads to a reversal of the SFR–density relation.

这项研究报道了一项在红移为1.34的TXS 1206+549窄线塞弗特1星系的g-和r-带光变曲线中检测到的光学拟周期振荡（QPO），使用了Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF)的观测数据。在考虑试验因子后，两个波段中的显著性水平分别为3.1σ和2.6σ。QPO信号在2018年3月至2021年12月之间大约有10个周期，持续了约4年。通过相位分析，折叠后的光变曲线显示出近乎正弦的轮廓。有趣的是，在ZTF观测的同时光变曲线中，在Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System数据的o-带光变曲线中检测到了一个类似周期的潜在周期信号；此外，在来自Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope数据的γ射线光变曲线中也检测到了一个类似周期的弱峰。文中还讨论了活动星系核中周期性的潜在起源。 <br /><br />总结:
1. 在TXS 1206+549星系中检测到约134天的光学拟周期振荡。

Here we report an optical quasiperiodic oscillation (QPO) with a period of ∼134 days detected in g- and r-band light curves of the narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy TXS 1206+549 at a redshift of 1.34 with data from observations at the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). After considering the trial factor, the significance levels in the two bands are 3.1σ and 2.6σ, respectively. The QPO signal presents about 10 cycles ranging from 2018 March to 2021 December, thus lasting ∼4 yr. A nearly sinusoidal profile also appears in the folded light curves by using a phase-resolved analysis. Interestingly, in the simultaneous light curve with the timescale of ZTF observations, a potential periodic signal with a similar period is detected in the o-band light curve from Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System data; additionally, a weak peak is also detected at a similar period in the γ-ray light curve obtained from Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope data. Some potential origins of periodicities in active galactic nuclei are discussed for the QPO reported here.

星系形成和演化涉及各种在不同时间尺度上运行的有效随机过程。扩展的调节器模型提供了一个分析框架，用于解释由这些过程造成的星系整体恒星形成的变化（或“爆发性”）。它通过使用功率谱密度（PSD）形式主义，将Fourier空间中的变化性与影响巨大分子云的创造和破坏的随机气体流入、平衡和动力学过程的有效时间尺度联系起来。我们利用功率谱密度和自相关函数之间的连接，将这个模型重新表述为自相关函数，然后使用物理上有动机的高斯过程在对数恒星形成率（SFR）空间中对星系恒星形成史（SFHs）的变化性进行建模。然后，我们利用恒星群合成模型，探讨模型随机性的变化如何影响类似银河系和现今矮星的星系群在高红移下的光谱特征。我们发现，即使在固定的散射情况下，对随机性模型的干扰（改变时间尺度与总体变化性）也会在理想化和更真实的星系群中留下独特的光谱特征。基于Hubble空间望远镜、詹姆斯·韦伯空间望远镜和南希·格雷斯·罗曼空间望远镜的现有和未来调查，光谱特征的分布，包括基于Hα和紫外线的SFR指标、Hδ和Ca H和K吸收线强度、Dn(4000)和宽带颜色，提供了可验证的预测。高斯过程SFH框架为下一代光谱能量分布建模工具提供了一种快速、灵活的物理协方差模型的实现。可在https://github.com/kartheikiyer/GP-SFH找到用于重现我们结果的代码。<br /><br />总结: 该研究探讨了星系形成和演化中的随机过程，并提出了扩展的调节器模型来解释星系恒星形成的变化。这项研究使用物理上有动机的高斯过程在对数恒星形成率空间中对星系恒星形成史的变化性进行建模，并发现即使在固定的散射情况下，对随机性模型的干扰也会在星系群中留下独特的光谱特征。研究结果提供了对未来观测的可验证预测，并为下一代光谱能量分布建模工具提供了一种快速、灵活的实现。 <div>
Galaxy formation and evolution involve a variety of effectively stochastic processes that operate over different timescales. The extended regulator model provides an analytic framework for the resulting variability (or “burstiness”) in galaxy-wide star formation due to these processes. It does this by relating the variability in Fourier space to the effective timescales of stochastic gas inflow, equilibrium, and dynamical processes influencing giant molecular clouds' creation and destruction using the power spectral density (PSD) formalism. We use the connection between the PSD and autocovariance function for general stochastic processes to reformulate this model as an autocovariance function, which we use to model variability in galaxy star formation histories (SFHs) using physically motivated Gaussian processes in log star formation rate (SFR) space. Using stellar population synthesis models, we then explore how changes in model stochasticity can affect spectral signatures across galaxy populations with properties similar to the Milky Way and present-day dwarfs, as well as at higher redshifts. We find that, even at fixed scatter, perturbations to the stochasticity model (changing timescales vs. overall variability) leave unique spectral signatures across both idealized and more realistic galaxy populations. Distributions of spectral features including Hα and UV-based SFR indicators, Hδ and Ca H and K absorption-line strengths, Dn(4000), and broadband colors provide testable predictions for galaxy populations from present and upcoming surveys with the Hubble Space Telescope, James Webb Space Telescope, and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. The Gaussian process SFH framework provides a fast, flexible implementation of physical covariance models for the next generation of spectral energy distribution modeling tools.

总结:<br /><br />这篇论文介绍了Shack-Hartmann波前传感器(SH-WFS)在扩展目标上的理论分析，特别关注了归一化交叉相关(NCC)算法的实施。通过利用NCC算法的计算公式直接表达相关函数矩阵中最大值的坐标，以获得准确的误差描述。此外，通过误差传递函数确定了质心位置的方差，量化了测量误差。与Michau等人之前的发现相比，我们的结果显示出系数差异，具体结果比其工作高出1.5倍。广泛的太阳颗粒模拟和实验结果验证了理论误差公式。这些误差公式可以有效地估计SH-WFS的准确度，为光学系统设计提供了理论基础。 <div>
Correlating the Shack–Hartmann wave front sensor (SH-WFS) with extended targets is widely used in solar adaptive optics systems. This paper aims to introduce a theoretical analysis that evaluates the accuracy of the SH-WFS on extended sources, with a specific focus on the implementation of the Normalized Cross-correlation (NCC) algorithm. To obtain an accurate error description, we utilized the calculation formula of the NCC algorithm to directly express the coordinates of the maximum value in the correlation function matrix. Furthermore, we determined the variance of the centroid position through the error transfer function, which quantifies the measurement error. In comparison with the previous findings of Michau et al., our result exhibits a coefficient disparity, specifically obtaining results 1.5 times higher than their work. The extensive solar granulation simulation and experimental results validate the theoretical error formulas. These error formulas can effectively estimate the accuracy of the SH-WFS, providing a theoretical foundation for the design of optical systems.

Visual inspections of the first optical rest-frame images from JWST have indicated a surprisingly high fraction of disk galaxies at high redshifts. Here, we alternatively apply self-supervised machine learning to explore the morphological diversity at z ≥ 3. Our proposed data-driven representation scheme of galaxy morphologies, calibrated on mock images from the TNG50 simulation, is shown to be robust to noise and to correlate well with the physical properties of the simulated galaxies, including their 3D structure. We apply the method simultaneously to F200W and F356W galaxy images of a mass-complete sample (M*/M⊙ &gt; 109) at 3 ≤ z ≤ 6 from the first JWST/NIRCam CEERS data release. We find that the simulated and observed galaxies do not exactly populate the same manifold in the representation space from contrastive learning. We also find that half the galaxies classified as disks—either convolutional neural network-based or visually—populate a similar region of the representation space as TNG50 galaxies with low stellar specific angular momentum and nonoblate structure. Although our data-driven study does not allow us to firmly conclude on the true nature of these galaxies, it suggests that the disk fraction at z ≥ 3 remains uncertain and possibly overestimated by traditional supervised classifications. Deeper imaging and spectroscopic follow-ups as well as comparisons with other simulations will help to unambiguously determine the true nature of these galaxies, and establish more robust constraints on the emergence of disks at very high redshift.

在哈勃边缘场进行的最新紫外线亮度函数（UVLF）分析通过对前景透镜星团后面的数据加以研究，帮助确立了z∼5-9 UVLF的微弱端估计，比在场内还要暗5等星。这些测量结果提供了有关低亮度星系在宇宙再电离中的作用的宝贵信息，有助于校准JWST观测的预期。我们将半经验模型拟合到来自哈勃的透镜和先前UVLF数据，并对再电离期间的平均恒星形成效率（SFE）进行约束，透镜UVLF测量探测到的暗物质尺度达到M∼2×10^9M⊙。隐含的SFE随暗物质质量的趋势与先前在M≳10^10M⊙的推断外推一致，尽管联合数据更倾向于较浅的SFE。然而，这种偏好部分受透镜测量的系统不确定性影响。在z∼6附近，我们发现SFE在∼10^11和10^12M⊙之间达到约20％的峰值。我们的最佳拟合模型与Planck2020确定的电子散射光学厚度值一致，并且与大多数当前的再电离历史测量结果一致，前提是离子化光子的逃逸分数fesc∼10％-20％。联合UVLF在z∼8附近占再电离光子预算的近80％。最后，我们表明，对于Z≳11的最新JWST UVLF估计需要与哈勃数据所暗示的红移演化有着显著偏离。 <br /><br />总结: UVLF分析帮助确立了z∼5-9 UVLF的微弱端估计，对于再电离和JWST观测有重要影响。测量结果约束了恒星形成效率及其与暗物质质量的关系，并表明在z∼6附近SFE达到峰值。最佳拟合模型与Planck2020确定的电子散射光学厚度值一致，并且联合UVLF占了再电离光子预算的近80％。最新JWST UVLF估计与哈勃数据有着显著偏离。 <div>
A recent ultraviolet luminosity function (UVLF) analysis in the Hubble Frontier Fields, behind foreground lensing clusters, has helped solidify estimates of the faint-end of the z ∼ 5–9 UVLF at up to 5 mag fainter than in the field. These measurements provide valuable information regarding the role of low-luminosity galaxies in reionizing the universe and can help in calibrating expectations for JWST observations. We fit a semiempirical model to the lensed and previous UVLF data from Hubble. This fit constrains the average star formation efficiency (SFE) during reionization, with the lensed UVLF measurements probing halo mass scales as small as M ∼ 2 × 109M⊙. The implied trend of SFE with halo mass is broadly consistent with an extrapolation from previous inferences at M ≳ 1010M⊙, although the joint data prefer a shallower SFE. This preference, however, is partly subject to systematic uncertainties in the lensed measurements. Near z ∼ 6, we find that the SFE peaks at ∼20% between ∼1011 and 1012M⊙. Our best-fit model is consistent with the Planck 2020 determinations of the electron scattering optical depth, and most current reionization history measurements, provided the escape fraction of ionizing photons is fesc ∼ 10%–20%. The joint UVLF accounts for nearly 80% of the ionizing photon budget at z ∼ 8. Finally, we show that recent JWST UVLF estimates at z ≳ 11 require strong departures from the redshift evolution suggested by the Hubble data.

We  present the demography of the dynamics and gas mass fraction of 33 extremely metal-poor galaxies (EMPGs) with metallicities of 0.015–0.195 Z⊙ and low stellar masses of 104–108M⊙ in the local universe. We conduct deep optical integral field spectroscopy (IFS) for the low-mass EMPGs with the medium-high resolution (R = 7500) grism of the 8 m Subaru FOCAS IFU instrument by the EMPRESS 3D survey, and investigate the Hα emission of the EMPGs. Exploiting the resolution high enough for the low-mass galaxies, we derive gas dynamics with the Hα lines by the fitting of three-dimensional disk models. We obtain an average maximum rotation velocity (vrot) of 15 ± 3 km s−1 and an average intrinsic velocity dispersion (σ0) of 27 ± 10 km s−1 for 15 spatially resolved EMPGs out of 33 EMPGs, and find that all 15 EMPGs have vrot/σ0 &lt; 1 suggesting dispersion-dominated systems. There is a clear decreasing trend of vrot/σ0 with the decreasing stellar mass and metallicity. We derive the gas mass fraction (fgas) for all 33 EMPGs, and find no clear dependence on stellar mass and metallicity. These vrot/σ0 and fgas trends should be compared with young high-z galaxies observed by the forthcoming JWST IFS programs to understand the physical origins of the EMPGs in the local universe.

总结:<br /><br />本研究利用上海天马射电望远镜在8600 MHz观测到了9颗毫秒脉冲星(MSPs)，并成功获取了它们的综合脉冲轮廓。通过对2250 MHz观测数据进行更新，本研究扩大了已发表综合轮廓的MSPs数量，包括了之前没有相关结果的七颗MSPs。通过对新的流量密度和脉冲宽度测量结果与先前的低频结果进行比较，研究了MSPs在更广泛的频率范围内的综合轮廓演变和光谱特性。最后，本研究发现其中四颗MSPs的光谱不符合单一幂律，而是用断裂幂律来拟合。此外，研究发现PSR J1713+0747星的综合轮廓出现了显著变化，且频率增加时这种变化更为突出。相比星际介质的影响，作者更倾向于将这一事件解释为磁层发生的变化。同时，研究发现其综合轮廓在事件发生后可能直到多个日期才恢复到先前的状态。 <div>
We report detection results of nine millisecond pulsars (MSPs) at 8600 MHz using simultaneous 2250 and 8600 MHz observations conducted with the Shanghai Tian Ma Radio Telescope. Mainly benefiting from updated ephemerids with 2250 MHz observations, integrated profiles of all nine MSPs at 8600 MHz are successfully obtained by coherently adding multi-epoch (3–83 epochs) observation data spanning from 19–1210 days, which significantly increases the number of MSPs with published profiles (from 4 to 11) above 8000 MHz, as seven of our target MPSs had no related results previously. Combining our new flux density and pulse width measurements with previous low-frequency results, we study their integrated profile evolution and spectral behaviors in a wider frequency range. We find their component separations and pulse widths remain almost constant, which is consistent with previous findings. While dramatic evolution of integrated profiles exists at low frequencies, we observe a potential end of the related evolution around 5 GHz in eight MSPs. The spectra of four MSPs are found to deviate from a single power law, and we fit them with a broken power law. The change in the profile of PSR J1713+0747, which started around MJD 59320−59321, seems to be more prominent as the observation frequency increases. Compared with the effects of the interstellar medium, we prefer to explain this event as some changes in the magnetosphere. We also find its integrated profile possibly had not recovered to the pre-event state until MJD 59842–59857.

<br /><br />总结: <br />Monte Carlo辐射传输模拟揭示了超新星光谱线形状与周围环境结构之间的关系，可以区分出质量流失机制。 <div>
Some supernovae (SNe) are powered by the collision of the SN ejecta with dense circumstellar matter (CSM). Their emission spectra show characteristic line shapes of combined broad emission and narrow P Cygni lines, which should closely relate to the CSM structure and the mass-loss mechanism that creates the dense CSM. We quantitatively investigate the relationship between the line shape and the CSM structure by Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations, considering two representative cases of dense CSM formed by steady and eruptive mass loss. Comparing the Hα emission between the two cases, we find that a narrow P Cygni line appears in the eruptive case but does not appear in the steady case due to the difference in the velocity gradient in the dense CSM. We also reproduce the blueshifted photon excess observed in some Type IIn SNe, which is formed by photon transport across the shock wave, and find the relationship between the velocity of the shocked matter and the amount of blueshift of the photon excess. We conclude that the presence or absence of narrow P Cygni lines can distinguish the mass-loss mechanism and suggest high-resolution spectroscopic observations with λ/Δλ ≳ 104 after the light-curve peak for applying this diagnostic method.

在这项工作中，我们对TNG50-1模拟生成的1780个孤立卫星星系进行了lopsided形态的统计分析，考虑了来自暗物质晕中心的潮汐场效应。孤立卫星星系指的是在其维里半径内质量超过1%的星系，且周围没有邻近子结构。我们研究了卫星星系的主轴与其暗物质晕中心径向方向之间的径向对齐（RA），分别在0-2、2-5和5-10 Rh（Rh为星体的半质量半径）的径向范围内进行研究。根据我们的结果，在内部和中间区域，径向对齐几乎无法检测到，但在外部区域明显存在。我们还计算了主轴的远端与近端半轴比率a-/a+，它衡量了面向暗物质晕中心（远端）和背向暗物质晕中心（近端）的半轴比率。在所有卫星星系的径向区间内，远端较长半轴的卫星数量几乎等于近端较长半轴的卫星数量。因此，暗物质晕中心的潮汐场在形成lopsided卫星星系中起到了较小的作用。我们进一步研究了长半长轴径向对齐（LRA），即卫星星系的长半长轴与其暗物质晕中心径向方向的对齐情况。在ΛCDM牛顿动力学框架内，我们的样本中没有发现明确的LRA证据。最后，我们简要讨论了TNG50-1模拟中星系不对称的可能起源。

<br /><br />总结: 本研究对TNG50-1模拟生成的孤立卫星星系进行lopsided形态的统计分析。研究发现，暗物质晕中心的潮汐场对于形成lopsided卫星星系的作用较小，且在牛顿动力学框架内未发现长半长轴径向对齐的明确证据。文章最后还简要讨论了卫星星系不对称的可能起源。 <div>
Galaxies are observed to be lopsided, meaning that they are more massive and more extended along one side than the opposite side. In this work, we provide a statistical analysis of the lopsided morphology of 1780 isolated satellite galaxies generated by the TNG50-1 simulation, incorporating the effect of tidal fields from halo centers. The isolated satellites are galaxies without nearby substructures whose mass is over 1% of the satellites within their virial radii. We study the radial alignment (RA) between the major axes of satellites and the radial direction of their halo centers in radial ranges of 0–2, 2–5, and 5–10 Rh, with Rh being the stellar half-mass radius. According to our results, the RA is virtually undetectable in inner and intermediate regions, yet it is significantly evident in outer regions. We also calculate the far-to-near-side semiaxial ratios of the major axes, denoted by a−/a+, which measure the semiaxial ratios of the major axes in the hemispheres between those facing away from (far side) and facing toward (nearside) halo centers. In all the radial bins of the satellites, the numbers of satellites with longer semiaxes on the far side are found to be almost equal to those with longer semiaxes on the near side. Therefore, the tidal fields from halo centers play a minor role in the generation of lopsided satellites. The long semimajor-axes radial alignment (LRA), i.e., an alignment between the long semimajor axes of satellite galaxies and the radial directions to their halo centers, is further studied. No clear evidence of LRA is found in our sample within the framework of ΛCDM Newtonian dynamics. Finally, we briefly discuss the possible origins of the asymmetry of galaxies in TNG50-1.

FRB190309A与GRB060502B存在空间关联，但其物理关联尚不清楚。研究者对623个FRBs和168个具有精确定位的SGRBs进行了系统搜索，发现FRB190309A与GRB060502B的空间关联概率为0.05。尽管该结果的统计显著性不高，但考虑到时间信息和红移信息后，此结果仍具有一定意义。虽然目前观测信息不足以确定它们的物理关联，但并不排除这种可能性。作为唯一一个具有空间关联的FRB和GRB对，这仍然是一个值得进一步关注的有趣案例。 <br /><br />总结: FRB190309A与GRB060502B存在空间关联，但尚不清楚它们是否物理相关。观测信息不足以确定它们的物理关联，但也没有排除这种可能性。这一发现仍值得进一步研究。 <div>
The physical origin of fast radio bursts (FRBs) is still unclear. However, young magnetars associated with short-duration gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) have been thought to be possible central engines for some FRBs. In this paper, we perform a systematic search for SGRBs that are associated with FRBs in a sample including 623 FRBs (601 one-off bursts and 22 repeaters) and 168 SGRBs with precise localizations. We find that FRB 190309A is spatially associated with GRB 060502B, with a chance probability of 0.05 when temporal and redshift information is taken into account. Considering the high chance probability (the statistical significance is &lt;3σ), we examine other observational properties such as the host galaxy, the dispersion measure, and the energy budget of the central engine to check the possibility of their association. Although the available observational information is insufficient to determine whether they are physically associated, it does not rule out such a possibility. As the only pair of FRB and GRB that are spatially associated, it remains an interesting case worthy of further attention.

<br /><br />总结: 本研究通过观测FRB 20201124A和其宿主星系，发现宿主星系中存在大量星体形成，比光学观测推测的星体形成高出2.5-6倍，显示星体形成受尘埃影响。同时，射电观测显示FRB位置延伸有射电发射。研究提出FRB可能源自星体形成区内的磁星，或者从宿主星系中央栏向外迁移而来。此外，对于FRB位置上的持续射电发射放射，对其亮度进行了限制，这一限制与磁星星云和超星云模型基本一致。 <div>
We present high-resolution 1.5–6 GHz Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) optical and infrared observations of the extremely active repeating fast radio burst (FRB) FRB 20201124A and its barred spiral host galaxy. We constrain the location and morphology of star formation in the host and search for a persistent radio source (PRS) coincident with FRB 20201124A. We resolve the morphology of the radio emission across all frequency bands and measure a star formation rate (SFR) ≈ 8.9 M⊙ yr−1, approximately ≈2.5–6 times larger than optically inferred SFRs, demonstrating dust-obscured star formation throughout the host. Compared to a sample of all known FRB hosts with radio emission, the host of FRB 20201124A has the most significantly obscured star formation. While HST observations show the FRB to be offset from the bar or spiral arms, the radio emission extends to the FRB location. We propose that the FRB progenitor could have formed in situ (e.g., a magnetar born from a massive star explosion). It is still plausible, although less likely, that the progenitor of FRB 20201124A migrated from the central bar of the host. We further place a limit on the luminosity of a putative PRS at the FRB position of L6.0GHz ≲ 1.8 ×1027 erg s−1 Hz−1, among the deepest PRS luminosity limits to date. However, this limit is still broadly consistent with both magnetar nebulae and hypernebulae models assuming a constant energy injection rate of the magnetar and an age of ≳105 yr in each model, respectively.

<title>Star Formation Efficiency in Nearby Galaxies Revealed with a New CO-to-H2 Conversion Factor Prescription</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Determining how the galactic environment, especially the high gas densities and complex dynamics in bar-fed galaxy centers, alters the star formation efficiency (SFE) of molecular gas is critical to understanding galaxy evolution. However, these same physical or dynamical effects also alter the emissivity properties of CO, leading to variations in the CO-to-H2 conversion factor (αCO) that impact the assessment of the gas column densities and thus of the SFE. To address such issues, we investigate the dependence of αCO on the local CO velocity dispersion at 150 pc scales using a new set of dust-based αCO measurements and propose a new αCO prescription that accounts for CO emissivity variations across galaxies. Based on this prescription, we estimate the SFE in a sample of 65 galaxies from the PHANGS–Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array survey. We find increasing SFE toward high-surface-density regions like galaxy centers, while using a constant or metallicity-based αCO results in a more homogeneous SFE throughout the centers and disks. Our prescription further reveals a mean molecular gas depletion time of 700 Myr in the centers of barred galaxies, which is overall three to four times shorter than in nonbarred galaxy centers or the disks. Across the galaxy disks, the depletion time is consistently around 2–3 Gyr, regardless of the choice of αCO prescription. All together, our results suggest that the high level of star formation activity in barred centers is not simply due to an increased amount of molecular gas, but also to an enhanced SFE compared to nonbarred centers or disk regions.

<title>Comparing Plasma Anisotropy Associated with Solar Wind Discontinuities and Alfvénic Fluctuations</title>

Solar wind magnetic field fluctuations exhibit a complex multiscale nature, often encompassing ion-scale discontinuities and MHD-scale Alfvénic fluctuations. Both of these types of structures are thought to play a critical role in plasma heating and turbulence dissipation. Here we comparatively analyze the plasma pressure anisotropies within discontinuities and adjacent Alfvénic fluctuations, leveraging unique solar wind observations from orbit conjunctions between the ARTEMIS and WIND missions, along the same flow streamline, though about 150 Earth radii apart. Based on 11 cases of such observations, we compare direct measurements of plasma anisotropy from particle instruments with its estimates from anisotropic MHD theory using the ratios of correlated ion velocity and Alfvén speed variations Δvi/ΔvA. We find that (1) sporadically observed discontinuities associated with bifurcated reconnection current sheets harbor significant parallel electron anisotropies of &gt;0.2; (2) direct electron measurements in all events reveal a median anisotropy of ∼0.07 for Alfvénic fluctuations and ∼0.17 for discontinuities; (3) anisotropic MHD predicts even more disparate total anisotropies within Alfvénic fluctuations and discontinuities, with a median value of ∼0.15 for the former and ∼0.57 for the latter; (4) the differences between theory-predicted and directly measured anisotropies imply that the ion contribution to anisotropy is significant and likely dominant within both types of structures, an assertion which we partly verify using simultaneous ion measurements from WIND. Our observations confirm that such discontinuities play a uniquely important role in producing solar wind plasma heating and anisotropy.

HM Sge是一个尘埃丰富的共生Mira系统，研究表明，这个系统在1975年的新星状爆发之后经历了迅速的演化，表现出一些有趣的特征。首次利用新的EXES高光谱分辨率红外光谱技术探测到了共生系统中的rovibrational水发射。该特征显示出一定的速度但没有明显的高速流出现。中红外光度测量和光谱学显示，氧丰富的巨星支系尘埃和尘埃产量在过去39年中几乎没有变化。在光学/紫外线范围内，检测到了三个主要的[N II]星云特征，其中两个特征显示出一定的运动，相对于之前观测到的平均流出速度为38和78 km/s；一些之前检测到的[N II]特征已不再可见。新的紫外线光谱表明，该星云环境在1975年的爆发后继续稳定放松。然而，数据表明热组分的温度从1989年的200,000K增加到目前大于250,000K。我们的新和存档观测表明，系统在爆发后经历的演化是迅速的，几年后几乎没有重大变化。 
<br /><br />总结: HM Sge是一个尘埃丰富的共生Mira系统，经过1975年的新星状爆发后，观测到了rovibrational水发射以及氧丰富的巨星支系尘埃和尘埃产量几乎没有变化。光学/紫外线范围内的[N II]星云特征显示一些运动，而紫外线光谱表明星云环境在1975年的爆发后继续稳定放松，但热组分的温度却有所增加。 <div>
We have targeted the dusty symbiotic Mira system HM Sge with four instruments from the IR to the UV. We have used these observations along with archival observations to study how the system has been evolving after its 1975 nova-like outburst. We have detected rovibrational water emission in a symbiotic system for the first time using new EXES high-spectral-resolution infrared spectroscopy. The features, detected in emission, have velocities consistent with the systemic velocity but do not show any clear evidence of high-velocity outflows. Mid-infrared photometry and grism spectroscopy show that the oxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch dust and dust output have shown little to no change over the past 39 years. In the optical/UV, we detect three main [N ii] nebular features that were detected 22 years ago. Two of these features show a small amount of movement, corresponding to average outflows speeds of 38 and 78 km s−1 since they were previously observed; some previously detected [N ii] features are no longer visible. New UV spectroscopy has shown that the nebular environment continues to steadily relax after the system’s 1975 outburst. The data suggest, however, that the temperature of the hot component has increased from 200,000 K in 1989 to greater than 250,000 K now. Our new and archival observations suggest that the evolution of the system after its outburst is swift with little to no major changes after a period of a couple of years.

<br />
HST-dark galaxies是指在深度光学-近红外成像中不可见，但在较长波长下被探测到的星系，最近的观测研究表明它们可能构成了一个数量可观的缺失星系群体，并且在z≳4时可能主导宇宙的星系形成率密度。这篇文章进行了首次基于模拟的研究，利用Feedback in Realistic Environments项目中高分辨率星系的模拟，通过辐射传递进行了多波段成像。研究发现，HST-dark galaxies通常位于高红移（z=4-7），有较高的尘埃衰减水平（AV=2-4），并展现出紧凑的近期星系形成。此外，研究还指出了方向性的重要性，对于大部分模拟的星系快照来说，存在一定视线并不符合选择标准。这一结果对于那些不能解析星尘几何结构的观测和模型（例如半解析模型或粗略解析的流体动力学模拟）之间的比较具有重要意义。最重要的是，研究证明HST-dark sources并不是意外或奇特的星系群体，而是在某些视线下观察到的高红移、高度尘埃衰减的星系的子集。 <br /><br />总结: HST-dark galaxies是在光学-近红外成像中不可见但在较长波长下被探测到的星系群体，主要研究了这些星系的模拟和特征，并发现了它们的环境位置、尘埃衰减和星系形成特征，同时也指出了观测和模型比较中方向性的重要性。 <div>
Galaxies that are invisible in deep optical–near-infrared imaging but detected at longer wavelengths have been the focus of several recent observational studies, with speculation that they could constitute a substantial missing population and even dominate the cosmic star formation rate density at z ≳ 4. The depths now achievable with JWST at the longest wavelengths probed by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), coupled with the transformative resolution at longer wavelengths, are already enabling detailed, spatially resolved characterization of sources that were invisible to HST, often known as “HST-dark” galaxies. However, until now, there has been little theoretical work to compare against. We present the first simulation-based study of this population, using highly resolved galaxies from the Feedback in Realistic Environments project, with multiwavelength images along several lines of sight forward-modeled using radiative transfer. We naturally recover a population of modeled sources that meet commonly used selection criteria (HAB &gt; 27 mag and HAB − F444W &gt; 2.3). These simulated HST-dark galaxies lie at high redshifts (z = 4–7), have high levels of dust attenuation (AV = 2–4), and display compact recent star formation (R1/2,4.4 μm ≲ 1 kpc). Orientation is very important: for all but one of the 17 simulated galaxy snapshots with HST-dark sight lines, there exist other sight lines that do not meet the criteria. This result has important implications for comparisons between observations and models that do not resolve the detailed star-dust geometry, such as semianalytic models or coarsely resolved hydrodynamical simulations. Critically, we demonstrate that HST-dark sources are not an unexpected or exotic population, but a subset of high-redshift, highly dust-attenuated sources viewed along certain lines of sight.

The current sample of 12 radio-quiet isolated neutron stars that emit strongly in X-rays (XINSs) is both small and heterogeneous, limiting its usefulness for understanding the physics of neutron star atmospheres and cooling rates and for constraining the equation of state of neutron degenerate matter. Utilizing the ROSAT 1RXS and 2RXS data sets, in conjunction with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 17 and other companion multiwavelength surveys, we have extended previous searches for blank-field X-ray source candidate XINSs, ultimately recovering two known XINSs while identifying 46 new, unstudied candidate fields devoid of likely multiwavelength counterparts. In this publication, we describe our selection approach and provide detailed information regarding our sample of new candidate XINSs. Future opportunities to verify or to refute these X-ray sources as isolated neutron stars by obtaining more accurate X-ray source positions, quality X-ray spectra, or deeper optical imaging are also discussed.

Compositional convection is atmospheric mixing driven by density variations caused by compositional gradients. Previous studies have suggested that compositional gradients of atmospheric trace species within planetary atmospheres can impact convection and the final atmospheric temperature profile. In this work, we employ 3D convection-resolving simulations using Cloud Model 1 (CM1) to gain a fundamental understanding of how compositional variation influences convection and the final atmospheric state of exoplanet atmospheres. We perform 3D initial value problem simulations of noncondensing compositional convection for Earth-air, H2, and CO2 atmospheres. Conventionally, atmospheric convection is assumed to mix the atmosphere to a final, marginally stable state defined by a unique temperature profile. However, when there is compositional variation within an atmosphere, a continuous family of stable end states is possible, differing in the final state composition profile. Our CM1 simulations are used to determine which of the family of possible compositional end states is selected. Leveraging the results from our CM1 simulations, we develop a dry convective adjustment scheme for use in general circulation models (GCMs). This scheme relies on an energy analysis to determine the final adjusted atmospheric state. Our convection scheme produces results that agree with our CM1 simulations and can easily be implemented in GCMs to improve modeling of compositional convection in exoplanet atmospheres.

Low-frequency gravitational-wave experiments such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna and pulsar timing arrays are expected to detect individual massive black hole (MBH) binaries and mergers. However, secure methods of identifying the exact host galaxy of each MBH merger among the large number of galaxies in the gravitational-wave localization region are currently lacking. We investigate the distinct morphological signatures of MBH merger host galaxies, using the Romulus25 cosmological simulation. We produce mock telescope images of 201 simulated galaxies in Romulus25 hosting recent MBH mergers through stellar population synthesis and dust radiative transfer. Based on comparisons to mass- and redshift-matched control samples, we show that combining multiple morphological statistics via a linear discriminant analysis enables identification of the host galaxies of MBH mergers, with accuracies that increase with chirp mass and mass ratio. For mergers with high chirp masses (≳108.2M⊙) and high mass ratios (≳0.5), the accuracy of this approach reaches ≳80%, and does not decline for at least ∼1 Gyr after numerical merger. We argue that these trends arise because the most distinctive morphological characteristics of MBH merger and binary host galaxies are prominent classical bulges, rather than relatively short-lived morphological disturbances from their preceding galaxy mergers. Since these bulges are formed though major mergers of massive galaxies, they lead to (and become permanent signposts for) MBH binaries and mergers that have high chirp masses and mass ratios. Our results suggest that galaxy morphology can aid in identifying the host galaxies of future MBH binaries and mergers.

We present a semi-analytic model for the growth, drift, desorption, and fragmentation of millimeter- to meter-sized particles in protoplanetary disks. Fragmentation occurs where particle collision velocities exceed critical fragmentation velocities. Using this criterion, we produce fragmentation regions in disk orbital radius–particle size phase space for particles with a range of material properties, structures, and compositions (including SiO2, Mg2SiO4, H2O, CO2, and CO). For reasonable disk conditions, compact aggregate H2O, CO2, and CO ice particles do not reach destructive relative velocities and are thus not likely to undergo collisional fragmentation. Uncoated silicate particles are more susceptible to collisional destruction and are expected to fragment in the inner disk, consistent with previous work. We then calculate the growth, drift, and sublimation of small particles, initially located in the outer disk. We find that ice-coated particles can avoid fragmentation as they grow and drift inward under a substantial range of disk conditions, as long as the particles are aggregates composed of 0.1 μm-sized monomers. Such particles may undergo runaway growth in disk regions abundant in H2O or CO2 ice, depending on the assumed disk temperature structure. These results indicate that icy collisional growth to planetesimally relevant sizes may happen efficiently throughout a disk’s lifetime, and is particularly robust at early times when the disk’s dust-to-gas ratio is comparable to that of the interstellar medium.

超新星遗迹Tycho的SNR被认为是一个典型的对象，具有光谱、形态和环境特性的重要性。最近的Chandra数据重新分析显示，其前向激波自2007年以来经历了显著的减速，这表明最近的激波与密集介质的相互作用，导致分子云内部的空腔环境。本研究利用最新的多时期 proper motion 测量，进行了水动力学模拟，以表征Tycho的空腔壁环境。模拟中探索了环境的一系列参数，以与每个方位区域的观测数据相匹配。结果显示，ρ(r)∝r−2的风洞模型与最新数据相符，而常数密度的均匀介质模型则不佳。此外，最佳拟合模型支持具有方位角变化的各向异性风，整体结果表明质量损失速率异常高，不符合传统的单重变星爆炸方案。 <div>
Among Type Ia supernova remnants (SNRs), Tycho’s SNR has been considered as a typical object from the viewpoints of its spectroscopic, morphological, and environmental properties. A recent reanalysis of Chandra data showed that its forward shock is experiencing a substantial deceleration since around 2007, which suggests recent shock interactions with a dense medium as a consequence of a cavity-wall environment inside a molecular cloud. Such a nonuniform environment can be linked back to the nature and activities of its progenitor. In this study, we perform hydrodynamic simulations to characterize Tycho’s cavity-wall environment using the latest multiepoch proper motion measurements of the forward shock. A range of parameters for the environment is explored in the hydrodynamic models to fit with the observational data for each azimuthal region. Our results show that a wind-like cavity with ρ(r) ∝ r−2 reconciles with the latest data better than a uniform medium with a constant density. In addition, our best-fit model favors an anisotropic wind with an azimuthally varying wind parameter. The overall result indicates a mass-loss rate which is unusually high for the conventional single-degenerate explosion scenario.

We performed synthetic observations of the Ulrich, Cassen, and Moosman (UCM) model to understand the relation between the physical structures of the infalling envelope around a protostar and their observational features in molecular lines, adopting L1527 as an example. We also compared the physical structure and synthetic position–velocity (P–V) diagrams of the UCM model and a simple ballistic (SB) model. There are multiple ways to compare synthetic data with observational data. We first calculated the correlation coefficient. The UCM model and the SB model show similarly good correlation with the observational data. While the correlation reflects the overall similarity between the cube datasets, we can alternatively compare specific local features, such as the centrifugal barrier in the SB model or the centrifugal radius in the UCM model. We evaluated systematic uncertainties in these methods. In the case of L1527, the stellar mass values estimated using these methods are all lower than the value derived from previous Keplerian analysis of the disk. This may indicate that the gas infall motion in the envelope is retarded by, e.g., magnetic fields. We also showed analytically that, in the UCM model, the spin-up feature of the P–V diagram is due to the infall velocity rather than the rotation. The line-of-sight velocity V is thus ∝x−0.5, where x is the offset. If the infall is retarded, rotational velocity should dominate so that V is proportional to x−1, as is often observed in the protostellar envelope.

总结: 
本文研究了利用机器学习进行大气检索的新方法，通过使用基于正规流的神经网络以及新开发的可微分前向模型Diff-τ来进行贝叶斯推断。研究表明，该框架不需要大量预先计算的训练集，能够在仅有一次观测的情况下进行训练。与基于抽样的检索相比，它能够产生与之相当的高保真后验分布，并且在收敛到相同结果时需要的前向模型调用次数少至75%。此外，该方法还允许进行正式的贝叶斯模型选择。研究者还讨论了Diff-τ在计算效率上的优势，并提供了在可微分语言中开发辐射传输模型的经验。这一框架为利用神经网络进行大气检索的最新发展做出了重要贡献，它的灵活性以及在大规模和复杂数据集中减少前向模型调用次数的潜力，使其成为检索工具箱的重要补充。 <br /><br /> <div>
Current endeavours in exoplanet characterization rely on atmospheric retrieval to quantify crucial physical properties of remote exoplanets from observations. However, the scalability and efficiency of said technique are under strain with increasing spectroscopic resolution and forward model complexity. The situation has become more acute with the recent launch of the James Webb Space Telescope and other upcoming missions. Recent advances in machine learning provide optimization-based variational inference as an alternative approach to perform approximate Bayesian posterior inference. In this investigation we developed a normalizing-flow-based neural network, combined with our newly developed differentiable forward model, Diff-τ, to perform Bayesian inference in the context of atmospheric retrievals. Using examples from real and simulated spectroscopic data, we demonstrate the advantages of our proposed framework: (1) training our neural network does not require a large precomputed training set and can be trained with only a single observation; (2) it produces high-fidelity posterior distributions in excellent agreement with sampling-based retrievals; (3) it requires up to 75% fewer forward model calls to converge to the same result; and (4) this approach allows formal Bayesian model selection. We discuss the computational efficiencies of Diff-τ in relation to TauREx3's nominal forward model and provide a “lessons learned” account of developing radiative transfer models in differentiable languages. Our proposed framework contributes toward the latest development of neural network–powered atmospheric retrieval. Its flexibility and significant reduction in forward model calls required for convergence holds the potential to be an important addition to the retrieval tool box for large and complex data sets along with sampling-based approaches.

<div> Spherical RHT algorithm, H i-based polarization templates, filament morphology, magnetic field structure, B-mode correlation <br />
<br />总结:
作者们使用了一种新的 Rolling Hough Transform (RHT) 算法来实现对球面上的纤维结构进行高效的量化。研究发现，对于模拟磁场结构最具信息量的 H i 结构是最细的解析纤维。他们还发现，一些星际形态可以产生奇异性违反的信号，即非零的 TB 和 EB。最后，他们证明了来自星际尘埃纤维的B模式主要受到纤维之间拓扑结构和相对极化强度的影响，而E模式主要受到单个纤维的形状的影响。 <div>
Filamentary structures in neutral hydrogen (H i) emission are well aligned with the interstellar magnetic field, so H i emission morphology can be used to construct templates that strongly correlate with measurements of polarized thermal dust emission. We explore how the quantification of filament morphology affects this correlation. We introduce a new implementation of the Rolling Hough Transform (RHT) using spherical harmonic convolutions, which enables efficient quantification of filamentary structure on the sphere. We use this Spherical RHT algorithm along with a Hessian-based method to construct H i-based polarization templates. We discuss improvements to each algorithm relative to similar implementations in the literature and compare their outputs. By exploring the parameter space of filament morphologies with the Spherical RHT, we find that the most informative H i structures for modeling the magnetic field structure are the thinnest resolved filaments. For this reason, we find a ∼10% enhancement in the B-mode correlation with polarized dust emission with higher-resolution H i observations. We demonstrate that certain interstellar morphologies can produce parity-violating signatures, i.e., nonzero TB and EB, even under the assumption that filaments are locally aligned with the magnetic field. Finally, we demonstrate that B modes from interstellar dust filaments are mostly affected by the topology of the filaments with respect to one another and their relative polarized intensities, whereas E modes are mostly sensitive to the shapes of individual filaments.

总结: 
该论文利用Atacama大型毫米/亚毫米阵列对M型恒星CIDA 9A周围的大型不对称粉尘环进行了双波长观测。通过对观测得到的可见度进行参数化建模分析，发现了1.3毫米和3.1毫米数据中的粉尘不对称性。在两个波长的观测中报告了粉尘发射峰值的轴向偏移，这与由涡旋引起的粉尘陷阱一致，可能是由内嵌原行星或其他流体动力不稳定性（如死区）形成的。需要进行深入的高空间分辨率的粉尘和分子气体观测，以限制形成CIDA 9A周围原行星盘中观测到的毫米级空洞和粉尘不对称性的机制。 <div>
While the most exciting explanation of the observed dust asymmetries in protoplanetary disks is the presence of protoplanets, other mechanisms can also form the dust features. This paper presents dual-wavelength Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of a large asymmetric dusty ring around the M-type star CIDA 9A. We detect a dust asymmetry in both 1.3 and 3.1 mm data. To characterize the asymmetric structure, a parametric model is used to fit the observed visibilities. We report a tentative azimuthal shift of the dust emission peaks between the observations at the two wavelengths. This shift is consistent with a dust trap caused by a vortex, which may be formed by an embedded protoplanet or other hydrodynamical instabilities, such as a dead zone. Deep high-spatial-resolution observations of dust and molecular gas are needed to constrain the mechanisms that formed the observed millimeter cavity and dust asymmetry in the protoplanetary disk around CIDA 9A.

<title>LATIS: Constraints on the Galaxy–Halo Connection at z ∼ 2.5 from Galaxy–Galaxy and Galaxy–Lyα Clustering</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The connection between galaxies and dark matter halos is often quantified using the stellar mass–halo mass (SMHM) relation. Optical and near-infrared imaging surveys have led to a broadly consistent picture of the evolving SMHM relation based on measurements of galaxy abundances and angular correlation functions. Spectroscopic surveys at z ≳ 2 can also constrain the SMHM relation via the galaxy autocorrelation function and through the cross-correlation between galaxies and Lyα absorption measured in transverse sight lines; however, such studies are very few and have produced some unexpected or inconclusive results. We use ∼3000 spectra of z ∼ 2.5 galaxies from the Lyα Tomography IMACS Survey (LATIS) to measure the galaxy–galaxy and galaxy–Lyα correlation functions in four bins of stellar mass spanning 109.2 ≲ M*/M⊙ ≲ 1010.5. Parallel analyses of the MultiDark N-body and ASTRID hydrodynamic cosmological simulations allow us to model the correlation functions, estimate covariance matrices, and infer halo masses. We find that results of the two methods are mutually consistent and broadly accord with standard SMHM relations. This consistency demonstrates that we are able to measure and model Lyα transmission fluctuations δF in LATIS accurately. We also show that the galaxy–Lyα cross-correlation, a free by-product of optical spectroscopic galaxy surveys at these redshifts, can constrain halo masses with similar precision to galaxy–galaxy clustering.

In the latest data release from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (the 4th Fermi LAT 14 yr Catalog, or 4FGL), more than 50% of the Galactic sources are yet to be identified. We observed 13 unidentified Fermi LAT sources with the Chandra X-Ray Observatory to explore their nature. We report the results of the classification of X-ray sources in the fields of these γ-ray sources and discuss the implications for their nature. We use multiwavelength (MW) data for a machine-learning classification, accompanied by a more detailed spectral/variability analysis for brighter sources. Eight 4FGL sources have γ-ray pulsars within their position error ellipses. We consider three of these pulsars (PSR J1906+0722, PSR J1105–6037, and PSR J1358–6025) to be detected in X-rays, while PSR J1203–6242 shows a hint of X-ray emission. Within the positional uncertainties of three of the 4FGL sources, we detect X-ray sources that may be yet unknown pulsars, depending on the MW association. In addition to point sources, we discovered two extended sources, one of which is likely to be a bow-shock pulsar-wind nebula associated with PSR J1358–6025. Finally, we classify other X-ray sources detected in these observations and report the most interesting classifications.

<title>The Scaling of Vortical Electron Acceleration in Thin-current Magnetic Reconnection and Its Implications in Solar Flares</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
To investigate how magnetic reconnection (MR) accelerates electrons to a power-law energy spectrum in solar flares, we explore the scaling of a kinetic model proposed by Che &amp; Zank (CZ) and compare it to observations. Focusing on thin current sheet MR particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, we analyze the impact of domain size on the evolution of the electron Kelvin–Helmholtz instability (EKHI). We find that the duration of the growth stage of the EKHI ({t}_{G}\sim {{\rm{\Omega }}}_{e}^{-1}) is short and remains nearly unchanged because the electron gyrofrequency Ωe is independent of domain size. The quasi-steady stage of the EKHI (tMR) dominates the electron acceleration process and scales linearly with the size of the simulations as L/vA0, where vA0 is the Alfvén speed. We use the analytical results obtained by CZ to calculate the continuous temporal evolution of the electron energy spectra from PIC simulations and linearly scale them to solar flare observational scales. For the first time, an electron acceleration model predicts the sharp two-stage transition observed in typical soft–hard–harder electron energy spectra, implying that the electron acceleration model must be efficient with an acceleration timescale that is a small fraction of the duration of solar flares. Our results suggest that we can use PIC MR simulations to investigate the observational electron energy spectral evolution of solar flares if the ratio tMR/tG is sufficiently small, i.e., ≲10%.

<title>Evidence of Third Dredge-up in Post-AGB Stars in Galactic Globular Clusters</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
To better understand the mixing and mass loss experienced by low-mass stars as they ascend the asymptotic giant branch (AGB), I have gathered from the literature the abundances of CNO and s-process elements in post-AGB stars in Galactic globular clusters. These species are mixed to the surface during third dredge-up (3DU) events, so their abundance should increase as the star ascends the AGB. Of the 17 stars in this sample, CNO abundances are available for 11. Of these, four are enhanced in CNO relative to the red giant branch stars from which they descended, which I take as evidence of 3DU on the AGB. The enhancement is mainly in the form of carbon. Of the six stars for which only heavy-element abundances are available, one shows s-process enhancements that previous authors have interpreted as evidence of 3DU. Combining these 17 stars with other recent samples reveals that most globular-cluster post-AGB stars have luminosities \mathrm{log}(L/{L}_{\odot })\sim 3.25. They are the progeny of blue horizontal-branch (HB) stars in clusters with intermediate metallicity ([Fe/H] ∼ −1.5). A second group consists of sub-luminous stars associated with high-metallicity clusters ([Fe/H] ∼ −1.0) with red HBs. They may be burning helium, rather than hydrogen. A third group of hot, super-luminous stars is evolving quickly across the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram. Some of them may be merger remnants.

<title>Multiwavelength Campaign Observations of a Young Solar-type Star, EK Draconis. I. Discovery of Prominence Eruptions Associated with Superflares</title>

Young solar-type stars frequently produce superflares, serving as a unique window into the young Sun-Earth environments. Large solar flares are closely linked to coronal mass ejections (CMEs) associated with filament/prominence eruptions, but observational evidence for stellar superflares remains scarce. Here, we present a 12-day, multiwavelength campaign observation of young solar-type star EK Draconis (G1.5V, 50–120 Myr age) utilizing the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, the Neutron star Interior Composition ExploreR, and the Seimei telescope. The star has previously exhibited blueshifted Hα absorptions as evidence for a filament eruption associated with a superflare. Our simultaneous optical and X-ray observations identified three superflares of 1.5 × 1033–1.2 × 1034 erg. We report the first discovery of two prominence eruptions on a solar-type star, observed as blueshifted Hα emissions at speeds of 690 and 430 km s−1 and masses of 1.1 × 1019 and 3.2 × 1017 g, respectively. The faster, massive event shows a candidate of post-flare X-ray dimming with the amplitude of up to ∼10%. Several observational aspects consistently point to the occurrence of a fast CME associated with this event. The comparative analysis of the estimated length scales of flare loops, prominences, possible dimming region, and starspots provides the overall picture of the eruptive phenomena. Furthermore, the energy partition of the observed superflares in the optical and X-ray bands is consistent with flares from the Sun, M-dwarfs, and close binaries, yielding the unified empirical relations. These discoveries provide profound implications of the impact of these eruptive events on early Venus, Earth, and Mars and young exoplanets.

<title>Potential Melting of Extrasolar Planets by Tidal Dissipation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Tidal heating on Io due to its finite eccentricity was predicted to drive surface volcanic activity, which was subsequently confirmed by the Voyager spacecraft. Although the volcanic activity in Io is more complex, in theory volcanism can be driven by runaway melting in which the tidal heating increases as the mantle thickness decreases. We show that this runaway melting mechanism is generic for a composite planetary body with liquid core and solid mantle, provided that (i) the mantle rigidity, μ, is comparable to the central pressure, i.e., μ/(ρgRP) ≳ 0.1 for a body with density ρ, surface gravitational acceleration g, and radius RP; (ii) the surface is not molten; (iii) tides deposit sufficient energy; and (iv) the planet has nonzero eccentricity. We calculate the approximate liquid core radius as a function of μ/(ρgRP), and find that more than 90% of the core will melt due to this runaway for μ/(ρgRP) ≳ 1. From all currently confirmed exoplanets, we find that the terrestrial planets in the L 98-59 system are the most promising candidates for sustaining active volcanism. However, uncertainties regarding the quality factors and the details of tidal heating and cooling mechanisms prohibit definitive claims of volcanism on any of these planets. We generate synthetic transmission spectra of these planets assuming Venus-like atmospheric compositions with an additional 5%, 50%, and 98% SO2 component, which is a tracer of volcanic activity. We find a ≳3σ preference for a model with SO2 with 5–10 transits with JWST for L 98-59bcd.

<title>A Numerical Study of the Effects of a Corotating Interaction Region on Cosmic-Ray Transport. II. Features of Cosmic-Ray Composition and Rigidity</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We continue the numerical modeling of a corotating interaction region (CIR) and the effects it has on solar-rotational recurrent variations of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs). A magnetohydrodynamic model is adapted to simulate the background solar wind plasma with a CIR structure in the inner heliosphere, which is incorporated into a comprehensive Parker-type transport model. The focus is on the simulation of the effects of a CIR on GCR protons and the two helium isotopes as a function of heliolongitude. This is to establish whether the difference in composition affects how they are modulated by the CIR in terms of their distribution in longitude. It is demonstrated that particle diffusion and drift influence the effects of the CIR with increasing rigidity from 100 MV up to 15 GV. It is found that protons and helium isotopes are modulated differently with longitude by the CIR and that particle drift influences the modulation effects in longitude. These differences dissipate with increasing rigidity. The final results are focused on the simulated amplitude of these GCR flux variations as a function of rigidity. The amplitude displays a power-law behavior above ∼1 GV with an index similar to the power index of the rigidity dependence of the assumed diffusion coefficients. The simulations further show that below this rigidity, the amplitude at first flattens off, displaying a plateau-like profile, but it then increases systematically with decreasing rigidity below ∼0.3 GV. Again, a power-law behavior is displayed, but it is completely different from that above 1 GV.

<title>How Many Supermassive Black Hole Binaries Are Detectable through Tracking Relative Motions by (Sub)millimeter Very Long Baseline Interferometry?</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad0da1</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad0da1</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The (sub)millimeter wavelengths (86–690 GHz) very long baseline interferometry will provide ∼5–40 μas angular resolution, ∼10 mJy baseline sensitivity, and ∼1 μas yr−1 proper-motion precision, which can directly detect supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) systems by imaging the two visible sources and tracking their relative motions. Such a way exhibits an advantage compared to indirect detect methods of observing periodic signals in motion and light curves, which are difficult to confirm from competing models. Moreover, tracking relative motion at (sub)millimeter wavelengths is more reliable, as there is a negligible offset between the emission region and the black hole center. In this way, it is unnecessary to correct the black hole location by a prior of jet morphology as it would be required at longer wavelengths. We extend the formalism developed in D’Orazio &amp; Loeb (2018) to link the observations with the orbital evolution of SMBHBs from the ≲10 kpc dynamical friction stages to the ≲0.01 pc gravitational radiation stages, and estimate the detectable numbers of SMBHBs. By assuming 5% of active galactic nuclei holding SMBHBs, we find that the number of detectable SMBHBs with redshift z ≤ 0.5 and mass M ≤ 1011M⊙ is about 20. Such a detection relies heavily on proper-motion precision and sensitivity. Furthermore, we propose that the simultaneous multifrequency technique plays a key role in meeting the observational requirements.

<title>JWST Confirms the Nature of CID-42</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The galaxy CID-42 (CXOC J100043.1+020637.2) at z = 0.359 has been proposed to contain a promising candidate for a gravitational-wave recoiling supermassive black hole (SMBH), a slingshot SMBH from a triple-SMBH interaction, or a kiloparsec-scale dual active galactic nucleus (AGN). These claims were primarily based on a pair of bright cores separated by ∼0.″5 resolved in optical Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging. Existing HST, Chandra, and ground-based imaging and spectroscopy are unable to confirm either scenario. With improved spatial resolution, depth, and IR wavelength coverage, NIRCam multiband imaging from the COSMOS-Web JWST treasury program well resolved the two cores in CID-42, revealing a significant stellar bulge for both cores (with stellar masses of ∼1010M⊙ for both). JWST imaging further revealed that only the SE core contains an unobscured AGN point source, based on both image decomposition and spectral energy distribution fitting. There is no evidence for AGN activity in the NW core based on the current data. These new observations unambiguously rule out the gravitational-wave-recoiling and slingshot-SMBH scenarios and establish CID-42 as a low-redshift merging pair of galaxies, with likely only one active AGN in the system. These results demonstrate the unparalleled capabilities of JWST (even with imaging alone) in studying the galactic-scale environment of merging galaxies and SMBHs.

We present a spatially resolved excitation analysis for the central molecular zone (CMZ) of the starburst galaxy NGC 253 using the data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Comprehensive High-resolution Extragalactic Molecular Inventory, whereby we explore parameters distinguishing NGC 253 from the quiescent Milky Way’s Galactic center (GC). Non-LTE analyses employing a hierarchical Bayesian framework are applied to Band 3–7 transitions from nine molecular species to delineate the position–position–velocity distributions of column density ({N}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}), volume density ({n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}), and temperature (Tkin) at 27 pc resolution. Two distinct components are detected: a low-density component with ({n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}},{T}_{\mathrm{kin}})\sim ({10}^{3.3}\ {\mathrm{cm}}^{-3},85\ {\rm{K}}) and a high-density component with ({n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}},{T}_{\mathrm{kin}})\,\sim ({10}^{4.4}\ {\mathrm{cm}}^{-3},110\ {\rm{K}}), separated at {n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}\sim {10}^{3.8}\ {\mathrm{cm}}^{-3}. NGC 253 has ∼10 times the high-density gas mass and ∼3 times the dense-gas mass fraction of the GC. These properties are consistent with their HCN/CO ratio but cannot alone explain the factor of ∼30 difference in their star formation efficiencies (SFEs), contradicting the dense-gas mass to star formation rate scaling law. The {n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}} histogram toward NGC 253 exhibits a shallow declining slope up to {n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}\sim {10}^{6}\ {\mathrm{cm}}^{-3}, while that of the GC steeply drops in {n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}\gtrsim {10}^{4.5}\ {\mathrm{cm}}^{-3} and vanishes at 105 cm−3. Their dense-gas mass fraction ratio becomes consistent with their SFEs when the threshold {n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}} for the dense gas is taken at ∼104.2−4.6 cm−3. The rich abundance of gas above this density range in the NGC 253 CMZ, or its scarcity in the GC, is likely to be the critical difference characterizing the contrasting star formation in the centers of the two galaxies.

We present the first test of coasting cosmological models with gravitational-wave (GW) standard sirens observed in the first three observing runs of the LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA detector network. We apply the statistical galaxy catalog method adapted to coasting cosmologies and infer constraints on the H0 Hubble constant for the three fixed values of the curvature parameter k=\left\{-1,0,+1\right\} in {H}_{0}^{2}{c}^{-2} units. The maximum posteriors and 68.3% highest density intervals we obtained from a combined analysis of 46 dark siren detections and a single bright siren detection are {H}_{0}=\left\{{68.1}_{-5.6}^{+8.5},{67.5}_{-5.2}^{+8.3},{67.1}_{-5.8}^{+6.6}\right\}\,\mathrm{km}\ {{\rm{s}}}^{-1}\ {\mathrm{Mpc}}^{-1}, respectively. All our constraints on H0 are consistent within 1σ with the H0 measured with the differential age method, which provides a constraint on H0 in coasting cosmologies independently from k. Our results constrain all cosmological models with a(t) ∝ t linear expansion in the luminosity distance and redshift range of the 47 LIGO–Virgo detections, i.e., dL ≲ 5Gpc and z ≲ 0.8, which practically include all (both strictly linear and quasi-linear) models in the coasting model family. As we have found, the coasting models and the Lambda cold dark matter (or ΛCDM) model fit equally well to the applied set of GW detections.

<title>The JWST Resolved Stellar Populations Early Release Science Program. IV. The Star Formation History of the Local Group Galaxy WLM</title>

We present the first star formation history (SFH) and age–metallicity relation (AMR) derived from resolved stellar populations imaged with the JWST NIRCam instrument. The target is the Local Group star-forming galaxy WLM at 970 kpc. The depth of the color–magnitude diagram (CMD) reaches below the oldest main sequence turnoff with a signal-to-noise ratio = 10 at MF090W = + 4.6 mag. This is the deepest CMD for any galaxy that is not a satellite of the Milky Way. We use Hubble Space Telescope (HST) optical imaging that overlaps with the NIRCam observations to directly evaluate the SFHs derived based on data from the two great observatories. The JWST and HST-based SFHs are in excellent agreement. We use the metallicity distribution function measured from stellar spectra to confirm the trends in the AMRs based on the JWST data. Together, these results confirm the efficacy of recovering an SFH and AMR with the NIRCam F090W−F150W filter combination, and validate the sensitivity and accuracy of stellar evolution libraries in the near-infrared relative to the optical for SFH recovery work. From the JWST data, WLM shows an early onset to star formation, followed by an extended pause post-reionization before star formation reignites, which is qualitatively similar to what has been observed in the isolated galaxies Leo A and Aquarius. Quantitatively, 15% of the stellar mass formed in the first Gyr, while only 10% formed over the next ∼5 Gyr. The stellar mass then rapidly doubled in ∼2.5 Gyr, followed by constant star formation over the last ∼5 Gyr.

<title>Efficiency of Turbulent Reacceleration by Solenoidal Turbulence and Its Application to the Origin of Radio Megahalos in Cluster Outskirts</title>

Recent radio observations with the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) discovered diffuse emission extending beyond the scale of classical radio halos. The presence of such megahalos indicates that the amplification of the magnetic field and acceleration of relativistic particles are working in the cluster outskirts, presumably due to the combination of shocks and turbulence that dissipate energy in these regions. Cosmological magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of galaxy clusters suggest that solenoidal turbulence has a significant energy budget in the outskirts of galaxy clusters. In this paper, we explore the possibility that this turbulence contributes to the emission observed in megahalos through second-order Fermi acceleration of relativistic particles and magnetic field amplification by the dynamo. We focus on the case of A2255 and find that this scenario can explain the basic properties of the diffuse emission component that is observed under assumptions that are used in previous literature. More specifically, we conduct a numerical follow-up, solving the Fokker–Planck equation by using a snapshot of an MHD simulation and deducing the synchrotron brightness integrated along the lines of sight. We find that a volume-filling emission, ranging between 30% and almost 100% of the projected area, depending on our assumptions on the particle diffusion and transport, can be detected at LOFAR sensitivities. Assuming a magnetic field B ∼ 0.2  μG, as derived from a dynamo model applied to the emitting region, we find that the observed brightness can be matched when ∼1% of the solenoidal turbulent energy flux is channeled into particle acceleration.

总结:<br /><br />这项研究首次对银河螺旋臂中的磁场结构进行了层析成像，利用光学恒星偏振测量探测了射手座螺旋臂，结合Gaia任务提供的恒星距离数据，成功分离并分析了沿视线方向上五个不同云团的磁场贡献。观测到的云团包括一个前景云（d < 200 pc）和四个射手座臂上的云团。这些云团的柱密度范围从0.5到2.8×1021 cm−2不等，与每个云团相关的磁场显示出在小于10 pc的区域内平滑的空间分布，并显示出不同的取向。测量的位置角从银河北向东测量，依次是135°、46°、58°、150°和40°，这些位置角与银河平面平行方向有明显偏差。 <div>
The Galactic global magnetic field is thought to play a vital role in shaping Galactic structures such as spiral arms and giant molecular clouds. However, our knowledge of magnetic field structures in the Galactic plane at different distances is limited, as measurements used to map the magnetic field are the integrated effect along the line of sight. In this study, we present the first ever tomographic imaging of magnetic field structures in a Galactic spiral arm. Using optical stellar polarimetry over a 17^{\prime} \times 10^{\prime} field of view, we probe the Sagittarius spiral arm. Combining these data with stellar distances from the Gaia mission, we can isolate the contributions of five individual clouds along the line of sight by analyzing the polarimetry data as a function of distance. The observed clouds include a foreground cloud (d &lt; 200 pc) and four clouds in the Sagittarius arm at 1.23, 1.47, 1.63, and 2.23 kpc. The column densities of these clouds range from 0.5 to 2.8 × 1021 cm−2. The magnetic fields associated with each cloud show smooth spatial distributions within their observed regions on scales smaller than 10 pc and display distinct orientations. The position angles projected on the plane of the sky, measured from the Galactic north to the east, for the clouds in increasing order of distance are 135°, 46°, 58°, 150°, and 40°, with uncertainties of a few degrees. Notably, these position angles deviate significantly from the direction parallel to the Galactic plane.

<div> gravitationally lensed DSFGs, high-resolution, star formation, extreme starbursts, PASSAGES collaboration<br />总结:
PASSAGES合作团队最近定义了30个通过引力透镜效应被观测到的尘埃星系形成星系(DSFGs)。这些罕见的亚毫米波选取的对象使得我们能够以高分辨率观测宇宙中午时最极端的星系中的星形成地点。利用lenstool分析了这些DSFGs中的15个物体，其跨越了z = 1.1–3.3的范围，使用了0.″6分辨率1.1mm阿塔卡马大毫米/亚毫米阵列(Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array)和0.″4 5cm望远镜(Jansky Very Large Array)连续成像的补充信息，以及与1.6μm哈勃和用Gemini-S进行的光学成像。物体放大倍数范围从μ = 2到28(平均μ = 7)，对应的红外光度范围为LIR = 0.2–5.9 × 10^13L⊙ (平均1.4 × 10^13L⊙)以及推断的星形成速率为170–6300 M⊙ yr−1 (平均1500 M⊙ yr−1)。这些结果表明PASSAGES物体包含了一些已知最极端的星爆，甚至与未经透镜的物体的亮度相媲美，还受到引力透镜效应的放大。远红外连续区域的固有大小较大(Re = 1.7–4.3 kpc; 平均3.0 kpc)，但与z > 1 DSFGs的LIR–Re比例关系一致，这表明了普遍的星形成空间分布。而研究也发现这些物体可能不是最大化的星爆，至少在全局的、整合的星系尺度上，它们的辐射压力限制安全地低于艾丁顿限制。 <div>
The PASSAGES (Planck All-Sky Survey to Analyze Gravitationally-lensed Extreme Starbursts) collaboration has recently defined a sample of 30 gravitationally lensed dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). These rare, submillimeter-selected objects enable high-resolution views of the most extreme sites of star formation in galaxies at cosmic noon. Here, we present the first major compilation of strong lensing analyses using lenstool for PASSAGES, including 15 objects spanning z = 1.1–3.3, using complementary information from 0.″6-resolution 1.1 mm Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and 0.″4 5 cm Jansky Very Large Array continuum imaging, in tandem with 1.6 μm Hubble and optical imaging with Gemini-S. Magnifications range from μ = 2 to 28 (median μ = 7), yielding intrinsic infrared luminosities of LIR = 0.2–5.9 × 1013L⊙ (median 1.4 × 1013L⊙) and inferred star formation rates of 170–6300 M⊙ yr−1 (median 1500 M⊙ yr−1). These results suggest that the PASSAGES objects comprise some of the most extreme known starbursts, rivaling the luminosities of even the brightest unlensed objects, further amplified by lensing. The intrinsic sizes of far-infrared continuum regions are large (Re = 1.7–4.3 kpc; median 3.0 kpc) but consistent with LIR–Re scaling relations for z &gt; 1 DSFGs, suggesting a widespread spatial distribution of star formation. With modestly high angular resolution, we explore if these objects might be maximal starbursts. Instead of approaching Eddington-limited surface densities, above which radiation pressure will disrupt further star formation, they are safely sub-Eddington—at least on global, galaxy-integrated scales.

<div> 磁通量绳索，帕克太阳探测器，磁场模型，等离子体β值，再连接<br />
总结:<br />
本研究报告了帕克太阳探测器（PSP）在三次接触时在窄的Carrington经度范围内观察到的小尺度磁通量绳索（SMFRs）的情况。研究发现在1.°4经度范围内连续观察到了一系列的SMFRs，这些SMFRs在径向距离上持续了约8.4个太阳半径单位（R☉）。这些SMFRs明显区别于周围环境，其等离子体β值显著降低，磁场和等离子体流动波动显著减少。此外，在Encounters 1和5中也发现了类似的SMFRs。研究推测这些SMFRs可能是在太阳附近的极窄角区域内通过连续再连接而重复生成的。 <div>
In this study, we report on small-scale magnetic flux ropes (SMFRs) observed as a compact series in a narrow Carrington longitudinal range during three Parker Solar Probe (PSP) encounters. First, during ∼1.5 days of PSP's inbound part of Encounter 4, we identified a series of 11 SMFRs within 1.°4 in longitude over the radial distance of ∼8.4 R☉ (from ∼44 to 35 R☉). The identified SMFRs lasted from ∼0.5 to 1.8 hr, and adjacent events were separated mostly by a few hours and up to ∼6.5 hr at the longest, but some events were very closely spaced with intervals of a few ∼tens of minutes or less apart. Most of the identified SMFRs are successfully fitted to the force-free model. The SMFRs are clearly distinguished from the surroundings by a notable reduction in plasma β, which itself was comparably low (less than unity) in the background plasma. Furthermore, the magnetic field and plasma flow within the SMFRs fluctuated significantly less than the more turbulent surroundings. The fluctuations in the surrounding medium exhibited occasional Br polarity reversal (possibly switchbacks) and were Alfvénic to a large extent with far weaker compressional components. The majority of these key features with some differences have also been found in the series of SMFRs and their surroundings identified within 1.°3 or less in longitude during Encounters 1 and 5. We speculate that these SMFRs were repetitively generated by successive reconnection within a very narrow angular zone located close to the Sun but not necessarily at the same radial position.

这篇文章使用500和700 au分辨率的观测数据，对Sagittarius B2（Sgr B2）北部（N）和主要（M）的原恒星核进行了观测。他们发现这些原恒星核中有约三分之一会分裂成平均两个物体。观测显示大多数源都部分受到光学厚的影响，它们与0/I级原恒星对象最一致，比太阳附近观测到的物体更温暖。此外，根据源计数推算了星体质量和星体形成速率。Sgr B2 N的星体质量为2800 M⊙，星体形成速率为0.0038 M⊙ yr−1；Sgr B2 M的星体质量为6900 M⊙，星体形成速率为0.0093 M⊙ yr−1。
<br /><br />总结: Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array的高分辨率观测显示Sgr B2北部和主要的原恒星核会发生分裂，大多数源都部分受到光学厚的影响，符合0/I级原恒星对象的特征，而且更温暖。根据源计数推算了星体质量和星体形成速率，Sgr B2的星体质量为2800 M⊙，Sgr B2 M的星体质量为6900 M⊙。 <div>
We present 500 and 700 au resolution 1 and 3 mm Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations, respectively, of protostellar cores in protoclusters Sagittarius B2 (Sgr B2) North (N) and Main (M), parts of the most actively star-forming cloud in our Galaxy. Previous lower-resolution (5000 au) 3 mm observations of this region detected ∼150 sources inferred to be young stellar objects (YSOs) with M &gt; 8 M⊙. With a 10-fold increase in resolution, we detect 371 sources at 3 mm and 218 sources in the smaller field of view at 1 mm. The sources seen at low resolution are observed to fragment into an average of two objects. About one-third of the observed sources fragment. Most of the sources we report are marginally resolved and are at least partially optically thick. We determine that the observed sources are most consistent with Stage 0/I YSOs, i.e., rotationally supported disks with an active protostar and an envelope, that are warmer than those observed in the solar neighborhood. We report source-counting-based inferred stellar mass and the star formation rate of the cloud: 2800 M⊙ and 0.0038 M⊙ yr−1 for Sgr B2 N and 6900 M⊙ and 0.0093 M⊙ yr−1 for Sgr B2 M, respectively.

总结:<br /><br />本文研究了使用f(R)引力理论框架计算原始黑洞合并率的问题，并发现与广义相对论相比，原始黑洞的合并率会有所增加。此外，通过调节场强fR0可以引起原始黑洞合并率的变化，这可能是修改引力的潜在观测特征。文章还探讨了来自f(R)引力模型的原始黑洞丰度的上限，并将结果与引力波和观测数据进行了比较。研究结果表明，在某些未被基准数据排除的区域，这些上限的参数空间可能是可靠的。 <div>
Primordial black holes (PBHs) are known as one of the potential candidates for dark matter. They are expected to have formed due to the direct gravitational collapse of density fluctuations in the early Universe. In this regard, examining the merger rate of PBHs within modified theories of gravity can offer a deeper insight into their abundance. In this work, we delve into the calculation of the merger rate of PBHs within the theoretical framework of f(R) gravity. Our analysis reveals an enhancement in the merger rate of PBHs compared to that obtained from general relativity. Additionally, modulating the field strength fR0 induces shifts in the PBH merger rate, presenting a potential observational signature of modified gravity. We also explore the upper bounds on the abundance of PBHs obtained from f(R) gravity models by comparing the results with gravitational-wave and observational data. The results indicate that in certain regions not excluded by benchmarking data, the parameter space for these upper bounds may be considered reliable.

总结:
本文研究了在多个尺度上对星系磁场动力学的建模，发现单独建模小尺度磁流体动力学（SSD）或大尺度磁流体动力学（LSD）都无法完全描述银河磁场的动态和拓扑结构。研究表明，SSD对LSD的存在并不敏感，并且在大尺度剪切流存在时更强。此外，我们还发现，通过在OB联合中集中超新星爆发可以增加SSD和LSD的生长速率。最后，我们的研究表明，对于LSD的建模在银河系中的温暖气体中心平面生长，并且通过增加分辨率，我们逐渐接近物理解。 <br /><br /> <div>
Magnetic fields are now widely recognized as critical at many scales to galactic dynamics and structure, including multiphase pressure balance, dust processing, and star formation. Using imposed magnetic fields cannot reliably model the interstellar medium's (ISM) dynamical structure nor phase interactions. Dynamos must be modeled. ISM models exist of turbulent magnetic fields using small-scale dynamo (SSD). Others model the large-scale dynamo (LSD) organizing magnetic fields at the scale of the disk or spiral arms. Separately, neither can fully describe the galactic magnetic field dynamics nor topology. We model the LSD and SSD together at a sufficient resolution to use the low explicit Lagrangian resistivity required. The galactic SSD saturates within 20 Myr. We show that the SSD is quite insensitive to the presence of an LSD and is even stronger in the presence of a large-scale shear flow. The LSD grows more slowly in the presence of SSD, saturating after 5 Gyr versus 1–2 Gyr in studies where the SSD is weak or absent. The LSD primarily grows in warm gas in the galactic midplane. Saturation of the LSD occurs due to α-quenching near the midplane as the growing mean-field produces a magnetic α that opposes the kinetic α. The magnetic energy in our models of the LSD shows a slightly sublinear response to increasing resolution, indicating that we are converging toward the physical solution at 1 pc resolution. Clustering supernovae in OB associations increases the growth rates for both the SSD and the LSD, compared to a horizontally uniform supernova distribution.

<br />总结: <br />这篇文章讨论了活动星系核的变化特性，并提出了一个新的优化解决方案，通过仔细审查假设的先验知识、采用的最佳拟合值、集合平均方法和拟合方法的复杂组合，确定了获取无偏差变化特性的最佳监测基线。这一结果对广域巡天望远镜进行的时间域调查具有积极作用，可以改善对AGN变化特性的约束。 <div>
The variability of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is ubiquitous, but has not yet been understood. Measuring the optical variation properties of AGNs, such as the variation timescale and amplitude, and then correlating them with their fundamental physical parameters has long served as a critical way of exploring the origin of AGN variability and the associated physics of the accretion process in AGNs. Obtaining accurate variation properties of AGNs is thus essential. It has been found that the damped random walk process can describe the AGN optical variation well, but there is a controversy over how long a minimal monitoring baseline is required to obtain unbiased variation properties. In this work, we settle the controversy by exhaustively scrutinizing the complex combination of assumed priors, adopted best-fit values, ensemble averaging methods, and fitting methods. The new proposal is then an optimized solution where unbiased variation properties of an AGN sample possessing the same variation timescale can be obtained with a minimal baseline of about 10 times their variation timescale. Finally, the new optimized solution is used to demonstrate the positive role of the time-domain surveys to be conducted by the Wide Field Survey Telescope in improving constraints on AGN variation properties.

总结:
本文研究了类地无生命行星大气中CO2、CO和CH4的相对丰度对行星气候和生物地球化学的基本控制。研究结果表明，大气中CO2水平的升高会触发CO气体的光化学失稳，导致CO逃逸。同时，更高的火山岩浆喷发通量也会引发CO逃逸。我们的系统研究揭示了类似地球的无生命行星的缺氧大气可以根据CH4/CO2与CO/CO2的相对比值被归类。研究结果表明，这种缺口结构是围绕类太阳恒星（F型、G型和K型）运转的类地无生命行星大气的普遍特征。 <div>
Carbon is an essential element for life on Earth, and the relative abundances of major carbon species (CO2, CO, and CH4) in the atmosphere exert fundamental controls on planetary climate and biogeochemistry. Here we employed a theoretical model of atmospheric chemistry to investigate diversity in the atmospheric abundances of CO2, CO, and CH4 on Earth-like lifeless planets orbiting Sun-like (F-, G-, and K-type) stars. We focused on the conditions for the formation of a CO-rich atmosphere, which would be favorable for the origin of life. Results demonstrated that elevated atmospheric CO2 levels trigger photochemical instability of the CO budget in the atmosphere (i.e., CO runaway) owing to enhanced CO2 photolysis relative to H2O photolysis. Higher volcanic outgassing fluxes of reduced C (CO and CH4) also tend to initiate CO runaway. Our systematic examinations revealed that anoxic atmospheres of Earth-like lifeless planets could be classified in the phase space of CH4/CO2 versus CO/CO2, where a distinct gap in atmospheric carbon chemistry is expected to be observed. Our findings indicate that the gap structure is a general feature of Earth-like lifeless planets with reducing atmospheres orbiting Sun-like (F-, G-, and K-type) stars.

The transport of energetic charged particles through magnetized plasmas is ubiquitous in interplanetary space and astrophysics, and the important physical quantities are the parallel and perpendicular diffusion coefficients of energetic charged particles. In this paper, the influence of solar wind on particle transport is investigated. Using the focusing equation, we obtain parallel and perpendicular diffusion coefficients, accounting for the solar wind effect. For different conditions, the relative importance of the solar wind effect to diffusion is investigated. It is shown that, when energetic charged particles are close to the Sun, for parallel diffusion, the solar wind effect needs to be taken into account. These results are important for studying energetic charged particle transport processes in the vicinity of the Sun.

<div> 关键词: 电磁辐射，中子星合并，喷射物质，光曲线，速度分布
总结: 本文探讨了中子星合并中产生的电磁辐射对喷射物质速度分布的影响。研究发现速度分布的不确定性可能导致对喷射物质质量的2-4倍的不确定性。早期的紫外或光学观测可以约束速度分布，从而降低对喷射物质质量的不确定性。这对于了解中子星合并在宇宙中 r 过程元素产生的作用至关重要。 <div>
The electromagnetic emission from the nonrelativistic ejecta launched in neutron star mergers (either dynamically or through a disk wind) has the potential to probe both the total mass and composition of this ejecta. These observations are crucial in understanding the role of these mergers in the production of r-process elements in the Universe. However, many properties of the ejecta can alter the light curves and we must both identify which properties play a role in shaping this emission and understand the effects these properties have on the emission before we can use observations to place strong constraints on the amount of r-process elements produced in the merger. This paper focuses on understanding the effect of the velocity distribution (amount of mass moving at different velocities) for lanthanide-rich ejecta on the light curves and spectra. The simulations use distributions guided by recent calculations of disk outflows and compare the velocity-distribution effects to those of ejecta mass, velocity, and composition. Our comparisons show that uncertainties in the velocity distribution can lead to a factor of 2–4 uncertainties in the inferred ejecta mass based on peak infrared luminosities. We also show that early-time UV or optical observations may be able to constrain the velocity distribution, reducing the uncertainty in the ejecta mass.

<div> CHIME, fast radio bursts, repeating behavior, Monte Carlo simulations, completeness of CHIME/FRB observations
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章介绍了加拿大氢强度映射实验(CHIME)干涉仪近年来发现的大量快速无线电暴( FRB) ，包括一大部分表现出重复行为的FRB。文章使用蒙特卡洛模拟对重复FRB进行了模拟，并通过不同的宇宙分布构建了FRB样本模型。研究还推断了CHIME/FRB观测的完整性，并预测了未来设施对FRB重复爆发的发现。根据模拟结果，作者预测当前的CHIME/FRB观测会有大约170个重复爆发来源，同时也展示了未来设施在大约3年时间内发现的重复爆发数量可能会达到饱和。 <div>
In recent years, the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) interferometer has revealed a large number of fast radio bursts (FRBs), including a sizable population that demonstrates repeating behavior. This transit facility, employing a real-time FRB search pipeline, continually scans the sky with declinations between −10° and 90° for events with fluences ⪆0.4 Jy ms. We simulate a population of repeating FRBs by performing Monte Carlo simulations of underlying source populations processed through a mock CHIME/FRB observing pipeline. Assuming intrinsic repeater rates follow a Poisson distribution, we test assumptions about the burst populations of the repeater sample, and construct models of the FRB sample assuming various cosmological distributions. We infer the completeness of CHIME/FRB observations as a function of observing cadence and redshifts out to 0.5. We find that, if all simulated bursts have a fixed Poisson probability of repetition over their integrated time of observation, repeating burst detections across comoving volume should continue to grow near linearly on the order of decades. We predict that around 170 of the current CHIME/FRB one-off sources will ultimately repeat. We also make projections for FRB repeaters by future facilities and demonstrate that the number of repeaters they find could saturate on a ∼3 yr timescale.

总结:
这篇文章研究了2012年3月10日观察到的一次复合太阳耀斑的磁场配置。研究者构建了一系列磁场模型，利用磁力线插入方法，实现了双层磁流结构的三维日冕磁场模型。他们发现，在初始磁力摩擦松弛过程中，共享相同路径但高度不同的双层磁流很快出现部分合并。但是，路径之间少于30%的重叠可以构建稳定的双层结构。通过对已验证的非线性力自由场双层配置中磁通量的变化，成功复现了双层结构的三种喷发情况。这表明磁力摩擦模拟可以捕捉到喷发开始时的大尺度磁场结构。 <div>
We present a magnetic configuration of a compound solar eruption observed on 2012 March 10, from NOAA AR 11429 near the disk center, which displayed a soft X-ray sigmoid before the eruption. We constructed a series of magnetic field models, including double-decker flux rope configurations, using the flux rope insertion method. This produces three-dimensional coronal magnetic field models constrained by the photospheric magnetogram and observed EUV coronal structures. We used different combinations of flux rope paths. We found that two flux ropes sharing the same path at different heights quickly experience a partial merging in the initial iteration of the magnetofrictional relaxation process. Different paths with less than 30% overlap allowed us to construct stable double-decker structures. The high spatial and temporal resolution of the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly facilitated the selection of a best-fit model that matches the observations best. Moreover, by varying fluxes in this validated nonlinear force-free field double-decker configuration, we successfully reproduce all three scenarios of eruptions of double-decker configurations: (i) eruption due to the instability of higher flux rope; (ii) eruption due to rising lower flux rope and merging with higher flux rope; and (iii) eruption due to the instability of both flux ropes. This demonstrates that magnetofrictional simulation can capture the large-scale magnetic structure of eruptions for a realistic field configuration at eruption onset.

<div> 关键词: R Aqr, 光谱演化, 空间演化, X射线, 联星系统
总结:
R Aqr是一个由红巨星和白矮星组成的联星系统，经过Chandra的观测发现其X射线辐射经历了显著变化。软X射线的发射量在感知到的射流辐射后有所上升，随后回落至之前的平静状态。硬X射线的辐射量在2017至2021年间保持不变，但在2022年后迅速下降。这可能是由于介质反射特性的改变、在近心点通道期间喷发物质的遮挡或白矮星周围吸积盘内部区域的部分/完全破坏。此外，还检测到了扩展辐射，可能与事先喷发的射流中的热斑有关，并且可以观察到其远离系统的中心区域。<br /><br /> <div>
We report on the X-ray spectral and spatial evolution of the symbiotic star R Aqr. Through a multiepoch observational campaign performed with Chandra between 2017 and 2022, we study the X-ray emission of this binary system, composed of an evolved red giant star and a white dwarf (WD). This analysis is particularly timely as the WD approached the periastron in late 2018/early 2019; thus, mass transfer, jet emission, and outburst phenomena are to be expected. Through detailed spectral analysis, we detect a significant rise in the soft X-ray (0.5–2 keV) emission of R Aqr, likely linked to jet emission, followed by a decay toward the previous quiescent state. The hard X-ray emission (5–8 keV) is not immediately affected by the periastron passage; the hard component, after maintaining the same flux level between 2017 and 2021, rapidly decays after 2022. Possible explanations for this are a change in the reflection properties of the medium surrounding the binary, obscuration of the central region by material ejected during the periastron passage, or even the partial/complete destruction of the inner regions of the accretion disk surrounding the WD. In addition to this activity in the central region, extended emission is also detected, likely linked to a hot spot in a pre-outburst-emitted jet, which can be observed moving away from the system’s central region.

这篇文章提出了一种新的方法来测量银河系的垂直势能。他们利用相空间蜗牛与z/Vz轴的交点，通过线性插值方法直接得出垂直势能的约束。他们的方法是独立于模型的，因为对蜗牛形状或垂直势能没有假设。研究表明，在银河系中，相空间蜗牛按照指导中心半径进行分组更为显著，但跟踪的垂直势能比相同银心半径分组的要浅。他们还应用了经验方法来校正这种差异。通过Gaia DR3数据，他们测量了几个Rg分组内的蜗牛交点，并应用插值法在几个垂直高度上推断势能值。研究结果显示，蜗牛交点处的势能以及接下来的质量建模与文献中的银河系势能模型是一致的。另外，他们的方法还可以在未来的研究中应用于更大的径向范围，提供对银河系势能的独立和更强的约束。<br /><br />总结: 本文提出了一种通过相空间蜗牛来测量银河系垂直势能的新方法，该方法独立于模型，能够有效约束银河系的势能，为我们更好地理解银河系的动力学提供了新途径。 <div>
The vertical phase-space spiral (snail) is a direct sign of disequilibrium of the Milky Way’s disk. Nevertheless, the wrapping of the phase snail contains information on the vertical potential. We propose a novel method to measure the vertical potential utilizing the intersections between the snail and z/Vz axes, for which we know the maximum vertical heights (Zmax) or velocities ({V}_{z,\max }). Using a refined linear interpolation method, we directly obtain ({Z}_{\max },\tfrac{1}{2}{V}_{z,\max }^{2}) for these snail intersections to constrain the vertical potential profile empirically. Our method is model-independent, since no assumptions about the snail shape or the vertical potential have been made. Although the snail binned by the guiding center radius (Rg) is more prominent, it traces a vertical potential shallower than that of the snail binned by the same galactocentric radius (R). We apply an empirical method to correct this difference. We measure the snail intersections in several Rg bins within 7.5 &lt; Rg &lt; 11.0 kpc for Gaia DR3 and apply the interpolation method to deduce the potential values at several vertical heights. The potential at the snail intersections, as well as the following mass modeling, is consistent with the popular Milky Way potentials in the literature. For the Rg-binned phase snail in the solar neighborhood, the mass modeling indicates a local dark matter density of ρdm = 0.0150 ± 0.0031 M⊙ pc−3, consistent with previous works. Our method could be applied to larger radial ranges in future works to provide independent and stronger constraints on the Milky Way’s potential.

<div> 关键词: 新方法, 星系原型团, 结构形成理论, 质量标准, 模拟校准
<br />
总结: 
本研究提出了一种新的方法，旨在利用结构形成理论直接应用于观测中，以找到星系原型团。该研究采用了传统的定义，即星系原型团是一个在其时代具有 virial 质量 Mvir < Mcl，且在演化至 z = 0 时将超过该限制的星系团。研究利用了在 z = 0 时预测的完全坍缩的临界过密度来找到将在 z = 0 坍缩的区域的半径和总质量。研究利用了宇宙学流体模拟 Horizon Run 5 (HR5) 来校准此方法，并展示了其性能。研究发现，根据球状坍缩模型确定的星系原型团区域内的质量与在 z = 0 发现的星系团内的最终质量之间存在着紧密的相关性。同时，研究也证实了红移空间畸变对星系原型团识别方案的性能影响不大。 <div>
We propose a new method for finding galaxy protoclusters that is motivated by structure formation theory and also directly applicable to observations. We adopt the conventional definition that a protocluster is a galaxy group whose virial mass Mvir &lt; Mcl at its epoch, where Mcl = 1014M⊙, but would exceed that limit when it evolves to z = 0. We use the critical overdensity for complete collapse at z = 0 predicted by the spherical top-hat collapse model to find the radius and total mass of the regions that would collapse at z = 0. If the mass of a region centered at a massive galaxy exceeds Mcl, the galaxy is at the center of a protocluster. We define the outer boundary of a protocluster as the zero-velocity surface at the turnaround radius so that the member galaxies are those sharing the same protocluster environment and showing some conformity in physical properties. We use the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation Horizon Run 5 (HR5) to calibrate this prescription and demonstrate its performance. We find that the protocluster identification method suggested in this study is quite successful. Its application to the high-redshift HR5 galaxies shows a tight correlation between the mass within the protocluster regions identified according to the spherical collapse model and the final mass to be found within the clusters at z = 0, meaning that the regions can be regarded as the bona fide protoclusters with high reliability. We also confirm that the redshift-space distortion does not significantly affect the performance of the protocluster identification scheme.

总结:<br />
本文介绍了用于解决散射和吸收媒介中辐射传递方程的快速、可靠且准确的近似方法。作者扩展了球谐方法的推导，用于研究热发射光谱学。通过比较不同模型产生的光谱，证明了SH4方法相对于Toon89方法在准确度上有显著提高。他们还探讨了计算时间和模型准确度之间的权衡，发现SH4方法在准确性方面有显著改进，而数值开销基本没有牺牲。 <div>
Approximate methods for radiative transfer equations that are fast, reliable, and accurate are essential for the understanding of atmospheres of exoplanets and brown dwarfs. The simplest and most popular choice is the “two-stream method,” which is often used to produce simple yet effective models for radiative transfer in scattering and absorbing media. Toon et al. (hereafter, Toon89) outlined a two-stream method for computing reflected light and thermal spectra that was later implemented in the open-source radiative transfer model PICASO. In Part I of this series, we developed an analytical spherical harmonics method for solving the radiative transfer equation for reflected solar radiation that was implemented in PICASO to increase the accuracy of the code by offering a higher-order approximation. This work is an extension of this spherical harmonics derivation, to study thermal emission spectroscopy. We highlight the model differences in the approach for thermal emission and benchmark the four-term method (SH4) against Toon89 and a high-stream discrete-ordinates method, CDISORT. By comparing the spectra produced by each model, we demonstrate that the SH4 method provides a significant increase in accuracy, compared to Toon89, which can be attributed to the increased order of approximation and to the choice of phase function. We also explore the trade-off between computational time and model accuracy. We find that our four-term method is twice as slow as our two-term method, but is up to five times more accurate, when compared with CDISORT. Therefore, SH4 provides excellent improvement in model accuracy with minimal sacrifice in numerical expense.

<div> 关键词: Voyager 1, Voyager 2, magnetic field, heliopause, interstellar medium  
总结:<br />本文重新审视了太空探测器Voyager 1和2在太阳圈层附近和极其局部的星际介质中的数据，旨在更好地理解在通过边界时观察到的磁场旋转的缺乏。然后提出可能的假设，即Voyagers穿越了一个与太阳风层表面沿边界重连接的厚厚的边界层。Voyager 1可能尚未完全穿越这一边界层，而Voyager 2可能已经穿越了这一边界层进入了从未与太阳连接的磁场和等离子体区域，即非常局部的星际介质。<br /> <div>
Voyager 1 and 2 data from the vicinity of the heliopause and very local interstellar medium are reexamined to better understand the confounding lack of rotation in the magnetic field (B-field) across the heliopause observed by both Voyagers, despite their very large spatial separations (&gt;100 au). Using three estimates for the orientation of the B-field in the pristine interstellar medium and four models of the heliosphere, we calculate draped interstellar B-field orientations along the model heliopauses and compare those estimates to the Voyager observations. At both Voyagers, expected draped B-fields are inconsistent with the observed B-field orientations after the boundary crossings. Furthermore, we show how the longer-term trends of the observed B-fields at both Voyagers after the crossings actually rotated away from both the expected draped B-field and the pristine interstellar B-field directions. We develop evidence, including an illustrative and analogous set of observations from Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft along Earth’s magnetopause, in support of a hypothesis that both Voyagers transited a thick boundary layer of reconnected magnetic flux along the heliopause surface. We estimate that Voyager 1 has not yet fully transited this boundary layer, the radial thickness of which at the Voyager 1 crossing location may be &gt;18 au and likely much thicker. Meanwhile, at Voyager 2's crossing location, the boundary layer is likely much thinner, and for Voyager 2, we present evidence that Voyager 2 might already have transited the boundary layer and entered a region of fields and plasma that were never connected to the Sun—the very local interstellar medium.

We use the first publicly available data from the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope to track magnetic connections from the solar photosphere into the corona. We scrutinize relationships between chromospheric magnetism and bright chromospheric, transition region, and coronal plasmas. In 2022 June, the Visible Spectro-Polarimeter (ViSP) instrument targeted unipolar network within a decaying active region. ViSP acquired rastered scans with longitudinal Zeeman sensitivities of 0.25 Mx cm−2 (Fe i, 630.2 nm) and 0.5 Mx cm−2 (Ca ii, 854.2 nm). ViSP was operated in a “low” resolution mode (0.″214 slit width, spectral resolution { \mathcal R }\approx {\rm{70,000}}) to produce polarization maps over a common area of 105″ × 50″. Data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory and Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph are combined to ask: Why is only a fraction of emerging flux filled with heated plasma? What is the elemental nature of the plasmas? No correlations were found between heated plasma and the properties of chromospheric magnetic fields derived from the weak field approximation, on scales below supergranules. Processes hidden from our observations control plasma heating. While improved magnetic measurements are needed, these data indicate that “the corona is a self-regulating forced system.” Heating depends on the state of the corona, not simply on boundary conditions. Heating models based upon identifiable bipolar fields, including cool loops, tectonics, and observable magnetic reconnection, are refuted for these regions with unipolar chromospheric magnetic fields.

总结:
本文介绍了使用Kalman检测器来改善快速射电暴（FRB）信号检测的灵敏度。Kalman检测器结合了光谱形状信息，基于最优匹配滤波器，并考虑一定的相关带宽，能够提供可比较且独立的FRB探测信息。通过对先前检测到的FRB进行分析，发现Kalman分数的灵敏度提高了20%左右，甚至最高可提高200%。此外，作者还将Kalman检测器应用于FRB 20201124A的数据，并成功检测到之前被忽略的两次重复爆发。最后，作者建议在实时调查中采用从初始流量集成的低显著性软触发的实际实现方法。Kalman检测器有可能显著提高FRB的探测能力，并为了解这些神秘的天体现象的光谱特性提供新的见解。 <div>
Detecting fast radio bursts (FRBs) with frequency-dependent intensity remains a challenge, as existing search algorithms do not account for the spectral shape, potentially leading to nondetections. We propose a novel detection statistic, which we call the Kalman detector, that improves the sensitivity of FRB signal detection by incorporating spectral shape information. The detection statistic is based on an optimal matched filter, marginalizing over all possible intensity functions, weighted by a random walk probability distribution, considering some decorrelation bandwidth. Our analysis of previously detected FRBs demonstrates that the Kalman score provides a comparable yet independent source of information for bursts with significant spectral structure, and the sensitivity improvement is of the order 0%–200% with a median improvement of 20%. We also applied the Kalman detector to existing data from FRB 20201124A and detected two new repeat bursts that were previously missed. Furthermore, we suggest a practical implementation for real-time surveys by employing a low significance soft-trigger from initial flux integration-based detection algorithms. The Kalman detector has the potential to significantly enhance FRB detection capabilities and enable new insights into the spectral properties of these enigmatic astrophysical phenomena.

在这篇研究中，我们对孤立的大质量原恒星G28.20-0.05进行了天体化学诊断研究。我们分析了来自Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array的1.3毫米观测数据，分辨率为0.″2（约1000天文单位）。我们检测到了丰富的物种排放，包括含氧（例如H2CO、CH3OH、CH3OCH3）、含硫（SO2、H2S）和含氮（例如HNCO、NH2CHO、C2H3CN、C2H5CN）的分子。我们讨论了它们的空间分布、物理条件、不同物种之间的相关性以及可能的化学起源。在靠近原恒星的中心区域，我们确定了三个热分子核（HMCs）。HMC1是一个类似环状结构的毫米连续体的一部分，投影到原恒星最近，温度最高约为300K，并且显示出最丰富的谱线。HMC2位于环的另一侧，温度约为250K，并且具有中等的化学复杂性。HMC3则更远一些，投影到大约3000天文单位处，温度较低（约70K），谱线最不丰富。这三个HMC的质量面密度（约10 g cm-2）、数密度（nH约109 cm-3）和质量均为几个太阳质量。核心和3000天文单位范围内的气体总质量约为25太阳质量，与中心原恒星的质量相当。根据激发能量的峰值线强度的空间分布，我们推断HMCs受到原恒星的外部加热。我们估算了检测到的物种的柱密度和丰度，并讨论了对热核天体化学的影响。
<br /><br />总结: 本研究利用Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array对孤立的大质量原恒星G28.20-0.05进行了天体化学诊断。通过分析1.3毫米观测数据，检测到了丰富的分子排放，包括含氧、含硫和含氮的分子。在靠近原恒星的中心区域确定了三个热分子核（HMCs），并进行了详细的空间分布和化学条件的研究。研究结果对热核天体化学具有重要意义。 <div>
We study the astrochemical diagnostics of the isolated massive protostar G28.20-0.05. We analyze data from Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array 1.3 mm observations with a resolution of 0.″2 (∼1000 au). We detect emission from a wealth of species, including oxygen-bearing (e.g., H2CO, CH3OH, CH3OCH3), sulfur-bearing (SO2, H2S), and nitrogen-bearing (e.g., HNCO, NH2CHO, C2H3CN, C2H5CN) molecules. We discuss their spatial distributions, physical conditions, correlation between different species, and possible chemical origins. In the central region near the protostar, we identify three hot molecular cores (HMCs). HMC1 is part of a millimeter continuum ring-like structure, is closest in projection to the protostar, has the highest temperature of ∼300 K, and shows the most line-rich spectra. HMC2 is on the other side of the ring, has a temperature of ∼250 K, and is of intermediate chemical complexity. HMC3 is further away, ∼3000 au in projection, cooler (∼70 K), and is the least line-rich. The three HMCs have similar mass surface densities (∼10 g cm−2), number densities (nH ∼ 109 cm−3), and masses of a few solar masses. The total gas mass in the cores and in the region out to 3000 au is ∼25 M⊙, which is comparable to that of the central protostar. Based on spatial distributions of peak line intensities as a function of excitation energy, we infer that the HMCs are externally heated by the protostar. We estimate column densities and abundances of the detected species and discuss the implications for hot core astrochemistry.

观测到了一个红移为3的极端红色和本质上明亮的类星体SDSSJ1652 + 1728，发现了该类星体产生的强大的星系尺度的流出现象。观测显示这个高速流出现象延伸至距离类星体约10千秒差距远的地方，速度偏移为正负500千米每秒，高速度分散700-2400千米每秒。利用近红外光谱仪的表面亮度灵敏度，清晰地展示了极端红色类星体中的高速流出现象包含了主宇宙中介质的大片区域。通过光学发射线的动力学分析，估算出温暖离子化相的质量流出率至少为2300±1400太阳质量每年。流量动量比接近1，表明流出现象很可能是在高电子密度环境中通过对尘埃颗粒的辐射压力驱动的。类星体和流出现象的耦合效率为0.1%，与负反馈所需的最小耦合效率相匹配。流出现象具有足够的能量来驱动观测到的动荡，这很可能直接导致延长气体有效冷却所需的时间。<br /><br />总结: 观测到了红移为3的极端红色和本质上明亮的类星体SDSSJ1652 + 1728产生的强大星系尺度的流出现象，并量化了流出现象的动力学特征，揭示了流出现象对气体动荡的影响，以及流出现象产生的能量和动量。流出现象显示出与类星体辐射耦合的效率，以及对负反馈的最小要求。 <div>
Quasar-driven galactic outflows are a major driver of the evolution of massive galaxies. We report observations of a powerful galactic-scale outflow in a z = 3 extremely red and intrinsically luminous (Lbol ≃ 5 × 1047erg s−1) quasar SDSSJ1652 + 1728 with the Near-infrared Spectrograph on board JWST. We analyze the kinematics of rest-frame optical emission lines and identify the quasar-driven outflow extending out to ∼10 kpc from the quasar with a velocity offset of (vr = ± 500 km s−1) and high velocity dispersion (FWHM = 700–2400 km s−1). Due to JWST’s unprecedented surface brightness sensitivity in the near-infrared, we unambiguously show that the powerful high velocity outflow in an extremely red quasar encompasses a large swath of the host galaxy’s interstellar medium. Using the kinematics and dynamics of optical emission lines, we estimate the mass outflow rate—in the warm ionized phase alone—to be at least 2300 ± 1400 M⊙ yr−1. We measure a momentum flux ratio between the outflow and the quasar accretion disk of ∼1 on a kpc scale, indicating that the outflow was likely driven in a relatively high (&gt;1023cm−2) column density environment through radiation pressure on dust grains. We find a coupling efficiency between the bolometric luminosity of the quasar and the outflow of 0.1%, matching the theoretical prediction of the minimum coupling efficiency necessary for negative quasar feedback. The outflow has sufficient energetics to drive the observed turbulence seen in shocked regions of the quasar host galaxy, which are likely directly responsible for prolonging the time that it takes for gas to cool efficiently.

<div> RS Ophiuchi, recurrent nova, eruption, X-ray spectrum, NICER
总结:
RS Ophiuchi是一颗周期性新星，2021年8月8日经历了最新的喷发，同时产生了可检测到的GeV和TeV辐射。通过对其X射线频谱进行广泛监测，使用了Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer Mission（NICER）来模拟X射线光谱，并探测了整个2021年喷发期间的冲击条件。在前5天内，温度显示出了峰值约为24keV的非平衡等离子体。吸收率的变化显示出喷发期间冲击区域的几何演变，最初是与一些密集的赤道壳相互作用，后来与极区的较少密集的物质相互作用。这些发现表明喷发物质与初始时一些密集的赤道壳相互作用，并且在喷发后期与极区的较少密集的物质发生相互作用。 <div>
The recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi (RS Oph) underwent its most recent eruption on 2021 August 8 and became the first nova to produce both detectable GeV and TeV emission. We used extensive X-ray monitoring with the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer Mission (NICER) to model the X-ray spectrum and probe the shock conditions throughout the 2021 eruption. The rapidly evolving NICER spectra consisted of both line and continuum emission that could not be accounted for using a single-temperature collisional equilibrium plasma model with an absorber that fully covered the source. We successfully modeled the NICER spectrum as a nonequilibrium ionization collisional plasma with partial covering absorption. The temperature of the nonequilibrium plasma shows a peak on day 5 with a kT of approximately 24 keV. The increase in temperature during the first five days could have been due to increasing contribution to the X-ray emission from material behind fast polar shocks or a decrease is the amount of energy being drained from the shocks into particle acceleration during that period. The absorption showed a change from fully covering the source to having a covering fraction of roughly 0.4, suggesting a geometrical evolution of the shock region within the complex global distribution of the circumstellar material. These findings show evidence of the ejecta interacting with some dense equatorial shell initially, and with less dense material in the bipolar regions at later times during the eruption.

<title>Neutrinos and Gamma Rays from Galaxy Clusters Constrained by the Upper Limits of IceCube</title>

Clusters of galaxies possess the capability to accelerate cosmic rays (CRs) to very high energy up to ∼1018 eV due to their large size and magnetic field strength, which favor CR confinement for cosmological times. During their confinement, they can produce neutrinos and γ-rays out of interactions with the background gas and photon fields. In recent work, Hussain et al. have conducted three-dimensional cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulations of the turbulent intracluster medium combined with multidimensional Monte Carlo simulations of CR propagation for redshifts ranging from z ∼ 5 to z = 0 to study the multimessenger emission from these sources. They found that when CRs with a spectral index in the range 1.5–2.5 and cutoff energy {E}_{\max }={10}^{16}\mbox{--}{10}^{17} eV are injected into the system, they make significant contributions to the diffuse background emission of both neutrinos and γ-rays. In this work, we have revisited this model and undertaken further constraints on the parametric space. This was achieved by incorporating the recently established upper limits on neutrino emission from galaxy clusters, as obtained by the IceCube experiment. We find that for CRs injected with spectral indices in the range 2.0–2.5, cutoff energy {E}_{\max }={10}^{16}\mbox{--}{10}^{17} eV, and power corresponding to (0.1–1)% of the cluster luminosity, our neutrino flux aligns with the upper limits estimated by IceCube. Additionally, the resulting contribution from clusters to the diffuse γ-ray background remains significant with values of the order of ∼10−5 MeV cm−2 s−1 sr−1 at energies above 500 GeV.

<title>WASP-69b’s Escaping Envelope Is Confined to a Tail Extending at Least 7 Rp</title>

Studying the escaping atmospheres of highly irradiated exoplanets is critical for understanding the physical mechanisms that shape the demographics of close-in planets. A number of planetary outflows have been observed as excess H/He absorption during/after transit. Such an outflow has been observed for WASP-69b by multiple groups that disagree on the geometry and velocity structure of the outflow. Here, we report the detection of this planet’s outflow using Keck/NIRSPEC for the first time. We observed the outflow 1.28 hr after egress until the target set, demonstrating the outflow extends at least 5.8 × 105 km or 7.5 Rp This detection is significantly longer than previous observations, which report an outflow extending ∼2.2 planet radii just 1 yr prior. The outflow is blueshifted by −23 km s−1 in the planetary rest frame. We estimate a current mass-loss rate of 1 M⊕ Gyr−1. Our observations are most consistent with an outflow that is strongly sculpted by ram pressure from the stellar wind. However, potential variability in the outflow could be due to time-varying interactions with the stellar wind or differences in instrumental precision.

<div> 关键词: LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA, O4, kilonova, DECam, gravitational-wave

总结: <br /><br />这篇文章讨论了在未来的LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA观测运行O4中最佳地识别所有通过引力波发射探测到的kilonovae的问题。他们提出了DECam在O4期间的优化观测策略，并基于引力波事件和宽先验kilonova模拟进行了研究。他们优化了策略以确认kilonova，同时最大程度地减少望远镜时间。通过优化策略，他们发现DECam对于银河系引力波探测极限（190Mpc）处的电磁对应物的发现概率约为80％，相比之前的策略提高了约30％。对于更遥远的事件（约330Mpc），发现概率达到约60％，增加了约2倍。对于更亮的kilonova模型，他们发现在330Mpc的范围内可以达到约90％的发现概率，而且还可以减少大约20％的望远镜观测时间。 <div>
We address the problem of optimally identifying all kilonovae detected via gravitational-wave emission in the upcoming LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA observing run, O4, which is expected to be sensitive to a factor of ∼7 more binary neutron star (BNS) alerts than previously. Electromagnetic follow-up of all but the brightest of these new events will require &gt;1 m telescopes, for which limited time is available. We present an optimized observing strategy for the DECam during O4. We base our study on simulations of gravitational-wave events expected for O4 and wide-prior kilonova simulations. We derive the detectabilities of events for realistic observing conditions. We optimize our strategy for confirming a kilonova while minimizing telescope time. For a wide range of kilonova parameters, corresponding to a fainter kilonova compared to GW170817/AT 2017gfo, we find that, with this optimal strategy, the discovery probability for electromagnetic counterparts with the DECam is ∼80% at the nominal BNS gravitational-wave detection limit for O4 (190 Mpc), which corresponds to an ∼30% improvement compared to the strategy adopted during the previous observing run. For more distant events (∼330 Mpc), we reach an ∼60% probability of detection, a factor of ∼2 increase. For a brighter kilonova model dominated by the blue component that reproduces the observations of GW170817/AT 2017gfo, we find that we can reach ∼90% probability of detection out to 330 Mpc, representing an increase of ∼20%, while also reducing the total telescope time required to follow up events by ∼20%.

Time-dependent photoionization modeling of warm absorber (WA) outflows in active galactic nuclei can play an important role in understanding the interaction between WAs and the central black hole. The WA may be out of the equilibrium state because of the variable nature of the central continuum. In this paper, with the help of time dependent photoionization modeling, we study how the WA gas properties change with time and how it reacts to changing radiation fields. Incorporating a flaring incident light curve, we investigate the behavior of WAs using a photoionization code that simultaneously and consistently solves the time-dependent equations of level population, heating and cooling, and radiative transfer. We simulate the physical processes in the gas clouds, such as ionization, recombination, heating, cooling, and the transfer of ionizing radiation through the cloud and present high-resolution time-resolved absorption spectra. We demonstrate that time-dependent radiative transfer is important and the calculations that omit this effect quantitatively and systematically underestimate the absorption. Time-dependent photoionization models provide crucial insights into the characteristics of WAs and can be used to constrain their density and spatial distribution.

We report spectroscopic observations of vB 120 (HD 30712), a 5.7 yr astrometric–spectroscopic binary system in the Hyades cluster. We combine our radial velocities with others from the literature, and with existing speckle interferometry measurements, to derive an improved 3D orbit for the system. We infer component masses of M1 = 1.065 ± 0.018 M☉ and M2 = 1.008 ± 0.016 M☉, and an orbital parallax of 21.86 ± 0.15 mas, which we show to be more accurate than the parallax from Gaia DR3. This is the ninth binary or multiple system in the Hyades with dynamical mass determinations, and one of the examples with the highest precision. An analysis of its spectral energy distribution yields the absolute radii of the stars, R1 = 0.968 ± 0.012 R☉ and R2 = 0.878 ± 0.013 R☉, and effective temperatures of 5656 ± 56 K and 5489 ± 60 K for the primary and secondary, respectively. A comparison of these properties with the predictions of current stellar evolution models for the known age and metallicity of the cluster shows only minor differences.

总结:<br />
本研究基于Gaia Data Release 3的数据，发现了一些关于双星系统的引力异常现象。在对天体测量和径向速度进行了严格要求的情况下，研究发现了纯粹的双星系统，符合牛顿力学，但在较大距离下却显示出与牛顿预期有明显偏差的运动。这一发现在数据分析中得到了验证，并得出了相应的运动加速度比率，证实了在低加速度下存在引力异常现象。 <div>
It is found that Gaia Data Release 3 binary stars selected with stringent requirements on astrometric measurements and radial velocities naturally satisfy Newtonian dynamics without hidden close companions when the projected separation s ≲ 2 kau, showing that pure binaries can be selected. It is then found that pure binaries selected with the same criteria show a systematic deviation from the Newtonian expectation when s ≳ 2 kau. When both proper motions and parallaxes are required to have precision better than 0.005 and radial velocities better than 0.2, I obtain 2463 statistically pure binaries within a “clean” G-band absolute magnitude range. From this sample, I obtain an observed-to-Newtonian predicted kinematic acceleration ratio of {\gamma }_{g}={g}_{\mathrm{obs}}/{g}_{\mathrm{pred}}={1.49}_{-0.19}^{+0.21} for acceleration ≲10−10 m s−2, in excellent agreement with 1.49 ± 0.07 for a much larger general sample with the amount of hidden close companions self-calibrated. I also investigate the radial profile of stacked sky-projected relative velocities without a deprojection to the 3D space. The observed profile matches the Newtonian predicted profile for s ≲ 2 kau without any free parameters, but shows a clear deviation at a larger separation with a significance of ≈5.0σ. The projected velocity boost factor for s ≳ 5 kau is measured to be {\gamma }_{{v}_{p}}=1.20\pm 0.06 (stat) ±0.05 (sys) matching \sqrt{{\gamma }_{g}}. Finally, for a small sample of 40 binaries with exceptionally precise radial velocities (fractional errors &lt;0.005), the directly measured relative velocities in the 3D space also show a boost at larger separations. These results robustly confirm the recently reported gravitational anomaly at low acceleration for a general sample.

<div> 关键词: Green Peas, Green Beans, [O iii] emission, jets, EELRs

研究调查了具有强烈[O iii]λ5007发射的星系（即绿豆和绿豌豆）受喷流影响的情况。研究样本包括12个附近源（z∼0.04–0.1，其中六个有喷流，六个没有喷流），具有高的[O iii]发光度（L∼1040 erg s−1），这些样本来自于斯隆数字化天空调查和二十厘米射电天空调查观测的射电选择星系样本。我们在每个星系上进行了大双望远镜-多对象双光谱仪的长条谱学观测，沿着两个位置角度进行观测：一个与喷流方向对齐，另一个垂直于喷流方向。通过沿着这些切口追踪[O iii]发射，我们旨在评估狭线区域的延伸并检查喷流的影响。令人惊讶的是，我们的分析显示[O iii]发射的延伸没有首选方向，这表明喷流对延伸的发射线区域（EELRs）影响有限。这也暗示了可能会漏掉与喷流对齐的圆锥形EELRs的检测，这归因于我们的切口方向。此外，我们比较了跟踪星形区域的[O ii]发射与[O iii]的延伸。我们观察到了显著的差异，[O ii]沿着星系平面展示了更大的延伸，这表明[O ii]发射与恒星过程的关联更加强烈。

<br /><br />总结:
1. 研究对象为具有高 [O iii] 发射的星系，分为有喷流和无喷流两组。
2. 使用长条谱学观测评估了狭线区域的延伸，并检查了喷流的影响。
3. 结果显示喷流对延伸的发射线区域影响有限，没有首选方向。
4. 比较了 [O ii] 和 [O iii] 发射的延伸，发现 [O ii] 更与恒星过程关联。
5. 研究结果暗示可能漏掉与喷流对齐的圆锥形 EELRs 的检测。 <div>
We present a study investigating the influence of jets on galaxies exhibiting strong [O iii]λ5007 emission, known as Green Peas and Green Beans. Our sample comprised 12 nearby sources (z ∼ 0.04–0.1, six with jets and six without jets) with high [O iii] luminosity (L ∼ 1040 erg s−1), selected from a radio-selected galaxy sample observed with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and Radio Sky at Twenty-centimeters survey. We perform Large Binocular Telescope–Multi-Object Double Spectrograph long-slit spectroscopy at two position angles for each galaxy: one aligned with the jet direction and another perpendicular to it. By tracing the [O iii] emission along these slits, we aimed to assess the extension of the narrow line region and examine the impact of jets. Surprisingly, our analysis revealed no preferred direction for the extension of the [O iii] emission, indicating that jets have a limited influence on the extended emission line regions (EELRs). This also suggests the possibility of missed detection of conical-shaped EELRs aligned with the jets, attributable to our slit orientations. Furthermore, we compared the extension of [O ii] emission, which traces star-forming regions, with that of [O iii]. We observed a significant difference, with [O ii] exhibiting a considerably greater extension along the galactic plane. This suggests a stronger association of [O ii] emission with stellar processes.

总结: <br /><br />此研究对太阳大气层中的横波进行了观测和模拟研究，发现高频率的横波振荡与长时间尺度的颗粒运动有着明显的区别，并提出了它们是通过纵波的模式转换而产生的。研究通过二维磁流体对流模拟，并在底部边界引入了类似p模式的激励源，发现了纵波向横波的能量转移效应，使得横波振荡的振幅和能量通量都得到了显著增加。这些发现为解释日冕的加热过程提供了重要线索。 <div>
Lateral motions of spicules serve as vital indicators of transverse waves in the solar atmosphere, and their study is crucial for understanding the wave-heating process of the corona. Recent observations have focused on high-frequency transverse waves (periods &lt; 100 s), which have the potential to transport sufficient energy for coronal heating. These high-frequency spicule oscillations are distinct from granular motions, which have much longer timescales of 5–10 minutes. Instead, it is proposed that they are generated through the mode conversion from high-frequency longitudinal waves that arise from a shock-steepening process. Therefore, these oscillations may not solely be produced by the horizontal buffeting motions of granulation but also by the leakage of p-mode oscillations. To investigate the contribution of p-modes, our study employs a two-dimensional magneto-convection simulation spanning from the upper convection zone to the corona. During the course of the simulation, we introduce a p-mode-like driver at the bottom boundary. We reveal a notable increase in the mean velocity amplitude of the transverse oscillations in spicules, ranging from 10%–30%, and attribute this to the energy transfer from longitudinal to transverse waves. This effect results in an enhancement of the estimated energy flux by 30%–80%.

<div> Cassini Orbiter, Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph, hydrogen Lyα observations, solar wind, sensitivity decline
<br />
卡西尼轨道飞行器紫外成像光谱仪（UVIS）从1999年到2017年获得了行星间的氢 Lyα 观测数据，其中2004年到2017年的观测数据是在土星轨道上获得的。飞船在土星轨道阶段从太阳圈层中的主要下风和侧风移动到上风位置。研究人员使用现有的热氢密度模型和最近用于研究太阳和日球观测器太阳风各向异性实验数据以及2003年到2004年间选定的卡西尼UVIS观测数据的太阳光照模型进行了所有观测数据分析。他们发现数据和模型之间存在一般的一致性，但有证据表明UVIS Lyα的灵敏度在2002年6月经历一次明显的下降，以及整体上近似线性下降。此前由普赛尔等人进行的工作使用UVIS实验室灵敏度校准拟合了2003年至2004年的UVIS Lyα数据，得出外太阳圈（但在外太阳圈边界进行了过滤）中的氢密度为0.085cm-3的估计值。然而，包括此处发现的灵敏度下降导致修订后的氢密度估计值为nH = 0.14 ± 0.03 cm−3。这一密度估计值与最近根据对新视野号飞船拾取氢离子观测的模型得出的终止冲击附近的中性氢密度估计值为0.127 ± 0.015 cm−3一致。 <br /><br />总结: 卡西尼轨道飞行器通过紫外成像光谱仪对行星间的氢进行观测，发现了UVIS Lyα灵敏度的下降，重新估计了外太阳圈的氢密度，与最近的模型观测结果一致。 <div>
The Cassini Orbiter Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) obtained interplanetary hydrogen Lyα observations from 1999 to 2017, with mid-2004 to 2017 observations obtained from Saturn orbit. During its Saturn orbital phase, the spacecraft moved from mostly downwind and sidewind in the heliosphere to upwind. We analyze the full set of observations with our existing hot hydrogen density model with a solar illumination model most recently used to study Solar and Heliospheric Observatory Solar Wind Anisotropy Experiment data and selected Cassini UVIS observations from 2003 to 2004. We find general agreement between data and model, but with evidence for a decline in UVIS Lyα sensitivity, with a significant decline in 2002 June during a starburn event and an overall roughly linear decline in sensitivity. While earlier work by Pryor et al. fit the UVIS Lyα data from 2003 to 2004 with a hydrogen density in the outer heliosphere (but after filtration at outer heliospheric boundaries) of 0.085  cm−3 using the UVIS laboratory sensitivity calibration, including the sensitivity decline found here leads to a revised hydrogen density estimate of nH = 0.14 ± 0.03 cm−3. This density estimate is consistent with a recent neutral hydrogen density estimate near the termination shock of 0.127 ± 0.015  cm−3 based on models of observations of pick-up hydrogen ions from the New Horizons spacecraft.

<div> PNS, neutrino emission, mass accretion, event rates, neutrino oscillation model
<br /><br />总结:
本研究通过对PNS质量回落至中子星的恒星上的物质吸积，利用完整的玻尔兹曼中微子输运进行中微子辐射-流体动力学模拟，调查了由物质吸积导致的延迟中微子辐射。我们追踪了PNS的吸积流动的时间演化，直到系统达到准稳态。吸积流动中通常形成一个驻波震荡，而震荡半径因物质吸积率和PNS质量而异。在PNS附近（∼10 公里）出现温度急剧增加，表征了中微子的辐射。随着物质吸积率和PNS质量的增加，中微子的发光度和平均能量也会增加。发射的中微子的平均能量在10 ≲ ϵ ≲ 20 MeV范围内，高于PNS冷却模型估计的值（≲10 MeV）。假设恒星型核心崩溃距离为10千秒差距，我们量化了Super-Kamiokande（超级神农）和深地下中微子实验（DUNE）的中微子事件率。估计的检测率远高于背景噪声，并且其能量依赖特征与PNS冷却模型的预期有质的不同。另一个显著特征是中微子辐射对味道的依赖性强，表现出中微子振荡模型的相关性。我们在考虑绝热米克耶夫-斯米尔诺夫-沃尔芬斯坦模型的情况下对其进行估算，结果显示在Super-K和DUNE中，正常和反转质量序列分别提供了大量的中微子探测。因此，Super-K和DUNE同时观测回落中微子将对中微子质量排列提供强有力的约束。 <div>
We investigate the late-time neutrino emission powered by fallback mass accretion onto a protoneutron star (PNS), using neutrino radiation-hydrodynamic simulations with full Boltzmann neutrino transport. We follow the time evolution of the accretion flow onto the PNS until the system reaches a quasi-steady state. A standing shock wave is commonly formed in the accretion flow, whereas the shock radius varies depending on the mass accretion rate and the PNS mass. A sharp increase in temperature emerges in the vicinity of the PNS (∼10 km), which characterizes neutrino emission. Both the neutrino luminosity and the average energy become higher with increasing mass accretion rate and PNS mass. The mean energy of the emitted neutrinos is in the range of 10 ≲ ϵ ≲ 20 MeV, which is higher than that estimated from PNS cooling models (≲10 MeV). Assuming a distance to core-collapse supernova of 10 kpc, we quantify neutrino event rates for Super-Kamiokande (Super-K) and Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE). The estimated detection rates are well above the background, and their energy-dependent features are qualitatively different from those expected from PNS cooling models. Another notable feature is that the neutrino emission is strongly flavor dependent, exhibiting that the neutrino event rate hinges on the neutrino oscillation model. We estimate them in the case with the adiabatic Mikheev–Smirnov–Wolfenstein model, and show that the normal and inverted mass hierarchy offer a large number of neutrino detections in Super-K and DUNE, respectively. Hence the simultaneous observation with Super-K and DUNE of fallback neutrinos will provide a strong constraint on the neutrino mass hierarchy.

<div> sunspot umbrae, wave patterns, observational properties, oscillation period, wave propagation
<br /><br />总结:
本文通过对太阳黑子中的螺旋波型的观测数据统计，得出了一些物理信息。研究发现螺旋波型的形成是由轴对称和非轴对称的黑子振动模式叠加而成。统计结果显示，从2013年到2018年，共检测到了241个螺旋波型，其中大部分只有一个螺旋臂。这些波型的振动周期和寿命与传统的黑子振动相当，没有明显的区别。另外，研究还发现螺旋波型的性质与太阳半球、纬度和黑子大小无关。通过对螺旋波型的视向速度和波传播模型的分析，得出螺旋波型可能在距离太阳光球表面2至11 Mm的地方产生，平均值约为6 Mm。 <div>
Spiral-shaped wave patterns (SWPs) observed in sunspot umbrae represent the superposition of axisymmetric patterns and nonaxisymmetric patterns of umbral oscillations. These patterns give us physical information about the source of oscillations below the surface. Here we present the statistics of their observational properties determined from the 304 Å line-intensity data obtained with the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory. From the 2013 to 2018 data set, we examined each of the 496 sunspots near the disk center for 2 hr. As a result, we identified 241 SWPs from 140 sunspots, which corresponds to the detection rate of 0.24 per hour in each sunspot. Most of the SWPs had one spiral arm, 48 SWPs had two arms, and only one had three. The oscillation period was estimated at 151 ± 27 s and the lifetime, at 770 ± 250 s, being comparable to those of conventional umbral oscillations. The rotation period of the SWPs was estimated at 190 ± 69 s for the one-armed SWPs and 299 ± 115 s for the two-armed SWPs. We found that the properties of the SWPs have no dependence on hemisphere, latitude, and sunspot size. From the apparent radial speeds of the SWPs and a simple model of wave propagation, we infer that the SWPs may be generated between 2 and 11 Mm below the photosphere with a mean value of about 6 Mm.

<div> 关键词: Solar Dynamics Observatory, coronal jets, erupting minifilaments, active region, magnetic flux<br />
总结: <br />本文研究了来自太阳活动区和日冕孔区的等离子体射流的特征。研究发现，活动区中的射流源通常被吸收的色球物质所遮挡，而日冕孔区的射流则明显起源于喷发的小丝状物。文章通过观测和磁数据分析得出这一结论，并指出在活动区中，喷发的小丝状物可能会在射流显示出来之前失去小丝状物的特征。研究强调了日冕孔区和活动区射流特征的差异，为太阳活动的物理过程提供了重要参考。 <br /> <div>
Solar quiet- and coronal-hole region coronal jets frequently clearly originate from erupting minifilaments, but active-region jets often lack an obvious erupting-minifilament source. We observe a coronal-jet-productive active region (AR), AR 12824, over 2021 May 22 0–8 UT, primarily using Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) Atmospheric Imaging Array (AIA) EUV images and SDO/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager magnetograms. Jets were concentrated in two locations in the AR: on the south side and on the northwest side of the AR’s lone large sunspot. The south-location jets are oriented so that we have a clear view of the jets’ origin low in the atmosphere: their source is clearly minifilaments erupting from locations showing magnetic flux changes/cancelations. After erupting a projected distance ≲5″ away from their origin site, the minifilaments erupt outward onto far-reaching field as part of the jet’s spire, quickly losing their minifilament character. In contrast, the northwest-location jets show no clear erupting minifilament, but the source site of those jets are obscured along our line of sight by absorbing chromospheric material. EUV and magnetic data indicate that the likely source sites were ≳15″ from where the we first see the jet spire; thus, an erupting minifilament would likely lose its minifilament character before we first see the spire. We conclude that such AR jets could work like non-AR jets, but the erupting-minifilament jet source is often hidden by obscuring material. Another factor is that magnetic eruptions making some AR jets carry only a harder-to-detect comparatively thin (∼1″–2″) minifilament “strand.”

<br /><br />总结: GECKO项目旨在快速识别引力波事件的电磁波对应体——巨新星(KN)，并成功使用该策略在O3期间对GW190425进行了观测并发现了十个瞬变现象，但没有找到巨新星。GECKO观测展示了在定位区域约为数百平方度的情况下，可能能够发现距离<200 Mpc的GW170817-like KN。 <div>
One of the keys to the success of multimessenger astronomy is the rapid identification of the electromagnetic wave counterpart, kilonova (KN), of the gravitational-wave (GW) event. Despite its importance, it is hard to find a KN associated with a GW event, due to a poorly constrained GW localization map and numerous signals that could be confused as a KN. Here, we present the Gravitational-wave Electromagnetic wave Counterpart Korean Observatory (GECKO) project, the GECKO observation of GW190425, and prospects of GECKO in the fourth observing run (O4) of the GW detectors. We outline our follow-up observation strategies during O3. In particular, we describe our galaxy-targeted observation criteria that prioritize based on galaxy properties. Armed with this strategy, we performed an optical and/or near-infrared follow-up observation of GW190425, the first binary neutron star merger event during the O3 run. Despite a vast localization area of 7460 deg2, we observed 621 host galaxy candidates, corresponding to 29.5% of the scores we assigned, with most of them observed within the first 3 days of the GW event. Ten transients were discovered during this search, including a new transient with a host galaxy. No plausible KN was found, but we were still able to constrain the properties of potential KNe using upper limits. The GECKO observation demonstrates that GECKO can possibly uncover a GW170817-like KN at a distance &lt;200 Mpc if the localization area is of the order of hundreds of square degrees, providing a bright prospect for the identification of GW electromagnetic wave counterparts during the O4 run.

We report the distribution of black hole (BH) masses and Eddingont ratios estimated for a sample of 131 low luminosity quasars in the early cosmic epoch (5.6 &lt; z &lt; 7.0). Our work is based on the Subaru High-z Exploration of Low-Luminosity Quasars (SHELLQs) project, which has constructed a low luminosity quasar sample down to M1450 ∼ − 21 mag, exploiting the survey data of Hyper Suprime-Cam installed on Subaru Telescope. The discovery spectra of these quasars are limited to the rest-frame wavelengths of ∼1200–1400 Å, which contain no emission lines that can be used as BH mass estimators. In order to overcome this problem, we made use of low-z counterpart spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, which are spectrally matched to the high-z spectra in overlapping wavelengths. We then combined the C iv emission line widths of the counterparts with the continuum luminosity from the SHELLQs data to estimate BH masses. The resulting BH mass distribution has a range of ∼107–10M⊙, with most of the quasars having BH masses ∼108M⊙ with sub-Eddington accretion. The present study provides not only a new insight into normal quasars in the reionization epoch, but also a new promising way to estimate BH masses of high-z quasars without near-infrared spectroscopy.

<br /><br />总结:
本研究利用二维全粒子动力学电磁粒子模拟，针对在典型日冕条件下弱磁化等离子体中的高次谐波发射过程进行了研究。研究发现，较大的束流速度有利于产生更高次谐波的辐射，并且随着谐波序数的增加，辐射强度递减。此外，H3辐射主要通过H2辐射与朗道波的合并生成，而H4辐射主要来源于H3辐射与正向/反向传播的朗道波的合并。这些发现有助于揭示高次谐波辐射的产生机制。 <div>
Electromagnetic radiation at higher harmonics of the plasma frequency (ω ∼ nωpe, n &gt; 2) has been occasionally observed in type II and type III solar radio bursts, yet the underlying mechanism remains undetermined. Here we present two-dimensional fully kinetic electromagnetic particle-in-cell simulations with high spectral resolution to investigate the beam-driven plasma emission process in weakly magnetized plasmas of typical coronal conditions. We focused on the generation mechanisms of high-harmonic emission. We found that a larger beam velocity (ud) favors the generation of the higher-harmonic emission. The emissions grow later for higher harmonics and decrease in intensity by ∼2 orders of magnitude for each jump of the harmonic number. The second and third harmonic (H2 and H3) emissions get closer in intensity with larger ud. We also show that (1) the H3 emission is mainly generated via the coalescence of the H2 emission with the Langmuir waves, i.e., H2 + L → H3, wherein the coalescence with the forward-propagating beam-Langmuir wave leads to the forward-propagating H3, and coalescence with the backward-propagating Langmuir wave leads to the backward-propagating H3; and (2) the H4 emission mainly arises from the coalescence of the H3 emission with the forward- (backward-)propagating Langmuir wave, in terms of H3 + L → H4.

We report on integral field unit (IFU) measurements of the host of the radio source 4C+37.11. This massive elliptical contains the only resolved double compact nucleus at parsec-scale separation, likely a bound supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB). i-band photometry and GMOS-N IFU spectroscopy show that the galaxy has a large rb = 1.″5 core and that the stellar velocity dispersion increases inside of a radius of influence rSOI ≈ 1.″3. Jeans Anisotropic Modeling analysis of the core infers a total SMBHB mass of {2.8}_{-0.8}^{+0.8}\times {10}^{10}{M}_{\odot }, making this one of the most massive black hole systems known. Our data indicate that there has been significant scouring of the central kiloparsec of the host galaxy.

总结: 
该研究在SDSS Data Release 12中针对活动星系核（AGN）的Type-1和Type-2进行了电子密度（ne）的比较。研究发现Type-1 AGN的NLRs中的ne要高于Type-2 AGN，并提出了AGN活动时间长、导致更多电子注入NLRs的可能解释，以及Type-2 AGN中更强烈的星形成贡献导致ne较低的可能解释。这些结果对广泛认可的AGN统一模型提出了有趣的挑战。<br /><br /> <div>
In the manuscript, we check properties of electron densities ne traced by flux ratio Rsii of [S ii]λ6716 Å to [S ii]λ6731 Å in narrow emission line regions (NLRs) between Type-1 active galactic nucleus (AGN) and Type-2 AGN in SDSS Data Release 12 (DR12). Under the framework of unified model considering kiloparsec-scale structures, similar ne in NLRs should be expected between Type-1 AGN and Type-2 AGN. Based on reliable measurements of the [S ii] doublet with measured parameters at least 5 times larger than corresponding uncertainties, there are 6039 Type-1 AGN and 8725 Type-2 AGN (excluding the Type-2 LINERs and the composite galaxies) collected from SDSS DR12. Then, lower Rsii (higher ne) in NLRs can be well confirmed in Type-1 AGN than in Type-2 AGN, with the confidence level higher than 5σ, even after considering the necessary effects including effects of electron temperatures traced by [O iii]λ4364,4959,5007 Å on estimating ne in NLRs. Two probable methods are proposed to explain the higher ne in NLRs in Type-1 AGN. First, the higher ne in NLRs of Type-1 AGN could indicate longer time durations of AGN activities in Type-1 AGN than in Type-2 AGN, if AGN activities triggering galactic-scale outflows leading to more electrons injecting into NLRs were accepted to explain the higher ne in NLRs of Type-2 AGN than H ii galaxies. Second, the lower ne in NLRs of Type-2 AGN could be explained by stronger star-forming contributions in Type-2 AGN, considering lower ne in H ii regions. The results provide interesting challenges to the commonly and widely accepted unified model of AGN.

The chromatic contamination that arises from photospheric heterogeneities, e.g., spots and faculae on the host star presents a significant noise source for exoplanet transmission spectra. If this contamination is not corrected for, it can introduce substantial bias in our analysis of the planetary atmosphere. We utilize two stellar models of differing complexity, StARPA (Stellar Activity Removal for Planetary Atmospheres) and ASteRA (Active Stellar Retrieval Algorithm), to explore the biases introduced by stellar contamination in retrieval under differing degrees of stellar activity. We use the retrieval framework TauREx3 and a grid of 27 synthetic, spot-contaminated transmission spectra to investigate potential biases and to determine how complex our stellar models must be in order to accurately extract the planetary parameters from transmission spectra. The input observation is generated using the more complex model (StARPA), in which the spot latitude is an additional, fixable parameter. This observation is then fed into a combined stellar-planetary retrieval, which contains a simplified stellar model (ASteRA). Our results confirm that the inclusion of stellar activity parameters in retrieval minimizes bias under all activity regimes considered. ASteRA performs very well under low-to-moderate activity conditions, retrieving the planetary parameters with a high degree of accuracy. For the most active cases, characterized by larger, higher-temperature contrast spots, some minor residual bias remains due to ASteRA neglecting the interplay between the spot and the limb-darkening effect. As a result of this, we find larger errors in retrieved planetary parameters for central spots (0°) and those found close to the limb (60°) than those at intermediate latitudes (30°).

事件视界望远镜合作团队首次发布了对M87*和Sgr A*超大质量黑洞的单位视界图像，并提供了其周围物理条件的初步信息。他们使用三维广义相对论磁流体力学模拟与观测进行比较，初步约束了这些黑洞时空的特性。然而，由于观测辐射在改变等离子体和时空特性时产生的退化，准确区分吸积流的性质和时空特性仍具有挑战性。下一代事件视界望远镜观测预计将通过探索盘-喷流动力学的复杂相互作用来消除一些这些退化。GRMHD模拟和广义相对论辐射传输的计算结果显示，喷流的径向和方位动态与黑洞自旋密切相关。基于ngEHT对M87*的分辨率和图像重建能力，我们能够评估这种相关性的检测性和相关的不确定性。总的来说，我们的结果有助于评估未来事件视界望远镜观测来约束黑洞自旋的前景。 <br /><br />总结: 超大质量黑洞M87*和Sgr A*的首张单位视界图像的发布和通过GRMHD模拟研究黑洞自旋的相关性，有望为未来事件视界望远镜观测提供了约束黑洞自旋的前景。 <div>
The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) Collaboration has recently published the first horizon-scale images of the supermassive black holes M87* and Sgr A* and provided some first information on the physical conditions in their vicinity. The comparison between the observations and the three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations has enabled the EHT to set initial constraints on the properties of these black hole spacetimes. However, accurately distinguishing the properties of the accretion flow from those of the spacetime, most notably, the black hole mass and spin, remains challenging because of the degeneracies the emitted radiation suffers when varying the properties of the plasma and those of the spacetime. The next-generation EHT (ngEHT) observations are expected to remove some of these degeneracies by exploring the complex interplay between the disk–jet dynamics, which represents one of the most promising tools for extracting information on the black hole spin. By using GRMHD simulations of magnetically arrested disks and general relativistic radiative transfer (GRRT) calculations of the emitted radiation, we have studied the properties of the jet and the accretion disk dynamics on spatial scales that are comparable with the horizon. In this way, we are able to highlight that the radial and azimuthal dynamics of the jet are well correlated with the black hole spin. Based on the resolution and image reconstruction capabilities of the ngEHT observations of M87*, we can assess the detectability and associated uncertainty of this correlation. Overall, our results serve to assess the prospects for constraining the black hole spin with future EHT observations.

<div> late-M and L dwarfs, metallicity, J-K color, correlation, Drift-Phoenix

总结:
本研究分析了64个benchmark late-M和L矮星的金属丰度和J-K颜色之间的关系，发现它们显示出正相关性。对比实验结果和Drift-Phoenix模型预测的关系，发现金属丰度越高的天体在光度上表现更红。作者推测这是因为更高的金属丰度导致了这些大气层中更多的凝结物形成，使得这些超冷矮星在光度上显得更红。 <div>
We examine the relationship between metallicity and J − K color for 64 benchmark late-M and L dwarfs, all of which are wide companions to higher-mass stars, and six of which are new discoveries. We assess the correlation between the Δ(J − K) color anomaly (the difference in an object’s J − K color from the median color for field objects of the same spectral type) and the metallicity of the host star to investigate how metallicity affects ultracool photospheres. Using Spearman’s rank correlation test and Student’s t-test, the late-M dwarf (L dwarf) sample’s Δ(J − K) and metallicity show a positive correlation at the 95% (90%) confidence level. A linear fit to color anomaly as a function of metallicity finds a slope of 0.17 ± 0.07 for the late-M dwarfs and a slope of {0.20}_{-0.08}^{+0.07} for the L dwarfs. We also computed the Δ(J − K) versus metallicity relationship predicted by multi-metallicity model spectra generated using Drift-Phoenix. The modeled late-M dwarfs show a slope of 0.202 ± 0.03, which is close to our observational results, but the modeled L dwarfs show a slope of 0.493 ± 0.02, steeper than our observational results. Both our empirical results and the models indicate that more metal-rich objects should appear redder photometrically. We speculate that higher metallicity drives more condensate formation in these atmospheres, thus making these ultracool dwarfs appear redder.

总结:
本研究利用JWST观测到的347个红移在4 < z < 9.5的星系，采用二维参数模型进行分析，测量星系的整体结构参数并量化其在真实光学波段的全局特性。研究着重于得出包括宇宙表面亮度衰减和分辨率影响在内的可靠不确定性。根据全局Sérsic指数(n < 1.5)和观测轴比(q < 0.6)的指导，我们将星系的旋盘现象的发生率保守地下限定为约45%。在4 < z < 9.5的红移范围内，星系的真实光学波段亮度和有效半径之间存在关系，分别在4 < z < 5和5 ≤ z < 9.5的区间内，具有相似的斜率，但较高红移区间的截距略低一些(Re = 0.69 ± 0.05 kpc)，而低红移区间的为(Re = 0.91 ± 0.04 kpc)。在目前样本规模的限制下，我们发现在这些早期时期，n或Re并没有显著的红移演化。 <div>
We analyze 347 galaxies at redshift 4 &lt; z &lt; 9.5 using JWST observations from the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) program by simultaneously fitting a two-dimensional parametric model to the seven-filter Near Infrared Camera images to measure the overall structural parameters and quantify the global properties of the galaxies in the rest-frame optical band. Particular attention is devoted to deriving robust uncertainties that include, among other factors, the influence of cosmological surface brightness dimming and resolution effects. Using the global Sérsic index (n &lt; 1.5) and observed axial ratio (q &lt; 0.6) as a guide, we place a conservative lower limit of ∼45% on the incidence of galactic disks. Galaxies follow a relation between the rest-frame optical luminosity and effective radius in the redshift range 4 &lt; z &lt; 9.5, as well as separately over the intervals 4 &lt; z &lt; 5 and 5 ≤ z &lt; 9.5, with a very similar slope but a marginally lower zero-point in the higher-redshift bin (Re = 0.69 ± 0.05 kpc) compared to the lower-redshift bin (Re = 0.91 ± 0.04 kpc). Within the limitations of the current sample size, we find no significant redshift evolution of n or Re at these early epochs.

<br /><br />总结:
本研究利用强引力透镜效应的时间延迟距离来锚定宇宙距离，结合类星体作为辅助探测器，使用模型无关的方法确定哈勃常数H0。通过模拟数据集和高斯过程回归，我们展示了利用高红移的类星体可以扩展SNe Ia的红移范围，提高强透镜时间延迟距离测量的精确度。在时间延迟距离不确定性为距离数值的5%时，我们将H0的估计精度从2.1%提高到1.3%。 <div>
Absolute distances from strong lensing can anchor Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) at cosmological distances giving a model-independent inference of the Hubble constant (H0). Future observations could provide strong lensing time-delay distances with source redshifts up to z  ≃  4, which are much higher than the maximum redshift of SNe Ia observed so far. In order to make full use of time-delay distances measured at higher redshifts, we use quasars as a complementary cosmic probe to measure cosmological distances at redshifts beyond those of SNe Ia and provide a model-independent method to determine H0. In this work, we demonstrate a model-independent, joint constraint of SNe Ia, quasars, and time-delay distances from strong lensed quasars. We first generate mock data sets of SNe Ia, quasar, and time-delay distances based on a fiducial cosmological model. Then, we calibrate the quasar parameters model independently using Gaussian process (GP) regression with mock SNe Ia data. Finally, we determine the value of H0 model-independently using GP regression from mock quasars and time-delay distances from strong lensing systems. As a comparison, we also show the H0 results obtained from mock SNe Ia in combination with time-delay lensing systems whose redshifts overlap with SNe Ia. Our results show that quasars at higher redshifts show great potential to extend the redshift coverage of SNe Ia and thus enable the full use of strong lens time-delay distance measurements from ongoing cosmic surveys and improve the accuracy of the estimation of H0 from 2.1% to 1.3% when the uncertainties of the time-delay distances are 5% of the distance values.

Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the solar corona are often started from a potential field initial condition, which may be far from the true state of the coronal magnetic field. To test the sensitivity of the simulations to the initial condition, an electric-field-driven MHD code was initiated from three different initial conditions: the commonly used potential field, a nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) extrapolation, which is believed to be a better representation of the true coronal magnetic field, and a purely vertical field. After relaxation, the magnetic field in the MHD simulations was compared. It was found that there is a tendency for all of the initial conditions to converge to a similar connectivity, particularly in areas of strong fields that are not close to the boundary, suggesting that the final state of the simulation is not particularly sensitive to the initial condition. The relaxed solution more closely resembles the NLFFF initial condition than the other initial conditions, but still exhibits substantial differences from it.

Interplanetary Type III bursts, generated by relativistic electron beams at solar flare reconnection sites, are explored through an investigation of 152 instances observed by the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory mission. This study reveals that the absolute values of the wavevector deviations from the Sun–spacecraft line are statistically 3.72 and 2.10 larger than predicted by the density model, assuming fundamental and harmonic emission, respectively. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we examine the impact of scattering by density inhomogeneities on the apparent locations of radio emissions in the interplanetary medium. The findings indicate that relative density fluctuations of 0.40 can account for the observed angular shift, a conclusion supported by the multiple flux-tube solar wind model, which confirms the presence of such magnitude of relative perpendicular density fluctuations in the solar wind. We propose a wavevector correction that incorporates this effect to enhance the triangulation of interplanetary Type III bursts, demonstrating that radio triangulation, with this correction, can reliably track electron beams in the interplanetary medium.

Recent advances in photon detectors have provided exceptional sensitivities to dark matter with high angular resolution. Motivated by this, we present a detailed study of photon flux from dark matter decay in dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) by focusing on the detectors with arcsecond-level field of view and/or angular resolution. We propose to use differential D-factors since such detectors are sensitive to their dark matter distributions. We carefully estimate the differential D-factors of 35 dSphs. By using the differential D-factors, it turns out that the resulting signal flux can have a more than { \mathcal O }(1–10) enhancement compared to conventional estimations. Based on this analysis, we find that the Infrared Camera and Spectrograph (IRCS) installed on the 8.2 m Subaru Telescope can be an excellent dark matter detector for the mass in the eV range, particularly axion-like particles (ALPs). Observing the Draco or Ursa Major II dSphs with the IRCS for { \mathcal O }(1) night will enable us to place the most stringent bound for the ALP dark matter in the mass range of 1 eV ≲ ma ≲ 2 eV.

We present the results from a pair of high-resolution, long-timescale (∼105GM/c3), global, three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical accretion disk simulations with differing initial magnetic plasma β in order to study the effects of the initial toroidal field strength on the production of a large-scale poloidal field. We initialize our disks in approximate equilibrium with purely toroidal magnetic fields of strength β0 = 5 and 200. We also perform a limited resolution study. We find that simulations of differing field strengths diverge early in their evolution and remain distinct over the time studied, indicating that the initial magnetic conditions leave a persistent imprint in our simulations. Neither simulation enters the magnetically arrested disk regime. Both simulations are able to produce poloidal fields from initially toroidal fields, with the β0 = 5 simulation evolving clear signs of a large-scale poloidal field. We make a cautionary note that computational artifacts in the form of large-scale vortices may be introduced in the combination of initially weak field and disk-internal mesh refinement boundaries, as evidenced by the production of an m = 1 mode overdensity in the weak field simulation. Our results demonstrate that the initial toroidal field strength plays a vital role in the simulated disk evolution for the models studied.

这项研究使用ACT和WISE的观测数据进行了交叉相关分析，发现了在WISE×ACT TT交叉功率谱中30σ显著性的空间各向同性信号，被解释为ACT频率下的宇宙红外背景与WISE中的多环芳烃（PAH）发射的相关性。在银河系内，观测到星际尘埃光谱在范围103 < ℓ < 104内通常可以用幂律描述，但在一些地区表现出幂律指数的可变性和非幂律行为。研究还发现在35个不同的∼100平方度天空区域中，WISE总强度和ACT E模极化之间存在正相关关系，表明银河密度结构与局部磁场的对齐性在这些区域保持到亚秒尺度。TE谱在所有107个区域中的分布偏向于正值，而TB谱没有这种偏向。这项工作是迄今为止对银河尘埃TE光谱的高ℓ测量，表明与高分辨率中红外观测尘埃辐射的交叉相关是约束毫米波长度下尘埃发射空间统计的有效工具。 <div>
We present a cross-correlation analysis between 1^{\prime} resolution total intensity and polarization observations from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) at 150 and 220 GHz and 15″ mid-infrared photometry from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) over 107 12.°5 × 12.°5 patches of sky. We detect a spatially isotropic signal in the WISE×ACT TT cross-power spectrum at 30σ significance that we interpret as the correlation between the cosmic infrared background at ACT frequencies and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission from galaxies in WISE, i.e., the cosmic PAH background. Within the Milky Way, the Galactic dust TT spectra are generally well described by power laws in ℓ over the range 103  &lt;  ℓ  &lt;  104, but there is evidence both for variability in the power-law index and for non-power-law behavior in some regions. We measure a positive correlation between WISE total intensity and ACT E-mode polarization at 1000  &lt;  ℓ  ≲  6000 at &gt;3σ in each of 35 distinct ∼100 deg2 regions of the sky, suggesting that alignment between Galactic density structures and the local magnetic field persists to subparsec physical scales in these regions. The distribution of TE amplitudes in this ℓ range across all 107 regions is biased to positive values, while there is no evidence for such a bias in the TB spectra. This work constitutes the highest-ℓ measurements of the Galactic dust TE spectrum to date and indicates that cross-correlation with high-resolution mid-infrared measurements of dust emission is a promising tool for constraining the spatial statistics of dust emission at millimeter wavelengths.

总结: <br /><br />这项研究观察了NOAA活跃区13023中两个相邻的太阳黑子、它们之间的间隙以及大量从间隙和太阳黑子外沿传播出的磁特征。研究发现，磁场倾斜角度不同的磁特征(MMFs)可以分为垂直型和水平型，其磁通量生成速率平均比太阳黑子的磁通量丢失速率高出5.6倍。特别是垂直型磁特征的磁通量大约是两个太阳黑子总丢失磁通量的1.4倍。这些观察结果表明，具有垂直磁场的磁特征与太阳黑子的解体密切相关，并且间隙中的磁特征的磁通量约为总磁通量的三分之一，大部分的垂直型磁特征可能直接源自太阳黑子的本质。 <div>
The relationship between the decay of sunspots and moving magnetic features (MMFs) plays an important role in understanding the evolution of active regions. We present observations of two adjacent sunspots, the gap between them, and a lot of MMFs propagating from the gap and the sunspots' outer edges in NOAA Active Region 13023. The MMFs are divided into two types based on their magnetic field inclination angle: vertical (0° &lt; γ &lt; 45°) and horizontal (45° ≤ γ &lt; 90°) MMFs (V-MMFs and H-MMFs, respectively). The main results are as follows: (1) the mean magnetic flux decay rates of the two sunspots are −1.7 × 1020 and −1.4 × 1020 Mx day−1; (2) the magnetic flux generation rate of all MMFs is calculated to be −1.9 × 1021 Mx day−1, which is on average 5.6 times higher than the total magnetic flux loss rate of the sunspots; (3) the magnetic flux of V-MMFs (including a pore separated from the sunspots) is 1.4 times larger than the total lost magnetic flux of the two sunspots, and in a later stage when the pore has passed through the reference ellipse, the magnetic flux generation rate of the V-MMFs is almost the same as the magnetic flux loss rate of the sunspots; and (4) within the gap, the magnetic flux of V-MMFs is one-third of the total magnetic flux. Few V-MMFs stream out from the sunspots at the nongap region. All observations suggest that MMFs with vertical magnetic fields are closely related to the disintegration of the sunspot, and most of the MMFs from the gap may originate directly from the sunspot umbra.

We present the first results from a high-resolution simulation with a focus on galactic wind driving for an isolated galaxy with a halo mass of ∼1011M⊙ (similar to the Large Magellanic Cloud) and a total gas mass of ∼6 × 108M⊙, resulting in ∼108 gas cells at ∼4 M⊙ mass resolution. We adopt a resolved stellar feedback model with nonequilibrium cooling and heating, including photoelectric heating and photoionizing radiation, as well as supernovae, coupled to the second-order meshless finite-mass method for hydrodynamics. These features make this the largest resolved interstellar medium (ISM) galaxy model run to date. We find mean star formation rates around 0.05 M⊙ yr−1 and evaluate typical time-averaged loading factors for mass (ηM ∼ 1.0, in good agreement with recent observations) and energy (ηE ∼ 0.01). The bulk of the mass of the wind is transported by the warm (T &lt; 5 × 105 K) phase, while there is a similar amount of energy transported in the warm and the hot phases (T &gt; 5 × 105 K). We find an average opening angle of 30° for the wind, decreasing with higher altitude above the midplane. The wind mass loading is decreasing (flat) for the warm (hot) phase as a function of the star formation surface rate density ΣSFR, while the energy loading shows inverted trends with ΣSFR, decreasing for the warm wind and increasing for the hot wind, although with very shallow slopes. These scalings are in good agreement with previous simulations of resolved wind driving in the multiphase ISM.

通过使用最小二乘法，从光度、光谱和星震观测中推断了60颗δ Scuti星的模型相关质量、金属丰度和年龄。发现大多数这些星的质量约为1.6太阳质量，金属丰度低于Z = 0.010。观察到了这些星年龄的双峰分布，大多数样本年龄小于30百万年，而其余的被推断为年龄较大，即数亿年。这项工作强调了大频率间隔（Δν）在δ Scuti星研究中的重要性。设计了三种机器学习模型，有望以更低的计算成本和更快的速度推断这些参数。这些模型还揭示了约束偶极模式可以显著改善年龄估计的重要性，径向模式简洁地包含了关于光度和温度的信息。使用机器学习模型，还对在估计质量、金属丰度和年龄时的星体可观测量的重要性进行了定性洞察。有效温度Teff大大影响了所有结构参数的推断，而星震偏移参数ϵ在年龄推断中起着重要作用。 <div>
Asteroseismology is a powerful tool to probe stellar structure. Spaceborne instruments like CoRoT, Kepler, and TESS have observed the oscillations of numerous stars, among which δ Scutis are particularly interesting, owing to their fast rotation and complex pulsation mechanisms. In this work, we inferred model-dependent masses, metallicities, and ages of 60 δ Scuti stars from photometric, spectroscopic, and asteroseismic observations using least-squares minimization. These statistics have the potential to explain why only a tiny fraction of δ Scuti stars pulsate in a very clean manner. We find most of these stars with masses around 1.6 M⊙ and metallicities below Z = 0.010. We observed a bimodality in age for these stars, with more than half the sample younger than 30 Myr, while the remaining ones were inferred to be older, i.e., hundreds of Myrs. This work emphasizes the importance of the large-frequency separation (Δν) in studies of δ Scutis. We also designed three machine-learning (ML) models that hold the potential for inferring these parameters at lower computational cost and much more rapidly. These models further revealed that constraining dipole modes can help in significantly improving age estimation and that radial modes succinctly encode information regarding luminosity and temperature. Using the ML models, we also gained qualitative insight into the importance of stellar observables in estimating mass, metallicity, and age. The effective temperature Teff strongly affects the inference of all structure parameters, and the asteroseismic offset parameter ϵ plays an essential role in the inference of age.

<div> 季节变化，离子沉降，火星大气，磁场，太阳风

总结:<br /><br />这项研究利用火星大气和挥发性物质演化任务的观测结果，研究了离子沉降的季节变化。研究发现，从火星季节Ls 0°–180°到Ls 180°–360°的过渡过程中存在一个减少的模式，表现为沉积离子流量的减少。此外，我们还发现地壳磁场对沉积离子流量的季节变化有重要影响，尤其在地壳磁场呈现强烈水平取向的地区，出现了相反的季节趋势。驱动这种离子沉降季节变化的物理机制可能是质量加载效应，可能减缓太阳风并影响磁排列。未来需要进行更详细的研究。 <div>
We investigate the seasonal variations of ion precipitation, utilizing observations from the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution mission spanning from 2014 January 4 to 2023 February 14. Our analysis reveals that a diminishing pattern characterizes the transition from Mars season Ls 0°–180° to Mars season Ls 180°–360°, manifesting as a reduction in precipitating ion fluxes. Additionally, we discern a significant influence of the crustal magnetic field on the seasonal variations in precipitating ion fluxes. Intriguingly, within regions where the crustal magnetic field exhibits a strong quasi-horizontal orientation, opposite seasonal trends become evident. The underlying physical mechanism driving these seasonal variations in ion precipitation is probably attributed to the mass loading effect that may decelerate the solar wind and influence the magnetic pileup. A detailed investigation is further demanded in the future.

该研究利用Hinode/X射线望远镜观测到的日冕图像，研究了FOV受限情况下排除的辐照率的比例。结果表明，在2022年7月观察到的活跃日冕中，在1.1R⊙内获得的辐照率相比于1.2R⊙和1.7R⊙内获得的辐照率排除了约3.5%和7%。相反，在2009年8月观察到的最小日冕中，排除的比例分别增加到约7%和13%。此外，研究确认了排除比例在太阳活动最低期间最高，并且发现排除比例在太阳活动周期上升阶段略微大于下降阶段。 
<br /><br />总结: 该研究利用Hinode/X射线望远镜观测到的日冕图像，研究了FOV受限情况下排除的辐照率的比例，并发现在太阳活动最低期间和太阳活动周期上升阶段，排除的比例最高。 <div>
Soft X-ray images of the Sun obtained with multiple broadband filters provide a simple and useful method to calculate averaged coronal temperature and emission measure, from which we can further calculate solar X-ray irradiance in physical units, e.g., watts per square meter. However, X-ray telescopes are often designed for pursuing high spatial resolution, and thus the field of view (FOV) of full-Sun images is often limited over the limb, extending to only ∼1.3 R⊙. This indicates that the irradiance obtained from the limited FOV may underestimate the true full-Sun irradiance by failing to count the contribution from outside the FOV. This work uses Hinode/X-Ray Telescope (XRT) coronal images observed up to 1.7 R⊙ to investigate the fraction of irradiance excluded from the FOVs limited in size. The analysis indicates that the irradiance obtained within 1.1 R⊙, which is used for XRT irradiance study, excludes ∼3.5%/∼7% of irradiance relative to the value within 1.2/1.7 R⊙, respectively, for the active corona observed in 2022 July. In contrast, the excluded fraction increases to ∼7%/∼13%, respectively, for the minimum corona observed in 2009 August. To further investigate the dependence of exclusion fraction on the Sun’s activity level, we process mission long Yohkoh/Soft X-ray Telescope full-Sun images to compare the irradiance within 1.1 and 0.9 R⊙ with that obtained from the maximum FOV of 1.2 R⊙. We confirm that the exclusion fraction is the largest in the period around solar minimum. We also find that the average value of exclusion fraction is slightly but measurably larger in the rising phase than the declining phase of the solar cycle.

<div> CH3O, CH2OH radicals, complex organic molecules, interstellar dust, water ice surface
总结:
CH3O和CH2OH自由基是星际尘埃中复杂有机分子(COMs)的重要前体，它们可以产生多种类型的COMs。为了更好地理解不同类型COMs的化学演变，确定CH3O和CH2OH的丰度比至关重要。最近的研究表明，在冰尘表面，CH3OH和OH的反应在形成CH3O和CH2OH自由基中起着重要作用。然而，目前还没有提出这些自由基丰度的定量细节。本文实验确定了在10K下CH3OH + OH反应在水冰表面的分支比(CH3O/CH2OH)为4.3 ± 0.6。此外，反应中产生的CH3O自由基即使在10K的低温下也会参与随后的扩散反应。这一事实对于在冷分子云中COMs形成模型提供了关键信息。 <div>
The CH3O and CH2OH radicals can be important precursors of complex organic molecules (COMs) in interstellar dust. The COMs presumably originating from these radicals were abundantly found in various astronomical objects. Because each radical leads to different types of COMs, determining the abundance ratio of CH3O to CH2OH is crucial for a better understanding of the chemical evolution into various COMs. Recent work suggested that the reaction between CH3OH and OH on ice dust plays an important role in forming CH3O and CH2OH radicals. However, quantitative details on the abundance of these radicals have not been presented to date. Herein, we experimentally determined the branching ratio (CH3O/CH2OH) resulting from the CH3OH + OH reaction on the water ice surface at 10 K to be 4.3 ± 0.6. Furthermore, the CH3O product in the reaction would participate in subsequent diffusive reactions even at a temperature as low as 10 K. This fact should provide critical information for COMs formation models in cold molecular clouds.

<br /><br />总结: <br />该研究探讨了冷木星形成对行星体轨道和系统形成的影响，发现CJ内部行星体系统的形成可能是由于盘中行星体的轨道重分布，这为了解内部行星系统形成机制提供了新的视角。 <div>
The formation of a cold Jupiter (CJ) is expected to quench the influx of pebbles and the migration of cores interior to its orbit, thus limiting the efficiency of rocky planet formation either by pebble accretion and/or orbital migration. Observations, however, show that the presence of outer CJs (&gt;1 au and ≳0.3MJup) correlates with the presence of inner super-Earths (at &lt;1 au). This observation may simply be a result of an enhanced initial reservoir of solids in the nebula required to form a CJ or a yet-to-be-determined mechanism assisted by the presence of the CJ. In this work, we focus on the latter alternative and study the orbital transport of planetesimals interior to a slightly eccentric (∼0.05) CJ subject to the gravity and drag from a viscously evolving gaseous disk. We find that a secular resonance sweeping inward through the disk gradually transports rings of planetesimals when their drag-assisted orbital decay is faster than the speed of the resonance scanning. This snowplow-like process leads to large concentration (boosted by a factor of ∼10–100) of size-segregated planetesimal rings with aligned apsidal lines, making their expected collisions less destructive, due to their reduced velocity dispersion. This process is efficient for a wide range of α-disk models (and thus disk lifetimes) and Jovian masses, peaking for values ∼1–5MJup, which are typical of observed CJs in radial velocity surveys. Overall, our work highlights the major role that the disk's gravity may have on the orbital redistribution of planetesimals, depicting a novel avenue by which CJs may enhance the formation of inner planetary systems, including super-Earths and perhaps even warm and hot Jupiters.

总结:<br />
这篇文章介绍了关于异常型Ia超新星SN 2022pul的星际物质(CSM)相互作用和光谱特征的观测。在光学和中红外波段，SN 2022pul的光变曲线early rise表现出两个不同的部分，与CSM相互作用相关。在光学方面，SN 2022pul类似于SN 2012dn，而在星云相中，SN 2022pul展现出了03fg-like subclass的多样性。最后，使用JWST的数据，得到了首个03fg-like超新星的光学到中红外星云光谱。研究结果表明，SN 2022pul是由一个白矮星在C/O-rich CSM中发生融合而产生。 <div>
Nebular-phase observations of peculiar Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) provide important constraints on progenitor scenarios and explosion dynamics for both these rare SNe and the more common, cosmologically useful SNe Ia. We present observations from an extensive ground- and space-based follow-up campaign to characterize SN 2022pul, a super-Chandrasekhar mass SN Ia (alternatively “03fg-like” SN), from before peak brightness to well into the nebular phase across optical to mid-infrared (MIR) wavelengths. The early rise of the light curve is atypical, exhibiting two distinct components, consistent with SN Ia ejecta interacting with dense carbon–oxygen (C/O)-rich circumstellar material (CSM). In the optical, SN 2022pul is most similar to SN 2012dn, having a low estimated peak luminosity (MB = −18.9 mag) and high photospheric velocity relative to other 03fg-like SNe. In the nebular phase, SN 2022pul adds to the increasing diversity of the 03fg-like subclass. From 168 to 336 days after peak B-band brightness, SN 2022pul exhibits asymmetric and narrow emission from [O i] λλ6300, 6364 (FWHM ≈ 2000 km s−1), strong, broad emission from [Ca ii] λλ7291, 7323 (FWHM ≈ 7300 km s−1), and a rapid Fe iii to Fe ii ionization change. Finally, we present the first ever optical-to-MIR nebular spectrum of an 03fg-like SN Ia using data from JWST. In the MIR, strong lines of neon and argon, weak emission from stable nickel, and strong thermal dust emission (with T ≈ 500 K), combined with prominent [O i] in the optical, suggest that SN 2022pul was produced by a white dwarf merger within C/O-rich CSM.

这篇论文提出了一个框架，用于对星体年龄进行概率预测，并使用SHapley Additive exPlanations来量化恒星演化和银河化学演化对这些预测的贡献。他们将这种可解释的预测框架应用于既包含各种演化阶段的模拟银河样本，又包含APOGEE模拟样本的红巨星。他们发现在前一种情况下，恒星演化是年龄估计的主要驱动因素，而在后一种情况下，由于演化信息受限，模型通过化学演化模型来估算年龄。他们还指出，由于使用了非内在的银河化学信息，估算出的趋势，如年龄-金属丰度关系，可能会偏离真实情况。 <div>
Stellar ages are key for determining the formation history of the Milky Way, but are difficult to measure precisely. Furthermore, methods that use chemical abundances to infer ages may entangle the intrinsic evolution of stars with the chemodynamical evolution of the Galaxy. In this paper, we present a framework for making probabilistic predictions of stellar ages, and then quantify the contribution of both stellar evolution and Galactic chemical evolution to those predictions using SHapley Additive exPlanations. We apply this interpretable prediction framework to both a simulated Milky Way sample containing stars in a variety of evolutionary stages and an APOGEE-mocked sample of red clump stars. We find that in the former case, stellar evolution is the dominant driver for age estimates, while in the latter case, the more restricted evolutionary information causes the model to proxy ages through the chemical evolution model. We show that as a result of the use of nonintrinsic Galactic chemical information, trends estimated with the predicted ages, such as the age–metallicity relation, can deviate from the truth.

<br /><br />总结:
本文研究了太阳耀斑的一种可能机制，即通过非热的幂律分布的质子束加热大气层，产生的质子束加热模型可以解释HMI仪器的连续可观测性的增强，并在一定程度上解释了引起太阳地震的过程。研究发现能量较高的质子束（大于500keV）在HMI仪器的连续可观测性中表现更为显著，而能量较低的质子束（小于100keV）在引起太阳地震的过程中表现更为强烈，这为太阳耀斑的热加热机制提供了新的理论解释。 <div>
Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) observations reveal a class of solar flares with substantial energy and momentum impacts in the photosphere, concurrent with white-light emission and helioseismic responses, known as sunquakes. Previous radiative hydrodynamic modeling has demonstrated the challenges of explaining sunquakes in the framework of the standard flare model of “electron beam” heating. One of the possibilities to explain the sunquakes and other signatures of the photospheric impact is to consider additional heating mechanisms involved in solar flares, for example via flare-accelerated protons. In this work, we analyze a set of single-loop Fokker–Planck and radiative hydrodynamics RADYN+FP simulations where the atmosphere is heated by nonthermal power-law-distributed proton beams which can penetrate deeper than the electron beams into the low atmospheric layers. Using the output of the RADYN models, we calculate synthetic Fe i 6173 Å line Stokes profiles and from those the line-of-sight observables of the SDO/HMI instrument, as well as the 3D helioseismic response, and compare them with the corresponding observational characteristics. These initial results show that the models with proton beam heating can produce the enhancement of the HMI continuum observable and explain qualitatively the generation of sunquakes. The continuum observable enhancement is evident in all models but is more prominent in ones with Ec ≥ 500 keV. In contrast, the models with Ec ≤ 100 keV provide a stronger sunquake-like helioseismic impact according to the 3D acoustic modeling, suggesting that low-energy (deka- and hecto-keV) protons have an important role in the generation of sunquakes.

总结: 中国空间站POLAR-2实验的LPD有效载荷是低能X射线偏振检测器，用于观测2-10keV能量范围内的伽马射线暴快速辐射的偏振情况。该设备具有90°的广角视场，在预设计中采用了基于气体像素探测器的X射线光电偏振计组成的阵列。通过GEANT4 C++软件包进行了详细模拟，发现LPD的主要背景成分包括宇宙X射线背景和明亮的X射线源。在施加带电粒子背景排除算法后，LPD的平均背景计数率约为0.55 counts cm–2 s–1，并随着探测器的轨道和指向方向而变化。此外，还进行了关于不同视场和探测器指向的宇宙X射线背景和X射线明亮源的综合模拟和比较分析。 <div>
The Low-Energy X-ray Polarization Detector (LPD) is one of the payloads in the POLAR-2 experiment, designed as an external payload for the China Space Station deployment in early 2026. LPD is specifically designed to observe the polarization of gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt emission in the energy range of 2–10 keV, with a wide field of view (FoV) of 90° in preliminary design. This observation is achieved using an array of X-ray photoelectric polarimeters based on gas pixel detectors. Due to the wide FoV configuration, the in-orbit background count rate in the soft X-ray range is high, while GRBs themselves also exhibit high flux in this energy band. In order to assess the contribution of various background components to the total count rate, we conducted detailed simulations using the GEANT4 C++ package. Our simulations encompassed the main interactions within the instrument materials and provided insights into various background components within the wide-FoV scheme. The simulation results reveal that among the background components, the primary contributors are the cosmic X-ray background (CXB) and bright X-ray sources. The total background count rate of LPD, after applying the charged particle background rejection algorithm, is approximately 0.55 counts cm–2 s–1 on average, and it varies with the detector’s orbit and pointing direction. Furthermore, we performed comprehensive simulations and comparative analyses of the CXB and X-ray bright sources under different FoVs and detector pointings. These analyses provide valuable insights into the background characteristics for soft X-ray polarimeter with wide FoV.

<div> gravitational-wave signal, neutron stars, equation of state, Weyl scalar, quasi-universal relation
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了双中子星合并所产生的引力波信号的频谱特性，以及这些特性所包含的关于系统和物质方程状态的信息。通过使用Weyl标量ψ4的特性，他们提出了一个新的瞬时频率{f}_{0}^{{\psi }_{4}}，并建立了与该频率相关的“准通用”关系。他们还推导了合并频率{f}_{\mathrm{mer}}^{h}的新“准通用”关系，并发现在足够长的时间尺度内，ℓ = 2, m = 1引力波模式的幅度可能与传统的ℓ = 2, m = 2模式相当，这些发现对引力波研究具有重要意义。 <div>
The spectral properties of the post-merger gravitational-wave signal from a binary of neutron stars encodes a variety of information about the features of the system and of the equation of state describing matter around and above nuclear saturation density. Characterizing the properties of such a signal is an “old” problem, which first emerged when a number of frequencies were shown to be related to the properties of the binary through “quasi-universal” relations. Here we take a new look at this old problem by computing the properties of the signal in terms of the Weyl scalar ψ4. In this way, and using a database of more than 100 simulations, we provide the first evidence for a new instantaneous frequency, {f}_{0}^{{\psi }_{4}}, associated with the instant of quasi-time-symmetry in the dynamics, and which also follows a quasi-universal relation. We also derive a new quasi-universal relation for the merger frequency {f}_{\mathrm{mer}}^{h}, which provides a description of the data that is 4 times more accurate than previous expressions while requiring fewer fitting coefficients. Finally, consistent with the findings of numerous studies before ours, and using an enlarged ensemble of binary systems, we point out that the ℓ = 2, m = 1 gravitational-wave mode could become comparable with the traditional ℓ = 2, m = 2 mode on sufficiently long timescales, with strain amplitudes in a ratio ∣h21∣/∣h22∣ ∼ 0.1–1 under generic orientations of the binary, which could be measured by present detectors for signals with a large signal-to-noise ratio or by third-generation detectors for generic signals should no collapse occur.

总结: 本研究通过现代仪器持续追踪太阳到地球的太阳耀斑活动和地基宇宙射线探测器，揭示了两次太阳耀斑事件对地球的所有活动链。首次太阳耀斑产生了CME抛射和CME驱动冲击波与地球相交，导致了宇宙射线减少事件。而第二次太阳耀斑的冲击波速度比第一次快得多，尽管第一次事件更好地与地球磁连接，并且耀斑相似，但第二次事件导致了宇宙射线增强事件。结果表明，宇宙射线增强事件的产生可以主要由足够快的CME驱动冲击波主导。 <div>
Two major solar eruptions on AR 12673 produced a Forbush decrease (FD) event (reduction of cosmic rays) on 2017 September 8 and ground-level enhancement (GLE; enhancement of cosmic rays) on 2017 September 10. The occurrence of two contrasting cosmic-ray events within 2 days that are associated with two similar X-class solar flares (X9.3 and X8.2) and share the same active region on the Sun provides us a rare opportunity to understand the dominant factors in determining the properties of transient cosmic-ray events. Using a suite of modern-day instruments continuously tracking solar eruptions from the Sun to the Earth with ground-based cosmic-ray detectors, we reveal the complete cause–effect chain of activities for these two events. We conclude that the different consequences on the ground arise from two effects of the eruptions near the Sun: (1) the geometric effect of CMEs and (2) the intensity effect of CME-driven shocks. The first eruption, which originated at the heliographic longitude of W34° on 2017 September 6, had its CME ejecta and CME-driven shock intercept the Earth, leading to the FD event. The second eruption, which occurred on September 10 at W88°, only had its far flank reach the Earth. The peak shock speed of 3344 km s−1 of the second eruption, much faster than the 2175 km s−1 of the first eruption, is the dominant factor producing the GLE event, even though the first eruption is better connected magnetically to the Earth and has a similar flare. The results indicate that the production of GLE particles can be dominated by fast-enough CME-driven shocks.

<div> NGC 1365, TYPHOON, Populations Synthesis, Metallicity Gradient, Inside-Out Growth
<br /><br />总结: 本研究使用TYPHOON长狭缝吸收线光谱技术对NGC 1365的恒星爆发带螺旋星系进行了分析。通过人口综合技术，确定了年龄和金属丰度的空间分布，以及年轻和老年恒星群体的星形成率、泛红、消光和消光与泛红比RV。研究发现恒星盘呈现明显的内外成长特征，年轻恒星群体的亮度分数呈向外增加的趋势，平均年龄减少，质量增长历史在最外层盘完成。年轻恒星群体的金属丰度在较大的星系中心距上呈下降梯度，而老年群体的金属含量则保持稳定。在星系中心区域，年轻群体的金属丰度急剧下降，低于老年群体的水平，这归因于金属贫穷气体的涌入，以及由活跃星系核和超新星反馈引起的星形成中断，并在数十亿年后以早期恒星的恒星风排出的气体再次开始。我们还提供了对后者的支持的简单模型计算。 <div>
We analyze TYPHOON long-slit-absorption line spectra of the starburst barred spiral galaxy NGC 1365 obtained with the Progressive Integral Step Method covering an area of 15 kpc2. Applying a population synthesis technique, we determine the spatial distribution of ages and metallicities of the young and old stellar populations together with star formation rates, reddening, extinction, and the ratio RV of extinction to reddening. We detect a clear indication of inside-out growth of the stellar disk beyond 3 kpc characterized by an outward increasing luminosity fraction of the young stellar population, a decreasing average age, and a history of mass growth, which was finished 2 Gyr later in the outermost disk. The metallicity of the young stellar population is clearly super solar but decreases toward larger galactocentric radii with a gradient of −0.02 dex kpc−1. On the other hand, the metal content of the old population does not show a gradient and stays constant at a level roughly 0.4 dex lower than that of the young population. In the center of NGC 1365, we find a confined region where the metallicity of the young population drops dramatically and becomes lower than that of the old population. We attribute this to the infall of metal-poor gas, and additionally, to interrupted chemical evolution where star formation is stopped by active galactic nuclei and supernova feedback and then after several gigayears resumes with gas ejected by stellar winds from earlier generations of stars. We provide a simple model calculation as support for the latter.

<title>Rapid Black Hole Spin-down by Thick Magnetically Arrested Disks</title>

<div> 关键词: 黑洞自旋, 磁化阻滞盘, 磁流体动力学模拟, 星系演化, 引力波 <br />
总结: <br />
本研究关注辐射效率低且几何厚的磁化阻滞盘（MAD），发现MAD可以迅速将黑洞的自旋降低到极低水平。与标准薄亮盘相比，MAD使黑洞的自旋迅速降至0 < aeq ≲ 0.1。这意味着受MAD供应的高超艾登顿速率下快速吸积的黑洞往往会将大部分旋转能量损失到磁化相对论流出。研究还构建了一个半解析的黑洞自旋演化模型，考虑了盘和电磁喷流对黑洞产生的扭矩，并发现aeq的低值既是因为喷流减慢了黑洞自旋，也是因为盘失去了大部分角动量到流出。研究结果对活跃星系和其他系统的黑洞自旋演化以及引力波的演化有重要影响。 <div>
Black hole (BH) spin can play an important role in galaxy evolution by controlling the amount of energy and momentum ejected from near the BH into the surroundings. We focus on radiatively inefficient and geometrically thick magnetically arrested disks (MADs) that can launch strong BH-powered jets. With an appropriately chosen adiabatic index, these systems can describe either the low-luminosity or highly super-Eddington BH accretion regimes. Using a suite of 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we find that for any initial spin, an MAD rapidly spins down the BH to the equilibrium spin of 0 &lt; aeq ≲ 0.1, very low compared to aeq = 1 for the standard thin luminous (Novikov–Thorne) disks. This implies that rapidly accreting (super-Eddington) BHs fed by MADs tend to lose most of their rotational energy to magnetized relativistic outflows. In an MAD, a BH only needs to accrete 20% of its own mass to spin down from a = 1–0.2. We construct a semi-analytic model of BH spin evolution in MADs by taking into account the torques on the BH due to both the hydrodynamic disk and electromagnetic jet components, and find that the low value of aeq is due to both the jets slowing down the BH rotation and the disk losing a large fraction of its angular momentum to outflows. Our results have crucial implications for how BH spins evolve in active galaxies and other systems such as collapsars, where the BH spin-down timescale can be short enough to significantly affect the evolution of gamma-ray emitting BH-powered jets.

在这篇文章中，研究了非均匀气体分布、星系旋转和引力等主要因素对几乎正面朝向的螺旋星系中超泡观测外观的影响。将3D数值模拟的结果与晚期螺旋星系NGC 628中最大的东南超泡的观测气体柱密度分布进行了比较。利用哈勃太空望远镜图像中解析的恒星群来获得其能量，并证明数值模拟的结果与观测到的气体表面密度分布是一致的。还表明观测到的气体柱密度分布可以约束气体盘的尺度高度和中平面气体密度，如果能够从观测中获得能量输入率。这意味着观测到星际气体分布中的大孔洞及其恒星群具有潜在的力量，可以解决几乎正面朝向星系中的中平面气体密度-气体盘尺度高度退化问题。还简要讨论了超泡在推动星系中次生星形成中的可能作用。<br /><br />总结: 本文研究了超泡对星系观测外观的影响，通过数值模拟结果与观测数据的比较得出结论，指出了观测中可以约束气体盘参数的可能性，并讨论了超泡对星系次生星形成的潜在作用。 <div>
Here we explore the impact of all major factors, such as the nonhomogeneous gas distribution, galactic rotation, and gravity, on the observational appearance of superbubbles in nearly face-on spiral galaxies. The results of our 3D numerical simulations are compared to the observed gas column density distribution in the largest southeast superbubble in the late-type spiral galaxy NGC 628. We make use of the star formation history inside the bubble derived from the resolved stellar population seen in Hubble Space Telescope images to obtain its energy and demonstrate that the results of numerical simulations are in good agreement with the observed gas surface density distribution. We also show that the observed gas column density distribution constrains the gaseous disk scale height and the midplane gas density if the energy input rate can be obtained from observations. This implies that observations of large holes in the interstellar gas distribution and their stellar populations have the potential power to solve the midplane gas density–gaseous disk scale height degeneracy problem in nearly face-on galaxies. The possible role of superbubbles in driving the secondary star formation in galaxies is also briefly discussed.

总结:
FAST在中间银河纬度进行了一次初步调查，发现了四颗脉冲星，其中两颗是毫秒脉冲星，另外两颗是“轻度再循环”的脉冲星。这次调查覆盖了4.7平方度的区域，但仍然发现了四颗再循环的脉冲星，显示了未来在中间银河纬度进行调查的巨大潜力。通过人口模拟发现，FAST和Parkes新的相位阵列前沿调查，聚焦于中间银河纬度，有能力发现数百颗新的毫秒脉冲星。<br /><br /> <div>
We present the discovery and timing results of four pulsars discovered in a pilot survey at intermediate Galactic latitudes with the Five-hundred Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST). Among these pulsars, two belong to the category of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) with spin periods of less than 20 ms. The other two fall under the classification of “mildly recycled” pulsars, with massive white dwarfs as companions. Remarkably, this small survey, covering an area of 4.7 deg2, led to the discovery of four recycled pulsars. Such success underscores the immense potential of future surveys at intermediate Galactic latitudes. In order to assess the potential yield of MSPs, we conducted population simulations and found that both FAST and Parkes new phased array feed surveys, focusing on intermediate Galactic latitudes, have the capacity to uncover several hundred new MSPs.

<div> pulsar, X-ray emission, wind nebula, multizone emission scenario, TeV results
总结:<br /><br /> 这篇文章报告了使用Chandra、XMM-Newton、NICER、Swift和NuSTAR测量的PSR J1849−0001脉冲星及其风星云（PWN）的X射线发射特性。我们发现脉冲星的X射线光谱呈现显着的曲率，在约60 keV处达到峰值。通过比较脉冲平均和脉冲内的光谱，我们发现脉冲星的脉冲外发射显示出与脉冲内发射非常相似的光谱形状。利用NuSTAR的脉冲外数据，我们成功测量了PWN的>10 keV光谱和辐射亮度的径向分布，并将这些X射线测量结果与已发表的TeV结果相结合。最后，采用多区域发射场景对广泛的数据进行建模，结果表明PWN内的磁场相对较低（≈7 μG），并且在该PWN内的电子被加速到能量≳400 TeV。负责TeV发射的电子可能会传播到距离脉冲星约30 pc的地方，在大约10 kyr内形成X射线PWN之外的TeV发射云。 <div>
We report on the X-ray emission properties of the pulsar PSR J1849−0001 and its wind nebula (PWN), as measured by Chandra, XMM-Newton, NICER, Swift, and NuSTAR. In the X-ray data, we detected the 38 ms pulsations of the pulsar up to ∼60 keV with high significance. Additionally, we found that the pulsar's on-pulse spectral energy distribution displays significant curvature, peaking at ≈60 keV. Comparing the phase-averaged and on-pulse spectra of the pulsar, we found that the pulsar's off-pulse emission exhibits a spectral shape that is very similar to its on-pulse emission. This characterization of the off-pulse emission enabled us to measure the &gt;10 keV spectrum of the faint and extended PWN using NuSTAR's off-pulse data. We measured both the X-ray spectrum and the radial profiles of the PWN’s brightness and photon index, and we combined these X-ray measurements with published TeV results. We then employed a multizone emission scenario to model the broadband data. The results of the modeling suggest that the magnetic field within the PWN is relatively low (≈7 μG) and that electrons are accelerated to energies ≳400 TeV within this PWN. The electrons responsible for the TeV emission outside the X-ray PWN may propagate to ∼30 pc from the pulsar in ∼10 kyr.

<div> 关键词: gamma-ray bursts, spectral hardness, peak energy, X-ray afterglows, magnetar origin
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了 gamma-ray bursts 的谱硬度特征，使用了峰能量和硬度比两种参数进行分类和分析。研究发现，X 射线的硬度比值普遍低于γ射线。此外，作者还确认了几乎所有观测到的γ射线暴的光谱均可用破裂幂律函数描述，并验证了具有内部X射线高原的暴的磁星起源。另外，作者还指出类型IV暴的光谱受物质喷流几何形状的影响，与其他类型的暴有显著差异。对中性氢吸收对硬度比估计的影响可以忽略不计，尽管它可能会略微降低γ/X射线的亮度。 <div>
Spectral hardness of gamma-ray bursts can be characterized by either hardness ratio or peak energy, and the inconsistency of these parameters can reflect spectral diversity and complexity. We have chosen 310 Swift bursts with well-measured X-ray afterglows to analyze the distributions of their peak energies and hardness ratios before and after absorption of neutral hydrogen. We categorize them into four types according to X-ray temporal patterns and calculate the hardness ratios of both γ-rays and X-rays. It is found that the hardness ratios of X-rays are systematically smaller than those of γ-rays. We also find that both γ-ray hardness ratios and peak energies of bursts of types I, II, and III are identically distributed and are significantly lower than the corresponding measurements of type IV bursts in statistics, which hints that the evolving spectra of type IV bursts are most probably affected by the geometry of outflows. This proves that the influence of neutral hydrogen absorption on the estimation of hardness ratio is negligible even though it can reduce the brightness of γ/X-rays somewhat. Furthermore, we verify that almost all the observed spectra of gamma-ray bursts can be described by a broken power-law function and confirm a magnetar origin for the bursts with internal X-ray plateaus.

通过APEX对G34进行观测，发现了大尺度的、与细丝对齐的速度梯度，驱动了气体向G34中部岭的密集块体内的细丝状气体流入。这些流入是由重力控制的。同时，通过其他线的观测，还确认了MM2、MM4和MM5三个岭的气体内存在块体尺度的气体流入。这些岭的气体流入速率可能取决于大尺度细丝状气体的流入，因为这两个尺度上的流入速率是可比的。总结:
<br />
HMSF是一个多尺度的动态过程，由大尺度的细丝状气体流入驱动，而细丝内部的气体流入现象也得到了确认。整个过程可能受到重力和来自多种来源的湍流的影响。 <div>
There is growing evidence that high-mass star formation (HMSF) is a multiscale, dynamical process in molecular clouds, where filaments transport gas material between larger and smaller scales. We analyze here multiscale gas dynamics in an HMSF filamentary cloud, G034.43+00.24 (G34), using APEX observations of the C18O (2−1), HCO+/H13CO+ (3−2), and HCN/H13CN (3−2) lines. We find large-scale, filament-aligned velocity gradients from C18O emission, which drive filamentary gas inflows onto dense clumps in the middle ridge of G34. The nature of these inflows is gravity driven. We also find clump-scale gas infall in the middle ridge of the MM2, MM4, and MM5 clumps from other lines. Their gas infall rates could depend on large-scale filamentary gas inflows since the infall/inflow rates on these two scales are comparable. We confirm that the multiscale, dynamical HMSF scenario is at work in G34. It could be driven by gravity up to the filament scale, beyond which turbulence originating from several sources, including gravity, could be in effect in G34.

<div> 黑洞，中子星，超Eddington质量转移，高能中微子，超新鲜<br />
总结:
这篇文章讨论了由进化后主序星到黑洞或中子星伴星的超Eddington质量转移所引起的超星云膨胀，以及产生高能中微子的可能机制。研究指出，一些快速无线电暴（FRB）可能由这种短暂的喷射式超Eddington质量转移引擎驱动。根据模型计算，这些超新鲜可能产生的中微子排放量可以解释IceCube观测到的高能中微子弥散背景流的约25％，并且其时间平均中微子谱也与观测到的中微子谱相吻合。此外，这些超新鲜产生的中微子排放可能可延伸至>100 PeV，可以被未来的超高能中微子观测站所探测到。另外，超新鲜内的光学厚度会阻碍GeV–PeV能区的伽马射线逃逸，使得这些中微子源辐射的伽马射线相对较弱，与Fermi对各向同性伽马射线背景的观测结果相符。 <div>
Hypernebulae are inflated by accretion-powered winds accompanying hyper-Eddington mass transfer from an evolved post-main-sequence star onto a black hole or neutron star companion. The ions accelerated at the termination shock—where the collimated fast disk winds and/or jet collide with the slower, wide-angled wind-fed shell—can generate high-energy neutrinos via hadronic proton–proton reactions, and photohadronic (pγ) interactions with the disk thermal and Comptonized nonthermal background photons. It has been suggested that some fast radio bursts (FRBs) may be powered by such short-lived jetted hyper-accreting engines. Although neutrino emission associated with the millisecond duration bursts themselves is challenging to detect, the persistent radio counterparts of some FRB sources—if associated with hypernebulae—could contribute to the high-energy neutrino diffuse background flux. If the hypernebula birth rate follows that of stellar-merger transients and common envelope events, we find that their volume-integrated neutrino emission—depending on the population-averaged mass-transfer rates—could explain up to ∼25% of the high-energy diffuse neutrino flux observed by the IceCube Observatory and the Baikal Gigaton Volume Detector Telescope. The time-averaged neutrino spectrum from hypernebula—depending on the population parameters—can also reproduce the observed diffuse neutrino spectrum. The neutrino emission could in some cases furthermore extend to &gt;100 PeV, detectable by future ultra-high-energy neutrino observatories. The large optical depth through the nebula to Breit–Wheeler (γγ) interaction attenuates the escape of GeV–PeV gamma rays coproduced with the neutrinos, rendering these gamma-ray-faint neutrino sources, consistent with the Fermi observations of the isotropic gamma-ray background.

总结: <br />
G106.3+2.7被认为是一个复合超新星遗迹，具有类似回旋镖形状的脉冲星风星云和无线电波段的两个不同区域（“头”和“尾”）。最近在尾部发现了超高能量的γ射线发射，这表明G106.3+2.7是PeVatron候选星. 通过使用存档的无线电和Chandra数据，以及2020年的新NuSTAR X射线观测结果，我们对脉冲星J2229+6114周围100″范围内的Boomerang PWN进行了全面的多波段研究。 NuSTAR观测结果显示了脉冲星PSR J2229+6114的51.67毫秒自转周期和PWN辐射的能量谱，该辐射呈幂律模型，Γ值为1.52±0.06，直到20keV。与Kothes等人以前的无线电研究不同，根据（1）过去20年来X射线流量的稳定性，（2）脉冲星风星云的能量依赖性X射线尺寸和（3）多波段光谱能谱数据，我们更倾向于较低的PWN磁场（B∼3μG）和较大的距离（d∼8kpc）。我们的光谱能谱模型表明，脉冲星风星云目前正在被超新星逆冲击压缩，大约在1000年前被压缩。在这种情况下，头部区域应该是由早期被脉冲星注入的GeV-TeV电子形成，这些电子正在向低密度环境传播。 <div>
G106.3+2.7, commonly considered to be a composite supernova remnant (SNR), is characterized by a boomerang-shaped pulsar wind nebula (PWN) and two distinct (“head” and “tail”) regions in the radio band. A discovery of very-high-energy gamma-ray emission (Eγ &gt; 100 GeV) followed by the recent detection of ultrahigh-energy gamma-ray emission (Eγ &gt; 100 TeV) from the tail region suggests that G106.3+2.7 is a PeVatron candidate. We present a comprehensive multiwavelength study of the Boomerang PWN (100″ around PSR J2229+6114) using archival radio and Chandra data obtained two decades ago, a new NuSTAR X-ray observation from 2020, and upper limits on gamma-ray fluxes obtained by Fermi-LAT and VERITAS observatories. The NuSTAR observation allowed us to detect a 51.67 ms spin period from the pulsar PSR J2229+6114 and the PWN emission characterized by a power-law model with Γ = 1.52 ± 0.06 up to 20 keV. Contrary to the previous radio study by Kothes et al., we prefer a much lower PWN B-field (B ∼ 3 μG) and larger distance (d ∼ 8 kpc) based on (1) the nonvarying X-ray flux over the last two decades, (2) the energy-dependent X-ray size of the PWN resulting from synchrotron burn-off, and (3) the multiwavelength spectral energy distribution (SED) data. Our SED model suggests that the PWN is currently re-expanding after being compressed by the SNR reverse shock ∼1000 yr ago. In this case, the head region should be formed by GeV–TeV electrons injected earlier by the pulsar propagating into the low-density environment.

We present the stellar mass–stellar metallicity relation for 3491 star-forming galaxies at 2 ≲ z ≲ 3 using rest-frame far-ultraviolet spectra from the Lyα Tomography IMACS Survey (LATIS). We fit stellar population synthesis models from the Binary Population And Spectral Synthesis code (v2.2.1) to medium-resolution (R ∼ 1000) and high signal-to-noise (&gt;30 per 100 km s−1 over the wavelength range 1221–1800 Å) composite spectra of galaxies in bins of stellar mass to determine their stellar metallicity, primarily tracing Fe/H. We find a strong correlation between stellar mass and stellar metallicity, with stellar metallicity monotonically increasing with stellar mass at low masses and flattening at high masses (M* ≳ 1010.3M⊙). Additionally, we compare our stellar metallicity measurements with the gas-phase oxygen abundance of galaxies at similar redshift and estimate the average [α/Fe] ∼ 0.6. Such high α-enhancement indicates that high-redshift galaxies have not yet undergone significant iron enrichment through Type Ia supernovae. Moreover, we utilize an analytic chemical evolution model to constrain the mass loading parameter of galactic winds as a function of stellar mass. We find that as the stellar mass increases, the mass loading parameter decreases. The parameter then flattens or reaches a turning point at around M* ∼ 1010.5M⊙. Our findings may signal the onset of black-hole-driven outflows at z ∼ 2.5 for galaxies with M* ≳ 1010.5 M⊙.

本文探讨了使用地面广域调查数据来增加核心坍缩超新星（SN）前体星探测率的可能性。研究发现，通过结合前SN和晚期图像来搜索前体星的消失可以提高检测率。通过对ZTF数据进行搜索验证了这一概念。然后，通过模拟近距离SN的种群估算了Vera C. Rubin望远镜的LSST的前体探测率。研究还指出，亮宿主星系的背景会降低LSST灵敏度，预计在10年的调查中将检测到大约50个红超巨前体星和数个黄色和蓝色超巨前体星。此外，预计还将检测数百个前SN暴发。 <div>
The direct detection of core-collapse supernova (SN) progenitor stars is a powerful way of probing the last stages of stellar evolution. However, detections in archival Hubble Space Telescope images are limited to about one detection per year. Here, we explore whether we can increase the detection rate by using data from ground-based wide-field surveys. Due to crowding and atmospheric blurring, progenitor stars can typically not be identified in preexplosion images alone. Instead, we combine many pre-SN and late-time images to search for the disappearance of the progenitor star. As a proof of concept, we implement our search of ZTF data. For a few hundred images, we achieve limiting magnitudes of ∼23 mag in the g and r bands. However, no progenitor stars or long-lived outbursts are detected for 29 SNe within z ≤ 0.01, and the ZTF limits are typically several magnitudes less constraining than detected progenitors in the literature. Next, we estimate progenitor detection rates for the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) with the Vera C. Rubin telescope by simulating a population of nearby SNe. The background from bright host galaxies reduces the nominal LSST sensitivity by, on average, 0.4 mag. Over the 10 yr survey, we expect the detection of ∼50 red supergiant progenitors and several yellow and blue supergiants. The progenitors of Type Ib and Ic SNe will be detectable if they are brighter than −4.7 or −4.0 mag in the LSST i band, respectively. In addition, we expect the detection of hundreds of pre-SN outbursts depending on their brightness and duration.

<div> 关键词: DECaLS, 星系团，质量关系，星等离散度，超大质量黑洞

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了DECaLS剪切目录中的不同参数与斯隆数字化天文巡天中心星系的哈洛质量（Mh）之间的关系。结果表明，这些参数与Mh存在强烈的正相关关系，其中包括星际质量（M*）、星等离散度（σ*）、丰度匹配哈洛质量（MAM）和卫星速度离散度（σs）。Mh-M*和Mh-σ*的关系与星系团的丰度密切相关，而Mh-MAM和Mh-σs的关系则独立于此。研究还表明，σs是其中最佳的代理参数。此外，通过组合M*、σ*和MAM构建新的代理参数，可以最小化对丰度密度和星际发射率的依赖。最后，研究还探讨了Mh-超大质量黑洞（SMBH）质量的关系，并发现了SMBH快速线性生长阶段的迹象。同时发现Mh、M*和σ*之间的关联随着M*的变化而变化，表明不同的过程推动了星系和SMBH在不同阶段的生长。 <div>
Based on the DECaLS shear catalog, we study the scaling relations between halo mass (Mh) and various proxies for Sloan Digital Sky Survey central galaxies, including stellar mass (M*), stellar velocity dispersion (σ*), abundance-matching halo mass (MAM), and satellite velocity dispersion (σs), and their dependencies on galaxy and group properties. In general, these proxies all have strong positive correlations with Mh, consistent with previous studies. We find that the Mh–M* and Mh–σ* relations depend strongly on group richness (Nsat), while the Mh–MAM and Mh–σs relations are independent of it. Moreover, the dependence on the star formation rate (SFR) is rather weak in the Mh–σ* and Mh–σs relations, but very prominent in the other two. σs is thus the best proxy among them, and its scaling relation is in good agreement with hydrodynamical simulations. However, estimating σs accurately for individual groups/clusters is challenging because of interlopers and the requirement for sufficient satellites. We construct new proxies by combining M*, σ*, and MAM, and find that the proxy with 30% contribution from MAM and 70% from σ* can minimize the dependence on Nsat and the SFR. We obtain the Mh–supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass relation via the SMBH scaling relation and find indications for rapid and linear growth phases for the SMBH. We also find that correlations among Mh, M*, and σ* change with M*, indicating that different processes drive the growth of galaxies and SMBHs at different stages.

<div> 关键词: 核心坍缩超新星，双峰射电光度曲线，环绕恒星介质，同步辐射，快速冷却

总结:
核心坍缩超新星（CCSNe）的一些案例显示在爆炸几年内的双峰射电光度曲线。研究人员提出了一种新的机制来解释这种现象，即在同步辐射光谱能量分布的进化模型中引入快速和慢速冷却阶段，从而在观测频率下系统变得对同步辐射自吸收。当快速冷却转变为慢速冷却阶段时，射电光度曲线就会呈现双峰特征。研究人员还提出SN 2007bg作为这种双峰射电超新星的特例，并建议该模型可能成为评估超新星中电子加速特性的潜在手段。  <br /><br /> <div>
It is recognized that some core-collapse supernovae (SNe) show a double-peaked radio light curve within a few years since the explosion. A shell of circumstellar medium (CSM) detached from the SN progenitor has been considered to play a viable role in characterizing such a rebrightening of radio emission. Here, we propose another mechanism that can give rise to the double-peaked radio light curve in core-collapse SNe. The key ingredient in the present work is to expand the model for the evolution of the synchrotron spectral energy distribution (SED) to a generic form, including fast and slow cooling regimes, as guided by the widely accepted modeling scheme of gamma-ray burst afterglows. We show that even without introducing an additional CSM shell, the radio light curve would show a double-peaked morphology when the system becomes optically thin to synchrotron self-absorption at the observational frequency during the fast cooling regime. We can observe this double-peaked feature if the transition from the fast cooling to slow cooling regime occurs during the typical observational timescale of SNe. This situation is realized when the minimum Lorentz factor of injected electrons is initially large enough for the nonthermal electrons’ SED to be discrete from the thermal distribution. We propose SN 2007bg as a special case of double-peaked radio SNe that can be possibly explained by the presented scenario. Our model can serve as a potential diagnostic for electron acceleration properties in SNe.

<br /><br />总结:
TDEs在后星爆星系中过度表示，通过重新审视TDE率并考虑AGN盘的演变，发现TDE率在AGN转为非活跃阶段时会显著增强约2个数量级，这提供了对于TDE在后星爆星系中过度表示的解释。 <div>
Tidal disruption events (TDEs) provide a valuable probe for studying the dynamics of stars in the nuclear environments of galaxies. Recent observations show that TDEs are strongly overrepresented in post-starburst or “green valley” galaxies, although the underlying physical mechanism remains unclear. Considering the possible interaction between stars and active galactic nucleus (AGN) disks, the TDE rates can be greatly changed compared to those in quiescent galactic nuclei. In this work, we revisit TDE rates by incorporating an evolving AGN disk within the framework of “loss cone” theory. We numerically evolve the Fokker–Planck equations by considering star–disk interactions, in situ star formation in the unstable region of the outer AGN disk, and evolution of the accretion process of supermassive black holes. We find that the TDE rates are enhanced by about 2 orders of magnitude shortly after the AGN transitions into an inactive stage. During this phase, the accumulated stars rapidly scatter into the loss cone due to the disappearance of the inner standard thin disk. Our results provide an explanation for the overrepresentation of TDEs in post-starburst galaxies.

Recent observations of Her X-1 with NuSTAR (as well as with INTEGRAL, Swift, and Astrosat) have provided evidence that the nearly 20 yr-long decay of the cyclotron line energy since ∼1994 has ended and that a stable value has replaced the decay. Using the observations of the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (Insight-HXMT) performed between 2017 July and 2020 February, we analyze the spectra of Her X-1 in its main-on state, focusing on tracing the evolution of cyclotron line energy. While our analysis of eight main-on observations with Insight-HXMT (two in coordination with NuSTAR) shows significant differences with the results of NuSTAR, two earlier findings are confirmed: the positive correlation between the cyclotron line energy and the X-ray flux (source luminosity) and the constancy of the flux-normalized cyclotron line energy during 2017–2020—albeit with significant uncertainty about the absolute value.

<div> T Tauri stars, disk evolution, planet formation, accretion, stellar mass
<br /><br />总结:
这项研究研究了T Tauri恒星的盘演化时间尺度及其与吸积的关系。通过对数据的分析，发现了1077颗盘载T Tauri恒星候选者，其中有783颗新分类为传统T Tauri恒星或弱线T Tauri恒星。研究发现，M<0.35M☉的TTS在大约0.1百万年内就失去了它们的盘，而M>0.35M☉的TTS几乎所有盘都能存活超过0.1百万年，大部分能存活1百万年甚至20百万年。此外，发现了随着年龄增长，全盘TTSs与吸积TTSs的比例都呈现下降趋势，确认了全盘TTSs和吸积对非全盘TTSs的演化速度更快。最后，研究还发现较低质量恒星的吸积比率普遍低于较高质量恒星，确认了吸积与恒星质量的依赖关系。 <div>
The full disk, full of gas and dust, determines the upper limit of planet masses, and its lifetime is critical for planet formation, especially for giant planets. In this work, we studied the evolutionary timescales of the full disks of T Tauri stars (TTSs) and their relations to accretion. Combined with Gaia EDR3, Two Micron All Sky Survey, and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer data, 1077 disk-bearing TTS candidates were found in LAMOST DR8, and stellar parameters were obtained. Among them, 783 are newly classified by spectra as classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs; 169) or weak-lined T Tauri stars (WTTSs). Based on EW and FWHM of Hα, 157 TTSs in accretion were identified, with ∼82% also having full disks. For TTSs with M &lt; 0.35M☉, about 80% seem to already lose their full disks at ∼0.1 Myr, which may explain their lower mass, while the remaining 20% with full disks evolve at similar rates of non-full disks within 5 Myr, allowing enough time and material to form giant planets. The fraction of accreting TTSs to disk-bearing TTSs is stable at ∼10% and can last ∼5–10 Myr, suggesting that full disks and accretion evolve with similar rates as non-full disks. For TTSs with M &gt; 0.35 M☉, almost all full disks can survive more than 0.1 Myr, most for 1 Myr and some even for 20 Myr. For TTSs with M &gt; 0.35 M☉, almost all full disks can survive more than 0.1 Myr, most for 1 Myr, and some even for 20 Myr, which implies planets are more likely to be formed in their disks than those of M &lt; 0.35 M☉, and thus M dwarfs with M &gt; 0.35 M☉ can have more planets. The fraction of full-disk TTSs to disk-bearing TTSs decreases with age following the relation f ∝ t−0.35, and similar relations existed in the fraction of accreting TTSs and the fraction of full-disk CTTSs, suggesting faster full disks and accretion evolution than non-full disks. For full-disk stars, the ratio of accretion of lower-mass stars is systematically lower than that of higher-mass stars, confirming the dependence of accretion on stellar mass, which may be reflective of an observational bias in the detection of accretion levels, with the lower-mass stars crossing below the detection threshold earlier than higher-mass stars.

Supermassive primordial stars with masses exceeding ∼105M⊙ that form in atomically cooled halos are the leading candidates for the origin of high-redshift quasars at z &gt; 6. Recent numerical simulations, however, find that multiple accretion disks can form within a halo, each of which can potentially host a supermassive star. We investigate the formation and evolution of secondary supermassive stars in atomically cooled halos, including strong variations in their accretion histories driven by gravitational interactions between their disks and those surrounding the primary supermassive stars in each halo. We find that all secondary disks produce long-lived supermassive stars under sustained rapid accretion. We also find, however, that the majority of secondary supermassive stars do undergo at least one protracted quiescent accretion phase, during which time they thermally relax and may become powerful sources of ionizing feedback. In many halos, the two satellite disks collide, suggesting that the two stars can come into close proximity. This may induce additional mass exchange between them, leading to a great diversity of possible outcomes. These range from coevolution as main-sequence stars to main sequence—black hole pairs and black hole—black hole mergers. We discuss the likely outcome for these binary interactions based on the evolutionary state of both supermassive stars at the end of our simulations, as well as prospects for their future detection by current and next-generation facilities.

Measuring the coverage of dark spots on cool stars is important to understanding how stellar magnetic activity scales with the rotation rate and convection zone depth. In this respect, it is crucial to infer surface magnetic patterns on G and K stars, to reveal solar-like stellar dynamos in action. Molecular bands serve as invaluable indicators of cool spots on the surfaces of stars, as they play a crucial role in enabling accurate assessments of the extent of spot coverage across the stellar surface. Therefore, more reliable surface images can be obtained considering the inversion of atomic lines with molecular bands. In this context, we simultaneously carry out Doppler imaging (DI) using atomic lines as well as titanium oxide band profiles of PW And (K2 V) and also investigate chromospheric activity indicators for the first time in the literature, using high-resolution spectra. The surface spot distribution obtained from the inversion process represents both atomic line and TiO-band profiles quite accurately. The chromospheric emission is also correlated with photospheric spot coverage, except during a possible flare event during the observations. We detect frequent flare activity, using TESS photometry. We also introduce a new open-source, Python-based DI code SpotDIPy that allows performing surface reconstructions of single stars using the maximum entropy method. We test the code by comparing surface reconstruction simulations with the extensively used DoTS code. We show that the surface brightness distribution maps reconstructed via both codes using the same simulated data are consistent with each other.

总结:
该研究探讨了高斯过程（GPs）作为一种机器学习算法在重建哈勃参数H(z)方面的前景，考虑了即将到来的引力波观测任务eLISA和Einstein Telescope。研究假设了各种宇宙学背景模型，并利用实际生成的目录，非参数地利用GPs重建了Hubble参数。研究重点讨论了早期和晚期先验对H(z)重建的影响，进而对哈勃常数（H0）的影响。分析表明，GPs在特定任务的观测窗口内对宇宙膨胀历史的重建是相当稳健的。该研究进一步证实，eLISA和ET都能够提供对H(z)和H0的约束，这些约束与当前数据集的推断相竞争。特别地，研究发现，eLISA大约持续10年，观测到大约80个明亮的引力波事件时，将能够像大约持续3年的ET运行观测大约1000个明亮的引力波事件一样准确地约束H0。预计，在更长的eLISA任务持续时间（例如大约15年，有大约120个事件）内，精确度会有进一步提高。最后，针对每个模型，讨论了这些未来的引力波观测任务在解决哈勃张力中可能发挥的作用。 <br /><br /> <div>
We study the prospects of Gaussian processes (GPs), a machine-learning (ML) algorithm, as a tool to reconstruct the Hubble parameter H(z) with two upcoming gravitational-wave (GW) missions, namely, the evolved Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (eLISA) and the Einstein Telescope (ET). Assuming various background cosmological models, the Hubble parameter has been reconstructed in a nonparametric manner with the help of a GP using realistically generated catalogs for each mission. The effects of early-time and late-time priors on the reconstruction of H(z), and hence on the Hubble constant (H0), have also been focused on separately. Our analysis reveals that a GP is quite robust in reconstructing the expansion history of the Universe within the observational window of the specific missions under consideration. We further confirm that both eLISA and ET would be able to provide constraints on H(z) and H0, which would be competitive to those inferred from current data sets. In particular, we observe that an eLISA run of a ∼10 yr duration with ∼80 detected bright siren events would be able to constrain H0 as precisely as a ∼3 yr ET run assuming ∼1000 bright siren event detections. Further improvement in precision is expected for longer eLISA mission durations such as a ∼15 yr time frame having ∼120 events. Lastly, we discuss the possible role of these future GW missions in addressing the Hubble tension, for each model, on a case-by-case basis.

The vast majority of stars in the nearby stellar neighborhood are M dwarfs. Their low masses and luminosities result in slow rates of nuclear evolution and minimal changes to the stars’ observable properties, even along astronomical timescales. However, they possess relatively powerful magnetic dynamos and resulting X-ray to UV (X–UV) activity, compared to their bolometric luminosities. This magnetic activity does undergo an observable decline over time, potentially making it a key age determinant for M dwarfs. Observing this activity is important for studying the outer atmospheres of these stars, but also for comparing the behaviors of different spectral type subsets of M dwarfs; e.g., those with partially versus fully convective interiors. Beyond stellar astrophysics, understanding the X–UV activity of M dwarfs over time is a key component when studying the atmospheres and habitability of any hosted exoplanets. Earth-sized exoplanets, in particular, are more commonly found orbiting M dwarfs than any other stellar type, and thermal escape (driven by the M dwarf X–UV activity) is believed to be the dominant atmospheric loss mechanism for these planets. Utilizing recently calibrated M dwarf age–rotation relationships, also constructed as part of the Living with a Red Dwarf program, we have analyzed the evolution of M dwarf activity over time, in terms of coronal (X-ray), chromospheric (Lyα, and Ca ii), and overall X–UV (5–1700 Å) emissions. The activity–age relationships presented here will be useful for studying exoplanet habitability and atmospheric loss, and also for studying the different dynamo and outer atmospheric heating mechanisms at work in M dwarfs.

Previous numerical simulations of double-peaked Type IIb supernova (SN IIb) light curves have demonstrated that the radius and mass of the hydrogen-rich envelope of the progenitor star can significantly influence the brightness and timescale of the early-time light curve around the first peak. In this study, we investigate how Thomson scattering and chemical mixing in the SN ejecta affect the optical light curves during the early stages of the SNe IIb using radiation hydrodynamics simulations. By comparing the results from two different numerical codes (i.e., STELLA and SNEC), we find that the optical brightness of the first peak can be reduced by more than a factor of 3 as a result of the effect of Thomson scattering that causes the thermalization depth to be located below the Rosseland mean photosphere, compared to the corresponding case where this effect is ignored. We also observe a short-lived plateau-like feature lasting for a few days in the early-time optical light curves of our models, in contrast to typical observed SNe IIb that show a quasi-linear decrease in optical magnitudes after the first peak. A significant degree of chemical mixing between the hydrogen-rich envelope and the helium core in SN ejecta is required to reconcile this discrepancy between the model prediction and observation. Meanwhile, to properly reproduce the first peak, a significant mixing of 56Ni into the hydrogen-rich outermost layers should be restricted. Our findings indicate that inferring the SN IIb progenitor structure from a simplified approach that ignores these two factors may introduce substantial uncertainty.

<div> 内部重力波, 伪不可压缩, 频率极限, 位势扰动, 非绝热层

内部重力波在低频极限下自然是伪不可压缩的。在这种极限下, 一些anelastic近似形式无法正确再现内部重力波的行为。伪不可压缩近似假设压力的波动在连续方程中很小，而在非绝热层，这两种近似方法是相同的，但在稳定层中，它们之间的差异很大，只有伪不可压缩近似仍然有效。 <br /><br />总结: 内部重力波在低频极限下是伪不可压缩的，伪不可压缩近似假设压力的波动很小，适用于稳定层。与非绝热层的区别。 <div>
Starting from the fully compressible fluid equations in a plane-parallel atmosphere, we demonstrate that linear internal gravity waves are naturally pseudo-incompressible in the limit that the wave frequency ω is much less than that of surface gravity waves, i.e., \omega \ll \sqrt{{{gk}}_{h}}, where g is the gravitational acceleration and kh is the horizontal wavenumber. We accomplish this by performing a formal expansion of the wave functions and the local dispersion relation in terms of a dimensionless frequency \varepsilon =\omega /\sqrt{{{gk}}_{h}}. Further, we show that, in this same low-frequency limit, several forms of the anelastic approximation, including the Lantz–Braginsky–Roberts formulation, poorly reproduce the correct behavior of internal gravity waves. The pseudo-incompressible approximation is achieved by assuming that Eulerian fluctuations of the pressure are small in the continuity equation—whereas, in the anelastic approximation, Eulerian density fluctuations are ignored. In an adiabatic stratification, such as occurs in a convection zone, the two approximations become identical. However, in a stable stratification, the differences between the two approximations are stark and only the pseudo-incompressible approximation remains valid.

<div> JWST, NIRSpec, 红移, 宇宙星系形成率, 紫外光度函数
总结：<br /><br />这篇论文利用JWST/NIRSpec采集的光谱数据独立确认了16个红移为z=8.61-11.40的星系，并且发现了一个z=4.91的明亮干扰物。结合文献中的其他9个星系，共确认了25个星系，使用这些数据得出了紫外光度函数的确定性和下限，显示出对z∼12有轻微的红移演化。同时也得出了宇宙星系形成率密度的下限，证实了z∼12存在高星系形成率密度，支持了之前的光度研究结果。此外，作者还提出了一些观测策略，以有效地排除未来JWST项目中的低红移干扰因素。 <div>
We present pure spectroscopic constraints on the UV luminosity functions and cosmic star formation rate (SFR) densities from 25 galaxies at zspec = 8.61–13.20. By reducing the JWST/NIRSpec spectra taken in multiple programs of Early Release Observation, Early Release Science, General Observer, and Director’s Discretionary Time observations with our analysis technique, we independently confirm 16 galaxies at zspec = 8.61–11.40, including new redshift determinations, and a bright interloper at zspec = 4.91 that was claimed as a photometric candidate at z ∼ 16. In conjunction with nine galaxies at redshifts up to zspec = 13.20 in the literature, we make a sample of 25 spectroscopically confirmed galaxies in total and carefully derive the best estimates and lower limits of the UV luminosity functions. These UV luminosity function constraints are consistent with the previous photometric estimates within the uncertainties and indicate mild redshift evolution toward z ∼ 12, showing tensions with some theoretical models of rapid evolution. With these spectroscopic constraints, we obtain firm lower limits of the cosmic SFR densities and spectroscopically confirm a high SFR density at z ∼ 12 beyond the constant star formation efficiency models, which supports earlier claims from the photometric studies. While there are no spectroscopically confirmed galaxies with very large stellar masses violating the ΛCDM model due to the removal of the bright interloper, we confirm star-forming galaxies at zspec = 11–13 with stellar masses much higher than model predictions. Our results indicate possibilities of high star formation efficiency (&gt;5%), a hidden active galactic nucleus, a top-heavy initial mass function (possibly with Population III), and large scatter/variance. Having these successful and unsuccessful spectroscopy results, we suggest observational strategies for efficiently removing low-redshift interlopers for future JWST programs.

<div> Gravitational-wave emission, binary black hole systems, distribution estimation, population analysis, kernel density estimation
<br /><br />总结:
本文研究了通过引力波发射检测到的二进制黑洞系统，提出了一种基于核密度估计的自洽迭代方法来估计完整的二进制质量分布。研究发现，主要质量具有与以前调查一致的局部极大值，而次要质量分布具有部分独立的结构，并且与幂律和常数函数的q不一致。与大多数先前的调查不同，我们发现次要质量对几乎相等质量的二进制的偏好较小；相反，次要质量在略低于主要质量的地方具有自己的“光谱线”，并且我们观察到在∼10 M⊙峰值附近的主要和次要质量之间的反相关。 <div>
Binary black hole (BBH) systems detected via gravitational-wave emission are a recently opened astrophysical frontier with many unknowns and uncertainties. Accurate reconstruction of the binary distribution with as few assumptions as possible is desirable for inference of formation channels and environments. Most population analyses have, though, assumed a power law in binary mass ratio q, and/or assumed a universal q distribution regardless of primary mass. Methods based on kernel density estimation allow us to dispense with such assumptions and directly estimate the joint binary mass distribution. We deploy a self-consistent iterative method to estimate this full BBH mass distribution, finding local maxima in primary mass consistent with previous investigations and a secondary mass distribution with a partly independent structure, inconsistent both with a power law and with a constant function of q. We find a weaker preference for near-equal-mass binaries than in most previous investigations; instead, the secondary mass has its own “spectral lines” at slightly lower values than the primary, and we observe an anticorrelation between primary and secondary masses around the ∼10 M⊙ peak.
