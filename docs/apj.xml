<div> 关键词: LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA, O4, kilonova, DECam, gravitational-wave

总结: <br /><br />这篇文章讨论了在未来的LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA观测运行O4中最佳地识别所有通过引力波发射探测到的kilonovae的问题。他们提出了DECam在O4期间的优化观测策略，并基于引力波事件和宽先验kilonova模拟进行了研究。他们优化了策略以确认kilonova，同时最大程度地减少望远镜时间。通过优化策略，他们发现DECam对于银河系引力波探测极限（190Mpc）处的电磁对应物的发现概率约为80％，相比之前的策略提高了约30％。对于更遥远的事件（约330Mpc），发现概率达到约60％，增加了约2倍。对于更亮的kilonova模型，他们发现在330Mpc的范围内可以达到约90％的发现概率，而且还可以减少大约20％的望远镜观测时间。 <div>
We address the problem of optimally identifying all kilonovae detected via gravitational-wave emission in the upcoming LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA observing run, O4, which is expected to be sensitive to a factor of ∼7 more binary neutron star (BNS) alerts than previously. Electromagnetic follow-up of all but the brightest of these new events will require &gt;1 m telescopes, for which limited time is available. We present an optimized observing strategy for the DECam during O4. We base our study on simulations of gravitational-wave events expected for O4 and wide-prior kilonova simulations. We derive the detectabilities of events for realistic observing conditions. We optimize our strategy for confirming a kilonova while minimizing telescope time. For a wide range of kilonova parameters, corresponding to a fainter kilonova compared to GW170817/AT 2017gfo, we find that, with this optimal strategy, the discovery probability for electromagnetic counterparts with the DECam is ∼80% at the nominal BNS gravitational-wave detection limit for O4 (190 Mpc), which corresponds to an ∼30% improvement compared to the strategy adopted during the previous observing run. For more distant events (∼330 Mpc), we reach an ∼60% probability of detection, a factor of ∼2 increase. For a brighter kilonova model dominated by the blue component that reproduces the observations of GW170817/AT 2017gfo, we find that we can reach ∼90% probability of detection out to 330 Mpc, representing an increase of ∼20%, while also reducing the total telescope time required to follow up events by ∼20%.

Time-dependent photoionization modeling of warm absorber (WA) outflows in active galactic nuclei can play an important role in understanding the interaction between WAs and the central black hole. The WA may be out of the equilibrium state because of the variable nature of the central continuum. In this paper, with the help of time dependent photoionization modeling, we study how the WA gas properties change with time and how it reacts to changing radiation fields. Incorporating a flaring incident light curve, we investigate the behavior of WAs using a photoionization code that simultaneously and consistently solves the time-dependent equations of level population, heating and cooling, and radiative transfer. We simulate the physical processes in the gas clouds, such as ionization, recombination, heating, cooling, and the transfer of ionizing radiation through the cloud and present high-resolution time-resolved absorption spectra. We demonstrate that time-dependent radiative transfer is important and the calculations that omit this effect quantitatively and systematically underestimate the absorption. Time-dependent photoionization models provide crucial insights into the characteristics of WAs and can be used to constrain their density and spatial distribution.

We report spectroscopic observations of vB 120 (HD 30712), a 5.7 yr astrometric–spectroscopic binary system in the Hyades cluster. We combine our radial velocities with others from the literature, and with existing speckle interferometry measurements, to derive an improved 3D orbit for the system. We infer component masses of M1 = 1.065 ± 0.018 M☉ and M2 = 1.008 ± 0.016 M☉, and an orbital parallax of 21.86 ± 0.15 mas, which we show to be more accurate than the parallax from Gaia DR3. This is the ninth binary or multiple system in the Hyades with dynamical mass determinations, and one of the examples with the highest precision. An analysis of its spectral energy distribution yields the absolute radii of the stars, R1 = 0.968 ± 0.012 R☉ and R2 = 0.878 ± 0.013 R☉, and effective temperatures of 5656 ± 56 K and 5489 ± 60 K for the primary and secondary, respectively. A comparison of these properties with the predictions of current stellar evolution models for the known age and metallicity of the cluster shows only minor differences.

<div> Gaia Data Release 3, binary stars, Newtonian dynamics, kinematic acceleration ratio, gravitational anomaly<br />
总结:<br />
本研究基于Gaia Data Release 3的数据，发现了一些关于双星系统的引力异常现象。在对天体测量和径向速度进行了严格要求的情况下，研究发现了纯粹的双星系统，符合牛顿力学，但在较大距离下却显示出与牛顿预期有明显偏差的运动。这一发现在数据分析中得到了验证，并得出了相应的运动加速度比率，证实了在低加速度下存在引力异常现象。 <div>
It is found that Gaia Data Release 3 binary stars selected with stringent requirements on astrometric measurements and radial velocities naturally satisfy Newtonian dynamics without hidden close companions when the projected separation s ≲ 2 kau, showing that pure binaries can be selected. It is then found that pure binaries selected with the same criteria show a systematic deviation from the Newtonian expectation when s ≳ 2 kau. When both proper motions and parallaxes are required to have precision better than 0.005 and radial velocities better than 0.2, I obtain 2463 statistically pure binaries within a “clean” G-band absolute magnitude range. From this sample, I obtain an observed-to-Newtonian predicted kinematic acceleration ratio of {\gamma }_{g}={g}_{\mathrm{obs}}/{g}_{\mathrm{pred}}={1.49}_{-0.19}^{+0.21} for acceleration ≲10−10 m s−2, in excellent agreement with 1.49 ± 0.07 for a much larger general sample with the amount of hidden close companions self-calibrated. I also investigate the radial profile of stacked sky-projected relative velocities without a deprojection to the 3D space. The observed profile matches the Newtonian predicted profile for s ≲ 2 kau without any free parameters, but shows a clear deviation at a larger separation with a significance of ≈5.0σ. The projected velocity boost factor for s ≳ 5 kau is measured to be {\gamma }_{{v}_{p}}=1.20\pm 0.06 (stat) ±0.05 (sys) matching \sqrt{{\gamma }_{g}}. Finally, for a small sample of 40 binaries with exceptionally precise radial velocities (fractional errors &lt;0.005), the directly measured relative velocities in the 3D space also show a boost at larger separations. These results robustly confirm the recently reported gravitational anomaly at low acceleration for a general sample.

<title>Influence of Jets on [O iii] Extensions in Green Pea/Bean Galaxies</title>

<div> 关键词: Green Peas, Green Beans, [O iii] emission, jets, EELRs

研究调查了具有强烈[O iii]λ5007发射的星系（即绿豆和绿豌豆）受喷流影响的情况。研究样本包括12个附近源（z∼0.04–0.1，其中六个有喷流，六个没有喷流），具有高的[O iii]发光度（L∼1040 erg s−1），这些样本来自于斯隆数字化天空调查和二十厘米射电天空调查观测的射电选择星系样本。我们在每个星系上进行了大双望远镜-多对象双光谱仪的长条谱学观测，沿着两个位置角度进行观测：一个与喷流方向对齐，另一个垂直于喷流方向。通过沿着这些切口追踪[O iii]发射，我们旨在评估狭线区域的延伸并检查喷流的影响。令人惊讶的是，我们的分析显示[O iii]发射的延伸没有首选方向，这表明喷流对延伸的发射线区域（EELRs）影响有限。这也暗示了可能会漏掉与喷流对齐的圆锥形EELRs的检测，这归因于我们的切口方向。此外，我们比较了跟踪星形区域的[O ii]发射与[O iii]的延伸。我们观察到了显著的差异，[O ii]沿着星系平面展示了更大的延伸，这表明[O ii]发射与恒星过程的关联更加强烈。

<br /><br />总结:
1. 研究对象为具有高 [O iii] 发射的星系，分为有喷流和无喷流两组。
2. 使用长条谱学观测评估了狭线区域的延伸，并检查了喷流的影响。
3. 结果显示喷流对延伸的发射线区域影响有限，没有首选方向。
4. 比较了 [O ii] 和 [O iii] 发射的延伸，发现 [O ii] 更与恒星过程关联。
5. 研究结果暗示可能漏掉与喷流对齐的圆锥形 EELRs 的检测。 <div>
We present a study investigating the influence of jets on galaxies exhibiting strong [O iii]λ5007 emission, known as Green Peas and Green Beans. Our sample comprised 12 nearby sources (z ∼ 0.04–0.1, six with jets and six without jets) with high [O iii] luminosity (L ∼ 1040 erg s−1), selected from a radio-selected galaxy sample observed with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and Radio Sky at Twenty-centimeters survey. We perform Large Binocular Telescope–Multi-Object Double Spectrograph long-slit spectroscopy at two position angles for each galaxy: one aligned with the jet direction and another perpendicular to it. By tracing the [O iii] emission along these slits, we aimed to assess the extension of the narrow line region and examine the impact of jets. Surprisingly, our analysis revealed no preferred direction for the extension of the [O iii] emission, indicating that jets have a limited influence on the extended emission line regions (EELRs). This also suggests the possibility of missed detection of conical-shaped EELRs aligned with the jets, attributable to our slit orientations. Furthermore, we compared the extension of [O ii] emission, which traces star-forming regions, with that of [O iii]. We observed a significant difference, with [O ii] exhibiting a considerably greater extension along the galactic plane. This suggests a stronger association of [O ii] emission with stellar processes.

<div> 关键词: spicules, transverse waves, coronal heating, p-modes, magneto-convection simulation

总结: <br /><br />此研究对太阳大气层中的横波进行了观测和模拟研究，发现高频率的横波振荡与长时间尺度的颗粒运动有着明显的区别，并提出了它们是通过纵波的模式转换而产生的。研究通过二维磁流体对流模拟，并在底部边界引入了类似p模式的激励源，发现了纵波向横波的能量转移效应，使得横波振荡的振幅和能量通量都得到了显著增加。这些发现为解释日冕的加热过程提供了重要线索。 <div>
Lateral motions of spicules serve as vital indicators of transverse waves in the solar atmosphere, and their study is crucial for understanding the wave-heating process of the corona. Recent observations have focused on high-frequency transverse waves (periods &lt; 100 s), which have the potential to transport sufficient energy for coronal heating. These high-frequency spicule oscillations are distinct from granular motions, which have much longer timescales of 5–10 minutes. Instead, it is proposed that they are generated through the mode conversion from high-frequency longitudinal waves that arise from a shock-steepening process. Therefore, these oscillations may not solely be produced by the horizontal buffeting motions of granulation but also by the leakage of p-mode oscillations. To investigate the contribution of p-modes, our study employs a two-dimensional magneto-convection simulation spanning from the upper convection zone to the corona. During the course of the simulation, we introduce a p-mode-like driver at the bottom boundary. We reveal a notable increase in the mean velocity amplitude of the transverse oscillations in spicules, ranging from 10%–30%, and attribute this to the energy transfer from longitudinal to transverse waves. This effect results in an enhancement of the estimated energy flux by 30%–80%.

<br />
卡西尼轨道飞行器紫外成像光谱仪（UVIS）从1999年到2017年获得了行星间的氢 Lyα 观测数据，其中2004年到2017年的观测数据是在土星轨道上获得的。飞船在土星轨道阶段从太阳圈层中的主要下风和侧风移动到上风位置。研究人员使用现有的热氢密度模型和最近用于研究太阳和日球观测器太阳风各向异性实验数据以及2003年到2004年间选定的卡西尼UVIS观测数据的太阳光照模型进行了所有观测数据分析。他们发现数据和模型之间存在一般的一致性，但有证据表明UVIS Lyα的灵敏度在2002年6月经历一次明显的下降，以及整体上近似线性下降。此前由普赛尔等人进行的工作使用UVIS实验室灵敏度校准拟合了2003年至2004年的UVIS Lyα数据，得出外太阳圈（但在外太阳圈边界进行了过滤）中的氢密度为0.085cm-3的估计值。然而，包括此处发现的灵敏度下降导致修订后的氢密度估计值为nH = 0.14 ± 0.03 cm−3。这一密度估计值与最近根据对新视野号飞船拾取氢离子观测的模型得出的终止冲击附近的中性氢密度估计值为0.127 ± 0.015 cm−3一致。 <br /><br />总结: 卡西尼轨道飞行器通过紫外成像光谱仪对行星间的氢进行观测，发现了UVIS Lyα灵敏度的下降，重新估计了外太阳圈的氢密度，与最近的模型观测结果一致。 <div>
The Cassini Orbiter Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) obtained interplanetary hydrogen Lyα observations from 1999 to 2017, with mid-2004 to 2017 observations obtained from Saturn orbit. During its Saturn orbital phase, the spacecraft moved from mostly downwind and sidewind in the heliosphere to upwind. We analyze the full set of observations with our existing hot hydrogen density model with a solar illumination model most recently used to study Solar and Heliospheric Observatory Solar Wind Anisotropy Experiment data and selected Cassini UVIS observations from 2003 to 2004. We find general agreement between data and model, but with evidence for a decline in UVIS Lyα sensitivity, with a significant decline in 2002 June during a starburn event and an overall roughly linear decline in sensitivity. While earlier work by Pryor et al. fit the UVIS Lyα data from 2003 to 2004 with a hydrogen density in the outer heliosphere (but after filtration at outer heliospheric boundaries) of 0.085  cm−3 using the UVIS laboratory sensitivity calibration, including the sensitivity decline found here leads to a revised hydrogen density estimate of nH = 0.14 ± 0.03 cm−3. This density estimate is consistent with a recent neutral hydrogen density estimate near the termination shock of 0.127 ± 0.015  cm−3 based on models of observations of pick-up hydrogen ions from the New Horizons spacecraft.

<div> PNS, neutrino emission, mass accretion, event rates, neutrino oscillation model
<br /><br />总结:
本研究通过对PNS质量回落至中子星的恒星上的物质吸积，利用完整的玻尔兹曼中微子输运进行中微子辐射-流体动力学模拟，调查了由物质吸积导致的延迟中微子辐射。我们追踪了PNS的吸积流动的时间演化，直到系统达到准稳态。吸积流动中通常形成一个驻波震荡，而震荡半径因物质吸积率和PNS质量而异。在PNS附近（∼10 公里）出现温度急剧增加，表征了中微子的辐射。随着物质吸积率和PNS质量的增加，中微子的发光度和平均能量也会增加。发射的中微子的平均能量在10 ≲ ϵ ≲ 20 MeV范围内，高于PNS冷却模型估计的值（≲10 MeV）。假设恒星型核心崩溃距离为10千秒差距，我们量化了Super-Kamiokande（超级神农）和深地下中微子实验（DUNE）的中微子事件率。估计的检测率远高于背景噪声，并且其能量依赖特征与PNS冷却模型的预期有质的不同。另一个显著特征是中微子辐射对味道的依赖性强，表现出中微子振荡模型的相关性。我们在考虑绝热米克耶夫-斯米尔诺夫-沃尔芬斯坦模型的情况下对其进行估算，结果显示在Super-K和DUNE中，正常和反转质量序列分别提供了大量的中微子探测。因此，Super-K和DUNE同时观测回落中微子将对中微子质量排列提供强有力的约束。 <div>
We investigate the late-time neutrino emission powered by fallback mass accretion onto a protoneutron star (PNS), using neutrino radiation-hydrodynamic simulations with full Boltzmann neutrino transport. We follow the time evolution of the accretion flow onto the PNS until the system reaches a quasi-steady state. A standing shock wave is commonly formed in the accretion flow, whereas the shock radius varies depending on the mass accretion rate and the PNS mass. A sharp increase in temperature emerges in the vicinity of the PNS (∼10 km), which characterizes neutrino emission. Both the neutrino luminosity and the average energy become higher with increasing mass accretion rate and PNS mass. The mean energy of the emitted neutrinos is in the range of 10 ≲ ϵ ≲ 20 MeV, which is higher than that estimated from PNS cooling models (≲10 MeV). Assuming a distance to core-collapse supernova of 10 kpc, we quantify neutrino event rates for Super-Kamiokande (Super-K) and Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE). The estimated detection rates are well above the background, and their energy-dependent features are qualitatively different from those expected from PNS cooling models. Another notable feature is that the neutrino emission is strongly flavor dependent, exhibiting that the neutrino event rate hinges on the neutrino oscillation model. We estimate them in the case with the adiabatic Mikheev–Smirnov–Wolfenstein model, and show that the normal and inverted mass hierarchy offer a large number of neutrino detections in Super-K and DUNE, respectively. Hence the simultaneous observation with Super-K and DUNE of fallback neutrinos will provide a strong constraint on the neutrino mass hierarchy.

本文通过对太阳黑子中的螺旋波型的观测数据统计，得出了一些物理信息。研究发现螺旋波型的形成是由轴对称和非轴对称的黑子振动模式叠加而成。统计结果显示，从2013年到2018年，共检测到了241个螺旋波型，其中大部分只有一个螺旋臂。这些波型的振动周期和寿命与传统的黑子振动相当，没有明显的区别。另外，研究还发现螺旋波型的性质与太阳半球、纬度和黑子大小无关。通过对螺旋波型的视向速度和波传播模型的分析，得出螺旋波型可能在距离太阳光球表面2至11 Mm的地方产生，平均值约为6 Mm。 <div>
Spiral-shaped wave patterns (SWPs) observed in sunspot umbrae represent the superposition of axisymmetric patterns and nonaxisymmetric patterns of umbral oscillations. These patterns give us physical information about the source of oscillations below the surface. Here we present the statistics of their observational properties determined from the 304 Å line-intensity data obtained with the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory. From the 2013 to 2018 data set, we examined each of the 496 sunspots near the disk center for 2 hr. As a result, we identified 241 SWPs from 140 sunspots, which corresponds to the detection rate of 0.24 per hour in each sunspot. Most of the SWPs had one spiral arm, 48 SWPs had two arms, and only one had three. The oscillation period was estimated at 151 ± 27 s and the lifetime, at 770 ± 250 s, being comparable to those of conventional umbral oscillations. The rotation period of the SWPs was estimated at 190 ± 69 s for the one-armed SWPs and 299 ± 115 s for the two-armed SWPs. We found that the properties of the SWPs have no dependence on hemisphere, latitude, and sunspot size. From the apparent radial speeds of the SWPs and a simple model of wave propagation, we infer that the SWPs may be generated between 2 and 11 Mm below the photosphere with a mean value of about 6 Mm.

总结: <br />本文研究了来自太阳活动区和日冕孔区的等离子体射流的特征。研究发现，活动区中的射流源通常被吸收的色球物质所遮挡，而日冕孔区的射流则明显起源于喷发的小丝状物。文章通过观测和磁数据分析得出这一结论，并指出在活动区中，喷发的小丝状物可能会在射流显示出来之前失去小丝状物的特征。研究强调了日冕孔区和活动区射流特征的差异，为太阳活动的物理过程提供了重要参考。 <br /> <div>
Solar quiet- and coronal-hole region coronal jets frequently clearly originate from erupting minifilaments, but active-region jets often lack an obvious erupting-minifilament source. We observe a coronal-jet-productive active region (AR), AR 12824, over 2021 May 22 0–8 UT, primarily using Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) Atmospheric Imaging Array (AIA) EUV images and SDO/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager magnetograms. Jets were concentrated in two locations in the AR: on the south side and on the northwest side of the AR’s lone large sunspot. The south-location jets are oriented so that we have a clear view of the jets’ origin low in the atmosphere: their source is clearly minifilaments erupting from locations showing magnetic flux changes/cancelations. After erupting a projected distance ≲5″ away from their origin site, the minifilaments erupt outward onto far-reaching field as part of the jet’s spire, quickly losing their minifilament character. In contrast, the northwest-location jets show no clear erupting minifilament, but the source site of those jets are obscured along our line of sight by absorbing chromospheric material. EUV and magnetic data indicate that the likely source sites were ≳15″ from where the we first see the jet spire; thus, an erupting minifilament would likely lose its minifilament character before we first see the spire. We conclude that such AR jets could work like non-AR jets, but the erupting-minifilament jet source is often hidden by obscuring material. Another factor is that magnetic eruptions making some AR jets carry only a harder-to-detect comparatively thin (∼1″–2″) minifilament “strand.”

<br /><br />总结: GECKO项目旨在快速识别引力波事件的电磁波对应体——巨新星(KN)，并成功使用该策略在O3期间对GW190425进行了观测并发现了十个瞬变现象，但没有找到巨新星。GECKO观测展示了在定位区域约为数百平方度的情况下，可能能够发现距离<200 Mpc的GW170817-like KN。 <div>
One of the keys to the success of multimessenger astronomy is the rapid identification of the electromagnetic wave counterpart, kilonova (KN), of the gravitational-wave (GW) event. Despite its importance, it is hard to find a KN associated with a GW event, due to a poorly constrained GW localization map and numerous signals that could be confused as a KN. Here, we present the Gravitational-wave Electromagnetic wave Counterpart Korean Observatory (GECKO) project, the GECKO observation of GW190425, and prospects of GECKO in the fourth observing run (O4) of the GW detectors. We outline our follow-up observation strategies during O3. In particular, we describe our galaxy-targeted observation criteria that prioritize based on galaxy properties. Armed with this strategy, we performed an optical and/or near-infrared follow-up observation of GW190425, the first binary neutron star merger event during the O3 run. Despite a vast localization area of 7460 deg2, we observed 621 host galaxy candidates, corresponding to 29.5% of the scores we assigned, with most of them observed within the first 3 days of the GW event. Ten transients were discovered during this search, including a new transient with a host galaxy. No plausible KN was found, but we were still able to constrain the properties of potential KNe using upper limits. The GECKO observation demonstrates that GECKO can possibly uncover a GW170817-like KN at a distance &lt;200 Mpc if the localization area is of the order of hundreds of square degrees, providing a bright prospect for the identification of GW electromagnetic wave counterparts during the O4 run.

本研究报告了在早期宇宙时期（5.6 <7.0）对131个低亮度类星体的黑洞质量和厄ddington比率进行估计的分布情况。该研究基于Subaru Telescope安装的Hyper Suprime-Cam的调查数据，构建了一个低亮度类星体样本，其M1450∼-21等IL 。这些类星体的发现光谱仅限于约1200-1400埃的固有波长范围，不包含可用作黑洞质量估计器的发射线。为了解决这个问题，我们利用斯隆数字化巡天中的低z对应光谱，这些光谱在重叠波长范围内与高z光谱匹配。然后，我们将对应的C iv发射线宽度与SHELLQs数据的连续光度结合起来估算黑洞质量。结果显示，黑洞质量分布范围约为107-10M⊙，大多数类星体的黑洞质量约为108M⊙，具有次Eddington流。本研究不仅为我们提供了有关再电离时期正常类星体的新见解，还为准确估算没有近红外光谱高z类星体的黑洞质量提供了新的有效方法。<br /><br />总结: 本研究基于SHELLQs项目的数据，针对低亮度类星体进行了黑洞质量和厄ddington比率的估计。利用光谱匹配和连续光度估算相结合的方法，得出了黑洞质量分布范围和大多数类星体的特征。研究结果不仅为我们提供了有关再电离时期正常类星体的新见解，还提出了一个新的有效方法来估算高z类星体的黑洞质量。 <div>
We report the distribution of black hole (BH) masses and Eddingont ratios estimated for a sample of 131 low luminosity quasars in the early cosmic epoch (5.6 &lt; z &lt; 7.0). Our work is based on the Subaru High-z Exploration of Low-Luminosity Quasars (SHELLQs) project, which has constructed a low luminosity quasar sample down to M1450 ∼ − 21 mag, exploiting the survey data of Hyper Suprime-Cam installed on Subaru Telescope. The discovery spectra of these quasars are limited to the rest-frame wavelengths of ∼1200–1400 Å, which contain no emission lines that can be used as BH mass estimators. In order to overcome this problem, we made use of low-z counterpart spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, which are spectrally matched to the high-z spectra in overlapping wavelengths. We then combined the C iv emission line widths of the counterparts with the continuum luminosity from the SHELLQs data to estimate BH masses. The resulting BH mass distribution has a range of ∼107–10M⊙, with most of the quasars having BH masses ∼108M⊙ with sub-Eddington accretion. The present study provides not only a new insight into normal quasars in the reionization epoch, but also a new promising way to estimate BH masses of high-z quasars without near-infrared spectroscopy.

<br /><br />总结:
本研究利用二维全粒子动力学电磁粒子模拟，针对在典型日冕条件下弱磁化等离子体中的高次谐波发射过程进行了研究。研究发现，较大的束流速度有利于产生更高次谐波的辐射，并且随着谐波序数的增加，辐射强度递减。此外，H3辐射主要通过H2辐射与朗道波的合并生成，而H4辐射主要来源于H3辐射与正向/反向传播的朗道波的合并。这些发现有助于揭示高次谐波辐射的产生机制。 <div>
Electromagnetic radiation at higher harmonics of the plasma frequency (ω ∼ nωpe, n &gt; 2) has been occasionally observed in type II and type III solar radio bursts, yet the underlying mechanism remains undetermined. Here we present two-dimensional fully kinetic electromagnetic particle-in-cell simulations with high spectral resolution to investigate the beam-driven plasma emission process in weakly magnetized plasmas of typical coronal conditions. We focused on the generation mechanisms of high-harmonic emission. We found that a larger beam velocity (ud) favors the generation of the higher-harmonic emission. The emissions grow later for higher harmonics and decrease in intensity by ∼2 orders of magnitude for each jump of the harmonic number. The second and third harmonic (H2 and H3) emissions get closer in intensity with larger ud. We also show that (1) the H3 emission is mainly generated via the coalescence of the H2 emission with the Langmuir waves, i.e., H2 + L → H3, wherein the coalescence with the forward-propagating beam-Langmuir wave leads to the forward-propagating H3, and coalescence with the backward-propagating Langmuir wave leads to the backward-propagating H3; and (2) the H4 emission mainly arises from the coalescence of the H3 emission with the forward- (backward-)propagating Langmuir wave, in terms of H3 + L → H4.

We report on integral field unit (IFU) measurements of the host of the radio source 4C+37.11. This massive elliptical contains the only resolved double compact nucleus at parsec-scale separation, likely a bound supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB). i-band photometry and GMOS-N IFU spectroscopy show that the galaxy has a large rb = 1.″5 core and that the stellar velocity dispersion increases inside of a radius of influence rSOI ≈ 1.″3. Jeans Anisotropic Modeling analysis of the core infers a total SMBHB mass of {2.8}_{-0.8}^{+0.8}\times {10}^{10}{M}_{\odot }, making this one of the most massive black hole systems known. Our data indicate that there has been significant scouring of the central kiloparsec of the host galaxy.

<div> 关键词: 电子密度, 窄发射线区域, 活动星系核, 统一模型, SDSS Data Release 12

总结: 
该研究在SDSS Data Release 12中针对活动星系核（AGN）的Type-1和Type-2进行了电子密度（ne）的比较。研究发现Type-1 AGN的NLRs中的ne要高于Type-2 AGN，并提出了AGN活动时间长、导致更多电子注入NLRs的可能解释，以及Type-2 AGN中更强烈的星形成贡献导致ne较低的可能解释。这些结果对广泛认可的AGN统一模型提出了有趣的挑战。<br /><br /> <div>
In the manuscript, we check properties of electron densities ne traced by flux ratio Rsii of [S ii]λ6716 Å to [S ii]λ6731 Å in narrow emission line regions (NLRs) between Type-1 active galactic nucleus (AGN) and Type-2 AGN in SDSS Data Release 12 (DR12). Under the framework of unified model considering kiloparsec-scale structures, similar ne in NLRs should be expected between Type-1 AGN and Type-2 AGN. Based on reliable measurements of the [S ii] doublet with measured parameters at least 5 times larger than corresponding uncertainties, there are 6039 Type-1 AGN and 8725 Type-2 AGN (excluding the Type-2 LINERs and the composite galaxies) collected from SDSS DR12. Then, lower Rsii (higher ne) in NLRs can be well confirmed in Type-1 AGN than in Type-2 AGN, with the confidence level higher than 5σ, even after considering the necessary effects including effects of electron temperatures traced by [O iii]λ4364,4959,5007 Å on estimating ne in NLRs. Two probable methods are proposed to explain the higher ne in NLRs in Type-1 AGN. First, the higher ne in NLRs of Type-1 AGN could indicate longer time durations of AGN activities in Type-1 AGN than in Type-2 AGN, if AGN activities triggering galactic-scale outflows leading to more electrons injecting into NLRs were accepted to explain the higher ne in NLRs of Type-2 AGN than H ii galaxies. Second, the lower ne in NLRs of Type-2 AGN could be explained by stronger star-forming contributions in Type-2 AGN, considering lower ne in H ii regions. The results provide interesting challenges to the commonly and widely accepted unified model of AGN.

The chromatic contamination that arises from photospheric heterogeneities, e.g., spots and faculae on the host star presents a significant noise source for exoplanet transmission spectra. If this contamination is not corrected for, it can introduce substantial bias in our analysis of the planetary atmosphere. We utilize two stellar models of differing complexity, StARPA (Stellar Activity Removal for Planetary Atmospheres) and ASteRA (Active Stellar Retrieval Algorithm), to explore the biases introduced by stellar contamination in retrieval under differing degrees of stellar activity. We use the retrieval framework TauREx3 and a grid of 27 synthetic, spot-contaminated transmission spectra to investigate potential biases and to determine how complex our stellar models must be in order to accurately extract the planetary parameters from transmission spectra. The input observation is generated using the more complex model (StARPA), in which the spot latitude is an additional, fixable parameter. This observation is then fed into a combined stellar-planetary retrieval, which contains a simplified stellar model (ASteRA). Our results confirm that the inclusion of stellar activity parameters in retrieval minimizes bias under all activity regimes considered. ASteRA performs very well under low-to-moderate activity conditions, retrieving the planetary parameters with a high degree of accuracy. For the most active cases, characterized by larger, higher-temperature contrast spots, some minor residual bias remains due to ASteRA neglecting the interplay between the spot and the limb-darkening effect. As a result of this, we find larger errors in retrieved planetary parameters for central spots (0°) and those found close to the limb (60°) than those at intermediate latitudes (30°).

事件视界望远镜合作团队首次发布了对M87*和Sgr A*超大质量黑洞的单位视界图像，并提供了其周围物理条件的初步信息。他们使用三维广义相对论磁流体力学模拟与观测进行比较，初步约束了这些黑洞时空的特性。然而，由于观测辐射在改变等离子体和时空特性时产生的退化，准确区分吸积流的性质和时空特性仍具有挑战性。下一代事件视界望远镜观测预计将通过探索盘-喷流动力学的复杂相互作用来消除一些这些退化。GRMHD模拟和广义相对论辐射传输的计算结果显示，喷流的径向和方位动态与黑洞自旋密切相关。基于ngEHT对M87*的分辨率和图像重建能力，我们能够评估这种相关性的检测性和相关的不确定性。总的来说，我们的结果有助于评估未来事件视界望远镜观测来约束黑洞自旋的前景。 <br /><br />总结: 超大质量黑洞M87*和Sgr A*的首张单位视界图像的发布和通过GRMHD模拟研究黑洞自旋的相关性，有望为未来事件视界望远镜观测提供了约束黑洞自旋的前景。 <div>
The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) Collaboration has recently published the first horizon-scale images of the supermassive black holes M87* and Sgr A* and provided some first information on the physical conditions in their vicinity. The comparison between the observations and the three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations has enabled the EHT to set initial constraints on the properties of these black hole spacetimes. However, accurately distinguishing the properties of the accretion flow from those of the spacetime, most notably, the black hole mass and spin, remains challenging because of the degeneracies the emitted radiation suffers when varying the properties of the plasma and those of the spacetime. The next-generation EHT (ngEHT) observations are expected to remove some of these degeneracies by exploring the complex interplay between the disk–jet dynamics, which represents one of the most promising tools for extracting information on the black hole spin. By using GRMHD simulations of magnetically arrested disks and general relativistic radiative transfer (GRRT) calculations of the emitted radiation, we have studied the properties of the jet and the accretion disk dynamics on spatial scales that are comparable with the horizon. In this way, we are able to highlight that the radial and azimuthal dynamics of the jet are well correlated with the black hole spin. Based on the resolution and image reconstruction capabilities of the ngEHT observations of M87*, we can assess the detectability and associated uncertainty of this correlation. Overall, our results serve to assess the prospects for constraining the black hole spin with future EHT observations.

总结:
本研究分析了64个benchmark late-M和L矮星的金属丰度和J-K颜色之间的关系，发现它们显示出正相关性。对比实验结果和Drift-Phoenix模型预测的关系，发现金属丰度越高的天体在光度上表现更红。作者推测这是因为更高的金属丰度导致了这些大气层中更多的凝结物形成，使得这些超冷矮星在光度上显得更红。 <div>
We examine the relationship between metallicity and J − K color for 64 benchmark late-M and L dwarfs, all of which are wide companions to higher-mass stars, and six of which are new discoveries. We assess the correlation between the Δ(J − K) color anomaly (the difference in an object’s J − K color from the median color for field objects of the same spectral type) and the metallicity of the host star to investigate how metallicity affects ultracool photospheres. Using Spearman’s rank correlation test and Student’s t-test, the late-M dwarf (L dwarf) sample’s Δ(J − K) and metallicity show a positive correlation at the 95% (90%) confidence level. A linear fit to color anomaly as a function of metallicity finds a slope of 0.17 ± 0.07 for the late-M dwarfs and a slope of {0.20}_{-0.08}^{+0.07} for the L dwarfs. We also computed the Δ(J − K) versus metallicity relationship predicted by multi-metallicity model spectra generated using Drift-Phoenix. The modeled late-M dwarfs show a slope of 0.202 ± 0.03, which is close to our observational results, but the modeled L dwarfs show a slope of 0.493 ± 0.02, steeper than our observational results. Both our empirical results and the models indicate that more metal-rich objects should appear redder photometrically. We speculate that higher metallicity drives more condensate formation in these atmospheres, thus making these ultracool dwarfs appear redder.

本研究利用JWST观测到的347个红移在4 < z < 9.5的星系，采用二维参数模型进行分析，测量星系的整体结构参数并量化其在真实光学波段的全局特性。研究着重于得出包括宇宙表面亮度衰减和分辨率影响在内的可靠不确定性。根据全局Sérsic指数(n < 1.5)和观测轴比(q < 0.6)的指导，我们将星系的旋盘现象的发生率保守地下限定为约45%。在4 < z < 9.5的红移范围内，星系的真实光学波段亮度和有效半径之间存在关系，分别在4 < z < 5和5 ≤ z < 9.5的区间内，具有相似的斜率，但较高红移区间的截距略低一些(Re = 0.69 ± 0.05 kpc)，而低红移区间的为(Re = 0.91 ± 0.04 kpc)。在目前样本规模的限制下，我们发现在这些早期时期，n或Re并没有显著的红移演化。 <div>
We analyze 347 galaxies at redshift 4 &lt; z &lt; 9.5 using JWST observations from the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) program by simultaneously fitting a two-dimensional parametric model to the seven-filter Near Infrared Camera images to measure the overall structural parameters and quantify the global properties of the galaxies in the rest-frame optical band. Particular attention is devoted to deriving robust uncertainties that include, among other factors, the influence of cosmological surface brightness dimming and resolution effects. Using the global Sérsic index (n &lt; 1.5) and observed axial ratio (q &lt; 0.6) as a guide, we place a conservative lower limit of ∼45% on the incidence of galactic disks. Galaxies follow a relation between the rest-frame optical luminosity and effective radius in the redshift range 4 &lt; z &lt; 9.5, as well as separately over the intervals 4 &lt; z &lt; 5 and 5 ≤ z &lt; 9.5, with a very similar slope but a marginally lower zero-point in the higher-redshift bin (Re = 0.69 ± 0.05 kpc) compared to the lower-redshift bin (Re = 0.91 ± 0.04 kpc). Within the limitations of the current sample size, we find no significant redshift evolution of n or Re at these early epochs.

<br /><br />总结:
本研究利用强引力透镜效应的时间延迟距离来锚定宇宙距离，结合类星体作为辅助探测器，使用模型无关的方法确定哈勃常数H0。通过模拟数据集和高斯过程回归，我们展示了利用高红移的类星体可以扩展SNe Ia的红移范围，提高强透镜时间延迟距离测量的精确度。在时间延迟距离不确定性为距离数值的5%时，我们将H0的估计精度从2.1%提高到1.3%。 <div>
Absolute distances from strong lensing can anchor Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) at cosmological distances giving a model-independent inference of the Hubble constant (H0). Future observations could provide strong lensing time-delay distances with source redshifts up to z  ≃  4, which are much higher than the maximum redshift of SNe Ia observed so far. In order to make full use of time-delay distances measured at higher redshifts, we use quasars as a complementary cosmic probe to measure cosmological distances at redshifts beyond those of SNe Ia and provide a model-independent method to determine H0. In this work, we demonstrate a model-independent, joint constraint of SNe Ia, quasars, and time-delay distances from strong lensed quasars. We first generate mock data sets of SNe Ia, quasar, and time-delay distances based on a fiducial cosmological model. Then, we calibrate the quasar parameters model independently using Gaussian process (GP) regression with mock SNe Ia data. Finally, we determine the value of H0 model-independently using GP regression from mock quasars and time-delay distances from strong lensing systems. As a comparison, we also show the H0 results obtained from mock SNe Ia in combination with time-delay lensing systems whose redshifts overlap with SNe Ia. Our results show that quasars at higher redshifts show great potential to extend the redshift coverage of SNe Ia and thus enable the full use of strong lens time-delay distance measurements from ongoing cosmic surveys and improve the accuracy of the estimation of H0 from 2.1% to 1.3% when the uncertainties of the time-delay distances are 5% of the distance values.

Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the solar corona are often started from a potential field initial condition, which may be far from the true state of the coronal magnetic field. To test the sensitivity of the simulations to the initial condition, an electric-field-driven MHD code was initiated from three different initial conditions: the commonly used potential field, a nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) extrapolation, which is believed to be a better representation of the true coronal magnetic field, and a purely vertical field. After relaxation, the magnetic field in the MHD simulations was compared. It was found that there is a tendency for all of the initial conditions to converge to a similar connectivity, particularly in areas of strong fields that are not close to the boundary, suggesting that the final state of the simulation is not particularly sensitive to the initial condition. The relaxed solution more closely resembles the NLFFF initial condition than the other initial conditions, but still exhibits substantial differences from it.

总结: 本研究通过对STEREO任务观测到的152个太阳风耀斑进行了研究，发现其波矢偏离太阳-航天器线的绝对值比密度模型预测的分别大了3.72和2.10倍。通过蒙特卡洛模拟，探讨了密度不均匀对射电发射位置的影响，结果显示相对密度波动为0.40可以解释观测到的角度偏移。同时，多通量管太阳风模型证实了太阳风中存在这种数量级的相对密度波动。研究提出了一种波矢修正方法，以增强对太阳风中电子束的三角定位能力，证明了在使用这种修正后的射电三角定位可以可靠地跟踪太阳风中的电子束。 <div>
Interplanetary Type III bursts, generated by relativistic electron beams at solar flare reconnection sites, are explored through an investigation of 152 instances observed by the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory mission. This study reveals that the absolute values of the wavevector deviations from the Sun–spacecraft line are statistically 3.72 and 2.10 larger than predicted by the density model, assuming fundamental and harmonic emission, respectively. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we examine the impact of scattering by density inhomogeneities on the apparent locations of radio emissions in the interplanetary medium. The findings indicate that relative density fluctuations of 0.40 can account for the observed angular shift, a conclusion supported by the multiple flux-tube solar wind model, which confirms the presence of such magnitude of relative perpendicular density fluctuations in the solar wind. We propose a wavevector correction that incorporates this effect to enhance the triangulation of interplanetary Type III bursts, demonstrating that radio triangulation, with this correction, can reliably track electron beams in the interplanetary medium.

该研究关注最近光子探测器在测量暗物质方面的进展。研究人员提出使用具有角秒级视野和/或角分辨率的探测器来探测小矮星系（dSphs）中暗物质衰变产生的光子流。通过使用差分D因子来估计35个dSphs的信号流量，并发现相比传统估计，结果信号通量可以有超过1-10倍的增强。研究指出，8.2米斯巴鲁望远镜上安装的红外摄像机和光谱仪（IRCS）可以成为质量在eV范围内的暗物质探测器，特别是想桨粒子（ALPs）。观测德拉科或大熊星II dSphs与IRCS约1晚，将能够在质量范围1 eV≲ma≲2 eV内放置最严格的ALP暗物质限制。

Recent advances in photon detectors have provided exceptional sensitivities to dark matter with high angular resolution. Motivated by this, we present a detailed study of photon flux from dark matter decay in dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) by focusing on the detectors with arcsecond-level field of view and/or angular resolution. We propose to use differential D-factors since such detectors are sensitive to their dark matter distributions. We carefully estimate the differential D-factors of 35 dSphs. By using the differential D-factors, it turns out that the resulting signal flux can have a more than { \mathcal O }(1–10) enhancement compared to conventional estimations. Based on this analysis, we find that the Infrared Camera and Spectrograph (IRCS) installed on the 8.2 m Subaru Telescope can be an excellent dark matter detector for the mass in the eV range, particularly axion-like particles (ALPs). Observing the Draco or Ursa Major II dSphs with the IRCS for { \mathcal O }(1) night will enable us to place the most stringent bound for the ALP dark matter in the mass range of 1 eV ≲ ma ≲ 2 eV.

<div> 磁流体力学，环形磁场，极向场生成，初始场强，模拟演化 <br /><br /> 这是一项关于磁流体力学的模拟研究，探讨了不同初始磁场强度对大尺度极向场生成的影响。研究发现，不同磁场强度的模拟在演化早期即开始出现差异，并在研究期间保持明显差异，表明初始磁条件在模拟中留下持久的痕迹。两种模拟均无法进入磁控制的盘状态。模拟发现，从初始环形磁场中产生了极向场，初始磁场强度对模拟盘演化起着至关重要的作用。另外，作者指出，弱磁场和盘内网格细化边界的组合可能会引入计算人为失真，表现为弱场模拟中产生m=1模态的过密现象。 <div>
We present the results from a pair of high-resolution, long-timescale (∼105GM/c3), global, three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical accretion disk simulations with differing initial magnetic plasma β in order to study the effects of the initial toroidal field strength on the production of a large-scale poloidal field. We initialize our disks in approximate equilibrium with purely toroidal magnetic fields of strength β0 = 5 and 200. We also perform a limited resolution study. We find that simulations of differing field strengths diverge early in their evolution and remain distinct over the time studied, indicating that the initial magnetic conditions leave a persistent imprint in our simulations. Neither simulation enters the magnetically arrested disk regime. Both simulations are able to produce poloidal fields from initially toroidal fields, with the β0 = 5 simulation evolving clear signs of a large-scale poloidal field. We make a cautionary note that computational artifacts in the form of large-scale vortices may be introduced in the combination of initially weak field and disk-internal mesh refinement boundaries, as evidenced by the production of an m = 1 mode overdensity in the weak field simulation. Our results demonstrate that the initial toroidal field strength plays a vital role in the simulated disk evolution for the models studied.

总结:<br /><br />
这项研究使用ACT和WISE的观测数据进行了交叉相关分析，发现了在WISE×ACT TT交叉功率谱中30σ显著性的空间各向同性信号，被解释为ACT频率下的宇宙红外背景与WISE中的多环芳烃（PAH）发射的相关性。在银河系内，观测到星际尘埃光谱在范围103 < ℓ < 104内通常可以用幂律描述，但在一些地区表现出幂律指数的可变性和非幂律行为。研究还发现在35个不同的∼100平方度天空区域中，WISE总强度和ACT E模极化之间存在正相关关系，表明银河密度结构与局部磁场的对齐性在这些区域保持到亚秒尺度。TE谱在所有107个区域中的分布偏向于正值，而TB谱没有这种偏向。这项工作是迄今为止对银河尘埃TE光谱的高ℓ测量，表明与高分辨率中红外观测尘埃辐射的交叉相关是约束毫米波长度下尘埃发射空间统计的有效工具。 <div>
We present a cross-correlation analysis between 1^{\prime} resolution total intensity and polarization observations from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) at 150 and 220 GHz and 15″ mid-infrared photometry from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) over 107 12.°5 × 12.°5 patches of sky. We detect a spatially isotropic signal in the WISE×ACT TT cross-power spectrum at 30σ significance that we interpret as the correlation between the cosmic infrared background at ACT frequencies and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission from galaxies in WISE, i.e., the cosmic PAH background. Within the Milky Way, the Galactic dust TT spectra are generally well described by power laws in ℓ over the range 103  &lt;  ℓ  &lt;  104, but there is evidence both for variability in the power-law index and for non-power-law behavior in some regions. We measure a positive correlation between WISE total intensity and ACT E-mode polarization at 1000  &lt;  ℓ  ≲  6000 at &gt;3σ in each of 35 distinct ∼100 deg2 regions of the sky, suggesting that alignment between Galactic density structures and the local magnetic field persists to subparsec physical scales in these regions. The distribution of TE amplitudes in this ℓ range across all 107 regions is biased to positive values, while there is no evidence for such a bias in the TB spectra. This work constitutes the highest-ℓ measurements of the Galactic dust TE spectrum to date and indicates that cross-correlation with high-resolution mid-infrared measurements of dust emission is a promising tool for constraining the spatial statistics of dust emission at millimeter wavelengths.

总结: <br /><br />这项研究观察了NOAA活跃区13023中两个相邻的太阳黑子、它们之间的间隙以及大量从间隙和太阳黑子外沿传播出的磁特征。研究发现，磁场倾斜角度不同的磁特征(MMFs)可以分为垂直型和水平型，其磁通量生成速率平均比太阳黑子的磁通量丢失速率高出5.6倍。特别是垂直型磁特征的磁通量大约是两个太阳黑子总丢失磁通量的1.4倍。这些观察结果表明，具有垂直磁场的磁特征与太阳黑子的解体密切相关，并且间隙中的磁特征的磁通量约为总磁通量的三分之一，大部分的垂直型磁特征可能直接源自太阳黑子的本质。 <div>
The relationship between the decay of sunspots and moving magnetic features (MMFs) plays an important role in understanding the evolution of active regions. We present observations of two adjacent sunspots, the gap between them, and a lot of MMFs propagating from the gap and the sunspots' outer edges in NOAA Active Region 13023. The MMFs are divided into two types based on their magnetic field inclination angle: vertical (0° &lt; γ &lt; 45°) and horizontal (45° ≤ γ &lt; 90°) MMFs (V-MMFs and H-MMFs, respectively). The main results are as follows: (1) the mean magnetic flux decay rates of the two sunspots are −1.7 × 1020 and −1.4 × 1020 Mx day−1; (2) the magnetic flux generation rate of all MMFs is calculated to be −1.9 × 1021 Mx day−1, which is on average 5.6 times higher than the total magnetic flux loss rate of the sunspots; (3) the magnetic flux of V-MMFs (including a pore separated from the sunspots) is 1.4 times larger than the total lost magnetic flux of the two sunspots, and in a later stage when the pore has passed through the reference ellipse, the magnetic flux generation rate of the V-MMFs is almost the same as the magnetic flux loss rate of the sunspots; and (4) within the gap, the magnetic flux of V-MMFs is one-third of the total magnetic flux. Few V-MMFs stream out from the sunspots at the nongap region. All observations suggest that MMFs with vertical magnetic fields are closely related to the disintegration of the sunspot, and most of the MMFs from the gap may originate directly from the sunspot umbra.

We present the first results from a high-resolution simulation with a focus on galactic wind driving for an isolated galaxy with a halo mass of ∼1011M⊙ (similar to the Large Magellanic Cloud) and a total gas mass of ∼6 × 108M⊙, resulting in ∼108 gas cells at ∼4 M⊙ mass resolution. We adopt a resolved stellar feedback model with nonequilibrium cooling and heating, including photoelectric heating and photoionizing radiation, as well as supernovae, coupled to the second-order meshless finite-mass method for hydrodynamics. These features make this the largest resolved interstellar medium (ISM) galaxy model run to date. We find mean star formation rates around 0.05 M⊙ yr−1 and evaluate typical time-averaged loading factors for mass (ηM ∼ 1.0, in good agreement with recent observations) and energy (ηE ∼ 0.01). The bulk of the mass of the wind is transported by the warm (T &lt; 5 × 105 K) phase, while there is a similar amount of energy transported in the warm and the hot phases (T &gt; 5 × 105 K). We find an average opening angle of 30° for the wind, decreasing with higher altitude above the midplane. The wind mass loading is decreasing (flat) for the warm (hot) phase as a function of the star formation surface rate density ΣSFR, while the energy loading shows inverted trends with ΣSFR, decreasing for the warm wind and increasing for the hot wind, although with very shallow slopes. These scalings are in good agreement with previous simulations of resolved wind driving in the multiphase ISM.

总结: 
通过使用最小二乘法，从光度、光谱和星震观测中推断了60颗δ Scuti星的模型相关质量、金属丰度和年龄。发现大多数这些星的质量约为1.6太阳质量，金属丰度低于Z = 0.010。观察到了这些星年龄的双峰分布，大多数样本年龄小于30百万年，而其余的被推断为年龄较大，即数亿年。这项工作强调了大频率间隔（Δν）在δ Scuti星研究中的重要性。设计了三种机器学习模型，有望以更低的计算成本和更快的速度推断这些参数。这些模型还揭示了约束偶极模式可以显著改善年龄估计的重要性，径向模式简洁地包含了关于光度和温度的信息。使用机器学习模型，还对在估计质量、金属丰度和年龄时的星体可观测量的重要性进行了定性洞察。有效温度Teff大大影响了所有结构参数的推断，而星震偏移参数ϵ在年龄推断中起着重要作用。 <div>
Asteroseismology is a powerful tool to probe stellar structure. Spaceborne instruments like CoRoT, Kepler, and TESS have observed the oscillations of numerous stars, among which δ Scutis are particularly interesting, owing to their fast rotation and complex pulsation mechanisms. In this work, we inferred model-dependent masses, metallicities, and ages of 60 δ Scuti stars from photometric, spectroscopic, and asteroseismic observations using least-squares minimization. These statistics have the potential to explain why only a tiny fraction of δ Scuti stars pulsate in a very clean manner. We find most of these stars with masses around 1.6 M⊙ and metallicities below Z = 0.010. We observed a bimodality in age for these stars, with more than half the sample younger than 30 Myr, while the remaining ones were inferred to be older, i.e., hundreds of Myrs. This work emphasizes the importance of the large-frequency separation (Δν) in studies of δ Scutis. We also designed three machine-learning (ML) models that hold the potential for inferring these parameters at lower computational cost and much more rapidly. These models further revealed that constraining dipole modes can help in significantly improving age estimation and that radial modes succinctly encode information regarding luminosity and temperature. Using the ML models, we also gained qualitative insight into the importance of stellar observables in estimating mass, metallicity, and age. The effective temperature Teff strongly affects the inference of all structure parameters, and the asteroseismic offset parameter ϵ plays an essential role in the inference of age.

We investigate the seasonal variations of ion precipitation, utilizing observations from the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution mission spanning from 2014 January 4 to 2023 February 14. Our analysis reveals that a diminishing pattern characterizes the transition from Mars season Ls 0°–180° to Mars season Ls 180°–360°, manifesting as a reduction in precipitating ion fluxes. Additionally, we discern a significant influence of the crustal magnetic field on the seasonal variations in precipitating ion fluxes. Intriguingly, within regions where the crustal magnetic field exhibits a strong quasi-horizontal orientation, opposite seasonal trends become evident. The underlying physical mechanism driving these seasonal variations in ion precipitation is probably attributed to the mass loading effect that may decelerate the solar wind and influence the magnetic pileup. A detailed investigation is further demanded in the future.

<br /><br />总结: 该研究利用Hinode/X射线望远镜观测到的日冕图像，研究了FOV受限情况下排除的辐照率的比例，并发现在太阳活动最低期间和太阳活动周期上升阶段，排除的比例最高。 <div>
Soft X-ray images of the Sun obtained with multiple broadband filters provide a simple and useful method to calculate averaged coronal temperature and emission measure, from which we can further calculate solar X-ray irradiance in physical units, e.g., watts per square meter. However, X-ray telescopes are often designed for pursuing high spatial resolution, and thus the field of view (FOV) of full-Sun images is often limited over the limb, extending to only ∼1.3 R⊙. This indicates that the irradiance obtained from the limited FOV may underestimate the true full-Sun irradiance by failing to count the contribution from outside the FOV. This work uses Hinode/X-Ray Telescope (XRT) coronal images observed up to 1.7 R⊙ to investigate the fraction of irradiance excluded from the FOVs limited in size. The analysis indicates that the irradiance obtained within 1.1 R⊙, which is used for XRT irradiance study, excludes ∼3.5%/∼7% of irradiance relative to the value within 1.2/1.7 R⊙, respectively, for the active corona observed in 2022 July. In contrast, the excluded fraction increases to ∼7%/∼13%, respectively, for the minimum corona observed in 2009 August. To further investigate the dependence of exclusion fraction on the Sun’s activity level, we process mission long Yohkoh/Soft X-ray Telescope full-Sun images to compare the irradiance within 1.1 and 0.9 R⊙ with that obtained from the maximum FOV of 1.2 R⊙. We confirm that the exclusion fraction is the largest in the period around solar minimum. We also find that the average value of exclusion fraction is slightly but measurably larger in the rising phase than the declining phase of the solar cycle.

<div> CH3O, CH2OH radicals, complex organic molecules, interstellar dust, water ice surface
总结:
CH3O和CH2OH自由基是星际尘埃中复杂有机分子(COMs)的重要前体，它们可以产生多种类型的COMs。为了更好地理解不同类型COMs的化学演变，确定CH3O和CH2OH的丰度比至关重要。最近的研究表明，在冰尘表面，CH3OH和OH的反应在形成CH3O和CH2OH自由基中起着重要作用。然而，目前还没有提出这些自由基丰度的定量细节。本文实验确定了在10K下CH3OH + OH反应在水冰表面的分支比(CH3O/CH2OH)为4.3 ± 0.6。此外，反应中产生的CH3O自由基即使在10K的低温下也会参与随后的扩散反应。这一事实对于在冷分子云中COMs形成模型提供了关键信息。 <div>
The CH3O and CH2OH radicals can be important precursors of complex organic molecules (COMs) in interstellar dust. The COMs presumably originating from these radicals were abundantly found in various astronomical objects. Because each radical leads to different types of COMs, determining the abundance ratio of CH3O to CH2OH is crucial for a better understanding of the chemical evolution into various COMs. Recent work suggested that the reaction between CH3OH and OH on ice dust plays an important role in forming CH3O and CH2OH radicals. However, quantitative details on the abundance of these radicals have not been presented to date. Herein, we experimentally determined the branching ratio (CH3O/CH2OH) resulting from the CH3OH + OH reaction on the water ice surface at 10 K to be 4.3 ± 0.6. Furthermore, the CH3O product in the reaction would participate in subsequent diffusive reactions even at a temperature as low as 10 K. This fact should provide critical information for COMs formation models in cold molecular clouds.

The formation of a cold Jupiter (CJ) is expected to quench the influx of pebbles and the migration of cores interior to its orbit, thus limiting the efficiency of rocky planet formation either by pebble accretion and/or orbital migration. Observations, however, show that the presence of outer CJs (&gt;1 au and ≳0.3MJup) correlates with the presence of inner super-Earths (at &lt;1 au). This observation may simply be a result of an enhanced initial reservoir of solids in the nebula required to form a CJ or a yet-to-be-determined mechanism assisted by the presence of the CJ. In this work, we focus on the latter alternative and study the orbital transport of planetesimals interior to a slightly eccentric (∼0.05) CJ subject to the gravity and drag from a viscously evolving gaseous disk. We find that a secular resonance sweeping inward through the disk gradually transports rings of planetesimals when their drag-assisted orbital decay is faster than the speed of the resonance scanning. This snowplow-like process leads to large concentration (boosted by a factor of ∼10–100) of size-segregated planetesimal rings with aligned apsidal lines, making their expected collisions less destructive, due to their reduced velocity dispersion. This process is efficient for a wide range of α-disk models (and thus disk lifetimes) and Jovian masses, peaking for values ∼1–5MJup, which are typical of observed CJs in radial velocity surveys. Overall, our work highlights the major role that the disk's gravity may have on the orbital redistribution of planetesimals, depicting a novel avenue by which CJs may enhance the formation of inner planetary systems, including super-Earths and perhaps even warm and hot Jupiters.

<div> SN Ia, Nebular-phase observations, SN 2022pul, 03fg-like subclass, White dwarf merger<br />
总结:<br />
这篇文章介绍了关于异常型Ia超新星SN 2022pul的星际物质(CSM)相互作用和光谱特征的观测。在光学和中红外波段，SN 2022pul的光变曲线early rise表现出两个不同的部分，与CSM相互作用相关。在光学方面，SN 2022pul类似于SN 2012dn，而在星云相中，SN 2022pul展现出了03fg-like subclass的多样性。最后，使用JWST的数据，得到了首个03fg-like超新星的光学到中红外星云光谱。研究结果表明，SN 2022pul是由一个白矮星在C/O-rich CSM中发生融合而产生。 <div>
Nebular-phase observations of peculiar Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) provide important constraints on progenitor scenarios and explosion dynamics for both these rare SNe and the more common, cosmologically useful SNe Ia. We present observations from an extensive ground- and space-based follow-up campaign to characterize SN 2022pul, a super-Chandrasekhar mass SN Ia (alternatively “03fg-like” SN), from before peak brightness to well into the nebular phase across optical to mid-infrared (MIR) wavelengths. The early rise of the light curve is atypical, exhibiting two distinct components, consistent with SN Ia ejecta interacting with dense carbon–oxygen (C/O)-rich circumstellar material (CSM). In the optical, SN 2022pul is most similar to SN 2012dn, having a low estimated peak luminosity (MB = −18.9 mag) and high photospheric velocity relative to other 03fg-like SNe. In the nebular phase, SN 2022pul adds to the increasing diversity of the 03fg-like subclass. From 168 to 336 days after peak B-band brightness, SN 2022pul exhibits asymmetric and narrow emission from [O i] λλ6300, 6364 (FWHM ≈ 2000 km s−1), strong, broad emission from [Ca ii] λλ7291, 7323 (FWHM ≈ 7300 km s−1), and a rapid Fe iii to Fe ii ionization change. Finally, we present the first ever optical-to-MIR nebular spectrum of an 03fg-like SN Ia using data from JWST. In the MIR, strong lines of neon and argon, weak emission from stable nickel, and strong thermal dust emission (with T ≈ 500 K), combined with prominent [O i] in the optical, suggest that SN 2022pul was produced by a white dwarf merger within C/O-rich CSM.

总结:<br />
这篇论文提出了一个框架，用于对星体年龄进行概率预测，并使用SHapley Additive exPlanations来量化恒星演化和银河化学演化对这些预测的贡献。他们将这种可解释的预测框架应用于既包含各种演化阶段的模拟银河样本，又包含APOGEE模拟样本的红巨星。他们发现在前一种情况下，恒星演化是年龄估计的主要驱动因素，而在后一种情况下，由于演化信息受限，模型通过化学演化模型来估算年龄。他们还指出，由于使用了非内在的银河化学信息，估算出的趋势，如年龄-金属丰度关系，可能会偏离真实情况。 <div>
Stellar ages are key for determining the formation history of the Milky Way, but are difficult to measure precisely. Furthermore, methods that use chemical abundances to infer ages may entangle the intrinsic evolution of stars with the chemodynamical evolution of the Galaxy. In this paper, we present a framework for making probabilistic predictions of stellar ages, and then quantify the contribution of both stellar evolution and Galactic chemical evolution to those predictions using SHapley Additive exPlanations. We apply this interpretable prediction framework to both a simulated Milky Way sample containing stars in a variety of evolutionary stages and an APOGEE-mocked sample of red clump stars. We find that in the former case, stellar evolution is the dominant driver for age estimates, while in the latter case, the more restricted evolutionary information causes the model to proxy ages through the chemical evolution model. We show that as a result of the use of nonintrinsic Galactic chemical information, trends estimated with the predicted ages, such as the age–metallicity relation, can deviate from the truth.

<div> SDO, HMI, solar flares, proton beam heating, sunquakes
<br /><br />总结:
本文研究了太阳耀斑的一种可能机制，即通过非热的幂律分布的质子束加热大气层，产生的质子束加热模型可以解释HMI仪器的连续可观测性的增强，并在一定程度上解释了引起太阳地震的过程。研究发现能量较高的质子束（大于500keV）在HMI仪器的连续可观测性中表现更为显著，而能量较低的质子束（小于100keV）在引起太阳地震的过程中表现更为强烈，这为太阳耀斑的热加热机制提供了新的理论解释。 <div>
Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) observations reveal a class of solar flares with substantial energy and momentum impacts in the photosphere, concurrent with white-light emission and helioseismic responses, known as sunquakes. Previous radiative hydrodynamic modeling has demonstrated the challenges of explaining sunquakes in the framework of the standard flare model of “electron beam” heating. One of the possibilities to explain the sunquakes and other signatures of the photospheric impact is to consider additional heating mechanisms involved in solar flares, for example via flare-accelerated protons. In this work, we analyze a set of single-loop Fokker–Planck and radiative hydrodynamics RADYN+FP simulations where the atmosphere is heated by nonthermal power-law-distributed proton beams which can penetrate deeper than the electron beams into the low atmospheric layers. Using the output of the RADYN models, we calculate synthetic Fe i 6173 Å line Stokes profiles and from those the line-of-sight observables of the SDO/HMI instrument, as well as the 3D helioseismic response, and compare them with the corresponding observational characteristics. These initial results show that the models with proton beam heating can produce the enhancement of the HMI continuum observable and explain qualitatively the generation of sunquakes. The continuum observable enhancement is evident in all models but is more prominent in ones with Ec ≥ 500 keV. In contrast, the models with Ec ≤ 100 keV provide a stronger sunquake-like helioseismic impact according to the 3D acoustic modeling, suggesting that low-energy (deka- and hecto-keV) protons have an important role in the generation of sunquakes.

总结: 中国空间站POLAR-2实验的LPD有效载荷是低能X射线偏振检测器，用于观测2-10keV能量范围内的伽马射线暴快速辐射的偏振情况。该设备具有90°的广角视场，在预设计中采用了基于气体像素探测器的X射线光电偏振计组成的阵列。通过GEANT4 C++软件包进行了详细模拟，发现LPD的主要背景成分包括宇宙X射线背景和明亮的X射线源。在施加带电粒子背景排除算法后，LPD的平均背景计数率约为0.55 counts cm–2 s–1，并随着探测器的轨道和指向方向而变化。此外，还进行了关于不同视场和探测器指向的宇宙X射线背景和X射线明亮源的综合模拟和比较分析。 <div>
The Low-Energy X-ray Polarization Detector (LPD) is one of the payloads in the POLAR-2 experiment, designed as an external payload for the China Space Station deployment in early 2026. LPD is specifically designed to observe the polarization of gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt emission in the energy range of 2–10 keV, with a wide field of view (FoV) of 90° in preliminary design. This observation is achieved using an array of X-ray photoelectric polarimeters based on gas pixel detectors. Due to the wide FoV configuration, the in-orbit background count rate in the soft X-ray range is high, while GRBs themselves also exhibit high flux in this energy band. In order to assess the contribution of various background components to the total count rate, we conducted detailed simulations using the GEANT4 C++ package. Our simulations encompassed the main interactions within the instrument materials and provided insights into various background components within the wide-FoV scheme. The simulation results reveal that among the background components, the primary contributors are the cosmic X-ray background (CXB) and bright X-ray sources. The total background count rate of LPD, after applying the charged particle background rejection algorithm, is approximately 0.55 counts cm–2 s–1 on average, and it varies with the detector’s orbit and pointing direction. Furthermore, we performed comprehensive simulations and comparative analyses of the CXB and X-ray bright sources under different FoVs and detector pointings. These analyses provide valuable insights into the background characteristics for soft X-ray polarimeter with wide FoV.

<title>Post-merger Gravitational-wave Signal from Neutron-star Binaries: A New Look at an Old Problem</title>

<div> gravitational-wave signal, neutron stars, equation of state, Weyl scalar, quasi-universal relation
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了双中子星合并所产生的引力波信号的频谱特性，以及这些特性所包含的关于系统和物质方程状态的信息。通过使用Weyl标量ψ4的特性，他们提出了一个新的瞬时频率{f}_{0}^{{\psi }_{4}}，并建立了与该频率相关的“准通用”关系。他们还推导了合并频率{f}_{\mathrm{mer}}^{h}的新“准通用”关系，并发现在足够长的时间尺度内，ℓ = 2, m = 1引力波模式的幅度可能与传统的ℓ = 2, m = 2模式相当，这些发现对引力波研究具有重要意义。 <div>
The spectral properties of the post-merger gravitational-wave signal from a binary of neutron stars encodes a variety of information about the features of the system and of the equation of state describing matter around and above nuclear saturation density. Characterizing the properties of such a signal is an “old” problem, which first emerged when a number of frequencies were shown to be related to the properties of the binary through “quasi-universal” relations. Here we take a new look at this old problem by computing the properties of the signal in terms of the Weyl scalar ψ4. In this way, and using a database of more than 100 simulations, we provide the first evidence for a new instantaneous frequency, {f}_{0}^{{\psi }_{4}}, associated with the instant of quasi-time-symmetry in the dynamics, and which also follows a quasi-universal relation. We also derive a new quasi-universal relation for the merger frequency {f}_{\mathrm{mer}}^{h}, which provides a description of the data that is 4 times more accurate than previous expressions while requiring fewer fitting coefficients. Finally, consistent with the findings of numerous studies before ours, and using an enlarged ensemble of binary systems, we point out that the ℓ = 2, m = 1 gravitational-wave mode could become comparable with the traditional ℓ = 2, m = 2 mode on sufficiently long timescales, with strain amplitudes in a ratio ∣h21∣/∣h22∣ ∼ 0.1–1 under generic orientations of the binary, which could be measured by present detectors for signals with a large signal-to-noise ratio or by third-generation detectors for generic signals should no collapse occur.

<title>A Comparative Study of Two Contrasting Cosmic-Ray Events Caused by Solar Eruptions from NOAA AR 12673 in 2017 September</title>

<div> solar eruptions, AR 12673, Forbush decrease, ground-level enhancement, CMEs <br />
总结: 本研究通过现代仪器持续追踪太阳到地球的太阳耀斑活动和地基宇宙射线探测器，揭示了两次太阳耀斑事件对地球的所有活动链。首次太阳耀斑产生了CME抛射和CME驱动冲击波与地球相交，导致了宇宙射线减少事件。而第二次太阳耀斑的冲击波速度比第一次快得多，尽管第一次事件更好地与地球磁连接，并且耀斑相似，但第二次事件导致了宇宙射线增强事件。结果表明，宇宙射线增强事件的产生可以主要由足够快的CME驱动冲击波主导。 <div>
Two major solar eruptions on AR 12673 produced a Forbush decrease (FD) event (reduction of cosmic rays) on 2017 September 8 and ground-level enhancement (GLE; enhancement of cosmic rays) on 2017 September 10. The occurrence of two contrasting cosmic-ray events within 2 days that are associated with two similar X-class solar flares (X9.3 and X8.2) and share the same active region on the Sun provides us a rare opportunity to understand the dominant factors in determining the properties of transient cosmic-ray events. Using a suite of modern-day instruments continuously tracking solar eruptions from the Sun to the Earth with ground-based cosmic-ray detectors, we reveal the complete cause–effect chain of activities for these two events. We conclude that the different consequences on the ground arise from two effects of the eruptions near the Sun: (1) the geometric effect of CMEs and (2) the intensity effect of CME-driven shocks. The first eruption, which originated at the heliographic longitude of W34° on 2017 September 6, had its CME ejecta and CME-driven shock intercept the Earth, leading to the FD event. The second eruption, which occurred on September 10 at W88°, only had its far flank reach the Earth. The peak shock speed of 3344 km s−1 of the second eruption, much faster than the 2175 km s−1 of the first eruption, is the dominant factor producing the GLE event, even though the first eruption is better connected magnetically to the Earth and has a similar flare. The results indicate that the production of GLE particles can be dominated by fast-enough CME-driven shocks.

<br /><br />总结: 本研究使用TYPHOON长狭缝吸收线光谱技术对NGC 1365的恒星爆发带螺旋星系进行了分析。通过人口综合技术，确定了年龄和金属丰度的空间分布，以及年轻和老年恒星群体的星形成率、泛红、消光和消光与泛红比RV。研究发现恒星盘呈现明显的内外成长特征，年轻恒星群体的亮度分数呈向外增加的趋势，平均年龄减少，质量增长历史在最外层盘完成。年轻恒星群体的金属丰度在较大的星系中心距上呈下降梯度，而老年群体的金属含量则保持稳定。在星系中心区域，年轻群体的金属丰度急剧下降，低于老年群体的水平，这归因于金属贫穷气体的涌入，以及由活跃星系核和超新星反馈引起的星形成中断，并在数十亿年后以早期恒星的恒星风排出的气体再次开始。我们还提供了对后者的支持的简单模型计算。 <div>
We analyze TYPHOON long-slit-absorption line spectra of the starburst barred spiral galaxy NGC 1365 obtained with the Progressive Integral Step Method covering an area of 15 kpc2. Applying a population synthesis technique, we determine the spatial distribution of ages and metallicities of the young and old stellar populations together with star formation rates, reddening, extinction, and the ratio RV of extinction to reddening. We detect a clear indication of inside-out growth of the stellar disk beyond 3 kpc characterized by an outward increasing luminosity fraction of the young stellar population, a decreasing average age, and a history of mass growth, which was finished 2 Gyr later in the outermost disk. The metallicity of the young stellar population is clearly super solar but decreases toward larger galactocentric radii with a gradient of −0.02 dex kpc−1. On the other hand, the metal content of the old population does not show a gradient and stays constant at a level roughly 0.4 dex lower than that of the young population. In the center of NGC 1365, we find a confined region where the metallicity of the young population drops dramatically and becomes lower than that of the old population. We attribute this to the infall of metal-poor gas, and additionally, to interrupted chemical evolution where star formation is stopped by active galactic nuclei and supernova feedback and then after several gigayears resumes with gas ejected by stellar winds from earlier generations of stars. We provide a simple model calculation as support for the latter.

<div> 关键词: 黑洞自旋, 磁化阻滞盘, 磁流体动力学模拟, 星系演化, 引力波 <br />
总结: <br />
本研究关注辐射效率低且几何厚的磁化阻滞盘（MAD），发现MAD可以迅速将黑洞的自旋降低到极低水平。与标准薄亮盘相比，MAD使黑洞的自旋迅速降至0 < aeq ≲ 0.1。这意味着受MAD供应的高超艾登顿速率下快速吸积的黑洞往往会将大部分旋转能量损失到磁化相对论流出。研究还构建了一个半解析的黑洞自旋演化模型，考虑了盘和电磁喷流对黑洞产生的扭矩，并发现aeq的低值既是因为喷流减慢了黑洞自旋，也是因为盘失去了大部分角动量到流出。研究结果对活跃星系和其他系统的黑洞自旋演化以及引力波的演化有重要影响。 <div>
Black hole (BH) spin can play an important role in galaxy evolution by controlling the amount of energy and momentum ejected from near the BH into the surroundings. We focus on radiatively inefficient and geometrically thick magnetically arrested disks (MADs) that can launch strong BH-powered jets. With an appropriately chosen adiabatic index, these systems can describe either the low-luminosity or highly super-Eddington BH accretion regimes. Using a suite of 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we find that for any initial spin, an MAD rapidly spins down the BH to the equilibrium spin of 0 &lt; aeq ≲ 0.1, very low compared to aeq = 1 for the standard thin luminous (Novikov–Thorne) disks. This implies that rapidly accreting (super-Eddington) BHs fed by MADs tend to lose most of their rotational energy to magnetized relativistic outflows. In an MAD, a BH only needs to accrete 20% of its own mass to spin down from a = 1–0.2. We construct a semi-analytic model of BH spin evolution in MADs by taking into account the torques on the BH due to both the hydrodynamic disk and electromagnetic jet components, and find that the low value of aeq is due to both the jets slowing down the BH rotation and the disk losing a large fraction of its angular momentum to outflows. Our results have crucial implications for how BH spins evolve in active galaxies and other systems such as collapsars, where the BH spin-down timescale can be short enough to significantly affect the evolution of gamma-ray emitting BH-powered jets.

Here we explore the impact of all major factors, such as the nonhomogeneous gas distribution, galactic rotation, and gravity, on the observational appearance of superbubbles in nearly face-on spiral galaxies. The results of our 3D numerical simulations are compared to the observed gas column density distribution in the largest southeast superbubble in the late-type spiral galaxy NGC 628. We make use of the star formation history inside the bubble derived from the resolved stellar population seen in Hubble Space Telescope images to obtain its energy and demonstrate that the results of numerical simulations are in good agreement with the observed gas surface density distribution. We also show that the observed gas column density distribution constrains the gaseous disk scale height and the midplane gas density if the energy input rate can be obtained from observations. This implies that observations of large holes in the interstellar gas distribution and their stellar populations have the potential power to solve the midplane gas density–gaseous disk scale height degeneracy problem in nearly face-on galaxies. The possible role of superbubbles in driving the secondary star formation in galaxies is also briefly discussed.

We present the discovery and timing results of four pulsars discovered in a pilot survey at intermediate Galactic latitudes with the Five-hundred Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST). Among these pulsars, two belong to the category of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) with spin periods of less than 20 ms. The other two fall under the classification of “mildly recycled” pulsars, with massive white dwarfs as companions. Remarkably, this small survey, covering an area of 4.7 deg2, led to the discovery of four recycled pulsars. Such success underscores the immense potential of future surveys at intermediate Galactic latitudes. In order to assess the potential yield of MSPs, we conducted population simulations and found that both FAST and Parkes new phased array feed surveys, focusing on intermediate Galactic latitudes, have the capacity to uncover several hundred new MSPs.

In the X-ray data, we detected the 38 ms pulsations of the pulsar up to ∼60 keV with high significance. Additionally, we found that the pulsar's on-pulse spectral energy distribution displays significant curvature, peaking at ≈60 keV. Comparing the phase-averaged and on-pulse spectra of the pulsar, we found that the pulsar's off-pulse emission exhibits a spectral shape that is very similar to its on-pulse emission. This characterization of the off-pulse emission enabled us to measure the &gt;10 keV spectrum of the faint and extended PWN using NuSTAR's off-pulse data. We measured both the X-ray spectrum and the radial profiles of the PWN’s brightness and photon index, and we combined these X-ray measurements with published TeV results. We then employed a multizone emission scenario to model the broadband data. The results of the modeling suggest that the magnetic field within the PWN is relatively low (≈7 μG) and that electrons are accelerated to energies ≳400 TeV within this PWN. The electrons responsible for the TeV emission outside the X-ray PWN may propagate to ∼30 pc from the pulsar in ∼10 kyr.

<div> 关键词: gamma-ray bursts, spectral hardness, peak energy, X-ray afterglows, magnetar origin
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了 gamma-ray bursts 的谱硬度特征，使用了峰能量和硬度比两种参数进行分类和分析。研究发现，X 射线的硬度比值普遍低于γ射线。此外，作者还确认了几乎所有观测到的γ射线暴的光谱均可用破裂幂律函数描述，并验证了具有内部X射线高原的暴的磁星起源。另外，作者还指出类型IV暴的光谱受物质喷流几何形状的影响，与其他类型的暴有显著差异。对中性氢吸收对硬度比估计的影响可以忽略不计，尽管它可能会略微降低γ/X射线的亮度。 <div>
Spectral hardness of gamma-ray bursts can be characterized by either hardness ratio or peak energy, and the inconsistency of these parameters can reflect spectral diversity and complexity. We have chosen 310 Swift bursts with well-measured X-ray afterglows to analyze the distributions of their peak energies and hardness ratios before and after absorption of neutral hydrogen. We categorize them into four types according to X-ray temporal patterns and calculate the hardness ratios of both γ-rays and X-rays. It is found that the hardness ratios of X-rays are systematically smaller than those of γ-rays. We also find that both γ-ray hardness ratios and peak energies of bursts of types I, II, and III are identically distributed and are significantly lower than the corresponding measurements of type IV bursts in statistics, which hints that the evolving spectra of type IV bursts are most probably affected by the geometry of outflows. This proves that the influence of neutral hydrogen absorption on the estimation of hardness ratio is negligible even though it can reduce the brightness of γ/X-rays somewhat. Furthermore, we verify that almost all the observed spectra of gamma-ray bursts can be described by a broken power-law function and confirm a magnetar origin for the bursts with internal X-ray plateaus.

<br />
通过APEX对G34进行观测，发现了大尺度的、与细丝对齐的速度梯度，驱动了气体向G34中部岭的密集块体内的细丝状气体流入。这些流入是由重力控制的。同时，通过其他线的观测，还确认了MM2、MM4和MM5三个岭的气体内存在块体尺度的气体流入。这些岭的气体流入速率可能取决于大尺度细丝状气体的流入，因为这两个尺度上的流入速率是可比的。总结:
<br />
HMSF是一个多尺度的动态过程，由大尺度的细丝状气体流入驱动，而细丝内部的气体流入现象也得到了确认。整个过程可能受到重力和来自多种来源的湍流的影响。 <div>
There is growing evidence that high-mass star formation (HMSF) is a multiscale, dynamical process in molecular clouds, where filaments transport gas material between larger and smaller scales. We analyze here multiscale gas dynamics in an HMSF filamentary cloud, G034.43+00.24 (G34), using APEX observations of the C18O (2−1), HCO+/H13CO+ (3−2), and HCN/H13CN (3−2) lines. We find large-scale, filament-aligned velocity gradients from C18O emission, which drive filamentary gas inflows onto dense clumps in the middle ridge of G34. The nature of these inflows is gravity driven. We also find clump-scale gas infall in the middle ridge of the MM2, MM4, and MM5 clumps from other lines. Their gas infall rates could depend on large-scale filamentary gas inflows since the infall/inflow rates on these two scales are comparable. We confirm that the multiscale, dynamical HMSF scenario is at work in G34. It could be driven by gravity up to the filament scale, beyond which turbulence originating from several sources, including gravity, could be in effect in G34.

<div> 黑洞，中子星，超Eddington质量转移，高能中微子，超新鲜<br />
总结:
这篇文章讨论了由进化后主序星到黑洞或中子星伴星的超Eddington质量转移所引起的超星云膨胀，以及产生高能中微子的可能机制。研究指出，一些快速无线电暴（FRB）可能由这种短暂的喷射式超Eddington质量转移引擎驱动。根据模型计算，这些超新鲜可能产生的中微子排放量可以解释IceCube观测到的高能中微子弥散背景流的约25％，并且其时间平均中微子谱也与观测到的中微子谱相吻合。此外，这些超新鲜产生的中微子排放可能可延伸至>100 PeV，可以被未来的超高能中微子观测站所探测到。另外，超新鲜内的光学厚度会阻碍GeV–PeV能区的伽马射线逃逸，使得这些中微子源辐射的伽马射线相对较弱，与Fermi对各向同性伽马射线背景的观测结果相符。 <div>
Hypernebulae are inflated by accretion-powered winds accompanying hyper-Eddington mass transfer from an evolved post-main-sequence star onto a black hole or neutron star companion. The ions accelerated at the termination shock—where the collimated fast disk winds and/or jet collide with the slower, wide-angled wind-fed shell—can generate high-energy neutrinos via hadronic proton–proton reactions, and photohadronic (pγ) interactions with the disk thermal and Comptonized nonthermal background photons. It has been suggested that some fast radio bursts (FRBs) may be powered by such short-lived jetted hyper-accreting engines. Although neutrino emission associated with the millisecond duration bursts themselves is challenging to detect, the persistent radio counterparts of some FRB sources—if associated with hypernebulae—could contribute to the high-energy neutrino diffuse background flux. If the hypernebula birth rate follows that of stellar-merger transients and common envelope events, we find that their volume-integrated neutrino emission—depending on the population-averaged mass-transfer rates—could explain up to ∼25% of the high-energy diffuse neutrino flux observed by the IceCube Observatory and the Baikal Gigaton Volume Detector Telescope. The time-averaged neutrino spectrum from hypernebula—depending on the population parameters—can also reproduce the observed diffuse neutrino spectrum. The neutrino emission could in some cases furthermore extend to &gt;100 PeV, detectable by future ultra-high-energy neutrino observatories. The large optical depth through the nebula to Breit–Wheeler (γγ) interaction attenuates the escape of GeV–PeV gamma rays coproduced with the neutrinos, rendering these gamma-ray-faint neutrino sources, consistent with the Fermi observations of the isotropic gamma-ray background.

<div> 关键词: G106.3+2.7, 脉冲星风星云, gamma射线, 磁场, 多波段研究<br />
总结: <br />
G106.3+2.7被认为是一个复合超新星遗迹，具有类似回旋镖形状的脉冲星风星云和无线电波段的两个不同区域（“头”和“尾”）。最近在尾部发现了超高能量的γ射线发射，这表明G106.3+2.7是PeVatron候选星. 通过使用存档的无线电和Chandra数据，以及2020年的新NuSTAR X射线观测结果，我们对脉冲星J2229+6114周围100″范围内的Boomerang PWN进行了全面的多波段研究。 NuSTAR观测结果显示了脉冲星PSR J2229+6114的51.67毫秒自转周期和PWN辐射的能量谱，该辐射呈幂律模型，Γ值为1.52±0.06，直到20keV。与Kothes等人以前的无线电研究不同，根据（1）过去20年来X射线流量的稳定性，（2）脉冲星风星云的能量依赖性X射线尺寸和（3）多波段光谱能谱数据，我们更倾向于较低的PWN磁场（B∼3μG）和较大的距离（d∼8kpc）。我们的光谱能谱模型表明，脉冲星风星云目前正在被超新星逆冲击压缩，大约在1000年前被压缩。在这种情况下，头部区域应该是由早期被脉冲星注入的GeV-TeV电子形成，这些电子正在向低密度环境传播。 <div>
G106.3+2.7, commonly considered to be a composite supernova remnant (SNR), is characterized by a boomerang-shaped pulsar wind nebula (PWN) and two distinct (“head” and “tail”) regions in the radio band. A discovery of very-high-energy gamma-ray emission (Eγ &gt; 100 GeV) followed by the recent detection of ultrahigh-energy gamma-ray emission (Eγ &gt; 100 TeV) from the tail region suggests that G106.3+2.7 is a PeVatron candidate. We present a comprehensive multiwavelength study of the Boomerang PWN (100″ around PSR J2229+6114) using archival radio and Chandra data obtained two decades ago, a new NuSTAR X-ray observation from 2020, and upper limits on gamma-ray fluxes obtained by Fermi-LAT and VERITAS observatories. The NuSTAR observation allowed us to detect a 51.67 ms spin period from the pulsar PSR J2229+6114 and the PWN emission characterized by a power-law model with Γ = 1.52 ± 0.06 up to 20 keV. Contrary to the previous radio study by Kothes et al., we prefer a much lower PWN B-field (B ∼ 3 μG) and larger distance (d ∼ 8 kpc) based on (1) the nonvarying X-ray flux over the last two decades, (2) the energy-dependent X-ray size of the PWN resulting from synchrotron burn-off, and (3) the multiwavelength spectral energy distribution (SED) data. Our SED model suggests that the PWN is currently re-expanding after being compressed by the SNR reverse shock ∼1000 yr ago. In this case, the head region should be formed by GeV–TeV electrons injected earlier by the pulsar propagating into the low-density environment.

We present the stellar mass–stellar metallicity relation for 3491 star-forming galaxies at 2 ≲ z ≲ 3 using rest-frame far-ultraviolet spectra from the Lyα Tomography IMACS Survey (LATIS). We fit stellar population synthesis models from the Binary Population And Spectral Synthesis code (v2.2.1) to medium-resolution (R ∼ 1000) and high signal-to-noise (&gt;30 per 100 km s−1 over the wavelength range 1221–1800 Å) composite spectra of galaxies in bins of stellar mass to determine their stellar metallicity, primarily tracing Fe/H. We find a strong correlation between stellar mass and stellar metallicity, with stellar metallicity monotonically increasing with stellar mass at low masses and flattening at high masses (M* ≳ 1010.3M⊙). Additionally, we compare our stellar metallicity measurements with the gas-phase oxygen abundance of galaxies at similar redshift and estimate the average [α/Fe] ∼ 0.6. Such high α-enhancement indicates that high-redshift galaxies have not yet undergone significant iron enrichment through Type Ia supernovae. Moreover, we utilize an analytic chemical evolution model to constrain the mass loading parameter of galactic winds as a function of stellar mass. We find that as the stellar mass increases, the mass loading parameter decreases. The parameter then flattens or reaches a turning point at around M* ∼ 1010.5M⊙. Our findings may signal the onset of black-hole-driven outflows at z ∼ 2.5 for galaxies with M* ≳ 1010.5 M⊙.

<div> Hubble Space Telescope, ground-based surveys, progenitor detection, Legacy Survey of Space and Time, supernova

总结:<br />
本文探讨了使用地面广域调查数据来增加核心坍缩超新星（SN）前体星探测率的可能性。研究发现，通过结合前SN和晚期图像来搜索前体星的消失可以提高检测率。通过对ZTF数据进行搜索验证了这一概念。然后，通过模拟近距离SN的种群估算了Vera C. Rubin望远镜的LSST的前体探测率。研究还指出，亮宿主星系的背景会降低LSST灵敏度，预计在10年的调查中将检测到大约50个红超巨前体星和数个黄色和蓝色超巨前体星。此外，预计还将检测数百个前SN暴发。 <div>
The direct detection of core-collapse supernova (SN) progenitor stars is a powerful way of probing the last stages of stellar evolution. However, detections in archival Hubble Space Telescope images are limited to about one detection per year. Here, we explore whether we can increase the detection rate by using data from ground-based wide-field surveys. Due to crowding and atmospheric blurring, progenitor stars can typically not be identified in preexplosion images alone. Instead, we combine many pre-SN and late-time images to search for the disappearance of the progenitor star. As a proof of concept, we implement our search of ZTF data. For a few hundred images, we achieve limiting magnitudes of ∼23 mag in the g and r bands. However, no progenitor stars or long-lived outbursts are detected for 29 SNe within z ≤ 0.01, and the ZTF limits are typically several magnitudes less constraining than detected progenitors in the literature. Next, we estimate progenitor detection rates for the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) with the Vera C. Rubin telescope by simulating a population of nearby SNe. The background from bright host galaxies reduces the nominal LSST sensitivity by, on average, 0.4 mag. Over the 10 yr survey, we expect the detection of ∼50 red supergiant progenitors and several yellow and blue supergiants. The progenitors of Type Ib and Ic SNe will be detectable if they are brighter than −4.7 or −4.0 mag in the LSST i band, respectively. In addition, we expect the detection of hundreds of pre-SN outbursts depending on their brightness and duration.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了DECaLS剪切目录中的不同参数与斯隆数字化天文巡天中心星系的哈洛质量（Mh）之间的关系。结果表明，这些参数与Mh存在强烈的正相关关系，其中包括星际质量（M*）、星等离散度（σ*）、丰度匹配哈洛质量（MAM）和卫星速度离散度（σs）。Mh-M*和Mh-σ*的关系与星系团的丰度密切相关，而Mh-MAM和Mh-σs的关系则独立于此。研究还表明，σs是其中最佳的代理参数。此外，通过组合M*、σ*和MAM构建新的代理参数，可以最小化对丰度密度和星际发射率的依赖。最后，研究还探讨了Mh-超大质量黑洞（SMBH）质量的关系，并发现了SMBH快速线性生长阶段的迹象。同时发现Mh、M*和σ*之间的关联随着M*的变化而变化，表明不同的过程推动了星系和SMBH在不同阶段的生长。 <div>
Based on the DECaLS shear catalog, we study the scaling relations between halo mass (Mh) and various proxies for Sloan Digital Sky Survey central galaxies, including stellar mass (M*), stellar velocity dispersion (σ*), abundance-matching halo mass (MAM), and satellite velocity dispersion (σs), and their dependencies on galaxy and group properties. In general, these proxies all have strong positive correlations with Mh, consistent with previous studies. We find that the Mh–M* and Mh–σ* relations depend strongly on group richness (Nsat), while the Mh–MAM and Mh–σs relations are independent of it. Moreover, the dependence on the star formation rate (SFR) is rather weak in the Mh–σ* and Mh–σs relations, but very prominent in the other two. σs is thus the best proxy among them, and its scaling relation is in good agreement with hydrodynamical simulations. However, estimating σs accurately for individual groups/clusters is challenging because of interlopers and the requirement for sufficient satellites. We construct new proxies by combining M*, σ*, and MAM, and find that the proxy with 30% contribution from MAM and 70% from σ* can minimize the dependence on Nsat and the SFR. We obtain the Mh–supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass relation via the SMBH scaling relation and find indications for rapid and linear growth phases for the SMBH. We also find that correlations among Mh, M*, and σ* change with M*, indicating that different processes drive the growth of galaxies and SMBHs at different stages.

<div> 关键词: 核心坍缩超新星，双峰射电光度曲线，环绕恒星介质，同步辐射，快速冷却

总结:
核心坍缩超新星（CCSNe）的一些案例显示在爆炸几年内的双峰射电光度曲线。研究人员提出了一种新的机制来解释这种现象，即在同步辐射光谱能量分布的进化模型中引入快速和慢速冷却阶段，从而在观测频率下系统变得对同步辐射自吸收。当快速冷却转变为慢速冷却阶段时，射电光度曲线就会呈现双峰特征。研究人员还提出SN 2007bg作为这种双峰射电超新星的特例，并建议该模型可能成为评估超新星中电子加速特性的潜在手段。  <br /><br /> <div>
It is recognized that some core-collapse supernovae (SNe) show a double-peaked radio light curve within a few years since the explosion. A shell of circumstellar medium (CSM) detached from the SN progenitor has been considered to play a viable role in characterizing such a rebrightening of radio emission. Here, we propose another mechanism that can give rise to the double-peaked radio light curve in core-collapse SNe. The key ingredient in the present work is to expand the model for the evolution of the synchrotron spectral energy distribution (SED) to a generic form, including fast and slow cooling regimes, as guided by the widely accepted modeling scheme of gamma-ray burst afterglows. We show that even without introducing an additional CSM shell, the radio light curve would show a double-peaked morphology when the system becomes optically thin to synchrotron self-absorption at the observational frequency during the fast cooling regime. We can observe this double-peaked feature if the transition from the fast cooling to slow cooling regime occurs during the typical observational timescale of SNe. This situation is realized when the minimum Lorentz factor of injected electrons is initially large enough for the nonthermal electrons’ SED to be discrete from the thermal distribution. We propose SN 2007bg as a special case of double-peaked radio SNe that can be possibly explained by the presented scenario. Our model can serve as a potential diagnostic for electron acceleration properties in SNe.

TDEs在后星暴星系中过度表示；重新审视TDE率；包括AGN盘的演变；TDE率在AGN转为非活跃阶段时显著增强；解释TDE在后星暴星系中过度表示的原因。
<br /><br />总结:
TDEs在后星爆星系中过度表示，通过重新审视TDE率并考虑AGN盘的演变，发现TDE率在AGN转为非活跃阶段时会显著增强约2个数量级，这提供了对于TDE在后星爆星系中过度表示的解释。 <div>
Tidal disruption events (TDEs) provide a valuable probe for studying the dynamics of stars in the nuclear environments of galaxies. Recent observations show that TDEs are strongly overrepresented in post-starburst or “green valley” galaxies, although the underlying physical mechanism remains unclear. Considering the possible interaction between stars and active galactic nucleus (AGN) disks, the TDE rates can be greatly changed compared to those in quiescent galactic nuclei. In this work, we revisit TDE rates by incorporating an evolving AGN disk within the framework of “loss cone” theory. We numerically evolve the Fokker–Planck equations by considering star–disk interactions, in situ star formation in the unstable region of the outer AGN disk, and evolution of the accretion process of supermassive black holes. We find that the TDE rates are enhanced by about 2 orders of magnitude shortly after the AGN transitions into an inactive stage. During this phase, the accumulated stars rapidly scatter into the loss cone due to the disappearance of the inner standard thin disk. Our results provide an explanation for the overrepresentation of TDEs in post-starburst galaxies.

Recent observations of Her X-1 with NuSTAR (as well as with INTEGRAL, Swift, and Astrosat) have provided evidence that the nearly 20 yr-long decay of the cyclotron line energy since ∼1994 has ended and that a stable value has replaced the decay. Using the observations of the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (Insight-HXMT) performed between 2017 July and 2020 February, we analyze the spectra of Her X-1 in its main-on state, focusing on tracing the evolution of cyclotron line energy. While our analysis of eight main-on observations with Insight-HXMT (two in coordination with NuSTAR) shows significant differences with the results of NuSTAR, two earlier findings are confirmed: the positive correlation between the cyclotron line energy and the X-ray flux (source luminosity) and the constancy of the flux-normalized cyclotron line energy during 2017–2020—albeit with significant uncertainty about the absolute value.

<div> T Tauri stars, disk evolution, planet formation, accretion, stellar mass
<br /><br />总结:
这项研究研究了T Tauri恒星的盘演化时间尺度及其与吸积的关系。通过对数据的分析，发现了1077颗盘载T Tauri恒星候选者，其中有783颗新分类为传统T Tauri恒星或弱线T Tauri恒星。研究发现，M<0.35M☉的TTS在大约0.1百万年内就失去了它们的盘，而M>0.35M☉的TTS几乎所有盘都能存活超过0.1百万年，大部分能存活1百万年甚至20百万年。此外，发现了随着年龄增长，全盘TTSs与吸积TTSs的比例都呈现下降趋势，确认了全盘TTSs和吸积对非全盘TTSs的演化速度更快。最后，研究还发现较低质量恒星的吸积比率普遍低于较高质量恒星，确认了吸积与恒星质量的依赖关系。 <div>
The full disk, full of gas and dust, determines the upper limit of planet masses, and its lifetime is critical for planet formation, especially for giant planets. In this work, we studied the evolutionary timescales of the full disks of T Tauri stars (TTSs) and their relations to accretion. Combined with Gaia EDR3, Two Micron All Sky Survey, and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer data, 1077 disk-bearing TTS candidates were found in LAMOST DR8, and stellar parameters were obtained. Among them, 783 are newly classified by spectra as classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs; 169) or weak-lined T Tauri stars (WTTSs). Based on EW and FWHM of Hα, 157 TTSs in accretion were identified, with ∼82% also having full disks. For TTSs with M &lt; 0.35M☉, about 80% seem to already lose their full disks at ∼0.1 Myr, which may explain their lower mass, while the remaining 20% with full disks evolve at similar rates of non-full disks within 5 Myr, allowing enough time and material to form giant planets. The fraction of accreting TTSs to disk-bearing TTSs is stable at ∼10% and can last ∼5–10 Myr, suggesting that full disks and accretion evolve with similar rates as non-full disks. For TTSs with M &gt; 0.35 M☉, almost all full disks can survive more than 0.1 Myr, most for 1 Myr and some even for 20 Myr. For TTSs with M &gt; 0.35 M☉, almost all full disks can survive more than 0.1 Myr, most for 1 Myr, and some even for 20 Myr, which implies planets are more likely to be formed in their disks than those of M &lt; 0.35 M☉, and thus M dwarfs with M &gt; 0.35 M☉ can have more planets. The fraction of full-disk TTSs to disk-bearing TTSs decreases with age following the relation f ∝ t−0.35, and similar relations existed in the fraction of accreting TTSs and the fraction of full-disk CTTSs, suggesting faster full disks and accretion evolution than non-full disks. For full-disk stars, the ratio of accretion of lower-mass stars is systematically lower than that of higher-mass stars, confirming the dependence of accretion on stellar mass, which may be reflective of an observational bias in the detection of accretion levels, with the lower-mass stars crossing below the detection threshold earlier than higher-mass stars.

Supermassive primordial stars with masses exceeding ∼105M⊙ that form in atomically cooled halos are the leading candidates for the origin of high-redshift quasars at z &gt; 6. Recent numerical simulations, however, find that multiple accretion disks can form within a halo, each of which can potentially host a supermassive star. We investigate the formation and evolution of secondary supermassive stars in atomically cooled halos, including strong variations in their accretion histories driven by gravitational interactions between their disks and those surrounding the primary supermassive stars in each halo. We find that all secondary disks produce long-lived supermassive stars under sustained rapid accretion. We also find, however, that the majority of secondary supermassive stars do undergo at least one protracted quiescent accretion phase, during which time they thermally relax and may become powerful sources of ionizing feedback. In many halos, the two satellite disks collide, suggesting that the two stars can come into close proximity. This may induce additional mass exchange between them, leading to a great diversity of possible outcomes. These range from coevolution as main-sequence stars to main sequence—black hole pairs and black hole—black hole mergers. We discuss the likely outcome for these binary interactions based on the evolutionary state of both supermassive stars at the end of our simulations, as well as prospects for their future detection by current and next-generation facilities.

Measuring the coverage of dark spots on cool stars is important to understanding how stellar magnetic activity scales with the rotation rate and convection zone depth. In this respect, it is crucial to infer surface magnetic patterns on G and K stars, to reveal solar-like stellar dynamos in action. Molecular bands serve as invaluable indicators of cool spots on the surfaces of stars, as they play a crucial role in enabling accurate assessments of the extent of spot coverage across the stellar surface. Therefore, more reliable surface images can be obtained considering the inversion of atomic lines with molecular bands. In this context, we simultaneously carry out Doppler imaging (DI) using atomic lines as well as titanium oxide band profiles of PW And (K2 V) and also investigate chromospheric activity indicators for the first time in the literature, using high-resolution spectra. The surface spot distribution obtained from the inversion process represents both atomic line and TiO-band profiles quite accurately. The chromospheric emission is also correlated with photospheric spot coverage, except during a possible flare event during the observations. We detect frequent flare activity, using TESS photometry. We also introduce a new open-source, Python-based DI code SpotDIPy that allows performing surface reconstructions of single stars using the maximum entropy method. We test the code by comparing surface reconstruction simulations with the extensively used DoTS code. We show that the surface brightness distribution maps reconstructed via both codes using the same simulated data are consistent with each other.

总结:
该研究探讨了高斯过程（GPs）作为一种机器学习算法在重建哈勃参数H(z)方面的前景，考虑了即将到来的引力波观测任务eLISA和Einstein Telescope。研究假设了各种宇宙学背景模型，并利用实际生成的目录，非参数地利用GPs重建了Hubble参数。研究重点讨论了早期和晚期先验对H(z)重建的影响，进而对哈勃常数（H0）的影响。分析表明，GPs在特定任务的观测窗口内对宇宙膨胀历史的重建是相当稳健的。该研究进一步证实，eLISA和ET都能够提供对H(z)和H0的约束，这些约束与当前数据集的推断相竞争。特别地，研究发现，eLISA大约持续10年，观测到大约80个明亮的引力波事件时，将能够像大约持续3年的ET运行观测大约1000个明亮的引力波事件一样准确地约束H0。预计，在更长的eLISA任务持续时间（例如大约15年，有大约120个事件）内，精确度会有进一步提高。最后，针对每个模型，讨论了这些未来的引力波观测任务在解决哈勃张力中可能发挥的作用。 <br /><br /> <div>
We study the prospects of Gaussian processes (GPs), a machine-learning (ML) algorithm, as a tool to reconstruct the Hubble parameter H(z) with two upcoming gravitational-wave (GW) missions, namely, the evolved Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (eLISA) and the Einstein Telescope (ET). Assuming various background cosmological models, the Hubble parameter has been reconstructed in a nonparametric manner with the help of a GP using realistically generated catalogs for each mission. The effects of early-time and late-time priors on the reconstruction of H(z), and hence on the Hubble constant (H0), have also been focused on separately. Our analysis reveals that a GP is quite robust in reconstructing the expansion history of the Universe within the observational window of the specific missions under consideration. We further confirm that both eLISA and ET would be able to provide constraints on H(z) and H0, which would be competitive to those inferred from current data sets. In particular, we observe that an eLISA run of a ∼10 yr duration with ∼80 detected bright siren events would be able to constrain H0 as precisely as a ∼3 yr ET run assuming ∼1000 bright siren event detections. Further improvement in precision is expected for longer eLISA mission durations such as a ∼15 yr time frame having ∼120 events. Lastly, we discuss the possible role of these future GW missions in addressing the Hubble tension, for each model, on a case-by-case basis.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章主要介绍了M矮星的活动随时间的演化，特别关注了它们的磁活动以及X-UV辐射，这对于研究外层大气和宿主外行星的适居性至关重要。研究发现M矮星的活动会随着时间而有所下降，这可能成为确定M矮星年龄的重要因素。文章还讨论了M矮星活动与外行星大气流失机制的关联以及不同的磁活动机制。 <div>
The vast majority of stars in the nearby stellar neighborhood are M dwarfs. Their low masses and luminosities result in slow rates of nuclear evolution and minimal changes to the stars’ observable properties, even along astronomical timescales. However, they possess relatively powerful magnetic dynamos and resulting X-ray to UV (X–UV) activity, compared to their bolometric luminosities. This magnetic activity does undergo an observable decline over time, potentially making it a key age determinant for M dwarfs. Observing this activity is important for studying the outer atmospheres of these stars, but also for comparing the behaviors of different spectral type subsets of M dwarfs; e.g., those with partially versus fully convective interiors. Beyond stellar astrophysics, understanding the X–UV activity of M dwarfs over time is a key component when studying the atmospheres and habitability of any hosted exoplanets. Earth-sized exoplanets, in particular, are more commonly found orbiting M dwarfs than any other stellar type, and thermal escape (driven by the M dwarf X–UV activity) is believed to be the dominant atmospheric loss mechanism for these planets. Utilizing recently calibrated M dwarf age–rotation relationships, also constructed as part of the Living with a Red Dwarf program, we have analyzed the evolution of M dwarf activity over time, in terms of coronal (X-ray), chromospheric (Lyα, and Ca ii), and overall X–UV (5–1700 Å) emissions. The activity–age relationships presented here will be useful for studying exoplanet habitability and atmospheric loss, and also for studying the different dynamo and outer atmospheric heating mechanisms at work in M dwarfs.

光学光度曲线的早期阶段受到汤姆逊散射和超新星喷射物中的化学混合的影响。研究发现，考虑汤姆逊散射会导致光度峰值明显降低，并且初期光学光度曲线出现了持续几天的平台特征。此外，化学混合对模拟结果和观测数据之间的差异也起到了重要作用，表明简单的方法可能会引入很大的不确定性。总结:光学光度曲线受汤姆逊散射和化学混合的影响；汤姆逊散射降低了光度峰值；模拟结果出现了持续几天的平台特征；化学混合对模拟结果和观测数据之间的差异起到了重要作用。 <div>
Previous numerical simulations of double-peaked Type IIb supernova (SN IIb) light curves have demonstrated that the radius and mass of the hydrogen-rich envelope of the progenitor star can significantly influence the brightness and timescale of the early-time light curve around the first peak. In this study, we investigate how Thomson scattering and chemical mixing in the SN ejecta affect the optical light curves during the early stages of the SNe IIb using radiation hydrodynamics simulations. By comparing the results from two different numerical codes (i.e., STELLA and SNEC), we find that the optical brightness of the first peak can be reduced by more than a factor of 3 as a result of the effect of Thomson scattering that causes the thermalization depth to be located below the Rosseland mean photosphere, compared to the corresponding case where this effect is ignored. We also observe a short-lived plateau-like feature lasting for a few days in the early-time optical light curves of our models, in contrast to typical observed SNe IIb that show a quasi-linear decrease in optical magnitudes after the first peak. A significant degree of chemical mixing between the hydrogen-rich envelope and the helium core in SN ejecta is required to reconcile this discrepancy between the model prediction and observation. Meanwhile, to properly reproduce the first peak, a significant mixing of 56Ni into the hydrogen-rich outermost layers should be restricted. Our findings indicate that inferring the SN IIb progenitor structure from a simplified approach that ignores these two factors may introduce substantial uncertainty.

内部重力波在低频极限下自然是伪不可压缩的。在这种极限下, 一些anelastic近似形式无法正确再现内部重力波的行为。伪不可压缩近似假设压力的波动在连续方程中很小，而在非绝热层，这两种近似方法是相同的，但在稳定层中，它们之间的差异很大，只有伪不可压缩近似仍然有效。 <br /><br />总结: 内部重力波在低频极限下是伪不可压缩的，伪不可压缩近似假设压力的波动很小，适用于稳定层。与非绝热层的区别。 <div>
Starting from the fully compressible fluid equations in a plane-parallel atmosphere, we demonstrate that linear internal gravity waves are naturally pseudo-incompressible in the limit that the wave frequency ω is much less than that of surface gravity waves, i.e., \omega \ll \sqrt{{{gk}}_{h}}, where g is the gravitational acceleration and kh is the horizontal wavenumber. We accomplish this by performing a formal expansion of the wave functions and the local dispersion relation in terms of a dimensionless frequency \varepsilon =\omega /\sqrt{{{gk}}_{h}}. Further, we show that, in this same low-frequency limit, several forms of the anelastic approximation, including the Lantz–Braginsky–Roberts formulation, poorly reproduce the correct behavior of internal gravity waves. The pseudo-incompressible approximation is achieved by assuming that Eulerian fluctuations of the pressure are small in the continuity equation—whereas, in the anelastic approximation, Eulerian density fluctuations are ignored. In an adiabatic stratification, such as occurs in a convection zone, the two approximations become identical. However, in a stable stratification, the differences between the two approximations are stark and only the pseudo-incompressible approximation remains valid.

总结：<br /><br />这篇论文利用JWST/NIRSpec采集的光谱数据独立确认了16个红移为z=8.61-11.40的星系，并且发现了一个z=4.91的明亮干扰物。结合文献中的其他9个星系，共确认了25个星系，使用这些数据得出了紫外光度函数的确定性和下限，显示出对z∼12有轻微的红移演化。同时也得出了宇宙星系形成率密度的下限，证实了z∼12存在高星系形成率密度，支持了之前的光度研究结果。此外，作者还提出了一些观测策略，以有效地排除未来JWST项目中的低红移干扰因素。 <div>
We present pure spectroscopic constraints on the UV luminosity functions and cosmic star formation rate (SFR) densities from 25 galaxies at zspec = 8.61–13.20. By reducing the JWST/NIRSpec spectra taken in multiple programs of Early Release Observation, Early Release Science, General Observer, and Director’s Discretionary Time observations with our analysis technique, we independently confirm 16 galaxies at zspec = 8.61–11.40, including new redshift determinations, and a bright interloper at zspec = 4.91 that was claimed as a photometric candidate at z ∼ 16. In conjunction with nine galaxies at redshifts up to zspec = 13.20 in the literature, we make a sample of 25 spectroscopically confirmed galaxies in total and carefully derive the best estimates and lower limits of the UV luminosity functions. These UV luminosity function constraints are consistent with the previous photometric estimates within the uncertainties and indicate mild redshift evolution toward z ∼ 12, showing tensions with some theoretical models of rapid evolution. With these spectroscopic constraints, we obtain firm lower limits of the cosmic SFR densities and spectroscopically confirm a high SFR density at z ∼ 12 beyond the constant star formation efficiency models, which supports earlier claims from the photometric studies. While there are no spectroscopically confirmed galaxies with very large stellar masses violating the ΛCDM model due to the removal of the bright interloper, we confirm star-forming galaxies at zspec = 11–13 with stellar masses much higher than model predictions. Our results indicate possibilities of high star formation efficiency (&gt;5%), a hidden active galactic nucleus, a top-heavy initial mass function (possibly with Population III), and large scatter/variance. Having these successful and unsuccessful spectroscopy results, we suggest observational strategies for efficiently removing low-redshift interlopers for future JWST programs.

<br /><br />总结:
本文研究了通过引力波发射检测到的二进制黑洞系统，提出了一种基于核密度估计的自洽迭代方法来估计完整的二进制质量分布。研究发现，主要质量具有与以前调查一致的局部极大值，而次要质量分布具有部分独立的结构，并且与幂律和常数函数的q不一致。与大多数先前的调查不同，我们发现次要质量对几乎相等质量的二进制的偏好较小；相反，次要质量在略低于主要质量的地方具有自己的“光谱线”，并且我们观察到在∼10 M⊙峰值附近的主要和次要质量之间的反相关。 <div>
Binary black hole (BBH) systems detected via gravitational-wave emission are a recently opened astrophysical frontier with many unknowns and uncertainties. Accurate reconstruction of the binary distribution with as few assumptions as possible is desirable for inference of formation channels and environments. Most population analyses have, though, assumed a power law in binary mass ratio q, and/or assumed a universal q distribution regardless of primary mass. Methods based on kernel density estimation allow us to dispense with such assumptions and directly estimate the joint binary mass distribution. We deploy a self-consistent iterative method to estimate this full BBH mass distribution, finding local maxima in primary mass consistent with previous investigations and a secondary mass distribution with a partly independent structure, inconsistent both with a power law and with a constant function of q. We find a weaker preference for near-equal-mass binaries than in most previous investigations; instead, the secondary mass has its own “spectral lines” at slightly lower values than the primary, and we observe an anticorrelation between primary and secondary masses around the ∼10 M⊙ peak.
