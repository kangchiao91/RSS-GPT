<div> cosmological parameters, SPT-3G, surveys, CMB, ΛCDM model
<br><br>
这篇文章介绍了使用SPT-3G进行的三项调查，覆盖了分别深度为1500、2650和6000 deg2的不同区域，总共观测了25%的天空。调查结果显示，在2024年底，将以大约2.5、9和-armin的宇宙微波背景(CMB)温度单位在150 GHz进行观测。此外，调查还包括了95和220 GHz的测量数据。作者采用了一种新方法获取了联合和最优估计的引力透镜势带功率和未透镜CMB温度和极化带功率的协方差矩阵。研究表明，SPT-3G数据对ΛCDM模型的cosmological参数通常具有约2倍更小的不确定性，相比之下Planck测量的角尺度和极化水平有很大的不同，这为标准cosmological模型提供了额外的测试。通过SPT-3G和Planck数据的联合分析，还可以考虑对ΛCDM拓展参数的约束改进。 <br><br>总结: 本文介绍了SPT-3G进行的三项调查，说明了对cosmological参数的约束与Planck数据相比有显著改进，同时还可以对ΛCDM模型进行额外的测试。 <div>
We forecast constraints on cosmological parameters enabled by three surveys conducted with SPT-3G, the third-generation camera on the South Pole Telescope. The surveys cover separate regions of 1500, 2650, and 6000 deg2 to different depths, in total observing 25% of the sky. These regions will be measured to white noise levels of roughly 2.5, 9, and -armin, respectively, in cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature units at 150 GHz by the end of 2024. The survey also includes measurements at 95 and 220 GHz, which have noise levels a factor of ∼1.2 and 3.5 times higher than 150 GHz, respectively, with each band having a polarization noise level times higher than the temperature noise. We use a novel approach to obtain the covariance matrices for jointly and optimally estimated gravitational lensing potential band powers and unlensed CMB temperature and polarization band powers. We demonstrate the ability to test the ΛCDM model via the consistency of cosmological parameters constrained independently from SPT-3G and Planck data, and consider the improvement in constraints on ΛCDM extension parameters from a joint analysis of SPT-3G and Planck data. The ΛCDM cosmological parameters are typically constrained with uncertainties up to ∼2 times smaller with SPT-3G data, compared to Planck, with the two data sets measuring significantly different angular scales and polarization levels, providing additional tests of the standard cosmological model.

<title>Rotation of Polarization Angle in Gamma-Ray Burst Prompt Phase. II. The Influence of the Parameters</title>

<div> 关键词: 光变曲线, 能谱, 极化, 旋转, 磁重联<br>
<br>总结:
本研究使用磁重联模型研究了伽马射线暴（GRB）的偏振角旋转对光变曲线和能谱推断的影响。发现喷流的半张角θj、观测角θV和洛伦兹因子Γ对偏振角旋转有显著影响，且受到θjΓ0乘积值影响，与具体数值关系不大。对于典型参数，偏离轴的观测变化范围在T90内的偏振角变化△PA为（12°，66°）。当θjΓ0 > 50且1.0 < q ≤ 1.2时，最显著的PA旋转将发生，△PA约为90°。 <div>
In addition to the light curve and energy spectrum, polarization is also important for inferring the physical properties of the gamma-ray burst (GRB). Rotation of the polarization angle (PA) with time will cause depolarization of the time-integrated polarization degree. However, it has rarely been studied before. Here, we use a magnetic reconnection model with a large-scale ordered aligned magnetic field in the emitting region to study the influence of the parameters on the PA rotations in the GRB prompt phase. We find that the half-opening angle of the jet θj, the observational angle θV, and the bulk Lorentz factor Γ all have significant impacts on the PA rotations. The PA rotations are affected by the product value of θjΓ0 (Γ0 is the normalization factor of Γ with ), but are roughly independent of the concrete values of both θj and Γ0. For the typical parameters, the changes of the PA within T90 (△PA) would be within (12°, 66°) for slight off-axis observations, where T90 is the duration of the burst with the accumulated flux density ranging from 5% to 95%. The q range for △PA > 10° becomes smaller with the increase of the product value of θjΓ0. The most significant PA rotation with △PA ∼ 90° will happen when θjΓ0 > 50 and 1.0 < q ≤ 1.2.

Summary:
LHS 6343系统由一个已解析的M-矮星双星系统和一个演化的棕矮星LHS 6343 C组成，棕矮星在主星周围轨道运转。通过使用高斯差分模糊算法，观测到了二次星食现象，进而获得了近红外发射光谱，匹配到了T1.5 ± 1的光谱类型。使用ATMO-2020、Sonora-Bobcat和BT-Settl模型网格进行大气特性的表征，并结合观测和模型化的光谱能量分布，推断出LHS 6343 C的视亮度为log(Lbol/L☉) = −4.77 ± 0.03，有效温度为1303 ± 29 K。同时利用ATMO-2020和Sonora-Bobcat演化模型网格推断了LHS 6343 C的年龄。 <br><br>总结: LHS 6343系统包括M矮星双星和棕矮星LHS 6343 C，通过观测到的二次星食现象获得了近红外发射光谱，并进行了大气特性的表征。用观测和模型化的光谱能量分布推断出LHS 6343 C的视亮度和有效温度。同时，通过演化模型网格推断了LHS 6343 C的年龄。 <div>
The LHS 6343 system consists of a resolved M-dwarf binary with an evolved, negligibly irradiated brown dwarf (BD), LHS 6343 C, orbiting the primary star. Such BD eclipsing binaries present rare and unique opportunities to calibrate substellar evolutionary and atmosphere models since mass, radius, temperature, and luminosity can be directly measured. We update this BD’s mass (62.6 ± 2.2 MJup) and radius (0.788 ± 0.043 RJup) using empirical stellar relations and a Gaia Data Release 3 distance. We use Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) observations of an LHS 6343 C secondary eclipse to obtain a near-IR emission spectrum, which matches to a spectral type of T1.5 ± 1. We combine this spectrum with existing Kepler and Spitzer/IRAC secondary-eclipse photometry to perform atmospheric characterization using the ATMO-2020, Sonora-Bobcat, and BT-Settl model grids. ATMO-2020 models with strong nonequilibrium chemistry yield the best fit to observations across all modeled bandpasses while predicting physical parameters consistent with Gaia-dependent analogs. BT-Settl predicts values slightly more consistent with such analogs but offers a significantly poorer fit to the WFC3 spectrum. Finally, we obtain a semi-empirical measurement of LHS 6343 C’s apparent luminosity by integrating its observed and modeled spectral energy distribution. Applying knowledge of the system’s distance yields a bolometric luminosity of log(Lbol/L☉) = −4.77 ± 0.03 and, applying the Stefan–Boltzmann law for the known radius, an effective temperature of 1303 ± 29 K. We also use the ATMO-2020 and Sonora-Bobcat evolutionary model grids to infer an age for LHS 6343 C of and respectively.

<div> millisecond pulsars, globular clusters, pulsar timing observations, core-collapse GC NGC 6752, nonluminous mass

总结：<br><br>本文报告了对NGC 6752核心内五颗毫秒射电脉冲星进行了20多年的脉冲星定时观测。研究发现，在GC NGC 6752的核心脉冲星经历了加速度和抖动，这表明核心内至少有2.56 × 103M⊙的非发光物质存在。另外，研究排除了在星团中央存在质量大于或等于∼3000M⊙的中等质量黑洞的可能性。 <div>
Millisecond pulsars are subject to accelerations in globular clusters (GCs) that manifest themselves in both the first and second spin period time derivatives, and can be used to explore the mass distribution of the potentials they inhabit. Here we report on over 20 yr of pulsar timing observations of five millisecond radio pulsars in the core of the core-collapse GC NGC 6752 with the Parkes (Murriyang) and MeerKAT radio telescopes, which have allowed us to measure the proper motions, positions, and first and second time derivatives of the pulsars. The pulsar timing parameters indicate that all the pulsars in the core experience accelerations and jerks that can be explained only if an amount of nonluminous mass of at least 2.56 × 103M⊙ is present in the core of NGC 6752. On the other hand, our studies highly disfavor the presence of an intermediate-mass black hole at the center of the cluster, with a mass equal to or greater than ∼3000M⊙.

<div> 黑洞、动摩擦、双星形成、星际气体、模拟研究
总结:
本文主要研究星际气体和星团的动摩擦对黑洞双星形成的影响。首先提出了简单的无量纲摩擦系数来近似描述动摩擦的影响，进行了大量的模拟研究，发现在摩擦较弱时，局部双星形成速率与摩擦系数成线性关系。这些研究结果对于不同尺度上的双星形成具有普遍适用性，如星团中的中等质量黑洞、星际盘中的行星体等。 <div>
Using the equations of motion from Hill’s problem, with added accelerations for different forms of dynamical friction, we provide the (to-date) broadest scale-free study of friction-driven binary formation in gaseous disks and stellar clusters. We focus mainly on binary formation between stellar-mass black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), considering both gas dynamical friction (GDF) from AGN disks and stellar dynamical friction (SDF) from the nuclear star cluster. We first find simple, dimensionless friction coefficients that approximate the effects of standard models for GDF and SDF. We perform extensive simulations of Hill’s problem under such friction, and we present a picture of binary formation through encounters between single stars on nearby orbits, as a function of friction parameter, eccentricity, and inclination. Notably, we find that the local binary formation rate is a linear function of the friction coefficient so long as the friction is weak. Due to the dimensionless nature of our model problem, our findings are generalizable to binary formation at all scales (e.g., intermediate-mass black holes in a star cluster, planetesimals in a gaseous disk).

We present a study of high-cadence, high-precision optical light curves from the TESS satellite of 67 blazars in the southern sky. We provide descriptive flux statistics, power spectral density (PSD) model parameters, and characteristic variability timescales. We find that only 15 BL Lacertae objects (BLLs) and 18 flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) from the initial 26 and 41, respectively, exhibit statistically significant variability. We employ an adapted power spectral response method to test the goodness of fit for the PSD function to three power-law variant models. From our best-fitting description of the PSD, we extract the high-frequency power-spectral slopes, and if present, determine the significant bend or break in the model to identify characteristic timescales. We find no significant difference in the excess variance or rms scatter between blazar subpopulations. We identify a linear rms–flux relation in ∼69% of our sample, in which ∼20% show a strong correlation. We find that both subpopulations of blazars show power spectral slopes of α ∼ 2 in which a broken power-law best fits five BLLs and six FSRQs and a bending power-law best fits one BLL and five FSRQs. The shortest timescales of variability in each light-curve range widely from minutes to weeks. Additionally, these objects’ characteristic timescales range from ∼0.8 to 8 days, consistent with optical variability originating in the jet.

We develop the kappa-tail fitting technique, which analyzes observations of power-law tails of distributions and energy flux spectra, and connects them to theoretical modeling of kappa distributions, to determine the thermodynamics of the examined space plasma. In particular, we (i) construct the associated mathematical formulation; (ii) prove its decisive lead for determining whether the observed power-law is associated with kappa distributions; and (iii) provide a validation of the technique using pseudo-observations of typical input plasma parameters. Then, we apply this technique to a case study by determining the thermodynamics of solar energetic particle (SEP) protons, for an SEP event observed on 2021 April 17, by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP)/Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun instrument suite on board PSP. The results show SEP temperatures and densities of the order of ∼1 MeV and ∼5 × 10−7 cm−3, respectively.

总结: 
本研究分析了太阳表面的不均匀性对径向速度的影响，发现各种不同的太阳表面特征会对观测到的速度产生复杂的变化，包括与边缘角度相关的减小。通过对Solar Dynamics Observatory的观测数据进行分类和分析，发现太阳黑子的本影和半影、宁静太阳的磁流体细胞、磁网络和日珥等特征都表现出不同的速度变化特征。研究强调了理解这些特征对径向速度的影响的重要性，以及将其视为天体物理信号而非简单的噪声过程。这些发现对于使用径向速度方法探测类太阳恒星的地球质量行星具有重要意义。 <br /> <div>
Stellar photospheric inhomogeneities are a significant source of noise, which currently precludes the discovery of Earth-mass planets orbiting Sun-like stars with the radial-velocity (RV) method. To complement several previous studies that have used ground- and spaced-based facilities to characterize the RV of the Sun, here we characterize the center-to-limb variability (CLV) of solar RVs arising from various solar-surface inhomogeneities observed by the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/Helioseismic Magnetic Imager and SDO/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly. By using various SDO observables to classify pixels and calculate line-of-sight velocities as a function of pixel classification and limb angle, we show that each identified feature type, including the umbrae and penumbrae of sunspots, quiet-Sun magnetoconvective cells, magnetic network, and plage, exhibit distinct and complex CLV signatures, including a notable limb-angle dependence in the observed suppression of convective blueshift for magnetically active regions. We discuss the observed distributions of velocities by identified region type and limb angle, offer interpretations of the physical phenomena that shape these distributions, and emphasize the need to understand the RV signatures of these regions as astrophysical signals, rather than simple (un)correlated noise processes.

<div> 关键词: 双层丝状通道, 日冕, 哈氏α波长, 磁结构, 等离子体流

总结:
观测证实了双层丝状通道的存在，该通道由两个丝状结构组成，根源于活跃区和远离的安静区。底层通道表现为间歇性的丝状物质，而上层通道则部分充满暗等离子体，呈现为一个小的丝状物质。通过观测还发现，底层通道的部分爆发是由于重连触发的，随之伴随着明亮的等离子体流向远离的根源。观测结果显示了在充满热/冷等离子体前，双层丝状通道作为一种磁结构的存在。 <div>
We present the observational evidence of the existence of a double-decker filament channel (FC) by using observations in extreme ultraviolet and Hα wavelengths. For both FCs, the east foot-point roots in the active region (AR), while the west one roots in the remote quiet region. The bottom FC (FC1) appears as intermittent filaments. Within the AR, the FC1 appears as an S-shaped filament (F1), which consisted of two J-shaped filaments (F1S/F1N for the south/north one). For the upper one (FC2), only the east part is filled with dark plasma and visible as a small filament (F2). Its east foot-point roots around the junction of F1S and F1N. Initially, due to the recurrent reconnections, F1N and F1S link to each other and form a new filament (F3) thread by thread. Meanwhile, the heated plasma, which appears as brightening features, flows from the east foot-point of F2 to the west, and becomes invisible about 1.1 × 105 km away. The failed eruption of F1S is triggered by the reconnection, which appears as the brightening threads changing their configuration from crossed to quasiparallel in between the F1S and F3, and is confined by the upper magnetic field. Associated with the eruption, the distant invisible plasma becomes visible as a brightening feature. It continuously flows to the remote foot-point, and becomes invisible before reaching it. The brightening plasma flow outlines the skeleton of FC2 gradually. The observations show the existence of a double-decker FC, as a magnetic structure, before they appear as a brightening/dark feature when fully filled with hot/cool plasma.

MACS0647−JD是一个三重透镜z ∼ 11候选星系，经JWST/NIRSpec棱镜光谱分析后发现，其中A星系的光谱红移z = 10.17，具有丰富的发射线，推测气相金属丰度为12 + log(O/H) ∼ 7.5–8.0，具有柔和的Lyα断裂和强烈的Lyα阻尼翼，该星系可能是目前已知的最遥远的星系并可能处于合并过程中。具有星际质量为log(M/M⊙) = 8.1 ± 0.3，主要在20百万年内形成，星际质量∼ 2 ± 1 M⊙ yr−1，都在一个有效半径70 ± 24 pc内。此外，测量了距离约3 kpc处的另一个星系C，其莱曼断点与z ∼ 10.17一致。<br /><br />总结:MACS0647−JD是一个具有丰富发射线和气相金属的远距离星系，可能是最遥远的星系合并事件。 <div>
We present JWST/NIRSpec prism spectroscopy of MACS0647−JD, a triply lensed z ∼ 11 candidate discovered in Hubble Space Telescope imaging and spatially resolved by JWST imaging into two components, A and B. Spectroscopy of component A yields a spectroscopic redshift z = 10.17 based on seven detected emission lines: C iii] λλ1907, 1909, [O ii] λ3727, [Ne iii] λ3869, [Ne iii] λ3968, Hδλ4101, Hγλ4340, and [O iii] λ4363. These are the second-most distant detections of these emission lines to date, in a galaxy observed just 460 million years after the Big Bang. Based on observed and extrapolated line flux ratios we derive a gas-phase metallicity 12 + log(O/H) ∼ 7.5–8.0, or Z ∼ (0.06–0.2) Z⊙, ionization parameter = −1.9 ± 0.2, and an ionizing photon production efficiency erg−1 Hz. The spectrum has a softened Lyα break, evidence for a strong Lyα damping wing. The Lyα damping wing also suppresses the F150W photometry, explaining the slightly overestimated photometric redshift z = 10.6 ± 0.3. MACS0647−JD has a stellar mass log(M/M⊙) = 8.1 ± 0.3, including ∼6 × 107M⊙ in component A, most of which formed recently (within ∼20 Myr) with a star formation rate ∼ 2 ± 1 M⊙ yr−1, all within an effective radius 70 ± 24 pc. Spectroscopy of a fainter companion galaxy C separated by a distance of ∼ 3 kpc reveals a Lyman break consistent with z ∼ 10.17. MACS0647−JD is likely the most distant galaxy merger known.

总结:
本研究使用AstroSat上的紫外成像望远镜对七个Seyfert型AGN和一个低电离核发射线区域的星系进行了观测，发现1742个星形成区域，大小在0.010-63.642kpc2之间。研究发现星系的总表面密度与灭光度呈正相关，并且在五个星系中，从中心到外部，灭光度和总表面密度都逐渐减少。四个星系处于主序星系形成区域，另外四个偏离主序。研究还发现核区的星形成率与总星形成率的比值与Eddington比例呈正相关，表明AGN对宿主星系的星形成特征有影响，但主要集中在中心核区，对其他尺度的影响不显著。 <br /><br /> <div>
Circumnuclear star formation (SF) is generally seen in galaxies hosting active galactic nuclei (AGN); however, the connection between the AGN activity and SF in them is less well understood. To explore this connection on scales of a few tens of parsecs to a few tens of kiloparsecs and larger, we carried out an investigation of SF in seven Seyfert-type AGN and one low-ionization nuclear emission-line region galaxy, using observations with the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope on board AstroSat in the near-ultraviolet (2000–3000 Å) and far-ultraviolet (1300−1800 Å) bands. A total of 1742 star-forming regions were identified, having size scales of 0.010–63.642 kpc2. Considering all the galaxies, we found a positive correlation between their total surface density of SF (ΣSFR) and extinction. For five galaxies, namely NGC 1365, NGC 4051, NGC 4321, NGC 5033, and NGC 6814, we found a gradual decrease of both extinction and ΣSFR from the centre to the outer regions. Four sources are found to lie in the main sequence of star-forming galaxies, and the other four lie away from it. We found the ratio of the star formation rate (SFR) in the nuclear region to the total SFR to be positively correlated with the Eddington ratio. This points to the influence of AGN in enhancing the SF characteristics of the hosts. However, the impact is dominant only in the central nuclear region and has no significant effect on the larger scales probed in this work.

<div> 磁岛，WISPR，帕克太阳探测器，太阳风，磁重联
总结:<br /><br />本研究利用帕克太阳探测器的WISPR观测到了可能的磁岛特征，并进行了物理分析。磁岛的平均速度约为334 km s−1，加速度约为−0.64 m s−2，表明该磁岛可能被慢太阳风所带动。磁岛呈椭圆形，中心存在密度缺陷，暗示可能存在磁场引导。研究认为这一特征与带状电流层中的重联相关。磁岛的横纵轴比（计算为次轴与主轴的比值）在WISPR观测过程中发生变化，从椭圆形逐渐变为更加圆形。相比于其他白光观测，WISPR的高灵敏度和观测角度使得对这一磁岛特征的观测成为可能。 <div>
We present the identification and physical analysis of a possible magnetic island feature seen in white-light images observed by the Wide-field Imager for Solar Probe (WISPR) on board the Parker Solar Probe. The island is imaged by WISPR during Parker's second solar encounter on 2019 April 6, when Parker was ∼38 R⊙ from the Sun's center. We report that the average velocity and acceleration of the feature are approximately 334 km s−1 and −0.64 m s−2. The kinematics of the island feature, coupled with its direction of propagation, indicate that the island is likely entrained in the slow solar wind. The island is elliptical in shape with a density deficit in its center, suggesting the presence of a magnetic guide field. We argue that this feature is consistent with the formation of this island via reconnection in the current sheet of the streamer. The feature's aspect ratio (calculated as the ratio of its minor to major axis) evolves from an elliptical to a more circular shape that approximately doubles during its propagation through WISPR’s field of view. The island is not distinct in other white-light observations from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory and the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory coronagraphs, suggesting that this is a comparatively faint heliospheric feature and that viewing perspective and WISPR’s enhanced sensitivity are key to observing the magnetic island.

<div> 黑洞，引力微透镜，OB110462，速度分布，事件率
<br /><br />
本研究调查了银河系中的黑洞对微透镜事件率分布的影响。研究考虑了不同平均脉冲速度的Maxwell分布，以及黑洞的空间分布的相应变化。研究发现，朝向银河系星系核的黑洞透镜事件率随着平均速度的增加而减少，主要是由于尺度高度的膨胀。重点关注了OB110462的独特微透镜参数，其微透镜视差πE超过0.06，持续时间超过200天。我们计算了OB110462类似参数的黑洞事件在OGLE-IV调查中的预期数量，并将其与实际发生的事件数量进行了比较。我们的模型预测，在vavg = 25, 50, 100, 200和400 km s-1的情况下，预期发生的事件数量分别为0.52, 0.38, 0.18, 0.042和4.0×10^-3。这表明平均脉冲速度可能小于100 km s-1。即使在最大情况下，预期数量也小于单位，这可能表明我们在发现OB110462方面的运气，这可以通过未来的调查，例如罗马空间望远镜加以测试。 
<br />总结:研究调查了银河系中的黑洞对微透镜事件率分布的影响，发现平均脉冲速度可能小于100 km s-1，通过未来的调查可以进一步验证发现OB110462的概率。 <div>
The natal kick velocity distribution for black holes (BHs) is unknown regardless of its importance for understanding the BH formation process. Gravitational microlensing is a unique tool for studying the distribution of BHs in our Galaxy, and the first isolated stellar-mass BH event, OGLE-2011-BLG-0462/MOA-2011-BLG-191 (OB110462), was recently identified by astrometric microlensing. This study investigates how the natal kick velocity for Galactic BHs affects the microlensing event rate distribution. We consider a Maxwell distribution with various average kick velocities, as well as the consequent variation of the spatial distribution of BHs. We find that the event rate for the BH lenses toward the Galactic bulge decreases as vavg increases, mainly due to the scale height inflation. We focus on the unique microlensing parameters measured for OB110462, with microlens parallax πE larger than 0.06 for its long timescale of tE > 200 days. We calculate the expected number of BH events occurring with parameters similar to OB110462 during the OGLE-IV survey by Mróz et al. and compare it with the actual number that occurred, at least one. Our fiducial model predicts 0.52, 0.38, 0.18, 0.042, and 4.0 × 10−3 events occurring for vavg = 25, 50, 100, 200, and 400 km s−1, respectively, which suggests that the average kick velocity is likely to be vavg ≲ 100 km s−1. The expected number smaller than unity even at maximum might indicate our luck in finding OB110462, which can be tested with future surveys by, e.g., the Roman Space Telescope.

Over the past few years alone, the lensing community has discovered thousands of strong lens candidates, and spectroscopically confirmed hundreds of them. In this time of abundance, it becomes pragmatic to focus our time and resources on the few extraordinary systems, in order to most efficiently study the Universe. In this paper, we present such a system: DESI-090.9854-35.9683, a cluster-scale lens at zl = 0.49, with seven observed lensed sources around the core, and additional lensed sources further out in the cluster. From the number and the textbook configuration of the lensed images, a tight constraint on the mass potential of the lens is possible. This would allow for detailed analysis on the dark and luminous matter content within galaxy clusters, as well as a probe into dark energy and high-redshift galaxies. We present our spatially resolved kinematic measurements of this system from the Very Large Telescope Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer, which confirm five of these source galaxies (in ascending order, at zs = 0.962, 0.962, 1.166, 1.432, and 1.432). With previous Hubble Space Telescope imaging in the F140W and F200LP bands, we also present a simple flux-based lens model consisting of two power-law profiles that, for a cluster lens, well models the five lensed arc families with redshifts. We determine the mass to be M(< θE) = 4.78 × 1013M⊙ for the primary mass potential. From the model, we extrapolate the redshift of one of the two source galaxies not yet spectroscopically confirmed to be at .

<br /><br />总结:
本研究旨在检查Gaia DR3光度测量和BP/RP光谱的空间均匀性，发现了小的偏差离散度，但存在明显的空间模式，这与Gaia的扫描规律有关。BP和G波段的模式相似，并且比RP波段的模式更明显。进一步独立测试显示，空间模式很可能是由于Gaia DR3 BP/RP光谱引起的。研究证实了Gaia数据在毫星等级上的高空间一致性，但也暗示了Gaia DR3 BP/RP光谱的空间一致性不如光度测量，未来有进一步的改进空间。 <div>
Gaia DR3 photometry and Blue Photometer (BP) and Red Photometer (RP) spectra have been widely used as reference in photometric calibrations. In this work, we check the spatial uniformity of Gaia DR3 photometry and BP/RP spectra by comparing the BP, RP, and G-band photometry with the synthetic ones from the BP/RP spectra. The discrepancies have a small dispersion of 1.07, 0.55, and 1.02 mmag for the BP, RP, and G bands, respectively. However, the discrepancies exhibit obvious spatial patterns, which are clearly associated with Gaia’s scanning law. The patterns observed in the BP and G bands are similar, with discrepancies between photometry and spectra being more pronounced in these bands compared to the RP band. A further independent test with the Dark Energy Survey DR2 photometry reveals that the spatial patterns are more likely attributed to the Gaia DR3 BP/RP spectra, particularly in the BP band. On one hand, our results confirm the high spatial uniformity of Gaia data at the mmag level. On the other hand, our results suggest that the spatial uniformity of Gaia DR3 BP/RP spectra is not as good as that of Gaia DR3 photometry, and could be further improved in the future.

本研究利用Horizon Run 5宇宙学热力学模拟，测试了LAEs和LBGs作为高红移大尺度结构的有效跟踪者。通过比较LAEs和LBGs在暗物质纤维结构周围的空间分布，发现它们比暗物质更集中于纤维结构附近。此外，他们也发现了纤维的垂直密度剖面的经验拟合公式，以及LAEs、LBGs和暗物质定义的纤维结构在空间分布上的一致性。这些结果支持了LAEs和LBGs在高红移时期作为大尺度结构的良好跟踪者的观点。 <div>
We test whether Lyα emitters (LAEs) and Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) can be good tracers of high-z large-scale structures, using the Horizon Run 5 cosmological hydrodynamical simulation. We identify LAEs using the Lyα emission line luminosity and its equivalent width, and LBGs using the broadband magnitudes at z ∼ 2.4, 3.1, and 4.5. We first compare the spatial distributions of LAEs, LBGs, all galaxies, and dark matter around the filamentary structures defined by dark matter. The comparison shows that both LAEs and LBGs are more concentrated toward the dark matter filaments than dark matter. We also find an empirical fitting formula for the vertical density profile of filaments as a binomial power-law relation of the distance to the filaments. We then compare the spatial distributions of the samples around the filaments defined by themselves. LAEs and LBGs are again more concentrated toward their filaments than dark matter. We also find the overall consistency between filamentary structures defined by LAEs, LBGs, and dark matter, with the median spatial offsets that are smaller than the mean separation of the sample. These results support the idea that the LAEs and LBGs could be good tracers of large-scale structures of dark matter at high redshifts.

<br /><br />总结: 
太阳耀斑预测的最新研究使用了Space-Weather MDI和SHARP数据，并将它们合并成一种数据产品。通过时间序列分析发现，太阳活动区的磁场特性可能领先于耀斑指数。研究结果显示，在太阳活动周期的高峰期，太阳活动区的高相关性区域对应于耀斑活动的增加。这对于太阳耀斑的预测具有重要意义。 <div>
Solar flare prediction studies have been recently conducted with the use of Space-Weather MDI (Michelson Doppler Imager on board Solar and Heliospheric Observatory) Active Region Patches (SMARPs) and Space-Weather HMI (Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board Solar Dynamics Observatory) Active Region Patches (SHARPs), which are two currently available data products containing magnetic field characteristics of solar active regions (ARs). The present work is an effort to combine them into one data product, and perform some initial statistical analyses in order to further expand their application in space-weather forecasting. The combined data are derived by filtering, rescaling, and merging the SMARP and SHARP parameters, which can then be spatially reduced to create uniform multivariate time series. The resulting combined MDI–HMI data set currently spans the period between 1996 April 4 and 2022 December 13, and may be extended to a more recent date. This provides an opportunity to correlate and compare it with other space-weather time series, such as the daily solar flare index or the statistical properties of the soft X-ray flux measured by the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites. Time-lagged cross correlation indicates that a relationship may exist, where some magnetic field properties of ARs lead the flare index in time. Applying the rolling-window technique makes it possible to see how this leader–follower dynamic varies with time. Preliminary results indicate that areas of high correlation generally correspond to increased flare activity during the peak solar cycle.

通过对TeV辐射明亮的GRB 190114C进行综合的时域和频谱分析，研究了其高能量释放以及辐射转换的效率。发现其快速射流在不同脉冲间有独立的热成分，且整体辐射效率较高。通过结合不同观测情况，测量了火球参数和GRB辐射效率，并发现尽管观测参数有所不同，但从P1和P2获得的辐射效率大致相同，这意味着相同GRB的中心引擎具有一些共同的特性。  <br /><br />总结: <div>
The jet composition of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), as well as how efficiently the jet converts its energy to radiation, are long-standing problems in GRB physics. Here, we reported a comprehensive temporal and spectral analysis of the TeV-emitting bright GRB 190114C. Its high fluence (∼4.4 × 10−4 erg cm−2) allows us to conduct the time-resolved spectral analysis in great detail and study their variations down to a very short timescale (∼0.1 s) while preserving a high significance. Its prompt emission consists of three well-separated pulses. The first two main pulses (P1 and P2) exhibit independently strong thermal components, starting from the third pulse (P3) and extending to the entire afterglow, the spectra are all nonthermal, and the synchrotron plus Compton upscattering model well interprets the observation. By combining the thermal (P1 and P2) and the nonthermal (P3) observations based on two different scenarios (global and pulse properties) and following the method described in Zhang et al., we measure the fireball parameters and GRB radiative efficiency with little uncertainties for this GRB. A relevantly high GRB radiative efficiency is obtained based on both the global and pulse properties, suggesting that if GRBs are powered by fireballs, the efficiency can sometimes be high. More interestingly, though the observed parameters are individually different (e.g., the amount of mass loading M), the radiative efficiency obtained from P1 (ηγ = 36.0% ± 6.5%) and P2 (ηγ = 41.1% ± 1.9%) is roughly the same, which implies that the central engine of the same GRB has some common properties.

<div> 关键词: 太阳系, 星际介质, 北领域, 地质证据, 磁流体力学模型

总结: 
太阳系在星际介质中运动，被太阳风形成的日晕保护着。根据地质证据，地球在2-3和5-7百万年前直接接触星际介质。最近的研究表明，太阳在2百万年前经历了一次冷云的遭遇，导致日晕缩小，使得地球暴露在星际介质之下。磁流体力学模型显示，这次经历导致日晕缩小到比地球轨道还要小，从而让地球暴露在寒冷而密集的星际介质之下。这次事件的时间与地质纪录中观测到的波动相匹配，表明太阳经过北领域表面并收缩的日晕可能显著影响了气候和生物圈，这可能是地球历史上的一个新的重要驱动因素。 <div>
The Sun moves through the interstellar medium (ISM) at a velocity of ∼19 pc Myr−1, making the conditions outside the solar system vary with time over millions of years. Today’s solar system is protected from interstellar particles by the heliosphere, the bubble formed by the solar wind as the Sun moves through the ISM, which engulfs the planets. There is geological evidence from 60Fe that Earth was in direct contact with the ISM 2–3 and 5–7 million years ago (MYA). Recent work argues that the Sun encountered a massive cold cloud 2 MYA as part of the Local Ribbon of Cold Clouds that shrunk the heliosphere and exposed Earth to the ISM. Here, we consider the effects of the passage of the Sun through the edge of the Local Bubble occurring at MYA assuming that the Sun encountered a cloud with a density of 900 cm−3. If we consider additional turbulent motion within the cloud due to shocks, the density encountered can be as low as 283 cm−3. Clouds of this density cover a small but nonzero (≲4.6%) fraction of the surface of the Local Bubble, making an encounter plausible. Using a state-of-the art magnetohydrodynamic model, we show that the heliosphere shrank to a scale smaller than Earth’s orbit, thereby exposing Earth to cold dense ISM, consistent with 60Fe evidence. The timing of the event matches perturbations observed in the paleoclimate record recovered from deep-sea sediments. The passage through the Local Bubble’s surface and contraction of the heliosphere therefore may have impacted the climate and biosphere significantly, suggesting a new driver of major events in Earth’s history.

这篇文章讨论了SNe Ia的起源问题。虽然一直以来认为它们来自碳/氧白矮星的爆炸，但确切的祖先构造和导致SNe Ia的爆炸机制仍存在争议。其中一种流行的理论是双重爆炸，即通过二元伴星积累的氦层在主星表面爆炸，导致下面的核心受到收敛的冲击诱发爆炸。研究发现，氦丰富的退化伴星可能会受到主星喷出的物质冲击而引发自己的爆炸。他们还展示了2D模拟，模拟了白矮星进行双重爆炸，触发了退化伴星的爆炸，导致三重或四重爆炸。结果表明，在一定范围内的退化双星质量配置下，这些事件的合成光变曲线和光谱与观测一样好，甚至与独立双重爆炸的理论模型一样。需要进一步了解这种情景，以确定至少一些观测到的SNe Ia是否实际上来自两颗恒星的爆炸。<br /><br />总结: SNe Ia的起源问题是个争议性话题，文章讨论了双重爆炸理论及退化伴星的爆炸，提出了具体研究结果，并强调了对这种场景的进一步理解的必要性。 <div>
The precise origin of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is unknown despite their value to numerous areas in astronomy. While it is a long-standing consensus that they arise from the explosion of a carbon/oxygen white dwarf, the exact progenitor configurations and explosion mechanisms that lead to SNe Ia are still debated. One popular theory is the double detonation, in which a helium layer, accreted from a binary companion, detonates on the surface of the primary star, leading to a converging shock-induced detonation of the underlying core. It has recently been seen in simulations that a helium-rich degenerate companion may undergo its own explosion triggered by the impact from the ejecta of the primary star. We show 2D simulations that approximate a white dwarf undergoing a double detonation, which triggers the explosion of the degenerate companion, leading to either a triple or quadruple detonation. We also present the first multidimensional radiative transfer results from the triple and quadruple detonation scenario. We find that within a range of mass configurations of the degenerate binary, the synthetic light curves and spectra of these events match observations as well as theoretical models of isolated double detonations do. Notably, double and quadruple detonations that are spectrally similar and reach the same peak brightnesses have drastically different ejecta masses and produce different amounts of Si- and Fe-group elements. Further understanding of this scenario is needed in order to determine if at least some observed SNe Ia actually originate from two stars exploding.

The X-ray thermal isolated neutron star (XTINS) RX J0806.4–4123 shows interesting multiwavelength properties that seemingly deviate from those of similar neutron stars. An accurate determination of the spin frequency change over time can assist in interpreting RX J0806.4–4123's properties in comparison to those of other XTINSs and the wider pulsar population. From 2019 to 2023 we carried out a tailored X-ray timing campaign of RX J0806.4–4123 with the NICER instrument. We used statistical properties of the Fourier coefficients and the ZK2 test for phase connecting separate observations and finding a timing solution for the entire data set. We also developed a simple and universal method for estimating the uncertainties of the frequency ν and its derivative from the empirical dependencies of ZK2 on trial values of these parameters, with account of all significant harmonics of the frequency. Applying this method, we determined a spin-down rate . The resulting spin-down power erg s−1 is the lowest among the XTINSs, and it is a factor of 60 lower than the X-ray luminosity of this neutron star. RX J0806.4–4123 is also among the pulsars with the lowest measured in general.

总结:<br />
本文提出了一个关于热而稀薄的麦克斯韦分布的质子环以及冷等离子体和电子背景的均匀等离子体系统的全面理论模型，用于研究磁体声波的共振不稳定性。文章通过数值方法解决与麦克斯韦环分布相关的垂直速度积分问题，同时通过调用等离子体色散函数的级数展开解析地解决了平行速度积分问题。对于地球内磁层相关的等离子体参数，理论模型产生了频率从本地质子回旋频率的5倍到低杂波频率以上的磁体声波，传播角度为89.5°。对于相同的等离子体参数，麦克斯韦环质子还激发了氢（H+）带电磁离子回旋波。详细分析表明，足够大的环速度以及较小的垂直和平行热速度可以增强磁体声波的增长。该研究还探讨了背景等离子体参数在调制波动中的作用。当前的理论模型重现了Van Allen Probes在地球内磁层观测到的磁体声波的谐波。此外，该模型还可以在其他等离子体环境中产生磁体声波，例如火星，在这里，MAVEN已经确认了环质子与磁体声波观测的关联。 <div>
A comprehensive theoretical model for a homogeneous plasma system of hot, tenuous Maxwellian ring-distributed protons and the cold background of Maxwellian ions and electrons is used to study the resonant instabilities of magnetosonic (MS) waves. The perpendicular velocity integrals associated with the Maxwellian ring distribution have no analytical solution, hence, are solved numerically, while the parallel velocity integrals are solved analytically by invoking series expansion of the plasma dispersion function. For the plasma parameters relevant to Earth’s inner magnetosphere, the theoretical model generates MS waves with frequencies from 5 times the local proton cyclotron frequency to above the lower hybrid frequency for a propagation angle of 89.5°. Hydrogen (H+) band electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves are also excited by the Maxwellian ring protons for the same set of plasma parameters. A detailed analysis reveals that a sufficiently large ring velocity, as well as a smaller perpendicular and parallel thermal velocity, can enhance the MS wave growth. The study also explores the role of background plasma parameters in modulating the waves. The present theoretical model reproduces the harmonics of the MS waves observed by the Van Allen Probes in the Earth’s inner magnetosphere. Further, the model can generate MS waves in other plasma environments, e.g., Mars, where the presence of ring protons has been established by MAVEN in connection with the MS wave observations.

这项研究提出了一种利用宽双星的标准化速度剖面来调查低加速度重力异常的新方法。研究使用Monte Carlo方法对Gaia观测到的双星及其虚拟的牛顿对应体在s/rM与平面上进行概率分布，并在s/rM的bin中测量了一个对数速度比参数Γ。通过三种双星样本的研究，作者发现了从牛顿平坦线的一致系统变化。作者提出了重力异常因子γg = 102Γ，通过减少的χ2检验，发现牛顿重力被最新样本排除5.8σ，并且使用最大样本排除9.2σ。米尔格罗米安AQUAL理论被证明是可接受的。这些结果与先前的“加速度平面分析”和“叠加速度剖面分析”的结果相吻合。 
<br /><br />总结: 本研究提出了一种新的方法来研究重力异常，通过分析双星的速度剖面，并测量了重力异常因子γg。研究结果表明牛顿重力被排除，而米尔格罗米安AQUAL理论被证明是可接受的。 <div>
Low-acceleration gravitational anomaly is investigated with a new method of exploiting the normalized velocity profile of wide binary stars as a function of the normalized sky-projected radius s/rM, where vp is the sky-projected relative velocity between the pair, vc is the Newtonian circular velocity at the sky-projected separation s, and rM is the MOND radius. With a Monte Carlo method, Gaia observed binaries and their virtual Newtonian counterparts are probabilistically distributed on the s/rM versus plane, and a logarithmic velocity ratio parameter Γ is measured in the bins of s/rM. With three samples of binaries covering a broad range in size, data quality, and implied fraction of hierarchical systems including a new sample of 6389 binaries selected with accurate distances and radial velocities, I find a unanimous systematic variation from the Newtonian flat line. With Γ = 0 at s/rM ≲ 0.15 or s ≲ 1 kau, I get Γ = 0.068 ± 0.015 (stat) (syst) for s/rM ≳ 0.7 or s ≳ 5 kau. The gravitational anomaly (i.e., acceleration boost) factor given by γg = 102Γ is measured to be (stat) (syst). With a reduced χ2 test of Newtonian and Milgromian nonrelativistic theories, I find that Newtonian gravity is ruled out at 5.8σ ( ) by the new sample (and 9.2σ by the largest sample used). The Milgromian AQUAL theory is acceptable with . These results agree well with earlier results with the “acceleration-plane analysis” for a variety of samples and the “stacked velocity profile analysis” for a pure binary sample.

<div> SN 2022oqm, CaRT, spectroscopic evolution, peak luminosity, progenitor <br />
<br />总结:
本文研究了SN 2022oqm的光度和光谱演化，发现它是一个多峰值的氢和氦贫钙丰富的瞬变事件（CaRT）。该事件距离其宿主星系NGC 5875有13.1 kpc。研究发现SN 2022oqm的峰值亮度相对较高（MB = −17 mag），是CaRT中的异常值。研究表明，需要三种不同的能量源来解释光度曲线的演化，分别对应于三个峰值。通过光度曲线的推导，得出了喷射物质和56Ni的质量，以及氢和氦缺乏的CSM。光谱建模显示约0.6 M⊙的喷射物质，并且其中充满了良好混合的Fe峰元素。作者讨论了SN 2022oqm的几种物理起源，认为一个大质量的白矮星前体或一个特殊的剥离包络模型可以解释SN 2022oqm。一个在稠密的、缺乏氢和氦的CSM内发生的剥离包络爆炸，类似于SNe Icn，但具有大质量的56Ni和小质量的CSM可以解释SN 2022oqm。另外，对于一个意外大质量的白矮星发生的氦爆也能解释SN 2022oqm。 <div>
We present the photometric and spectroscopic evolution of SN 2022oqm, a nearby multipeaked hydrogen- and helium-weak calcium-rich transient (CaRT). SN 2022oqm was detected 13.1 kpc from its host galaxy, the face-on spiral galaxy NGC 5875. Extensive spectroscopic coverage reveals an early hot (T ≥ 40,000 K) continuum and carbon features observed ∼1 day after discovery, SN Ic-like photospheric-phase spectra, and strong forbidden calcium emission starting 38 days after discovery. SN 2022oqm has a relatively high peak luminosity (MB = −17 mag) for CaRTs, making it an outlier in the population. We determine that three power sources are necessary to explain the light curve (LC), with each corresponding to a distinct peak. The first peak is powered by an expanding blackbody with a power-law luminosity, suggesting shock cooling by circumstellar material (CSM). Subsequent LC evolution is powered by a double radioactive decay model, consistent with two sources of photons diffusing through optically thick ejecta. From the LC, we derive an ejecta mass and 56Ni mass of ∼0.6 M⊙ and ∼0.09 M⊙. Spectroscopic modeling ∼0.6 M⊙ of ejecta, and with well-mixed Fe-peak elements throughout. We discuss several physical origins for SN 2022oqm and find either a surprisingly massive white dwarf progenitor or a peculiar stripped envelope model could explain SN 2022oqm. A stripped envelope explosion inside a dense, hydrogen- and helium-poor CSM, akin to SNe Icn, but with a large 56Ni mass and small CSM mass could explain SN 2022oqm. Alternatively, helium detonation on an unexpectedly massive white dwarf could also explain SN 2022oqm.

We report the serendipitous multiwavelength discovery of a candidate dual black hole system with a separation of ∼100 pc, in the gas-rich luminous infrared galaxy MCG-03-34-64 (z = 0.016). Hubble Space Telescope/Advanced Camera for Surveys observations show three distinct optical centroids in the [O iii] narrow-band and F814W images. Subsequent analysis of Chandra/ACIS data shows two spatially resolved peaks of equal intensity in the neutral Fe Kα (6.2–6.6 keV) band, while high-resolution radio continuum observations with the Very Large Array at 8.46 GHz (3.6 cm band) show two spatially coincident radio peaks. Fast shocks as the ionizing source seem unlikely, given the energies required for the production of Fe Kα. If confirmed, the separation of ∼100 pc would represent the closest dual active galactic nuclei reported to date with spatially resolved, multiwavelength observations.

We present near-infrared spectroscopy of 10 weak emission-line quasars (WLQs) at redshifts of z ∼ 2, obtained with the Palomar 200 inch Hale Telescope. WLQs are an exceptional population of type 1 quasars that exhibit weak or no broad emission lines in the ultraviolet (e.g., the C ivλ1549 line), and they display remarkable X-ray properties. We derive Hβ-based single-epoch virial black hole masses (median value 1.7 × 109M⊙) and Eddington ratios (median value 0.5) for our sources. We confirm the previous finding that WLQ Hβ lines, as a major low-ionization line, are not significantly weak compared to typical quasars. The most prominent feature of the WLQ optical spectra is the universally weak/absent [O iii] λ5007 emission. They also display stronger optical Fe ii emission than typical quasars. Our results favor the super-Eddington accretion scenario for WLQs, where the weak lines are a result of a soft ionizing continuum; the geometrically thick inner accretion disk and/or its associated outflow is responsible for obscuring the nuclear high-energy radiation and producing the soft ionizing continuum. We also report candidate extreme [O iii] outflows (blueshifts of ≈500 and 4900 km s−1) in one object.

这篇文章使用绿岸望远镜对银河系两个视线进行了无线再组合线观测。观测结果显示每个视线有两个高斯形状的光谱分量，其发射测量范围在约100至300厘米^-6 pc之间。在光度学选择速率（LSR）速度为负时，没有可检测到的RRL发射，这表明辐射等离子体必须位于太阳轨道内部。G20和G45的发射测量暗示如果这些视线充满均匀等离子体，其均方根密度分别为0.15和0.18厘米^-3。观测到的Hnβ/Hnα线比与LTE激发的最强分量一致。G20的高速度分量具有较窄的线宽（13.5 km s^-1），这为等离子体电子温度设置了上限（≲4000 K），这与普遍存在的低密度约为10,000 K的WIM等离子体的假设不一致。
<br /><br />总结: 该研究使用绿岸望远镜观测了银河系中的离子化气体，发现了两个视线中的RRL发射，并推测了等离子体发射测量的均方根密度。观测结果还表明，高速度分量的等离子体电子温度上限低于10,000 K的普遍假设。 <div>
Diffuse ionized gas pervades the disk of the Milky Way. We detect extremely faint emission from this Galactic warm ionized medium (WIM) using the Green Bank Telescope to make radio recombination line (RRL) observations toward two Milky Way sight lines: G20, (ℓ, b) = (20°, 0°), and G45, (ℓ, b) = (45°, 0°). We stack 18 consecutive Hnα transitions between 4.3 and 7.1 GHz to derive 〈Hnα〉 spectra that are sensitive to RRL emission from plasmas with emission measures EM ≳ 10 cm−6 pc. Each sight line has two Gaussian-shaped spectral components with emission measures that range between ∼100 and ∼300 cm−6 pc. Because there is no detectable RRL emission at negative LSR velocities, the emitting plasma must be located interior to the solar orbit. The G20 and G45 emission measures imply rms densities of 0.15 and 0.18 cm−3, respectively, if these sight lines are filled with homogeneous plasma. The observed 〈Hnβ〉/〈Hnα〉 line ratios are consistent with LTE excitation for the strongest components. The high-velocity component of G20 has a narrow line width, 13.5 km s−1, that sets an upper limit of ≲4000 K for the plasma electron temperature. This is inconsistent with the ansatz of a canonically pervasive, low-density, ∼10,000 K WIM plasma.

总结:
该研究使用了PDS来研究伽马射线暴（GRB）的光变曲线，利用了Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope（Insight-HXMT）的数据。对长暴和短暴分别进行了能谱指数的分析，结果显示长暴和短暴的能谱指数相似，表明它们可能是相似的随机过程的结果。此外，研究还发现伽马射线暴的光变曲线可能是由多个具有不同时间尺度的脉冲叠加而成。在样本中没有发现高于3σ显著性阈值的周期性或准周期性信号。伽马射线暴的光变曲线与能谱的关系也被研究出来，有助于对伽马射线暴的物理过程进行更深入的理解。 <br /><br /> <div>
The power density spectrum (PDS) is a powerful tool to study light curves of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We show the average PDS and individual PDS analysis with GRB data from the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (also named Insight-HXMT). The values of the power-law index of the average PDS ( ) for long GRBs (LGRBs) vary from 1.58 to 1.29 (for 100–245, 245–600, and 600–2000 keV). The Insight-HXMT data allow us to extend the energy of the LGRBs up to 2000 keV, and a relation between and energy E is obtained: (8–2000 keV). We first systematically investigate the average PDS and individual PDSs for short GRBs (SGRBs), and obtain (8–1000 keV), where the values of vary from 1.86 to 1.34. The distribution of the power-law index of an individual PDS (α) of an SGRB is consistent with that of an LGRB, and the α value for the group with a dominant timescale (the bent power law) is higher than that for the group with no dominant timescale (the single power law). Both LGRBs and SGRBs show similar α and , which indicates that they may be the result of similar stochastic processes. Typical values of the dominant timescale τ for LGRBs and SGRBs are 1.58 s and 0.02 s, respectively. It seems that τ varies in proportion to the duration of GRBs T90, with a relation . The GRB light curve may result from superposing a number of pulses with different timescales. No periodic or quasi-periodic signal above the 3σ significance threshold is found in our sample.

The distribution of chemical species in protoplanetary disks around young stars, especially their division between gas and solid phases, fundamentally shapes the composition of future planets and planetesimals. This distribution is likely affected by entrapment, a mechanism whereby volatile species are mechanically or chemically bound within a less volatile ice. In this study, we investigate the entrapment efficiencies of four hypervolatiles (CH4, CO, N2, and Ar) in multicomponent water ice mixtures deposited at different temperatures and mixture ratios. At low ice deposition temperatures, we observe small differences in entrapment efficiency (CH4>CO>N2∼Ar) up to a factor of two across species. The differences in entrapment between species increase by up to an order of magnitude with increasing deposition temperature. The relative entrapment efficiencies are also impacted by changes in the overall hypervolatile concentration of the ice mixtures. Collectively, these experiments suggest that relative entrapment efficiencies are mainly regulated by small differences in binding energies to the ice matrix, though competition for the best sites also influences entrapment in more concentrated ices. We use these results to better inform interpretations of hypervolatile observations in comets and related objects.

Coronal jets are one of the most common eruptive activities in the solar atmosphere. They are related to rich physics processes, including, but not limited to, magnetic reconnection, flaring, instabilities, and plasma heating. Automated identification of off-limb coronal jets has been difficult due to their abundant nature, complex appearance, and relatively small size compared to other features in the corona. In this paper, we present an automated jet identification algorithm (AJIA) that utilizes true and fake jets previously detected by a laborious semiautomated jet detection algorithm (SAJIA) as the input of an image segmentation neural network U-NET. It is found that AJIA can achieve a much higher (0.81) detecting precision than SAJIA (0.34) while giving the possibility of whether each pixel in an input image belongs to a jet. We demonstrate that with the aid of artificial neural networks, AJIA can enable fast, accurate, and real-time off-limb coronal jet identification from Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly 304 Å observations, which are essential in studying the collective and long-term behavior of coronal jets and their relation to the solar activity cycles.

We present a rigorous study of compact objects within f(Q) gravity where electrical fields and dark matter are studied and provide novel mass–radius relations with models falling in the mass gap of the events GW190814 and GW200210. After formulating the basic equations and finding their relevant solutions, we impose the boundary conditions on the system under treatment. The decoupled solution for the strange stellar model with the dark matter density profile is obtained. The distribution patterns of the effective energy density and the radial as well as the tangential pressure and anisotropy in the system are intensively examined. The stability properties of the stellar configuration and the influence of dark matter are studied. The recent observations of supermassive compact star candidates such as PSR J1614–2230 and PSR J0952–0607 with observed masses greater than or equal to 2 M⊙ have been employed in our study. Interestingly, the present study predicts the constraints on mass–radius measurements of the observed stars satisfying the equation of state based on the MIT bag model and employing the condition of mimicking, i.e., ρθ = in f(Q) gravity. Our graphical results exhibit that for a particular M–R curve with fixed values of the parameters, neutron stars having mass less than Mmax exist with larger radii within the context of the f(Q) formalism.

研究发现，在对B3 1343+451进行14年的Fermi望远镜观测的基础上，提取了0.1-500 GeV能量范围内的γ射线光变曲线，并确定了七次爆发期。在了解遥远类星体射流特性的基础上，采用标准的一区域亚电子模型对七次爆发期和一个平静期的多波段光谱能量分布进行了建模。研究还推测了B3 1343+451的射流可能不完全由Blandford–Payne过程解释，具有比较大的动能，而辐射功率较小，并且需要降低吸积效率。综合这些结果可以暗示B3 1343+451可能拥有环绕其质量黑洞的标准薄盘。<br /><br />总结: 高红移blazar B3 1343+451的Fermi望远镜长时间观测发现了七次爆发期，利用标准模型建模发现射流可能具有更大的动能，需要降低吸积效率，可能存在着标准薄盘。 <div>
High-redshift blazars are the most powerful extragalactic astrophysical sources ever detected in the high-energy γ-ray band. In this study, we present a temporal and spectral analysis of the high-redshift blazar B3 1343+451 based on 14 yr of the Fermi Large Area Telescope observations, spanning from 2008 August 4 to 2022 June 6 (MJD = 54686–59733). We extract a 7 day binned γ-ray light curve in the energy range 0.1–500 GeV and identify seven outburst periods with a peak flux of >4.32 × 10−7 ph cm−2 s−1. The highest 7 day flux (above 100 MeV) reaches (8.06 ± 0.56) × 10−7 erg cm−2 s−1 on MJD = 56177.16, which is 10 times higher than the flux in the quiescent period. To understand the properties of distant blazar jets, we employ a standard one-zone leptonic scenario and model the multiwavelength spectral energy distributions of one quiescent and seven flaring periods. We find that the γ-ray spectrum is better reproduced when the dissipation region of the jet, Rdiss, is located within the molecular torus, where infrared emission is the dominant external photon field. We infer that the jets in higher-redshift blazars have larger power and kinetic energy, where the kinetic energy is significantly greater than the radiation power, and the jet production efficiency suggests that we need to lower the accretion efficiency. These results imply that B3 1343+451 may have a standard thin disk surrounding its massive black hole, and the jets of B3 1343+451 may not be fully explained by the Blandford–Payne process.

<div> 关键词: 化学丰度，星系化学演化，恒星形成星系，氧和镁，质量-金属丰度关系
总结:
本研究使用Keck Cosmic Web Imager观测46个低红移、低质量恒星形成星系和两个质量为10^8.8M⊙的静止星系，旨在探讨介于本地星系群卫星星系和大质量场星系之间的星系化学演化。我们开发了一种新的方法，同时确定了恒星中的铁和镁丰度。利用强线法测量气相氧丰度(O/H)g，我们首次能够对星际介质和恒星中的α元素进行直接比较。我们发现[Mg/H]*–[O/H]g关系比[Fe/H]*–[O/H]g关系更紧密，这可以通过α元素的类似产生过程来解释。我们的样本中大多数星系的[O/H]g都高于[Fe/H]*和[Mg/H]*。此外，我们构建了作为三种不同元素(Fe*, Mg*, Og)的质量-金属丰度关系(MZR)。与气体O-MZR相比，恒星Fe-MZR和Mg-MZR显示出更大的离散度，这是由于特定星形成率(sSFR)的变化所驱动的，具有较高sSFR的恒星形成星系在固定质量下显示出较高的sSFR和较低的恒星丰度。[O/H]g相对于恒星丰度的过量以及sSFR与恒星丰度的反相关暗示，M* ∼ 10^8−10M⊙的中等质量星系的淘汰主要是由于饥饿驱动的。<br /><br /> <div>
Understanding the chemical enrichment of different elements is crucial to gaining a complete picture of galaxy chemical evolution. In this study, we present a new sample of 46 low-redshift, low-mass star-forming galaxies at M* ∼ 108−10M⊙ along with two quiescent galaxies at M* ∼ 108.8M⊙ observed with the Keck Cosmic Web Imager, aiming to investigate the chemical evolution of galaxies in the transition zone between Local Group satellites and massive field galaxies. We develop a novel method to simultaneously determine stellar abundances of iron and magnesium in star-forming galaxies. With the gas-phase oxygen abundance (O/H)g measured using the strong-line method, we are able to make the first-ever apples-to-apples comparison of α elements in the stars and the interstellar medium. We find that the [Mg/H]*–[O/H]g relation is much tighter than the [Fe/H]*–[O/H]g relation, which can be explained by the similar production processes of α elements. Most galaxies in our sample exhibit higher [O/H]g than [Fe/H]* and [Mg/H]*. In addition, we construct mass–metallicity relations (MZRs) measured as three different elements (Fe*, Mg*, Og). Compared to the gas O-MZR, the stellar Fe- and Mg-MZRs show larger scatter driven by variations in specific star formation rates (sSFR), with star-forming galaxies exhibiting higher sSFR and lower stellar abundances at fixed mass. The excess of [O/H]g compared to stellar abundances as well as the anticorrelation between sSFR and stellar abundance suggests that galaxy quenching of intermediate-mass galaxies at M* ∼ 108−10M⊙ is primarily driven by starvation.

<div> 天体行星形成，太阳系，盘状模型，N体模拟，内迁
总结:
天体行星形成，包括太阳系中的地球和超地球/亚类海王星系统，可以通过模拟在一个盘状模型中进行。N体模拟表明，质量小于地球质量的行星形成于离太阳1天文单位远的区域，不会向内偏移，保持高的径向质量浓度。质量大于地球质量的行星则会在盘状模型的外迁区域缓慢向内迁移，最终可能移动到大约10天的轨道上。这一模型预测，来自离太阳1天文单位远附近的环内迁形成的地球和次地球在近内迁区域不会很常见。 <div>
For the origin of the radially concentrated solar system’s terrestrial planets, planet formation from a ring of solids at about 1 au from the Sun with convergent/suppressed type I migration is preferred. On the other hand, many super-Earths and sub-Neptunes are found in the close-in region with orbital periods of 10–100 days, so that planet formation from rings in the 1 au region would require some degree of inward migration. One way to realize these different formation scenarios is to use different gas disk models. In this study, we investigate whether different scenarios can be realized within a single framework. We consider a disk model that evolves via disk winds and develops a density peak, and study planet formation and orbital evolution using N-body simulations. Planets with masses less than an Earth mass formed from a low-mass ring resembling the solar system do not migrate inward even in the evolving disk and remain near 1 au orbits, maintaining a high radial mass concentration. On the other hand, planets with masses greater than an Earth mass formed from a massive ring slowly migrate inward above the outward migration region. As a result, the innermost planet can move to an orbit of about 10 days. The simulation results also reproduce the characteristics (e.g., mass distribution, eccentricity, orbital separation) of the solar system and super-Earth/sub-Neptune systems. Our model predicts that Earths and sub-Earths formed by migration from rings near the 1 au region are less abundant in the close-in region.

<div> 超大质量黑洞，相对论性喷流，星系演化，宇宙微波背景透镜，宇宙大结构
<br />
这项研究通过对低频射电星系的聚类和宇宙微波背景透镜效应的测量，来限制超大质量黑洞产生的喷流与周围气体介质相互作用的环境。研究发现这些系统位于类似于星系团的暗物质晕的内部，并且这些暗物质晕的增长速率与过去约100亿年暗物质晕平均增长速率一致。聚类和光度函数的共同演变表明这些系统的工作周期大约为10％，但自大约z∼2以来略有增加，而类星体的工作周期却在下降。在动力学上，强大的喷流加热优于类星体风对于暗物质晕和星系团质量的作用，这与星系演化的范式一致，其中机械喷流能量反馈是团和星系团中气体含量的主要加热机制。
<br /><br />总结: 超大质量黑洞形成的相对论性喷流对于星系演化具有重要影响，在过去100亿年里，这些系统占据着类星体质量为1013–1014太阳质量的暗物质晕，呈现出工作周期大约为10％的特征，而且在过去的演化过程中有所增加。与此同时，它们在质量大于1013太阳质量的暗物质晕内的加热作用也优于类星体。 <div>
Coupling between relativistic jets launched by accreting supermassive black holes and the surrounding gaseous media is a vital ingredient in galaxy evolution models. To constrain the environments in which this feedback takes place over cosmic time, we study the host-halo properties of luminous low-frequency radio galaxies (L150 MHz ≳ 1025.25 W Hz−1) selected with the International Low-Frequency Array Telescope out to z ∼ 2 through tomographic clustering and cosmic microwave background lensing measurements. We find that these systems occupy halos characteristic of galaxy groups (Mh = 1013–1014h−1 M⊙), evolving at a rate consistent with the mean growth rate of halos over the past ∼10 Gyr. The coevolution of the clustering and the luminosity function reveals that the duty cycle of these systems is of order ∼10% but has been mildly increasing since z ∼ 2, while the duty cycle of quasars has been declining. We estimate the characteristic kinetic heating power injected by powerful jets per halo as a function of mass, and compare to the same quantity injected by quasar winds. We find that powerful jet heating dominates over quasar winds in halos Mh ≳ 1013 h−1 M⊙ at z < 2. These results conform to the paradigm of galaxy evolution in which mechanical jet power feedback is the dominant heating mechanism of the gas content of groups and clusters.

<div> 关键词: 等离子体湍流，太阳风，粒子比率，动力学模型，数值实验

总结: 
本文研究了等离子湍流的动力学模型，在模拟实验中系统地变化了离子-电子质量比，发现质量比对动力学范围的动态和等离子体加热都有重要影响。对离子和电子而言，质量比的改变导致了加热/耗散过程的本质巨大变化，同时也对加热过程产生了显著影响。最终发现，离子-电子质量比约为250时，可以捕捉到电子加热的渐近行为。本研究揭示了等离子体湍流动力学中质量比的重要影响。 <div>
Understanding plasma turbulence requires a synthesis of experiments, observations, theory, and simulations. In the case of kinetic plasmas such as the solar wind, the lack of collisions renders the fluid closures such as viscosity meaningless and one needs to resort to higher-order fluid models or kinetic models. Typically, the computational expense in such models is managed by simulating artificial values of certain parameters such as the ratio of the Alfvén speed to the speed of light (vA/c) or the relative mass ratio of ions and electrons (mi/me). Although, typically care is taken to use values as close as possible to realistic values within the computational constraints, these artificial values could potentially introduce unphysical effects. These unphysical effects could be significant at sub-ion scales, where kinetic effects are the most important. In this paper, we use the 10-moment fluid model in the Gkeyll framework to perform controlled numerical experiments, systematically varying the ion–electron mass ratio from a small value down to the realistic proton–electron mass ratio. We show that the unphysical mass ratio has a significant effect on the kinetic range dynamics as well as the heating of both plasma species. The dissipative process for both ions and electrons becomes more compressive in nature, although the ions remain nearly incompressible in all cases. The electrons move from being dominated by incompressive viscous-like heating/dissipation to very compressive heating/dissipation dominated by compressions/rarefactions. While the heating change is significant for the electrons, a mass ratio of mi/me ∼ 250 captures the asymptotic behavior of electron heating.

<div> Andromeda XVIII, dwarf galaxy, spectroscopy, metallicity, quenching<br />
<br />总结:<br />Andromeda XVIII是一种孤立的矮星系，可能受到M31近距离经过的影响，其金属丰度分布不符合简单的化学演化模型，表明星形成可能突然中断。平均速度和金属丰度与M31相对速度表明可能是由于M31的近距离经过导致的气体损失或者内部反馈对星系形成的影响。 <div>
Andromeda XVIII is an isolated dwarf galaxy 579 kpc away from the nearest large galaxy, M31. It is a candidate “backsplash galaxy” that might have been affected by a close passage to M31. We present new Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopy of Andromeda XVIII to assess the likelihood that it is a backsplash galaxy. We estimated the velocities, metallicities ([Fe/H]), and α-enhancements ([α/Fe]) for 56 probable members. Based on the abundances of 38 stars with low errors (δ[Fe/H] < 0.3), parameters for the simplest chemical evolution models were estimated using the maximum likelihood coupled with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. The metallicity distribution is inconsistent with these models, due to a sharp metal-rich cutoff. We estimated Andromeda XVIII’s mean heliocentric velocity, rotation velocity, position angle of the rotation axis, and velocity dispersion using the maximum likelihood coupled with an MCMC. There is no evidence for bulk rotation, though subpopulations might be rotating. The mean heliocentric velocity is −337.2 km s−1, such that the line-of-sight velocity relative to M31 is lower than the escape velocity from M31. Together, the metallicity distribution and the mean velocity are consistent with a sudden interruption of star formation. For possible causes of this quenching, we considered gas loss due to ram pressure stripping during a close passage by M31 or due to a past major merger. However, we cannot rule out internal feedback (i.e., a terminal wind).

Near-Earth supernova blasts which engulf the solar system have left traces of their ejecta in the geological and lunar records. There is now a wealth of data on live radioactive 60Fe pointing to a supernova at 3 Myr ago, as well as the recent discovery of an event at 7 Myr ago. We use the available measurements to evaluate the distances to these events. For the better analyzed supernova at 3 Myr, samples include deep-sea sediments, ferromanganese crusts, and lunar regolith; we explore the consistency among and across these measurements, which depends sensitively on the uptake of iron in the samples as well as possible anisotropies in the 60Fe fallout. There is also significant uncertainty in the astronomical parameters needed for these calculations. We take the opportunity to perform a parameter study on the effects that the ejected 60Fe mass from a core-collapse supernova and the fraction of dust that survives the remnant have on the resulting distance. We find that with an ejected 60Fe mass of 3 × 10−5M⊙ and a dust fraction of 10%, the distance range for the supernova 3 Myr ago is D ∼ 20–140 pc, with the most likely range between 50 and 65 pc. Using the same astrophysical parameters, the distance for the supernova at 7 Myr ago is D ∼ 110 pc. We close with a brief discussion of geological and astronomical measurements that can improve these results.

<div> 关键词: GRBs, 外部冲击模型, 光度曲线, 初能标, 磁场强度
总结:
外部冲击模型在薄壳情景下预测了伽马射线暴（GRBs）光学余辉曲线中的起始颠峰。研究收集了30个GRBs的典型光度曲线样本，并从其X射线和光学余辉曲线的联合拟合中推导了射流特性。结果发现，初始洛伦兹因子（Γ0）、减速半径（Rdec）和磁场强度（B0）的分布是对数正态的，但等离子体动能（Ek,iso）、介质密度（n0）和磁化参数（σB）的分布可能是双峰的。发现了严格的Rdec-B0-σB关系，推测支持先前的观点，即GRB辐射能量在GRBs之间是普遍存在的。模拟了26个GRBs的光度曲线需要喷流折射。射流开角和校正后的动能的分布分别呈对数正态分布（标准差σ=0.27）和（σ=0.54）。那些（19个GRBs）其中，其俄罗斯语报均匀估计出广能量段观测，可满足先前发现的Lγ，p，iso–Ep，z–Γ0关系，并且它们的γ射线辐射效率对数正态地分布在0.04%到10%范围内，中心值为0.42%。这种低效率有利于重子火球模型，并且它们的质子质量加载在GRB抛射物中的分布对数正态地集中在（σ=0.75）。 <div>
The standard external shock model in the thin-shell scenario predicts an onset bump in the early optical afterglow light curves of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We collect such a textbook-version light-curve sample of 30 GRBs and derive the jet properties from our joint fit to their X-ray and optical afterglow light curves. It is found that the distributions of the isotropic initial Lorentz factors (Γ0), the deceleration radii (Rdec), and the magnetic field strength (B0) are log-normal, but the distributions of the isotropic kinetic energy (Ek,iso), medium density (n0), and magnetization parameter (σB ≡ ϵB/ϵe) are tentatively bimodal. A tight Rdec–B0–σB relation is found. It infers a universal ϵeEk,iso among bursts, plausibly supporting the previous argument of a universal GRB radiation energy among GRBs. A jet break is required for modeling the light curves of 26 GRBs. The distributions of the jet opening angles and the jet-corrected kinetic energies log-normally center at (standard deviation σ = 0.27) and (σ = 0.54), respectively. Those GRBs (19 GRBs), whose prompt gamma-ray emission is well estimated with broad energy-band observations, satisfy the previously discovered Lγ,p,iso–Ep,z–Γ0 relation, and their gamma-ray radiation efficiencies log-normally distribute in the range from 0.04% to 10% with a central value of 0.42%. Such a low efficiency favors the baryonic fireball model, and the distribution of their baryon mass loading in the GRB ejecta log-normally centers at (σ = 0.75).

Recently Gagné et al. suggested that young moving groups with similar kinematic properties could be part of larger dissolving structures. One example was IC 2602 as the core of a group of associations, including its corona (CIC 2602), Tucana-Horologium (THA), and parts of Theia 92. We explore this hypothesis by measuring the rotation periods of 953 objects selected using Gaia DR3 kinematics from IC 2602, CIC 2602, Theia 92, and a newly identified group of stars that bridge IC 2602 and THA. We use Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) full frame images to measure new rotation periods and combine these with the rotation periods for THA from Popinchalk et al. to compare their rotation period distributions and other youth indicators where available to examine if the groups could be coeval. We find strong agreement between the rotation distributions of IC 2602, CIC 2602, and THA, suggesting a shared age of ∼40 Myr, and which in combination could serve as an example of a typical distribution at this age. Theia 92 does not agree at the same level, and we explore the potential kinematic reasons it does not match the rotation period distribution of the larger groups. Additionally, in our light curve analysis we identify ∼50 potential binaries, as well as four new M dwarf complex rotators that show major morphological changes between TESS cycles. Finally, using the amplitudes of the rotation periods we measured, we find strong agreement with the amplitude–age relation presented in Morris for our 40 Myr groups.

<div> SN 2024ggi, type II supernova, NGC 3621, UV-optical-near-infrared observations, progenitor mass-loss rate

总结:
SN 2024ggi是位于NGC 3621的II型超新星，通过UV-光学-近红外观测以及建模分析，发现其具有IIn-like特征，暗示其周围存在光电离的厚CSM。在观测的不同时间点上，发现了He ii，C iv，N iv/v和O v的发射线，显示出蓝向偏移的特征，这可能是由于扩展而密集的CSM引起的。此外，SN 2024ggi的峰值UV-光学绝对星等与已知的CSM相互作用的II型超新星的特征一致。建立的辐射流体力学模拟显示，爆发前约3年，SN 2024ggi的前体星经历了增强的质量流失。 <div>
We present UV–optical–near-infrared observations and modeling of supernova (SN) 2024ggi, a type II supernova (SN II) located in NGC 3621 at 7.2 Mpc. Early-time (“flash”) spectroscopy of SN 2024ggi within +0.8 days of discovery shows emission lines of H i, He i, C iii, and N iii with a narrow core and broad, symmetric wings (i.e., “IIn-like”) arising from the photoionized, optically thick, unshocked circumstellar material (CSM) that surrounded the progenitor star at shock breakout (SBO). By the next spectral epoch at +1.5 days, SN 2024ggi showed a rise in ionization as emission lines of He ii, C iv, N iv/v, and O v became visible. This phenomenon is temporally consistent with a blueward shift in the UV–optical colors, both likely the result of SBO in an extended, dense CSM. The IIn-like features in SN 2024ggi persist on a timescale of tIIn = 3.8 ± 1.6 days, at which time a reduction in CSM density allows the detection of Doppler-broadened features from the fastest SN material. SN 2024ggi has peak UV–optical absolute magnitudes of Mw2 = −18.7 mag and Mg = −18.1 mag, respectively, that are consistent with the known population of CSM-interacting SNe II. Comparison of SN 2024ggi with a grid of radiation hydrodynamics and non–local thermodynamic equilibrium radiative-transfer simulations suggests a progenitor mass-loss rate of yr−1 (vw = 50 km s−1), confined to a distance of r < 5 × 1014 cm. Assuming a wind velocity of vw = 50 km s−1, the progenitor star underwent an enhanced mass-loss episode in the last ∼3 yr before explosion.

<div> NDAF, SGWB, neutrino, CCSN, metallicity
<br /><br />总结:
本研究通过对回落型核心坍缩超新星（CCSN）模拟的结果，研究了以中微子为主导的吸积流（NDAFs）产生的随机引力波背景（SGWB）。研究发现，预测的SGWB主要取决于典型CCSN初始爆炸能量和母体金属丰度。在乐观情况下，如果典型的初始爆炸能量较低，则NDAFs产生的SGWB可能会被下一代太空干涉仪（如DECi-hertz干涉引力波观测器和宇宙大爆炸观测器）探测到。在低频领域∼10−3–10−1 Hz，该背景与标准的通货膨胀模型预期的背景相当。因此，NDAFs产生的SGWB可能成为研究通货膨胀时期产生的SGWB的前景。结合NDAF中微子背景和NDAFs产生的SGWB，可以限制CCSNe和NDAFs的属性。 <div>
We investigate the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) from neutrino-dominated accretion flows (NDAFs) based on the results of our fallback core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulations. We find that the predicted SGWB is mainly determined by the typical CCSN initial explosion energy and progenitor metallicity. For the optimistic cases in which the typical initial explosion energy is low, the SGWB from NDAFs without disk outflows might be detected by next-generation space-based interferometers such as DECi-hertz Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory and Big Bang Observer. In the low-frequency regime ∼10−3–10−1 Hz, this background is comparable to that expected from standard inflationary models. Therefore, the SGWB from NDAFs may become a foreground for research of the SGWB generated in the inflationary epoch. Combining the diffuse NDAF neutrino background and SGWB from NDAFs, one may constrain the properties of the CCSNe and NDAFs.

<div> 关键词: JWST, magnetar, MIRI, NIRCam, power-law model<br />
总结: <br />
JWST使用MIRI和NIRCam仪器对磁星4U 0142+61进行了观测。结果显示该磁星的光谱可以用吸收功率模型描述，不支持之前基于Spitzer光度提出的被动盘模型。研究者认为这些发现可能是由于非热源和观测时间的变化。另外，JWST的观测结果与NuSTAR的硬X射线光谱比较显示，X射线和红外非热发射可能来自磁星磁层中的不同区域。 <div>
JWST observed the magnetar 4U 0142+61 with the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) and Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) instruments within a 77 minute time interval on 2022 September 20–21. The low-resolution MIRI spectrum and NIRCam photometry show that the spectrum in the wavelength range 1.4–11 μm range can be satisfactorily described by an absorbed power-law (PL) model, fν ∝ ν−α, with a spectral slope α = 0.96 ± 0.02, interstellar extinction AV = 3.9 ± 0.2, and normalization f0 = 59.4 ± 0.5 μJy at λ = 8 μm. These observations do not support the passive disk model proposed in 2006 by Wang, Chakrabarty and Kaplan, based on Spitzer photometry, which was interpreted as evidence for a fallback disk from debris formed during the supernova explosion. We suggest a nonthermal origin for this emission and source variability as the most likely cause of discrepancies between the JWST data and other IR-optical observing campaigns. However, we cannot firmly exclude the presence of a large disk with a different dependence of the effective disk temperature on distance from the magnetar. Comparison with the PL fit to the hard X-ray spectrum above 10 keV, measured by the NuSTAR contemporaneously with JWST, shows that the X-ray spectrum is significantly harder. This may imply that the X-ray and IR nonthermal emission come from different sites in the magnetosphere of the magnetar.

<div> 关键词: Lagrangian, Gaussian process, Hubble measurements, ΛCDM, f(Q) parameterization

总结: 
该研究探讨了在引力修正理论中选择Lagrangian函数形式的标准程序的差异增加的问题，并提出了使用高斯过程来消除这一问题的方法。研究使用宇宙年代计和径向宇宙学声学振荡的58个哈勃测量来重建Hubble参数H(z)及其导数和H″(z)，从而在不做任何假设的情况下重建了f(Q)的区域。得到的平均曲线沿着Lambda冷暗物质(ΛCDM)常数在重建区域内呈现二次行为，这促使提出了一个新的f(Q)参数化，即f(Q) = −2Λ + ϵQ2，其中ϵ是一个单一参数，表示与ΛCDM宇宙学的偏差。此外，对比重建区域，探讨了广泛研究的幂律和指数f(Q)模型，并且大大改善了对参数空间的观测分析。此外，直接的哈勃测量以及重建的f(Q)函数使得H0张力得以缓解。 <div>
The increase of discrepancy in the standard procedure to choose the arbitrary functional form of the Lagrangian f(Q) motivates us to solve this issue in modified theories of gravity. In this regard, we investigate the Gaussian process, which allows us to eliminate this issue in an f(Q) model-independent way. In particular, we use the 58 Hubble measurements coming from cosmic chronometers and the radial Baryon acoustic oscillations to reconstruct H(z) and its derivatives and H″(z), which leads us to reconstruct the region of f(Q), without any assumptions. The obtained mean curve along the Lambda Cold Dark Matter (ΛCDM) constant in the reconstructed region follows a quadratic behavior. This motivates us to propose a new f(Q) parameterization, i.e., f(Q) = −2Λ + ϵQ2, with the single parameter ϵ, which signifies the deviations from ΛCDM cosmology. Further, we probe the widely studied power-law and exponential f(Q) models against the reconstructed region and can improve the parameter spaces significantly compared with observational analysis. In addition, the direct Hubble measurements, along with the reconstructed f(Q) function, allow the H0 tension to be alleviated.

<div> L dwarfs, retrieval analysis, elemental abundance measurements, K-dwarf, cloud model <br />
总结: 
这是一篇关于对年轻的、多云的红色L矮星进行大气检索分析的文章。研究使用了Brewster检索框架，并对年轻K矮星进行了首次元素丰度测量。研究发现在存在凝结云物种的复杂多云L矮星区域，只有近红外数据时，检索分析变得更加困难。尽管测试了三种不同的热剖面参数化，我们仍然无法约束可靠的丰度测量，因此无法确定碳氧比。然而，数据强烈支持云模型而不是无云模型。无论检查的数据的信噪比如何（CWISER BD+60 1417B的S/N约为10，W0047的S/N约为40），检索约束的困难依然存在。这项工作为检索年轻、低表面重力多云L矮星提供了宝贵的经验教训。这项研究进一步证明了模型中存在信息缺失的现象，并迫切需要JWST来指导和提供这一区域的检索分析。 <br /> <div>
We present an atmospheric retrieval analysis on a set of young, cloudy, red L dwarfs—CWISER J124332.12+600126.2 (BD+60 1417B) and WISEP J004701.06+680352.1 (W0047)—using the Brewster retrieval framework. We also present the first elemental abundance measurements of the young K-dwarf (K0) host star, BD+60 1417, using high-resolution (R = 50,000) spectra taken with the Potsdam Echelle Polarimetric and Spectroscopic Instrument on the Large Binocular Telescope. In the complex cloudy L-dwarf regime the emergence of condensate cloud species complicates retrieval analysis when only near-infrared data are available. We find that for both L dwarfs in this work, despite testing three different thermal profile parameterizations we are unable to constrain reliable abundance measurements and thus the carbon-to-oxygen ratio. While we cannot conclude what the abundances are, we can conclude that the data strongly favor a cloud model over a cloudless model. We note that the difficulty in retrieval constraints persists regardless of the signal-to-noise ratio of the data examined (S/N ∼ 10 for CWISER BD+60 1417B and 40 for WISEP W0047). The results presented in this work provide valuable lessons about retrieving young, low-surface-gravity cloudy L dwarfs. This work provides continued evidence of missing information in models and the crucial need for JWST to guide and inform retrieval analysis in this regime.

在这篇文章中，研究了1 AU处的多种能量粒子强度增强事件。识别为一个包括流界面、正反冲击对和嵌入的太阳圈电流片的共旋相互作用区（CIR）结构。文章指出CIR事件的显著特征是：高能（>1 MeV）离子在CIR结构的反波（RW）/冲击处显示了明显的通量增强，这似乎取决于能量。此外，40.5-520 keV能量范围的电子在通过SI和HCS区域后立即加速，并在RW处仅高能电子（约520 keV）显示出明显的局部通量增强。CIR结构后面是由日冕物质抛射（CME）驱动的快速垂直冲击，观察到低能质子和高能电子的通量显著增强。特别地，210-330 keV质子和180-520 keV电子的通量增加了约2个数量级。文章进一步提出，SI和RW处湍流的增加可能是不同物种观察到的通量增强的重要因素。另外，在RW附近存在离子尺度波动，这表明共振波-粒子相互作用可能是高能质子和离子尺度波之间高效的能量转移器。<br /><br />总结：本文研究了1 AU处CIR结构引起的能量粒子强度增强事件。主要观察到高能离子在反波/冲击处通量增强，与能量相关；低能电子通过SI和HCS区域后立即加速，RW处仅高能电子显示通量增强；CIR结构后面的ICME驱动冲击显著增加了低能质子和高能电子的通量。文章进一步指出SI和RW处湍流的增加可能是不同物种通量增强的重要因素，同时离子尺度波动可能是高能质子和离子间高效能量转移的关键。 <div>
A multispecies energetic particle intensity enhancement event at 1 au is analyzed. We identify this event as a corotating interaction region (CIR) structure that includes a stream interface (SI), a forward-reverse shock pair, and an embedded heliospheric current sheet (HCS). The distinct feature of this CIR event is that (1) the high-energy (>1 MeV) ions show significant flux enhancement at the reverse wave (RW)/shock of the CIR structure, following their passage through the SI and HCS. The flux amplification appears to depend on the energy per nucleon. (2) Electrons in the energy range of 40.5–520 keV are accelerated immediately after passing through the SI and HCS regions, and the flux quickly reaches a peak for low-energy electrons. At the RW, only high-energy electrons (∼520 keV) show significant local flux enhancement. The CIR structure is followed by a fast-forward perpendicular shock driven by a coronal mass ejection (CME), and we observed a significant flux enhancement of low-energy protons and high-energy electrons. Specifically, the 210–330 keV proton and 180–520 keV electron fluxes are enhanced by approximately 2 orders of magnitude. This suggests that the later ICME-driven shock may accelerate particles out of the suprathermal pool. In this paper, we further present that for CIR-accelerated particles, the increase in turbulence power at SI and RWs may be an important factor for the observed flux enhancement in different species. The presence of ion-scale waves near the RW, as indicated by the spectral bump near the proton gyrofrequency, suggests that the resonant wave–particle interaction may act as an efficient energy transferrer between energetic protons and ion-scale waves.

The radiation mechanism underlying the prompt emission remains unresolved and can be resolved using a systematic and uniform time-resolved spectro-polarimetric study. In this paper, we investigated the spectral, temporal, and polarimetric characteristics of five bright gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) using archival data from AstroSat CZTI, Swift Burst Alert Telescope, and Fermi/GBM. These bright GRBs were detected by CZTI in its first year of operation, and their average polarization characteristics have been published in Chattopadhyay et al. In the present work, we examined the time-resolved (in 100–600 keV) and energy-resolved polarization measurements of these GRBs with an improved polarimetric technique such as increasing the effective area and bandwidth (by using data from low-gain pixels), using an improved event selection logic to reduce noise in the double events and extend the spectral bandwidth. In addition, we also separately carried out detailed time-resolved spectral analyses of these GRBs using empirical and physical synchrotron models. By these improved time-resolved and energy-resolved spectral and polarimetric studies (not fully coupled spectro-polarimetric fitting), we could pin down the elusive prompt emission mechanism of these GRBs. Our spectro-polarimetric analysis reveals that GRB 160623A, GRB 160703A, and GRB 160821A have Poynting flux-dominated jets. On the other hand, GRB 160325A and GRB 160802A have baryonic-dominated jets with mild magnetization. Furthermore, we observe a rapid change in polarization angle by ∼90° within the main pulse of very bright GRB 160821A, consistent with our previous results. Our study suggests that the jet composition of GRBs may exhibit a wide range of magnetization, which can be revealed by utilizing spectro-polarimetric investigations of the bright GRBs.

<div> 双星系统，行星轨道，盘面扭曲，耗散性进动，系统的动力学建模<br />
总结:<br />
这项研究发现了一些行星-双星系统会出现行星轨道与双星轨道在同一平面上的趋势。他们提出了一个耗散性进动的模型，该模型将双星系统在原行星盘阶段的动态与盘面扭曲结合起来，指出了系统如何在受到倾斜双星伴星的影响下逐渐趋于轨道对齐。他们的模型显示，初始方向随机的系统在经历耗散性进动后会更加趋于对齐，并且这一过程还能产生与观测相一致的倾斜分布。研究结果表明，耗散性进动可能在一部分中等宽双星-行星系统的轨道配置中起到重要作用，但可能不是观测到的整体对齐趋势的唯一原因。 <div>
Recent observations have demonstrated that some subsets of even moderately wide-separation planet-hosting binaries are preferentially configured such that planetary and binary orbits appear to lie within the same plane. In this work, we explore dissipation during the protoplanetary disk phase, induced by disk warping as the system is forced into nodal recession by an inclined binary companion as a possible avenue of achieving orbit–orbit alignment. We analytically model the coupled evolution of the disk angular momentum vector and stellar spin vector under the influence of a distant binary companion. We find that a population of systems with random initial orientations can appear detectably more aligned after undergoing dissipative precession, and that this process can simultaneously produce an obliquity distribution that is consistent with observations. While dissipative precession proceeds efficiently in close binaries, favorable system properties (e.g., rout ≳ 100 au, α ≳ 0.05, and/or Mb/M* ≳ 1) are required to reproduce observed alignment trends at wider binary separations ab ≳ 450 au. Our framework further predicts that circum-primary planets in systems with high stellar mass ratios should be preferentially less aligned than planets in equal mass stellar binary systems. We discover tentative evidence for this trend in Gaia DR3 and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite data. Our findings suggest that dissipative precession may play a significant role in sculpting orbital configurations in a subset of moderately wide planet-hosting binaries, but is likely not solely responsible for their observed population-level alignment.

<div> gamma-ray bursts, relativistic jet, afterglow, two-component jet, reverse shock<br />电磁爆发、相对论性喷流、余辉、双组分喷流、反冲冲击<br /><br />总结: 本文提出了伽马射线暴余辉的双组分喷流假设，并通过GRB 191221B的观测结果支持了这一假设。光学余辉表现出了一个平台期和陡峭的衰减，这与双组分喷流相互作用产生的特征一致。作者提出了对光学余辉、X射线余辉和射电余辉的解释，表明不同阶段受到不同成分喷流的影响。这一研究为理解伽马射线暴遗留的余辉提供了重要线索。 <div>
The afterglows of gamma-ray bursts are believed to have originated from a relativistic jet, which is driven by the merger of compact binary objects or the core collapse of massive stars. Some of their jets may consist of two components: a faster (but narrower) jet and a slower (but wider) jet. The light curves produced by the interaction between the two-component jet and the surrounding medium typically exhibit a chromatic break in multiple bands. For GRB 191221B, the optical light curve of the afterglow exhibits a plateau from 33 to 143 s, followed by a steeper decay that is consistent with the characteristics of reverse shock from an arbitrarily magnetized ejecta. The flattening at ∼10 ks exhibits chromaticity relative to the X-ray afterglow. We propose that the two-component jet scenario can explain this observational result: For the X-ray afterglow, the narrow jet forward shock is dominated until ∼10 ks, and then both the narrow and wide components contribute comparable flux from the forward shock. For the optical afterglow, the first 2 ks is dominated by the narrow jet reverse shock emission (the plateau from 33 to 143 s is due to the jet being magnetized). Between 2 and 10 ks, the forward shock of the narrow jet dominates the optical afterglow, then transitions to wide component forward shock dominance, causing a chromatic plateau. For radio afterglow, the data are only presented after 105 s, which is dominated by the wide jet forward shock emission.

We present results from the JWST First Reionization Epoch Spectroscopically Complete Observations survey on the star-forming sequence (SFS) of galaxies at 1.0 < z < 1.7, around the peak of the cosmic star formation history. Star formation rates (SFRs) are measured from the redshifted, relatively dust-insensitive Paschen-α emission line, and stellar mass measurements include the F444W (4.4 μm; rest-frame H) band. We find SFRs of galaxies with log(M*/M⊙) > 9.5 that are lower than found in many earlier studies by up to 0.6 dex, but in good agreement with recent results obtained with the Prospector fitting framework. The difference (log(SFR(Paα)-SFR(Prospector)) is −0.09 ± 0.04 dex at 1010−11M⊙. We also measure the empirical relation between Paschen-α luminosity and rest-frame H-band magnitude and find that the scatter is only 0.04 dex lower than that of the SFR–M* relation and is much lower than the systematic differences among relations in the literature due to various methods of converting observed measurements to physical properties. We additionally identify examples of sources—that, with standard cutoffs via the UVJ diagram, would be deemed quiescent—with significant (log(sSFR)> −11 yr−1), typically extended, Paschen-α emission. Our results may be indicative of the potential unification of methods used to derive the SFS with careful selection of star-forming galaxies and independent SFR and stellar mass indicators.

In the era of state-of-the-art space-borne telescopes, high-resolution ground-based observation has emerged as a crucial method for characterizing exoplanets, providing essential insights into their atmospheric compositions. In the optical and near-infrared regions, high-resolution spectroscopy has been powerful for hot Jupiters (HJs) and ultrahot Jupiters (UHJs) during their primary transits, as it can probe molecules with better sensitivity. Here, we focus on a comparative simulation study of WASP-76 b (UHJ) and WASP-77 A b (HJ) for different numbers of transits, utilizing three ground-based spectrographs, GIANO-B (Telescopio Nazionale Galileo), CARMENES (Centro Astronomico Hispano Alemán), and ANDES (European Extremely Large Telescope or E-ELT), with varying instrumental parameters, spectral coverages, and resolutions. We aim to evaluate the feasibility of using the upcoming ground-based E-ELT to probe molecules from planet atmospheres and to show how it surpasses other ground-based observatories in terms of detectability. With the 1D model petitCODE, we have self-consistently simulated the atmospheric pressure–temperature profiles, which are subsequently integrated into the 1D chemical kinetics model, VULCAN, to evolve the atmospheric chemistry. High-resolution spectra are obtained by performing line-by-line radiative transfer using petitRADTRANS. Finally, we use the resulting spectra to assess the detectability ( ) of molecular bands, employing the ground-based noise simulator SPECTR. Utilizing cross-correlation spectroscopy, we have successfully demonstrated the robust consistency between our simulation study and real-time observations for both planets. ANDES excels overall in molecular detection, due to its enhanced instrumental architecture, reinforcing E-ELT’s importance for studying exoplanet atmospheres. Additionally, our theoretical simulations predict the detection of CO, NH3, and H2S in the WASP-76 b atmosphere with > 3.

该研究利用太阳动力学观测卫星的紫外成像观测了太阳耀斑产生的等离子体片的热特性。结果显示，在耀斑产生的等离子体片中存在着高温区域，这些区域具有等温特性，温度保持稳定且与高度无关。这暗示着在磁重联的过程中，存在着平衡的加热和冷却过程，以维持等离子体片的稳定结构。研究还发现，2017年9月10日X8.2级耀斑的等离子体片温度特性与其他情况略有不同，表现出温度随高度增加而降低的特点。总的来说，这些结果揭示了耀斑磁重联时产生的等离子体片具有稳定且均匀的结构。 <div>
The current sheet is an essential feature in solar flares and is the primary site for magnetic reconnection and energy release. Imaging observations feature a long linear structure above the candle-flame-shaped flare loops, which resembles the standard flare model with the current sheet viewed edge-on. We investigate the thermal properties of plasmas surrounding the linear sheet during flares, using EUV observations from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory. The differential emission measure analyses show evidence of high temperatures in the plasma sheets (PSs), containing hot emissions from only a narrow temperature range, suggestive of an isothermal feature. The sheet temperature remains constant at different heights above the flare arcade, peaking at around = 7.0–7.1; while the well-studied 2017 September 10 X8.2 flare serves as an exception in that the temperature decreases with increasing height and peaks higher ( = 7.25) during the gradual phase. Most PS cases also hold similar emission measures and thicknesses; while the PS emissions drop exponentially above the flare arcade, the sheet thicknesses show no significant height association as for all the measurements. The characteristics of isothermal and steady temperature suggest balanced heating and cooling processes along the current sheet; in particular, additional heating may exist to compensate for the conductive and radiative cooling away from the reconnection site. Our results suggest a steady and uniform sheet structure in the macroscopic scale that results from flare reconnection.

总结: 
PDS 70是一个原行星系统，有两颗正在积累气态巨行星PDS 70b和PDS 70c。通过ALMA和JVLA的观测，确定了系统内60-100天文单位以及两颗巨行星周围的尘埃环和环行天体盘。在ALMA观测中发现尘埃环呈现出方位上的不对称性。通过JVLA的观测，确定了在Ka和K波段的辐射，而在Q波段也有辐射信号但较弱，在X波段没有检测到辐射。通过观测得到了在33-44 GHz频率范围的谱指数(α)为5±1，22-33 GHz范围的谱指数为0.6±0.2，认为辐射主要来自于纳米级尘埃颗粒的自旋辐射。这些发现对了解原行星盘的性质有着重要意义，将来需要通过更高分辨率的观测来进一步探索这个问题。 <div>
PDS 70 is a protoplanetary system that hosts two actively accreting gas giants, namely, PDS 70b and PDS 70 c. The system has a ∼60–100 au dusty ring that has been resolved by the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA), along with circumplanetary disks around the two gas giants. Here, we report the first Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) Q- (40–48 GHz), Ka- (29–37 GHz), K- (18–26 GHz), and X- (8–12 GHz) bands' continuum observations, and the complementary ALMA Bands 3 (∼98 GHz) and 4 (∼145 GHz) observations towards PDS 70. The dusty ring appears azimuthally asymmetric in our ALMA images. We obtained firm detections at Ka and K bands without spatially resolving the source; we obtained a marginal detection at Q band, and no detection at X band. The spectral indices (α) are 5 ± 1 at 33–44 GHz and 0.6 ± 0.2 at 22–33 GHz. At 10–22 GHz, the conservative lower limit of α is 1.7. The 33–44 GHz flux density is likely dominated by the optically thin thermal emission of grown dust with ≳1 mm maximum grain sizes, which may be associated with the azimuthally asymmetric substructure induced by planet–disk interaction. Since PDS 70 was not detected at X band, we found it hard to explain the low spectral index at 22–33 GHz only with free–free emission. Hence, we attribute the dominant emission at 22–33 GHz to the emission of spinning nano-meter-sized dust particles, while free–free emission may partly contribute to emission at this frequency range. In some protoplanetary disks, the emission of spinning nano-meter-sized dust particles may resemble the 20–50 GHz excess in the spectra of millimeter-sized dust. The finding of strong continuum emission of spinning nano-meter-sized particles can complicate the procedure of constraining the properties of grown dust. Future high resolution, multifrequency JVLA/Next Generation Very Large Array and Square Kilometer Array observations may shed light on this issue.

GRB相关光学闪耀和余辉的光变曲线是本文的研究对象。研究使用了Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)观测的8个伽玛射线暴，对其进行了光学闪耀和余辉的特征分析，并利用TESS光变曲线对其中4个射线暴的物理参数进行了约束。同时，提出了一种纠正TESS宇宙射线抑制策略的简单方法，以估计与伽玛射线暴同时发生的光学闪耀的“真实”亮度。文章还强调了TESS的连续广域监测能力，能够有效地识别伽玛射线暴的光学发射并对其进行早期余辉光变曲线的特征刻画。基于Swift和Fermi伽玛射线空间望远镜的经验检测率，预计每年最多有10个伽玛射线暴会出现在TESS的视野内。 <br /><br />总结: 光学闪耀和余辉的研究；通过TESS观测8个伽马射线暴；利用TESS光变曲线对4个射线暴的物理参数进行约束；提出纠正TESS宇宙射线抑制策略的方法；TESS的连续广域监测能力；每年有10个伽玛射线暴可能出现在TESS的视野内。 <div>
Very few detections have been made of optical flashes contemporaneous with prompt high-energy emission from a gamma-ray burst (GRB). In this work, we present and analyze light curves of GRB-associated optical flashes and afterglows from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). Our sample consists of eight GRBs with arcsecond-level localizations from the X-Ray Telescope on board the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (Swift). For each burst, we characterize the prompt optical emission and any observed afterglow, and constrain physical parameters for four of these bursts using their TESS light curves. This work also presents a straightforward method to correct for TESS's cosmic-ray mitigation strategy on 20 s timescales, which allows us to estimate the “true” brightness of optical flashes associated with prompt GRB emission. We also highlight TESS’s continuous wide-field monitoring capability, which provides an efficient means of identifying optical emission from GRBs and characterizing early time afterglow light curves. Based on empirical detection rates from Swift and the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, up to 10 GRBs per year may fall within the contemporaneous TESS field of view.

<div> 磁场、太阳活动周期、表面流动、磁区、太阳地幔震

总结:<br /><br />研究通过使用日磁图识别的太阳地幔震数据，发现磁区仅对太阳活动纬度范围内的太阳表面流动产生大约1m/s的峰值振幅的影响，这只占已知残余经向或纬向流动变化的一小部分。因此，磁活跃区和一般的紧凑磁浓度可能不是全球流动11年变化的主要来源。研究还发现，约为5×1020 Mx的磁通量是观测到重要流动的阈值。此外，大多数磁区周围的进流被限制在其中心周围10°-12°内，与最近发现的更广泛的进流迹象相反。 <div>
We estimate the contributions to the solar-cycle variation of solar meridional and zonal flows near the surface expected solely from local magnetic regions. Maps of flows near magnetic regions are obtained using helioseismic holography and averaged over ensembles of such regions with similar magnetic flux. These averaged flows are assigned to the positions and times of all magnetic regions identified from daily magnetograms over an 11 yr period. Residuals are obtained after averaging both meridional and zonal-flow components over longitude for each Carrington rotation and subtracting the temporal mean at each latitude. Results indicate that magnetic regions produce solar-cycle variations of both components in the active latitude range with peak amplitudes of about 1 m s−1, which represents only a fraction of the known variations in either the residual zonal or meridional flow with amplitudes around 3 and 5 m s−1, respectively. Thus it is unlikely that active regions, and compact magnetic concentrations in general, are the primary source of the 11 yr variation in these global flows. A threshold magnetic flux of 5 × 1020 Mx, below which no significant flows are observed, is identified as a check on the completeness of the set of magnetic regions. We also find that inflows around most magnetic regions are confined to within 10°–12° of their centers, in contrast with recent evidence of more extended inflows.

<title>Are WASP-107-like Systems Consistent with High-eccentricity Migration?</title>

<div> 高离心率迁移，WASP-107 b，WASP-107 c，Tidal Dissipation，Lidov-Kozai Oscillations
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章讨论了WASP-107 b和WASP-107 c的特性以及它们之间的相互关系。WASP-107 b是一个类似木星却密度异常低的行星，它可能在雪线内发生了高离心率迁移。研究表明，这种高离心率迁移可能导致了行星内部加热的大气层和大气侵蚀现象。此外，研究推测目前WASP-107 b和WASP-107 c之间的相互倾斜可能相当大，可以通过未来的Gaia天体测量观测来加以验证。此外，研究还指出高离心率迁移可能适用于其他具有类似轨道结构的行星系统。 <div>
WASP-107 b seems to be a poster child of the long-suspected high-eccentricity migration scenario. It is on a 5.7 day, polar orbit. The planet is Jupiter-like in radius but Neptune-like in mass with exceptionally low density. WASP-107 c is on a 1100 day, e = 0.28 orbit with at least Saturn mass. Planet b may still have a residual eccentricity of 0.06 ± 0.04: the ongoing tidal dissipation leads to the observed internally heated atmosphere and hydrodynamic atmospheric erosion. We present a population synthesis study coupling octupole Lidov–Kozai oscillations with various short-range forces, while simultaneously accounting for the radius inflation and tidal disruption of the planet. We find that a high-eccentricity migration scenario can successfully explain nearly all observed system properties. Our simulations further suggest that the initial location of WASP-107 b at the onset of migration is likely within the snowline (<0.5 au). More distant initial orbits usually lead to tidal disruption or orbit crossing. WASP-107 b most likely lost no more than 20% of its mass during the high-eccentricity migration, i.e., it did not form as a Jupiter-mass object. More vigorous tidally induced mass loss leads to disruption of the planet during migration. We predict that the current-day mutual inclination between the planets b and c is substantial: at least 25°–55°, which may be tested with future Gaia astrometric observations. Knowing the current-day mutual inclination may further constrain the initial orbit of planet b. We suggest that the proposed high-eccentricity migration scenario of WASP-107 may be applicable to HAT-P-11, GJ-3470, HAT-P-18, and GJ-436, which have similar orbital architectures.

<br /><br />总结:
本研究通过测量双黑洞合并的引力波，揭示了双黑洞合并率随红移的演化规律。研究发现，在不同红移下，宇宙中星系的数量密度因其物理特性（如恒星质量和恒星形成速率）而有不同的演化趋势。根据这一发现，我们首先假定双黑洞的宿主星系可以用恒星质量或恒星形成速率加权的星系混合模型来描述，并对来自恒星质量加权样本的合并比例进行了上限估计。然后，我们利用GWTC-3数据约束了一个物理上合理的幂律延迟时间分布模型的参数，并用这个延迟时间模型自洽地跟踪了宇宙机器模拟中的星系，推断了一系列红移下双黑洞的可能宿主星系。我们发现，在红移z=0.21时推断得到的宿主星系的平均恒星形成速率约为0.9太阳质量每年，平均恒星质量约为1.9×10^10太阳质量。此外，我们还提供了宿主星系相关的平均恒星年龄、暗物质晕的质量、半径、固有速度和大尺度偏移分布，以及其B和Ks波段的绝对星等分布。我们的研究结果可用于设计最佳的电磁跟踪策略，并且有助于使用统计暗涌方法来测量宇宙参数。 <div>
Observations of gravitational waves from binary black hole (BBH) mergers have measured the redshift evolution of the BBH merger rate. The number density of galaxies in the Universe evolves differently with redshift based on their physical properties, such as their stellar masses and star formation rates. In this work we show that the measured population-level redshift distribution of BBHs sheds light on the properties of their probable host galaxies. We first assume that the hosts of BBHs can be described by a mixture model of galaxies weighted by stellar mass or star formation rate, and find that we can place upper limits on the fraction of mergers coming from a stellar-mass-weighted sample of galaxies. We then constrain the parameters of a physically motivated power-law delay-time distribution using GWTC-3 data, and self-consistently track galaxies in the UniverseMachine simulations with this delay-time model to infer the probable host galaxies of BBHs over a range of redshifts. We find that the inferred host galaxy distribution at redshift z = 0.21 has a median star formation rate ∼ 0.9 M⊙ yr−1 and a median stellar mass of ∼1.9 × 1010M⊙. We also provide distributions for the mean stellar age, halo mass, halo radius, peculiar velocity, and large-scale bias associated with the host galaxies, as well as their absolute magnitudes in the B and Ks bands. Our results can be used to design optimal electromagnetic follow-up strategies for BBHs, and also to aid the measurement of cosmological parameters using the statistical dark-siren method.

该研究使用来自Gaia E/DR3的OBA恒星样本，利用LAMOST的径向速度和年龄τ，研究了年轻恒星在最初几个轨道周期内的垂直运动。研究构建了一个参数模型，描述了恒星轨道的平均垂直动作Jz随银河中心半径RGC的时间演变。考虑数据不确定性，使用马尔可夫链蒙特卡罗分析约束了模型参数。最佳拟合模型显示，在所有考虑的银河中心半径范围内，垂直动作随年龄呈现明显的线性增加趋势。这种趋势可能是随机散射导致的轨道加热所致，但银河盘的各种动力学因素，例如恒星在弯曲盘中出生，也可能提供了未来可以验证的替代解释。 
<br />总结: 使用Gaia E/DR3和LAMOST数据研究了年轻恒星轨道垂直动作随年龄和银河中心半径变化的模式，认为垂直动作随年龄呈线性增加趋势，可能是由于随机散射导致的轨道加热。但也指出了可能的其他动力学因素，需要未来进一步研究验证。 <div>
Stars in the Galactic disk are born on cold, nearly circular orbits with small vertical excursions. After their birth, their orbits evolve, driven by small- or large-scale perturbations in the Galactic disk’s gravitational potential. Here, we study the vertical motions of young stars over their first few orbital periods, using a sample of OBA stars from Gaia E/DR3, which includes radial velocities and ages τ from LAMOST. We construct a parametric model for the time evolution of the stellar orbits’ mean vertical actions Jz as a function of Galactocentric radius, RGC. Accounting for data uncertainties, we use Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis in annuli of Galactocentric radius (RGC) to constrain the model parameters. Our best-fit model shows a remarkably linear increase of vertical actions with age across all Galactocentric radii examined. Orbital heating by random scattering could offer a straightforward interpretation for this trend. However, various other dynamical aspects of the Galactic disk, such as stars being born in a warped disk, might offer alternative explanations that could be tested in the future.

总结: 
本研究关注木星广带千米辐射（bKOM）在不同磁层条件下的形态特征。观察结果显示，当磁层条件压缩时，木星bKOM的频率范围普遍超过100千赫兹，持续时间从松弛条件下的0至3小时延长至约4至9小时。不同磁层条件下的辐射特征显示，太阳风条件对木星辐射具有重要影响，因此辐射可作为太阳风与木星磁层相互作用的诊断工具。 <div>
In the planetary magnetosphere, plasma waves act as the medium for particles to transfer energy. Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system, and the giant magnetosphere is full of energetic particles, producing intense radio emissions. When interplanetary shocks in the solar wind interact with the Jovian magnetosphere, magnetospheric conditions change, and the characteristics of Jovian radio emissions show distinct variations accordingly. This study focuses on the morphological characteristics of Jovian broadband kilometric radiation (bKOM) under different magnetospheric conditions, i.e., relaxed and compressed. Using observations from Juno, both the frequency range and duration of Jovian bKOM radio emissions are studied, and we compare their variations during compressed and relaxed magnetospheric conditions. Our results show that under compressed magnetospheric conditions, the observed frequency range of Jovian bKOM generally exceeded 100 kHz, and their duration extended from 0 to 3 hr during uncompressed conditions to about 4–9 hr. The distinct features of radio emissions under different magnetospheric conditions imply that solar wind conditions have important influences on Jovian radio emissions, and thus the radio emissions can be used as a diagnostic tool of solar wind interaction with the Jovian magnetosphere.

<br /><br />总结:
最近的观测发现，地球以外的星球，火星上的电子可以进入地壳磁场，并通过磁漂移运动显示为漂移分散的爆发。然而，这些漂移分散电子的来源和注入地壳磁场的机制仍不清楚。研究团队利用了“火星大气和挥发性物质演化任务”（MAVEN）的数据，并通过测试粒子模拟揭示了这些电子来源于经由开放磁场线注入地壳磁场的沉降电子。这些电子在源位置附近显示为无色散爆发，随着漂移离开源地则呈现为分散的爆发。因此，这些分散电子代表了无色散电子演变的后期阶段。这一演化过程与地球的偶极磁场内观察到的情况非常相似，证实地壳磁场类似于一个微型磁层。 <div>
Mars lacks a global intrinsic dipole field but possesses localized crustal fields, making it unique in the solar system. Recent observations revealed that electrons can be injected into the crustal fields, and exhibit drift-dispersed bursts due to the magnetic drift motion, which are characterized by increases or decreases in energy over time in the energy spectrum. However, the source of the drift-dispersed electrons and the mechanism of their injection into the crustal fields remains unclear. Here, by leveraging data from the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN mission, along with test-particle simulations, we reveal that the source of dispersed electrons is the precipitating electrons injected into the crustal fields via open field lines. These electrons display as dispersionless bursts near the source location, and as dispersed bursts as they drift away from the source. Thus, the dispersed electrons represent a later stage in the evolution of dispersionless electrons. This evolutionary process closely mirrors that observed within Earth’s dipole field, affirming that the crustal fields function similarly to a mini-magnetosphere.

We investigate the migration of low-mass protoplanets embedded in dust–gas coupled protoplanetary disks. Linear calculations are performed with respect to the Nakagawa–Sekiya–Hayashi (NSH) equilibrium within a shearing sheet. We find that the dusty quasi-drift mode dominates the dynamical behaviors in close proximity to the protoplanet. This mode exhibits an extremely short radial wavelength, characterized by a dispersion relation of . The emergence of this mode leads to a wake with a short radial length scale ahead of protoplanets, contributing to a positive torque, termed as “streaming torque” (ST). Furthermore, both Lindblad torque and corotation torque are affected by the NSH velocity. The total torque and planetary migration are contingent upon the coupling strength between dust and gas. In most scenarios, ST predominates, inducing outward migration for planets, thereby addressing the issue of rapid inward migration in their formation paradigm.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The Doppler beaming effect, induced by the reflex motion of stars, introduces flux modulations and serves as an efficient method to photometrically determine mass functions for a large number of close binary systems, particularly those involving compact objects. In order to convert observed beaming-flux variations into a radial-velocity curve, precise determination of the beaming factor is essential. Previously, this factor was calculated as a constant, assuming a power-law profile for stellar spectra. In this study, we present a novel approach to directly compute this factor. Our new method not only simplifies the computation, especially for blue bands and cool stars, but also enables us to evaluate whether the relationship between beaming flux and radial velocity can be accurately described as linear. We develop a Python code and compute a comprehensive beaming-factor table for commonly used filter systems covering main-sequence, subgiant, and giant stars, as well as hot subdwarf and white dwarf stars. Both the code and our table are archived and publicly available on Zenodo: doi:10.5281/zenodo.13049419.

<title>The Landscape of Thermal Transients from Supernovae Interacting with a Circumstellar Medium</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The interaction of supernova ejecta with a surrounding circumstellar medium (CSM) generates a strong shock, which can convert ejecta kinetic energy into observable radiation. Given the diversity of potential CSM structures (arising from diverse mass-loss processes such as late-stage stellar outbursts, binary interaction, and winds), the resulting transients can display a wide range of light-curve morphologies. We provide a framework for classifying the transients arising from interaction with a spherical CSM shell. The light curves are decomposed into five consecutive phases, starting from the onset of interaction and extending through shock breakout and subsequent shock cooling. The relative prominence of each phase in the light curve is determined by two dimensionless quantities representing the CSM-to-ejecta mass ratio η, and the breakout parameter ξ. These two parameters define four light-curve morphology classes, where each class is characterized by the location of the shock breakout and the degree of deceleration as the shock sweeps up the CSM. We compile analytic scaling relations connecting the luminosity and duration of each light-curve phase to the physical parameters. We then run a grid of radiation hydrodynamics simulations for a wide range of ejecta and CSM parameters to numerically explore the landscape of interaction light curves, and to calibrate and confirm the analytic scalings. We connect our theoretical framework to several case studies of observed transients, highlighting the relevance in explaining slow-rising and superluminous supernovae, fast blue optical transients, and double-peaked light curves.

该研究提出了一种层次贝叶斯流程BP3M，用于测量Hubble Space Telescope（HST）图像和Gaia之间的跨匹配源的位置、视差和恒星固有运动（PM），甚至对于稀疏的场景（每幅图像的N* < 10）。该技术利用Gaia测量的天文测量作为先验来预测HST图像中源的位置，因此能够在不使用背景星系/QSO的情况下将HST图像放入全局参考框架中。通过在佛莱斯和德拉科矮星系中测试公开可用的代码，我们测量了20.5 < G < 21等级的PM，比Gaia DR3单独测量的PM精度中位数提高了8-13倍。我们能够利用合成数据来探讨BP3M天文测量对观测策略的影响，发现了一种在不增加PM不确定性的情况下改善视差和位置精度的最佳策略。在稀疏的COSMOS场景中使用1619幅HST图像（每幅图像中中位数为九个Gaia源），我们测量了2640个16 < G < 21.5等级范围内独特源的BP3M PM，其中25%没有Gaia PM；20.25 < G < 20.75等级的中位BP3M PM不确定性为0.44 mas yr−1，而Gaia的为1.03 mas yr−1；没有Gaia测量PM的源（20.75 < G < 21.5等级）的中位BP3M PM不确定性为1.16 mas yr−1。支持BP3M流程的统计数据是一种将不同图像、时代和望远镜的位置测量方式进行泛化的方法，这允许信息在调查和档案之间共享，实现比每个目录单独获得的更高天文测量精度。 <br /><br />总结: 本研究提出了一种BP3M层次贝叶斯流程，用来测量Hubble Space Telescope（HST）图像和Gaia之间的跨匹配源的位置、视差和恒星固有运动（PM）。该技术在稀疏场景中也能有效工作，并且通过公开可用的代码进行了测试。使用合成数据，发现了一种改善视差和位置精度的最佳策略。在实际场景中的测试证实，BP3M PM的精度要比 Gaia DR3 高出数倍，尤其在一些等级的情况下差异尤为明显。该技术的统计手段可以将不同来源的数据进行统一处理，从而提高了天文测量的精度。 <div>
We present a hierarchical Bayesian pipeline, BP3M, that measures positions, parallaxes, and proper motions (PMs) for cross-matched sources between Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images and Gaia—even for sparse fields (N* < 10 per image)—expanding from the recent GaiaHub tool. This technique uses Gaia-measured astrometry as priors to predict the locations of sources in HST images, and is therefore able to put the HST images onto a global reference frame without the use of background galaxies/QSOs. Testing our publicly available code in the Fornax and Draco dwarf spheroidal galaxies, we measure PMs that are a median of 8–13 times more precise than Gaia DR3 alone for 20.5 < G < 21 mag. We are able to explore the effect of observation strategies on BP3M astrometry using synthetic data, finding an optimal strategy to improve parallax and position precision at no cost to the PM uncertainty. Using 1619 HST images in the sparse COSMOS field (median nine Gaia sources per HST image), we measure BP3M PMs for 2640 unique sources in the 16 < G < 21.5 mag range, 25% of which have no Gaia PMs; the median BP3M PM uncertainty for 20.25 < G < 20.75 mag sources is 0.44 mas yr−1 compared to 1.03 mas yr−1 from Gaia, while the median BP3M PM uncertainty for sources without Gaia-measured PMs (20.75 < G < 21.5 mag) is 1.16 mas yr−1. The statistics that underpin the BP3M pipeline are a generalized way of combining position measurements from different images, epochs, and telescopes, which allows information to be shared between surveys and archives to achieve higher astrometric precision than that from each catalog alone.

We perform the first magnetic field strength survey of Class I and Flat Spectrum (FS) sources using K-band observations with iSHELL. We obtained new observations of 42 Class I and FS sources and additionally included 10 sources from the archive. We detect photospheric lines in 44 of the sources, in addition to Brγ, H2, and CO emission in several objects. We model the photospheric absorption lines of 32 Class I and FS sources and measure their magnetic field strengths, K-band temperatures, gravities, projected rotational velocities, and infrared veiling values. We put the physical properties of Class I and FS sources in context by comparing them to the values derived for a sample of Class II sources. We find that (a) the average magnetic field strength of Class I and FS sources 〈B〉 = 2.0 ± 0.15 kG is consistent with the average magnetic field strength of Class II sources 〈B〉 = 1.8 ± 0.15 kG, and (b) the average gravity of Class I and FS objects is lower than the average gravity of Class II sources , although there is significant overlap between both gravity distributions. Furthermore, using stellar evolutionary models, we deduce that Class I and FS sources have a median age of ∼0.6 Myr, and are, as a group, younger than the Class II stars with a median age of ∼3 Myr. Our results confirm that Class I and FS sources host strong magnetic fields on their photospheres. Thus, it is likely that these sources accrete disk material through a magnetosphere similar to the more evolved T Tauri stars.

<div> 开源工具，吸收线特征，冷气体，模拟研究，吸收线观测

总结:<br /><br />CloudFlex是一个开源工具，用于预测星系暗云中冷气体吸收线的特征，可以根据多个参数设置模拟吸收线的质量、大小和速度分布。使用该工具可以预测在星系周围形成的吸收线分布，得出了一些结论，例如随着云团数密度和复杂结构尺寸的减小，具有相同金属丰度的观测视线中等效宽度小于0.3 Å的出现频率显著增加。这个工具还可以帮助详细约束构成光电离星系周围介质的结构大小和速度分布。 <div>
We present CloudFlex, an open-source tool for predicting absorption-line signatures of cool gas in galaxy halos with small-scale structure. Motivated by analyses of ∼104 K material in hydrodynamical simulations of turbulent, multiphase media, we model cool gas structures as complexes of cloudlets sampled from a power-law distribution of mass with velocities drawn from a turbulent velocity field. The user may specify α, the lower limit of the cloudlet mass distribution ( ), and several other parameters that set the mass, size, and velocity distribution of the complex. This permits investigation of the relation between these parameters and absorption-line observables. As a proof-of-concept, we calculate the Mg iiλ2796 absorption induced by the cloudlets in background quasi-stellar object (QSO) spectra. We demonstrate that, at fixed metallicity, the covering fraction of sight lines with equivalent widths W2796 < 0.3 Å increases significantly with decreasing , cloudlet number density (ncl), and complex size. We then use this framework to predict the halo-scale W2796 distribution around ∼L* galaxies. We show that the observed incidences of W2796 > 0.3 Å sight lines with impact parameters 10 kpc < R⊥ < 50 kpc in projected QSO–galaxy studies are consistent with our model over much of parameter space. However, they are underpredicted by models with and ncl ≥ 0.03 cm−3, in keeping with a picture in which the inner cool circumgalactic medium (CGM) is dominated by numerous low-mass cloudlets (mcl ≲ 100M⊙) with a volume filling factor ≲1%. When used to model absorption-line data sets built from multi-sight line and/or spatially extended background probes, CloudFlex enables detailed constraints on the size and velocity distributions of structures comprising the photoionized CGM.

<div> 高磁化中子星、地壳地震、等离子波动、能量传输、磁层
总结：<br /><br />这项研究模拟了磁星磁层中的相对论等离子波相互作用。磁场弯曲时，观察到阿尔芬波不断转换为快磁声波。转换效率在赤道区域可以高达三倍。阿尔芬波生成的快磁声波频率是其两倍。快磁声波呈周期性地由阿尔芬波转换而成，形成磁层阿尔芬波穿越时间的变化。这种快磁声波尾部携带了大部分（一半）总能量。磁星地壳对“反弹”阿尔芬波的塑性阻尼对快磁声波效率的影响很小。我们讨论了识别出的波动现象对磁星观测的影响。外向的快磁声波可以产生电区，是相干辐射的潜在来源。长波长的快磁声波可能通过光圈外的重连产生快速射电爆发。 <div>
Crustal quakes of highly magnetized neutron stars can disrupt their magnetospheres, triggering energetic phenomena like X-ray and fast radio bursts. Understanding plasma wave dynamics in these extreme environments is vital for predicting energy transport across scales to the radiation length. This study models relativistic plasma wave interaction in magnetar magnetospheres with force-free electrodynamics simulations. For propagation along curved magnetic field lines, we observe the continuous conversion of Alfvén waves to fast magnetosonic (FMS) waves. The conversion efficiency can be up to three times higher when counter-propagating Alfvén waves interact in the equatorial region. Alfvén waves generate FMS waves of twice their frequency during their first crossing of the magnetosphere. After the initial transient burst of FMS waves, Alfvén waves convert to FMS waves periodically, generating variations on timescales of the magnetospheric Alfvén wave crossing time. This decaying FMS wave tail carries a significant portion (half) of the total energy emitted. Plastic damping of “bouncing” Alfvén waves by the magnetar crust has minimal impact on the FMS efficiency. We discuss the implications of the identified wave phenomena for magnetar observations. Outgoing FMS waves can develop electric zones, potential sources of coherent radiation. Long wavelength FMS waves could generate FRBs through reconnection beyond the light cylinder.

1. 通过VLA和ALMA进行了SDSS J090122.37+181432.3的射电观测，得到了1.4 GHz和3 GHz连续谱以及1.2 mm连续谱和CO(7–6)以及C i(3P2→3P1)线的数据。
2. 利用VLA的积分通量密度将射电谱分解为自由—自由（FF）和非热成分，并与红外—射电相关参数一致，进一步得到了不受尘埃消光影响的射电连续谱推导的星形成率（SFR）。
3. 从C i(3P2→3P1)线估算得到了气体质量为（1.2 ± 0.2) × 1011M☉，与先前的CO(1–0)得到的气体质量一致。
4. 利用新的红外和射电连续谱数据来绘制SFR地图，评估了Schmidt-Kennicutt关系在∼kpc尺度上对SFR和气体追踪剂选择的依赖性。
5. 对于像J0901这样的星系，Schmidt-Kennicutt关系的斜率在使用CO(7–6)或C i(3P2→3P1)来追踪气体质量时最为平坦，这表明这些跃迁不适合追踪星系中大多数的分子气体。 <br />
总结:<br />这项研究利用射电和红外观测技术对星系SDSS J090122.37+181432.3进行了详细研究。通过将射电谱分解为不同成分，得到了不受尘埃消光影响的星形成率，并估算了气体质量。研究还评估了SFR和气体追踪剂选择对Schmidt-Kennicutt关系的影响。结果表明，采用不同的SFR追踪剂会得到不同的结果，而CO(7–6)或C i(3P2→3P1)不适合追踪星系中大多数的分子气体。 <div>
We report new radio observations of SDSS J090122.37+181432.3, a strongly lensed star-forming galaxy at z = 2.26. We image 1.4 GHz (L-band) and 3 GHz (S-band) continuum using the Very Large Array (VLA) and 1.2 mm (band 6) continuum with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, in addition to the CO(7–6) and C i(3P2→3P1) lines, all at ≲1.″7 resolution. Based on the VLA integrated flux densities, we decompose the radio spectrum into its free–free (FF) and nonthermal components. The infrared–radio correlation parameter is consistent with expectations for star-forming galaxies. We obtain radio continuum-derived star formation rates (SFRs) that are free of dust extinction, finding , , and from the FF emission, nonthermal emission, and when accounting for both emission processes, respectively, in agreement with previous results. We estimate the gas mass from the C i(3P2→3P1) line as Mgas = (1.2 ± 0.2) × 1011M☉, which is consistent with prior CO(1–0)-derived gas masses. Using our new IR and radio continuum data to map the SFR, we assess the dependence of the Schmidt–Kennicutt relation on choices of SFR and gas tracer for ∼kpc scales. The different SFR tracers yield different slopes, with the IR being the steepest, potentially due to highly obscured star formation in J0901. The radio continuum maps have the lowest slopes and overall fidelity for mapping the SFR, despite producing consistent total SFRs. We also find that the Schmidt–Kennicutt relation slope is flattest when using CO(7–6) or C i(3P2→3P1) to trace gas mass, suggesting that those transitions are not suitable for tracing the bulk molecular gas in galaxies like J0901.

<div> C2H4O2 isomers, abundance ratios, star-forming regions, gas-grain hot-core chemical model, ice-mantle desorption
总结:
C2H4O2异构体在星形成区域的丰度比通常为甲酸甲酯（MF）、乙二醛（GA）和乙酸（AA）的比值约为100:10:1。但最近在NGC 6334I巨大原核团中观察到了一种未能解释的偏离这种关系的现象，其中一些源显示出极端的MF：GA比率，导致不同源之间产生双峰行为，而MF：AA比率保持稳定。研究使用三相气相-颗粒热核化学模型来研究模拟的C2H4O2丰度对大量参数空间的影响。在冰盖解吸附（∼125–160 K)过程中，高气体密度和长时间尺度似乎是高MF:GA比率的物理原因。在这些条件下，GA破坏的主要化学机制是冰面上原子H的快速吸附和反应，使得它没有时间解吸附。 MF和GA在水冰上的不同结合能对表面破坏机制的选择性至关重要。个别MF分子在水分失去时迅速逃逸冰面，而GA滞留并被H破坏。适度提高宇宙射线电离速率可以增加冰中的“复杂有机分子”（COM）产量并增加MF：GA比率，但极端值对气相COMs有破坏性。我们推测，需要极端MF：GA比率的高密度可能是COM由星周盘中脱附的COM主导的排放的证据。 <div>
Gas-phase abundance ratios between C2H4O2 isomers methyl formate (MF), glycolaldehyde (GA), and acetic acid (AA) are typically on the order of 100:10:1 in star-forming regions. However, an unexplained divergence from this neat relationship was recently observed toward a collection of sources in the massive protocluster NGC 6334I; some sources exhibited extreme MF:GA ratios, producing a bimodal behavior between different sources, while the MF:AA ratio remained stable. Here, we use a three-phase gas-grain hot-core chemical model to study the effects of a large parameter space on the simulated C2H4O2 abundances. A combination of high gas densities and long timescales during ice-mantle desorption (∼125–160 K) appears to be the physical cause of the high MF:GA ratios. The main chemical mechanism for GA destruction occurring under these conditions is the rapid adsorption and reaction of atomic H with GA on the ice surfaces before it has time to desorb. The different binding energies of MF and GA on water ice are crucial to the selectivity of the surface destruction mechanism; individual MF molecules rapidly escape the surface when exposed by water loss, while GA lingers and is destroyed by H. Moderately elevated cosmic-ray ionization rates can increase absolute levels of “complex organic molecule” (COM) production in the ices and increase the MF:GA ratio, but extreme values are destructive for gas-phase COMs. We speculate that the high densities required for extreme MF:GA ratios could be evidence of COM emission dominated by COMs desorbing within a circumstellar disk.

总结:
Cepheid AW Per是多重系统中的一个组件，具有长周期轨道。 Griffin的径向速度很好地覆盖了38年的轨道。在Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy阵列的干涉测量显示了长周期轨道。此外，哈勃太空望远镜在紫外线高分辨率光谱中显示，伴星本身也是一个具有几乎相等质量的双星系统。这些数据结合来自Gaia的距离提供了Cepheid（主星）的质量M1 = 6.79 ± 0.85 M⊙。次星的组合质量为MS = 8.79 ± 0.50 M⊙。在大约两年后预计将根据Gaia第四次数据发布改善质量的精度。 <div>
The Cepheid AW Per is a component in a multiple system with a long-period orbit. The radial velocities of Griffin cover the 38 yr orbit well. An extensive program of interferometry with the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy array is reported here, from which the long-period orbit is determined. In addition, a Hubble Space Telescope high-resolution spectrum in the ultraviolet demonstrates that the companion is itself a binary with nearly equal-mass components. These data combined with a distance from Gaia provide a mass of the Cepheid (primary) of M1 = 6.79 ± 0.85 M⊙. The combined mass of the secondary is MS = 8.79 ± 0.50 M⊙. The accuracy of the mass will be improved after the fourth Gaia data release, expected in approximately two years.

The High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Gamma-Ray Observatory, located on the side of the Sierra Negra volcano in Mexico, has been fully operational since 2015. The HAWC collaboration has recently significantly improved their extensive air shower reconstruction algorithms, which has notably advanced the observatory performance. The energy resolution for primary gamma rays with energies below 1 TeV was improved by including a noise-suppression algorithm. Corrections have also been made to systematic errors in direction fitting related to the detector and shower plane inclinations, biases in highly inclined showers, and enhancements to the core reconstruction. The angular resolution for gamma rays approaching the HAWC array from large zenith angles (>37°) has improved by a factor of 4 at the highest energies (>70 TeV) as compared to previous reconstructions. The inclusion of a lateral distribution function fit to the extensive air shower footprint on the array to separate gamma-ray primaries from cosmic-ray ones based on the resulting χ2 values improved the background rejection performance at all inclinations. At large zenith angles, the improvement in significance is a factor of 4 compared to previous HAWC publications. These enhancements have been verified by observing the Crab Nebula, which is an overhead source for the HAWC Observatory. We show that the sensitivity to Crab-like point sources (E−2.63) with locations overhead to 30° zenith is comparable to or less than 10% of the Crab Nebula’s flux between 2 and 50 TeV. Thanks to these improvements, HAWC can now detect more sources, including the Galactic center.

<div> GHZ2/GLASS-z12, 红移 z = 12.34, NIRSpec PRISM, 光谱线, 星系形成 <br />
总结:
该研究通过NIRCam光度测定和NIRSpec PRISM光谱，确认了红移为z = 12.34的GHZ2/GLASS-z12星系的存在。光谱显示出了N iv, C iv, He ii, O iii, C iii, O ii和Ne iii线的探测，并首次在高红移处探测到3133 Å静止波长的O iii Bowen荧光线。在极端C iv发射体类别中，GHZ2因其明显的C iv线和等效宽度（EW）约为46 Å而被归类为极端C iv发射体。GHZ2显示出的UV线等效宽度只在低/中红移处的活动星系核（AGNs）或复合天体中发现。UV线强度比与低金属环境中的AGNs和星际物质形成具有兼容性，使得[Ne iv]/[N iv]比的下限更加支持光致辐射光子的恒星起源。研究者讨论了一种可能的情景，即高电离输出是由低金属环境中形成的恒星所致。他们估计了金属丰度≲0.1 Z/Z⊙，电离参数log U > −2，氮/氧丰度是太阳值的4-5倍，并且碳/氧比例是类似于最近发现的氮增强天体的次太阳值。考虑其丰度模式和高恒星质量密度（104M⊙ pc−2），GHZ2是今天球状星团的祖先的理想形成地点。GHZ2的显着亮度使其成为了解大爆炸后仅360百万年内星系形成物理学的“罗塞塔石”。 <div>
We spectroscopically confirm the MUV = −20.5 mag galaxy GHZ2/GLASS-z12 to be at redshift z = 12.34. The source was selected via NIRCam photometry in GLASS-JWST Early Release Science data, providing the first evidence of a surprising abundance of bright galaxies at z ≳ 10. The NIRSpec PRISM spectrum shows detections of N iv, C iv, He ii, O iii, C iii, O ii, and Ne iii lines and the first detection at high redshift of the O iii Bowen fluorescence line at 3133 Å rest frame. The prominent C iv line with rest-frame equivalent width (EW) ≈ 46 Å puts GHZ2 in the category of extreme C iv emitters. GHZ2 displays UV lines with EWs that are only found in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) or composite objects at low/intermediate redshifts. The UV line-intensity ratios are compatible with both AGNs and star formation in a low-metallicity environment, with the low limit on the [Ne iv]/[N iv] ratio favoring a stellar origin of the ionizing photons. We discuss a possible scenario in which the high ionizing output is due to low-metallicity stars forming in a dense environment. We estimate a metallicity ≲0.1 Z/Z⊙, a high ionization parameter log U > −2, a N/O abundance 4–5 times the solar value, and a subsolar C/O ratio similar to the recently discovered class of nitrogen-enhanced objects. Considering its abundance patterns and the high stellar mass density (104M⊙ pc−2), GHZ2 is an ideal formation site for the progenitors of today's globular clusters. The remarkable brightness of GHZ2 makes it a “Rosetta stone” for understanding the physics of galaxy formation within just 360 Myr after the Big Bang.

<div> 关键词：磁化盘风，非理想磁流体力学，线性摄动理论，对称模式，反对称模式

总结：
磁化盘风和风驱动堆积是原行星盘的重要且受到密切研究的扩散机制，但这些机制的稳定性尚未得到充分研究。本文利用半解析的线性摄动理论，应用非理想磁流体力学，重点关注磁扩散率在盘面到表面变化几个数量级的盘模型。线性模式通过其相对于中平面的对称性加以区分。这些模式具有定性不同的增长率：对称模式几乎总是衰减，而至少一个反对称模式总是具有正增长率。这一增长率随着盘中柱状半径R的增加快速下降，比开普勒角速度更陡，并且在基准盘模型中比例为R-5/2。反对称模式的增长打破了盘赤道平面的反射对称性，甚至在没有霍尔效应的情况下也可能发生。在完全发展的反对称模式发生的盘区域，只出现在盘的一侧的堆积流，而在另一侧只出现盘风。这可能解释一些观察到的原行星盘流的不对称性。 <br /><br /> <div>
Magnetized disk winds and wind-driven accretion are an essential and intensively studied dispersion mechanism of protoplanetary disks (PPDs). However, the stability of these mechanisms has yet to be adequately examined. This paper employs semi-analytic linear perturbation theories under nonideal magnetohydrodynamics, focusing on disk models whose magnetic diffusivities vary by a few orders of magnitude from the disk midplane to its surface. Linear modes are distinguished by their symmetry with respect to the midplane. These modes have qualitatively different growth rates: symmetric modes almost always decay, while at least one antisymmetric mode always has a positive growth rate. This growth rate decreases faster than the Keplerian angular velocity with cylindrical radius R in the disk and scales steeper than R−5/2 in the fiducial disk model. The growth of antisymmetric modes breaks the reflection symmetry across the disk equatorial plane, and may occur even in the absence of the Hall effect. In the disk regions where fully developed antisymmetric modes occur, accretion flows appear only on one side of the disk, while disk winds occur only on the other. This may explain the asymmetry of some observed PPD outflows.

<br /><br />总结: 该研究对Seyfert 1星系Mrk 817进行了多波段观测，发现其窄的UV吸收线受到X射线遮挡物的影响，但总柱密度未发生改变。通过调整后的电离参数推测出流离子化参数对氢电离辐射通量变化的影响，同时确定了吸收流的位置和横截面尺寸。 <div>
We observed the Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk 817 during an intensive multiwavelength reverberation mapping campaign for 16 months. Here, we examine the behavior of narrow UV absorption lines seen in the Hubble Space Telescope/Cosmic Origins Spectrograph spectra, both during the campaign and in other epochs extending over 14 yr. We conclude that, while the narrow absorption outflow system (at −3750 km s−1 with FWHM = 177 km s−1) responds to the variations of the UV continuum as modified by the X-ray obscurer, its total column density (log NH = 19.5 cm−2) did not change across all epochs. The adjusted ionization parameter (scaled with respect to the variations in the hydrogen-ionizing continuum flux) is log UH = −1.0 . The outflow is located at a distance smaller than 38 pc from the central source, which implies a hydrogen density of nH > 3000 cm−3. The absorption outflow system only covers the continuum emission source and not the broad emission line region, which suggests that its transverse size is small (< 1016 cm), with potential cloud geometries ranging from spherical to elongated along the line of sight.

We report the detection of Lyman-continuum (LyC) photons from a massive interacting system at z = 1.097 in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. The LyC detection is made in the far-ultraviolet F154W band of the UVIT telescope on board AstroSat. Both JWST and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging of the system reveal signs that it is a likely merger. In particular, high-resolution imaging in the JWST bands reveals an infrared-luminous object within the system that is faint in the bluer HST bands. The ionized gas kinematics from the MUSE-UDF data supports the merger hypothesis. We estimate that the entire system is leaking more than 8% of its ionizing photons to the intergalactic medium. The spectral-energy-distribution-derived stellar masses of the two components indicate that this is a major merger with a mass ratio of 1.13 ± 0.37. This detection hints at the potential contribution of massive interacting systems at higher redshifts, when major mergers were more frequent, to the ionizing budget of the Universe.

<div> 关键词：星际物质丰度，行星状星云，恒星前身，巨星分支，红巨星分支<br />
<br />总结: 本研究对比了银河系行星状星云（PNe）和它们的恒星前身（红巨星分支和渐近巨星分支，AGB恒星）的元素丰度，以探索并量化由于AGB演化或凝结到颗粒上导致的预期差异。作者通过文献调研获取了星云丰度数据，使用了APOGEE DR 17调查数据作为恒星样本。研究了星云和恒星样本之间共同的元素，即C、N、O、Fe和S。结果表明，PNe中的铁主要被封存在颗粒中，硫也可能轻微耗尽，而氮和碳则富集。这些结果对未来的银河系和外星系研究比较星云和恒星样本将具有重要意义。 <div>
We research the elemental abundances in Galactic planetary nebulae (PNe) compared with those of their stellar progenitors (red giant branch and asymptotic giant branch, AGB, stars), to explore and quantify the expected—i.e., due to AGB evolution or condensation onto grains—differences. We gleaned the current literature for the nebular abundances while we used the APOGEE DR 17 survey data for the stellar sample. We examined the elements in common between the nebular and stellar samples, namely, C, N, O, Fe, and S. We confirm that iron in PNe is mostly entrapped in grains, with an average depletion 〈D[Fe/H]〉 = 1.741 ± 0.486 dex, and we disclose a weak correlation between iron depletion and the [O/H] abundance, D[Fe/H] = (6.6003 ± 2.443) × [O/H] + (1.972 ± 0.199). Sulfur may also be mildly depleted in PNe, with 〈D[S/H]〉 = 0.179 ± 0.291 dex. We also found an indication of nitrogen enrichment for PNe 〈E[N/H]〉 = 0.393 ± 0.421 dex, with maximum enrichment (0.980 ± 0.243) occurring for the PNe whose progenitors have gone through the hot-bottom burning. The carbon enrichment is 〈E[C/H]〉 = 0.337 ± 0.463 dex when measured for the general PN populations. Our results will be relevant for future Galactic and extragalactic studies comparing nebular and stellar samples.

<div> 关键词: Andromeda XIX, Keck II telescope, chemical abundances, tidal stripping, tidal interactions

总结: 
Andromeda XIX是M31的一个异常卫星星系，其光度类似于Sextans等矮球状星系，但空间范围类似于超弥散星系。通过Keck II望远镜上的DEIMOS进行的中分辨率光谱测量，发现Andromeda XIX的金属丰度略高于当今局部星系团矮星系的金属丰度关系。这表明它可能经历了潮汐剥夺。同时，测量的化学丰度还显示出潮汐交互作用可能比星系合并更有可能是其形成的原因。其漫射结构和扰动的动力学特性也支持了这一观点。Overall, 这些研究结果表明了Andromeda XIX的形成可能是由潮汐影响引起的，而非星系合并。<br /><br /> <div>
With a luminosity similar to that of Milky Way dwarf spheroidal systems like Sextans, but a spatial extent similar to that of ultra-diffuse galaxies, Andromeda (And) XIX is an unusual satellite of M31. To investigate the origin of this galaxy, we measure chemical abundances for And XIX derived from medium-resolution (R ∼ 6000) spectra from the Deep Extragalactic Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph on the Keck II telescope. We coadd 79 red giant branch stars, grouped by photometric metallicity, in order to obtain a sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio to measure 20 [Fe/H] and [α/Fe] abundances via spectral synthesis. The latter are the first such measurements for And XIX. The mean metallicity we derive for And XIX places it ∼2σ higher than the present-day stellar mass–metallicity relation for Local Group dwarf galaxies, potentially indicating it has experienced tidal stripping. A loss of gas and associated quenching during such a process, which prevents the extended star formation necessary to produce shallow [α/Fe]–[Fe/H] gradients in massive systems, is also consistent with the steeply decreasing [α/Fe]–[Fe/H] trend we observe. In combination with the diffuse structure and disturbed kinematic properties of And XIX, this suggests tidal interactions, rather than galaxy mergers, are strong contenders for its formation.

<div> 光变星，δ Scuti 变星，光度关系，Gaia光度测量仪，旋转

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了δ Scuti变星与光度关系之间的关联，利用了来自NASA的TESS卫星的光变曲线数据以及Gaia光度测量仪的观测数据。通过对接近10万颗恒星的分析，发现大约15,918颗星符合δ Scuti变星的特征。并且在稳定带内的85%的变星被确认为δ Scuti变星，其余可能是混合型或γ Doradus变星。最后，文章还证实了旋转与δ Scuti星的脉动之间存在着相关性。 <div>
δ Scuti variables are found at the intersection of the classical instability strip and the main sequence on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram. With space-based photometry providing millions of light curves of A-F type stars, we can now probe the occurrence rate of δ Scuti pulsations in detail. Using the 30 minutes cadence light curves from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite's first 26 sectors, we identify variability in 103,810 stars within 5–24 cycles per day down to a magnitude of T = 11.25. We fit the period–luminosity relation of the fundamental radial mode for δ Scuti stars in the Gaia G band, allowing us to distinguish classical pulsators from contaminants for a subset of 39,367 stars. Out of this subset, over 15,918 are found on or above the expected period–luminosity relation. We derive an empirical red edge to the classical instability strip using Gaia photometry. The center where the pulsator fraction peaks at 50%–70%, combined with the red edge, agrees well with previous work in the Kepler field. While many variable sources are found below the period–luminosity relation, over 85% of sources inside of the classical instability strip derived in this work are consistent with being δ Scuti stars. The remaining 15% of variables within the instability strip are likely hybrid or γ Doradus pulsators. Finally, we discover strong evidence for a correlation between pulsator fraction and spectral line broadening from the Radial Velocity Spectrometer on board the Gaia spacecraft, confirming that rotation has a role in driving pulsations in δ Scuti stars.

在这篇文章中，研究人员利用高分辨率光谱技术在M13和M71星团的恒星中测定了锂的丰度。结果显示，这些星团中未演化的恒星的锂丰度范围相差4倍，这种差异被归因于初始角动量的差异，导致自旋减速、相关混合和锂的破坏。与其他星团中的主序星和转向星的类似结果进行了比较。这些星团的年龄跨度为3亿年，[Fe/H]的范围相差30倍。所有这些星团中未演化的恒星的锂丰度的最大值相同，对应于Li/H = 3.16 × 10−10，而根据氘丰度和Big Bang nucleosynthesis的预测，预期的锂丰度为5.24 × 10−10。<br /><br />总结: 文章研究了在宇宙诞生的前15分钟内产生的原始锂丰度，通过在球状星团中测量锂丰度，发现未演化的恒星的锂丰度存在差异，这被归因于初始角动量的不同导致了自旋减速、混合和锂的破坏。研究结果表明，这些星团中未演化的恒星的最大锂丰度相同，而预期的锂丰度却略高。 <div>
During Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) in the first 15 minutes of the Universe, some 7Li was created along with isotopes of H and He. The determination of that primordial value of Li can help constrain the conditions at that time. The oldest stars with known ages can be found in globular clusters which have well-determined ages through stellar evolution models. High-resolution spectra of Li have been obtained with the Keck I Telescope and HIRES in several unevolved stars in the clusters M13 and M71 with V magnitudes of 17.6–17.9. Abundances of Li have been determined with spectrum synthesis techniques and show a range of a factor of 4. We attribute that spread to differences in initial angular momentum resulting in different amounts of spin-down, related mixing, and destruction of Li. Our results are compared with similar results for main-sequence and turnoff stars in other globular clusters. The range in age of these clusters is 11.2–14.2 Gyr for an age span of 3 Gyr. These clusters range in [Fe/H] from −0.75 to −2.24 corresponding to a factor of 30 in metallicity. The maximum in the Li abundance for these unevolved stars in all eight clusters is the same corresponding to Li/H = 3.16 × 10−10, while the predicted Li abundance, based on the deuterium abundance and the BBN predictions, is 5.24 × 10−10.

<div> 星系、质量、尺寸、红移、近红外<br />
在这项研究中，使用JWST/NIRCam F277W和F444W成像数据，测量了约26,000个具有恒星质量M⋆ > 10^9M⊙的星系的Sérsic profile。发现在近红外的波段下，星系的有效半径普遍小于之前在光学波段下的测量结果，平均偏差为0.14 dex，而这种偏差与红移无显著相关性。星系在近红外的质量-尺寸关系比在光学波段下更为平缓，且在0.5 < z < 2.5的所有红移范围内都如此。此外，星系的尺寸演化规律在近红外与光学波段下基本一致，且具有相似的演化速率。具体来说，对于L*星系，尺寸演化速率为Re ∝ (1 + z)−0.7，对于质量较大的（M⋆ > 10^11M⊙）正在形成星系，则其尺寸演化速率几乎与静止星系相当。此外，质量较小的（M⋆ < 10^10M⊙）静止星系的尺寸演化速度则相当于正在形成星系。总的来说，结果表明过去20年来得出的尺寸演化结论，在使用JWST获得的近红外数据时并未发生根本性改变，这些数据更好地反映了恒星质量分布。 <br /><br />总结: 本研究利用JWST数据测量了近红外范围内约26,000个质量大于10^9M⊙的星系的Sérsic profiles，发现尺寸与质量的关系在近红外波段下比在光学波段下更为平缓，且在当前红移范围内这种情况持续存在。此外，研究还发现星系的尺寸演化规律在近红外与光学波段下基本一致，且有相似的演化速率。 <div>
We present the galaxy stellar mass–size relation in the rest-frame near-IR (1.5 μm) and its evolution with redshift up to z = 2.5. Sérsic profiles are measured for ∼26,000 galaxies with stellar masses M⋆ > 109M⊙ from JWST/NIRCam F277W and F444W imaging provided by the COSMOS-WEB and PRIMER surveys using coordinates, redshifts, colors, and stellar mass estimates from the COSMOS2020 catalog. The new rest-frame near-IR effective radii are generally smaller than previously measured rest-frame optical sizes, on average by 0.14 dex, with no significant dependence on redshift. For quiescent galaxies, this size offset does not depend on stellar mass, but for star-forming galaxies, the offset increases from −0.1 dex at M⋆ = 109.5M⊙ to −0.25 dex at M⋆ > 1011M⊙. That is, we find that the near-IR stellar mass–size relation for star-forming galaxies is flatter in the rest-frame near-IR than in the rest-frame optical at all redshifts 0.5 < z < 2.5. The general pace of size evolution is the same in the near-IR as previously demonstrated in the optical, with slower evolution (Re ∝ (1 + z)−0.7) for L* star-forming galaxies and faster evolution (Re ∝ (1 + z)−1.3) for L* quiescent galaxies. Massive (M⋆ > 1011M⊙) star-forming galaxies evolve in size almost as fast as quiescent galaxies. Low-mass (M⋆ < 1010M⊙) quiescent galaxies evolve as slow as star-forming galaxies. Our main conclusion is that the size evolution narrative as it has emerged over the past two decades does not radically change when accessing the rest-frame near-IR with JWST, a better proxy of the underlying stellar mass distribution.

<div> Event Horizon Telescope, EHT, circular polarization, Sgr A*, M87*

这篇文章主要对通过Event Horizon Telescope（EHT）观测到的Sgr A*和M87*等源的模型进行了研究比较。研究使用了多个波长、分辨率、偏振和时间间隔的观测来约束模型。通过对一个包含各种模型的库进行圆偏振测量对比，发现Atacama大型毫米/亚毫米阵列(ALMA)对Sgr A*的观测结果与所有边缘模型都不一致。在研究Sgr A*的MAD模型中，发现只有指向远离观测者的磁偶极矩模型与ALMA数据一致。此外，还发现在27个通过模型中有26个转向顺时针旋转的快速增长模型。研究还提供了所有模型参数均值、标准差及其趋势的表格。

<br /><br />总结:
1. 通过EHT观测的Sgr A*和M87*等源的模型进行了比较。
2. 使用多种观测数据约束模型，包括波长、分辨率、偏振和时间间隔。
3. ALMA观测结果与边缘模型不一致，MAD模型中只有指向远离观测者的磁偶极矩模型与观测数据一致。
4. 26个通过模型中有转向顺时针旋转的快速增长模型。
5. 研究提供了所有模型参数均值、标准差及其趋势的表格。 <div>
Models of the resolved Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) sources Sgr A* and M87* are constrained by observations at multiple wavelengths, resolutions, polarizations, and time cadences. In this paper, we compare unresolved circular polarization (CP) measurements to a library of models, where each model is characterized by a distribution of CP over time. In the library, we vary the spin of the black hole, the magnetic field strength at the horizon (i.e., both SANE and magnetically arrested disk or MAD models), the observer inclination, a parameter for the maximum ion–electron temperature ratio assuming a thermal plasma, and the direction of the magnetic field dipole moment. We find that Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of Sgr A* are inconsistent with all edge-on (i = 90°) models. Restricting attention to the MAD models favored by earlier EHT studies of Sgr A*, we find that only models with magnetic dipole moment pointing away from the observer are consistent with ALMA data. We also note that in 26 of the 27 passing MAD models, the accretion flow rotates clockwise on the sky. We provide a table of the means and standard deviations of the CP distributions for all model parameters, along with their trends.

这篇研究对明亮的GRB 231129C进行了详细的时间综合和时间分辨光谱分析。结果显示其具有独特的光谱特征，具有硬低能谱指数(α)和软高能谱指数(β)，类似于GRB 090902B，表明可能主要是热辐射。进一步分析显示92%的光谱指数超过了同步辐射的“死线”，最硬的指数为α∼+0.44。同时，53%的光谱可以很好地符合非耗散光球模型，支持可能起源于非耗散光球。此外，我们观察到光谱指数α与峰值能量Ep与通量之间存在强相关性。对于α−F关系，我们使用F=F0e(3.00±0.10)α来描述，而Ep−F关系需要一个平滑弯曲的幂律函数。基于Hascoët等人和Gao & Zhang提出的框架，研究了这次爆发的射流特性，结果显示这两种方法都支持纯火球模型在较小的初始射流半径下适用于这次GRB。

This study presents detailed time-integrated and time-resolved spectral analysis of the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor observations of the bright GRB 231129C. The results reveal its distinct spectral characteristics, featuring a hard low-energy spectral index (α) and soft high-energy spectral index (β), similar to GRB 090902B, suggesting a possible dominance of thermal emission. Further analysis indicates that 92% of the spectral indices exceed the synchrotron “line of death,” with the hardest index at α ∼ +0.44. Simultaneously, 53% of the spectra can be well fitted by the nondissipative photosphere model, supporting a potential origin from a nondissipative photosphere. Additionally, we observe strong correlations between the spectral index α and peak energy Ep with flux. For the α−F relationship, we employ F = F0e(3.00±0.10)α to describe it, whereas the Ep−F relationship requires a smoothly bending power-law function. Based on the framework proposed by Hascoët et al. and Gao & Zhang, the jet characteristics of this burst were studied, revealing that both methods support the suitability of a pure fireball model for this GRB at small initial jet radii.

<div> M dwarf stars, habitable planets, water loss, super-Earths, planetary mass
<br /><br />总结:
M矮星周围的超级地球可能是宇宙中最常见的适居行星。然而，它们的宜居性受到宿主恒星强烈辐射的威胁，导致水流失并可能导致地表干涸。模拟结果表明，质量为1-8M⊕的地球类行星在M矮星的宜居带中，能量限制性的水流失随着行星质量的增加而减少，而扩散限制性的水流失则随质量增加而增加。初始拥有更多水的行星最终可能成为无暴露大陆的水世界，而初始水更少的行星在5亿年后可能出现地表干涸。此外，更大的行星会在地幔中储存更多的水。处于宜居带内缘的超级地球往往最终成为水世界或干涸的行星，只有初始水储量在一定范围内的情况下才能形成类似地球的地表。 <div>
Super-Earths orbiting M dwarf stars may be the most common habitable planets in the Universe. However, their habitability is threatened by intense irradiation from their host stars, which drives the escape of water to space and can lead to surface desiccation. We present simulation results of a box model incorporating deep-water cycling between interior and atmosphere and water loss to space for terrestrial planets of mass 1–8 M⊕ orbiting in the habitable zone of a late M dwarf. Energy-limited loss decreases with planetary mass, while diffusion-limited loss increases with mass. Depending on where it orbits in the habitable zone, a 1 M⊕ planet that starts with 3–8 Earth Oceans can end up with an Earthlike surface of oceans and exposed continents; for an 8 M⊕ super-Earth, that range is 3–12 Earth Oceans. Planets initialized with more water end up as waterworlds with no exposed continents, while planets that start with less water have desiccated surfaces by 5 Gyr. Since the mantles of terrestrial planets can hold much more water than is currently present in Earth’s atmosphere, none of our simulations result in Dune planets—such planets may be less common than previously thought. Further, more water becomes sequestered within the mantle for larger planets. A super-Earth at the inner edge of the habitable zone tends to end up as either a waterworld or with a desiccated surface; only a narrow range of initial water inventory yields an Earthlike surface.

<div> Parker Solar Probe, Encounter 15, slow-speed solar wind, sub-Alfvénic, coronal heating

总结:<br /><br />在Parker Solar Probe第15次接触期间，观测到了近亚音速和亚阿尔文尼速度的太阳风，具有极端的性质，标志着Parker探测器最深入太阳冠层内部的探测。通过多点观测和宇宙风暴对流分析，确认了这一慢速太阳风是来自活跃区域、持续存在且具有极端空间天气影响潜力的稳定结构。针对该太阳风的湍流分析显示其性质与先前观测到的太阳风相似。因此，这一极端低动压太阳风区间是在至少到达1天文单位距离的大型稳定结构。 <div>
During Parker Solar Probe (Parker) Encounter 15 (E15), we observe an 18 hr period of near-subsonic (MS ∼ 1) and sub-Alfvénic (SA), MA ⋘ 1, slow-speed solar wind from 22 to 15.6 R⊙. As the most extreme SA interval measured to date and skirting the solar wind sonic point, it is the deepest Parker has probed into the formation and acceleration region of the solar wind in the corona. The stream is also measured by Wind and the Magnetosonic Multiscale mission near 1 au at times consistent with ballistic propagation of this slow stream. We investigate the stream source, properties, and potential coronal heating consequences via combining these observations with coronal modeling and turbulence analysis. Through source mapping, in situ evidence, and multipoint arrival time considerations of a candidate coronal mass ejection, we determine the stream is a steady (nontransient), long-lived, and approximately Parker spiral aligned and arises from overexpanded field lines mapping back to an active region. Turbulence analysis of the Elsässer variables shows the inertial range scaling of the z+ mode (f ∼ −3/2) to be dominated by the slab component. We discuss the spectral flattening and difficulties associated with measuring the z− spectra, cautioning against making definitive conclusions from the z− mode. Despite being more extreme than prior SA intervals, its turbulent nature does not appear to be qualitatively different from previously observed streams. We conclude that this extreme low-dynamic-pressure solar wind interval (which has the potential for extreme space-weather conditions) is a large, steady structure spanning at least to 1 au.

<div> 关键词: 涡流、原行星盘、磁场结构、气体动力学、粒子聚集

总结: 
涡流在原行星盘中起着重要作用，对其的存在和程度进行了探讨。研究表明，即使在中心恒星1-30天文单位处，气体湍流可以通过磁场传输角动量。气体速度波动在盘的不同高度呈现不同的范围，且与初始磁场强度有关。然而，湍流速度似乎不强烈依赖于磁场极性，因此对霍尔效应不敏感。盘中面的湍流可以驱动尘埃颗粒达到超过其破碎限的碰撞速度，可能减少了中面粒子聚集的有效性。然而，尚不清楚这种程度的湍流是否在离子化水平较低的盘中持续存在。 <div>
Given the important role turbulence plays in the settling and growth of dust grains in protoplanetary disks, it is crucial that we determine whether these disks are turbulent and to what extent. Protoplanetary disks are weakly ionized near the midplane, which has led to a paradigm in which largely laminar magnetic field structures prevail deeper in the disk, with angular momentum being transported via magnetically launched winds. Yet, there has been little exploration of the precise behavior of the gas within the bulk of the disk. We carry out 3D, local shearing box simulations that include all three low-ionization effects (ohmic diffusion, ambipolar diffusion, and the Hall effect) to probe the nature of magnetically driven gas dynamics 1–30 au from the central star. We find that gas turbulence can persist with a generous yet physically motivated ionization prescription (order unity Elsässer numbers). The gas velocity fluctuations range from 0.03 to 0.09 of the sound speed cs at the disk midplane to ∼cs near the disk surface, and are dependent on the initial magnetic field strength. However, the turbulent velocities do not appear to be strongly dependent on the field polarity, and thus appear to be insensitive to the Hall effect. The midplane turbulence has the potential to drive dust grains to collision velocities exceeding their fragmentation limit, and likely reduces the efficacy of particle clumping in the midplane, though it remains to be seen if this level of turbulence persists in disks with lower ionization levels.

总结: 该研究利用ALMA观测了一个z = 6.05的双类星系系统，发现两个暗淡的类星体之间有明亮的[C ii]发射，显示系统中有高达6 × 10^9L⊙的总[C ii]辐射。系统的基于[C ii]的总星形成速率约为550M⊙ yr−1，基于红外辐射的尘埃遮挡星形成速率约为100M⊙ yr−1，气体质量约为10^11M⊙。两个星系的动力学质量分别约为9 × 10^10M⊙和5 × 10^10M⊙。通过[C ii]发现了类星体间的光滑速度梯度，表明它们是一个潮汐相互作用的系统。在C1周围发现了动力学上不同的快速[C ii]成分，显示出约600 km s−1的快速流出。预期的出流质量加载因子介于2-3之间，属于AGN和星暴驱动出流之间的中间水平。文献中的流体动力学模拟预测，这一对星系在合并后将演变成一个光度极高（M1450 ≲ −26 mag），大规模星暴（≳1000 M⊙ yr−1）的类星体，在早期宇宙中属于极端的一种类型。 <div>
We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array [C ii] 158 μm line and underlying far-IR continuum emission observations (0.″57 × 0.″46 resolution) toward a quasar–quasar pair system recently discovered at z = 6.05. The quasar nuclei (C1 and C2) are faint (M1450 ≳ −23 mag), but we detect very bright [C ii] emission bridging the 12 kpc between the two objects and extending beyond them (total luminosity L[C ii] ≃ 6 × 109L⊙). The [C ii]-based total star formation rate of the system is ∼550 M⊙ yr−1 (the IR-based dust-obscured star formation is ∼100 M⊙ yr−1), with a [C ii]-based total gas mass of ∼1011M⊙. The dynamical masses of the two galaxies are large (∼9 × 1010M⊙ for C1 and ∼5 × 1010M⊙ for C2). There is a smooth velocity gradient in [C ii], indicating that these quasars are a tidally interacting system. We identified a dynamically distinct, fast-[C ii] component around C1: detailed inspection of the line spectrum there reveals the presence of a broad-wing component, which we interpret as the indication of fast outflows with a velocity of ∼600 km s−1. The expected mass-loading factor of the outflows, after accounting for multiphase gas, is ≳2 − 3, which is intermediate between AGN-driven and starburst-driven outflows. Hydrodynamic simulations in the literature predict that this pair will evolve to a luminous (M1450 ≲ −26 mag), starbursting (≳1000 M⊙ yr−1) quasar after coalescence, one of the most extreme populations in the early Universe.

<div> ALMA, ETGs, CNDs, BH mass, HST
<br /><br />总结:
本文研究了在明亮的早期星系中存在的尘埃环绕着的圆盘（CNDs），这些圆盘显示出规则的、动力学冷的分子气体动力学。通过ALMA CO成像和详细的气体动力学建模，确定了多个ETGs的黑洞质量。研究者识别了一组包括26个ETGs的样本，它们具有干净的CO动力学，但之前没有足够高角分辨率的近红外观测数据以减轻在构建恒星亮度模型时的尘埃遮挡问题。他们进行了新的光学和近红外哈勃空间望远镜（HST）图像，补充了存档中的HST数据，并测量了恒星表面亮度分布并使用MGE方法对亮度进行了建模。研究者发现这些CNDs通常在近红外光学上变得光学厚重。此外，他们发现不确定的尘埃对MGE的影响往往在BH质量误差估计中占主导地位。这项工作的延伸将集中在限制CND尘埃衰减上。这些发现将有助于重新审视局部黑洞质量 - 宿主星系比例关系。 <div>
Dusty circumnuclear disks (CNDs) in luminous early-type galaxies (ETGs) show regular, dynamically cold molecular gas kinematics. For a growing number of ETGs, Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) CO imaging and detailed gas-dynamical modeling facilitate moderate-to-high precision black hole (BH) mass (MBH) determinations. From the ALMA archive, we identified a subset of 26 ETGs with estimated MBH/M⊙ ≳ 108 to a few × 109 and clean CO kinematics but that previously did not have sufficiently high-angular-resolution near-IR observations to mitigate dust obscuration when constructing stellar luminosity models. We present new optical and near-IR Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images of this sample to supplement the archival HST data, detailing the sample properties and data-analysis techniques. After masking the most apparent dust features, we measure stellar surface-brightness profiles and model the luminosities using the multi-Gaussian expansion (MGE) formalism. Some of these MGEs have already been used in CO dynamical modeling efforts to secure quality MBH determinations, and the remaining ETG targets here are expected to significantly improve the high-mass end of the current BH census, facilitating new scrutiny of local BH mass–host galaxy scaling relationships. We also explore stellar isophotal behavior and general dust properties, finding these CNDs generally become optically thick in the near-IR (AH ≳ 1 mag). These CNDs are typically well aligned with the larger-scale stellar photometric axes, with a few notable exceptions. Uncertain dust impact on the MGE often dominates the BH mass error budget, so extensions of this work will focus on constraining CND dust attenuation.

白矮星大约有2%的行星残骸盘可以通过红外过量检测到，其中只有少数盘显示出气体成分，以其近红外钙三重线的双峰辐射为特征。研究发现，大多数白矮星周围的行星残骸盘在3.4和4.5微米处变化较大。通过对维持恒定位置的3.4微米光线曲线的变化进行分析发现，大多数带有钙发射的残骸盘都非常变化，这进一步证实了具有气态碎片的盘是最具碰撞活跃性的。我们生成了一个包含104个高置信度近红外变量白矮星的目录，并进行了七个新候选3.4微米变量的近红外光谱跟踪，至少证实了一个新的残留行星系统，这表明经验性近红外变化可以成为发现具有气体发射的残骸盘的一种引擎。 <br /><br />总结: 白矮星中大约有2%的行星残骸盘显示出红外过量，其中仅有少数显示出气体成分。通过分析3.4微米光线曲线的变化发现，大多数带有钙发射的残骸盘都非常变化，这证实了具有气态碎片的盘是最具碰撞活跃性的。我们生成了一个包含104个高置信度近红外变量白矮星的目录，并进行了七个新候选3.4微米变量的近红外光谱跟踪，至少证实了一个新的残留行星系统，这表明经验性近红外变化可以成为发现具有气体发射的残骸盘的一种引擎。 <div>
Roughly 2% of white dwarfs harbor planetary debris disks detectable via infrared excesses, but only a few percent of these disks show a gaseous component, distinguished by their double-peaked emission at the near-infrared calcium triplet. Previous studies found that most debris disks around white dwarfs are variable at 3.4 and 4.5 μm, but they analyzed only a few of the now 21 published disks showing calcium emission. To test if most published calcium emission disks exhibit large-amplitude stochastic variability in the near-infrared, we use light curves generated from the unWISE images at 3.4 μm that are corrected for proper motion to characterize the near-infrared variability of these disks against samples of disks without calcium emission, highly variable cataclysmic variables, and 3215 isolated white dwarfs. We find that most calcium emission disks are extremely variable: 6/11 with sufficient signal-to-noise show high-amplitude variability in their 3.4 μm light curves. These results lend further credence to the notion that disks showing gaseous debris in emission are the most collisionally active. Under the assumption that 3.4 μm variability is characteristic of white dwarfs with dusty debris disks, we generate a catalog of 104 high-confidence near-infrared variable white dwarfs, 84 of which are published as variable for the first time. We do near-infrared spectroscopic follow-up of seven new candidate 3.4 μm variables, confirming at least one new remnant planetary system, and posit that empirical near-infrared variability can be a discovery engine for debris disks showing gaseous emission.

<div> CHIME, FRB, GRB, SGRB, Radio emission
总结:
加拿大氢强度映射实验(CHIME)快速射电爆发(FRB)项目使用CHIME/FRB搜索2018年7月7日至2023年8月3日之间与伽马射线暴(GRB)在时间和空间上(误差不超过1周和3σ)重合的FRB。然而，未发现任何CHIME/FRB候选者与所有1σ定位误差<1°的GRB同时发生。在此基础上，使用CHIME/FRB对27个与CHIME/FRB子午线在17°内的短伽马射线暴(SGRBs)的可能FRB-like射电发射进行了限制。其中，两个SGRBs，GRB 210909A和GRB 230208A，在它们的高能辐射发生时正好在CHIME的地平线以上，我们对它们同时FRB-like射电发射进行了一些首次约束。尽管这两个SGRBs都没有已知的红移，但我们根据它们的高能辐射和推导的SGRB能量分布构建了一个红移范围。对于GRB 210909A，这个红移范围对应于z=[0.009，1.64]，平均z=0.13。因此，对于GRB 210909A，在高能辐射的时刻，我们将射电亮度限制为L<2×1046 erg s−1，L<5×1044 erg s−1，和L<3×1042 erg s−1，分别假设红移为z=0.85，z=0.16和z=0.013。我们将这些约束与不同紧凑天体并合模型对射电亮度的预测进行了比较。 <div>
We use the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) Fast Radio Burst (FRB) Project to search for FRBs that are temporally and spatially coincident with gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) occurring between 2018 July 7 and 2023 August 3. We do not find any temporal (within 1 week) and spatial (within overlapping 3σ localization regions) coincidences between any CHIME/FRB candidates and all GRBs with 1σ localization uncertainties <1°. As such, we use CHIME/FRB to constrain the possible FRB-like radio emission for 27 short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) that were within 17° of CHIME/FRB’s meridian at a point either 6 hr prior up to 12 hr after the high-energy emission. Two SGRBs, GRB 210909A and GRB 230208A, were above the horizon at CHIME at the time of their high-energy emission and we place some of the first constraints on simultaneous FRB-like radio emission from SGRBs. While neither of these two SGRBs have known redshifts, we construct a redshift range for each GRB based on their high-energy fluence and a derived SGRB energy distribution. For GRB 210909A, this redshift range corresponds to z = [0.009, 1.64] with a mean of z = 0.13. Thus, for GRB 210909A, we constrain the radio luminosity at the time of the high-energy emission to L < 2 × 1046 erg s−1, L < 5 × 1044 erg s−1, and L < 3 × 1042 erg s−1 assuming redshifts of z = 0.85, z = 0.16, and z = 0.013, respectively. We compare these constraints with the predicted simultaneous radio luminosities from different compact object merger models.

<div> 快速射电暴，磁层，反常康普顿散射，Alfvén波，重复射电暴<br />
总结:<br />
本文研究了快速射电暴（FRBs）的时间、频谱和偏振特性，指出大多数爆发的射电辐射可能是在其中央引擎（可能是一个磁星）的磁层内产生的。文章提出了一种通过低频X模电磁波（快磁声波）的相干逆康普顿散射（ICS）产生FRB的观点，并给出了以下发现：（1）在爆发事件期间，地壳振荡会激发千赫兹的Alfvén波。快磁声波可能直接在较大的半径处产生，其频率与Alfvén波几乎相同，并具有足够大的振幅来通过ICS过程为FRB提供动力。（2）截面随半径迅速增加，可在r≳100R⋆处发生显著的ICS，发射功率远大于曲率辐射功率，但仍处于线性散射状态。（3）低频快磁声波可以自然地重新分布充满涡动的相对论等离子体，在电荷稀疏区形成适当大小的束团，从而为FRB提供动力。（4）所需束团净电荷密度可以低于Goldreich-Julian值，这允许强平行电场加速电荷，维持束团，并持续为FRB辐射提供动力。（5）这个模型可以解释重复快速射电暴爆发的多种观测特性，包括高度线偏振和圆偏振以及窄谱线。 <div>
Growing observations of temporal, spectral, and polarization properties of fast radio bursts (FRBs) indicate that the radio emission of the majority of bursts is likely produced inside the magnetosphere of its central engine, likely a magnetar. We revisit the idea that FRBs are generated via coherent inverse Compton scattering (ICS) off low-frequency X-mode electromagnetic waves (fast magnetosonic waves) by bunches at a distance of a few hundred times the magnetar radius. The following findings are revealed: (1) Crustal oscillations during a flaring event would excite kHz Alfvén waves. Fast magnetosonic waves with essentially the same frequency can be generated directly or be converted from Alfvén waves at a large radius, with an amplitude large enough to power FRBs via the ICS process. (2) The cross section increases rapidly with radius and significant ICS can occur at r ≳ 100R⋆ with emission power much greater than the curvature radiation power but still in the linear scattering regime. (3) The low-frequency fast magnetosonic waves naturally redistribute a fluctuating relativistic plasma in the charge-depleted region to form bunches with the right size to power FRBs. (4) The required bunch net charge density can be sub-Goldreich–Julian, which allows a strong parallel electric field to accelerate the charges, maintain the bunches, and continuously power FRB emission. (5) This model can account for a wide range of observed properties of repeating FRB bursts, including high degrees of linear and circular polarization and narrow spectra as observed in many bursts from repeating FRB sources.

<br />总结:
太阳耀斑是太阳活动的重要现象，然而关于耀斑过程中元素丰度变化的研究仍然不足。本研究利用嫦娥二号月球探测器获取的太阳X射线监测数据，对太阳活跃区AR 11149和11158的两次耀斑进行了全面的软X射线光谱观测，揭示了不同条件下元素丰度随时间的变化。研究发现铁元素在耀斑过程中呈现出了反向第一电离势效应，硅元素也表现出了该效应。此外，在耀斑减弱阶段观察到了元素丰度稀缺的现象，标志着第二电离势效应的存在。研究还提出了一个基于CSHKP模型的解释，阐明了耀斑动力学中FIP和IFIP效应的形成，同时还将惰性效应引入了ponderomotive力分馏模型中。 <div>
Understanding how elemental abundances evolve during solar flares helps shed light on the mass and energy transfer between different solar atmospheric layers. However, prior studies have mostly concentrated on averaged abundances or specific flare phases, leaving a gap in exploring the comprehensive observations throughout the entire flare process. Consequently, investigations into this area are relatively scarce. Exploiting the Solar X-Ray Monitor data obtained from the Chang’E-2 lunar orbiter, we present two comprehensive soft X-ray spectroscopic observations of flares in active regions, AR 11149 and 11158, demonstrating elemental abundance evolutions under different conditions. Our findings unveil the inverse first ionization potential (IFIP) effect during flares for Fe for the first time, and reaffirm its existence for Si. Additionally, we observed a rare depletion of elemental abundances, marking the second IFIP effect in flare decay phases. Our study offers a CSHKP model-based interpretation to elucidate the formation of both the FIP and IFIP effects in flare dynamics, with the inertia effect being incorporated into the ponderomotive force fractionation model.

<div> 高温耀斑循环、准周期震荡、太阳动力学

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章报告了一个独特的事件，展示了C9.1级耀斑期间耀斑环的长时准周期强度震荡和带状亚结构的准周期滑动运动。耀斑环的高温环根植于带状直部显示出“明亮-暗淡”强度震荡，周期约为4.5分钟。与此同时，带状尖端内的亚结构在1400 Å图像上显示出沿着带状的准周期滑动运动，周期与耀斑环直部的静止强度震荡相似。文章指出，这种准周期模式可能与由重联流出影响耀斑环的环顶动力学有关。 <div>
Quasiperiodic oscillations in solar-flaring emission have been observed over the past few decades. To date, the underpinning processes resulting in the quasiperiodic oscillations remain unknown. In this paper, we report a unique event that exhibits both the long-duration quasiperiodic intensity oscillations of flare loops and the quasiperiodic slipping motion of ribbon substructures during a C9.1-class flare (SOL2015-03-15-T01:15), using the observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory and Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph. The high-temperature flare loops rooted in the straight part of ribbons display a “bright–dim” intensity oscillation, with a period of about 4.5 minutes. The oscillation starts just after the flare onset and lasts over 3 hr. Meanwhile, the substructures within the ribbon tip display the quasiperiodic slipping motion along the ribbon at 1400 Å images, which has a similar periodicity to the stationary intensity oscillation of the flare loops in the straight part of the flare ribbons. We suggest that the quasiperiodic pattern is probably related to the loop-top dynamics caused by the reconnection outflow impinging on the flare loops.

The detections of Lyα emission in galaxies with redshifts above 5 are of utmost importance for constraining the cosmic reionization timeline, yet such detections are usually based on slit spectroscopy. Here we investigate the significant bias induced by slit placement on the estimate of Lyα escape fraction ( ) by presenting a galaxy (dubbed A2744-z6Lya) at z = 5.66, where its deep JWST/NIRSpec prism spectroscopy completely misses the strong Lyα emission detected in the MUSE data. A2744-z6Lya exhibits a pronounced UV continuum with an extremely steep spectral slope of , and it has a stellar mass of ∼108.75M⊙, a star formation rate of ∼5.95 M⊙ yr−1, and a gas-phase metallicity of . The observed flux and rest-frame equivalent width of its Lyα from MUSE spectroscopy are 1.2 × 10−16 erg s−1 cm−2 and 75 Å, equivalent to . However, its Lyα nondetection from JWST NIRSpec gives a 5σ upper limit of <5%, in stark contrast to that derived from MUSE. To explore the reasons for this bias, we perform spatially resolved stellar population analysis of A2744-z6Lya using the JWST NIRCam and HST imaging data to construct 2D maps of star formation rate, dust extinction, and neutral hydrogen column density. We find that the absence of Lyα in the slit regions probably stems from both the resonance scattering effect of neutral hydrogen and dust extinction. Through analyzing an extreme case in detail, this work highlights the important caveat of inferring from slit spectroscopy, particularly when using the JWST multiplexed NIRSpec microshutter assembly.

Reconstruction of the point-spread function (PSF) plays an important role in many areas of astronomy, including photometry, astrometry, galaxy morphology, and shear measurement. The atmospheric and instrumental effects are the two main contributors to the PSF, both of which may exhibit complex spatial features. Current PSF reconstruction schemes typically rely on individual exposures, and their ability to reproduce the complicated features of the PSF distribution is therefore limited by the number of stars. Interestingly, in conventional methods, after stacking the model residuals of the PSF ellipticities and (relative) sizes from a large number of exposures, one can often observe some stable and nontrivial spatial patterns on the entire focal plane, which could be quite detrimental to, e.g., weak-lensing measurements. These PSF residual patterns are caused by instrumental effects, as they consistently appear in different exposures. Taking this as an advantage, we propose a multilayer PSF reconstruction method to remove such PSF residuals, the second and third layers of which make use of all available exposures together. We test our method on the i-band data of the second release of the Hyper Suprime-Cam. Our method successfully eliminates most of the PSF residuals. Using the Fourier_Quad shear measurement method, we further test the performance of the resulting PSF fields on shear recovery using the field distortion effect. The PSF residuals have strong correlations with the shear residuals, and our new multilayer PSF reconstruction method can remove most of such systematic errors related to the PSF, leading to much smaller shear biases.

The detection of O- and B-type stars with extremely low-mass companions is very important for understanding the formation and evolution of binary stars. However, finding them remains a challenge because the low-mass components in such systems contribute such small flux to the total. During our search for pulsations among O- and B-type stars using the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) data, we found two short-period and B-type (B9) eclipsing binaries with orbital periods of 1.61613 and 2.37857 days. Photometric solutions of the two close binaries were derived by analyzing the TESS light curves with the Wilson–Devinney method. It is discovered that both of them are detached binaries with extremely low mass ratios of 0.067(2) for TIC 260342097 and 0.140(3) for TIC 209148631. The determined mass ratio indicates that TIC 260342097 is one of the lowest mass ratios among known B-type binary systems. We showed that the two systems have total eclipses with a broad and flat secondary minimum, suggesting that the photometric parameters could be derived reliably. The absolute parameters of the two binaries are estimated and it is found that the secondary components in the two systems are overluminous and oversize when compared with the normal low-mass and cool main-sequence (MS) stars. These findings may imply that the two systems are composed of a B-type MS primary and a cool pre-MS secondary with orbital periods shorter than 2.5 days. They are valuable targets to test theories of binary star formation and evolution.

这篇文章介绍了Picard–Lefschetz理论在波动光学效应方面的应用，特别是在天体物理学中的透镜效应中的应用。它提出了波动光学下的透镜图像概念的概括性扩展，包括“虚像”和Lefschetz拇指的概念。研究了“Stokes现象”作为Lefschetz拇指拓扑结构的变化，与传统的焦散现象类似，Stokes线标志着有效虚像数量的突变。对一些透镜模型进行了Stokes线的映射，结果显示了Stokes线-焦散网络的独特特征。Stokes现象的可观测特征是干涉行为的改变，尤其是某些Stokes线上频率振荡的出现。此外，还展示了高阶Stokes现象，系统具有连续数量的有效图像，但它们与Lefschetz拇指的连接方式却突变。完整的特征描述需要类比于焦散的灾变理论。 <br /><br />总结: 这篇文章介绍了在天体物理学中透镜效应的波动光学理论框架下的研究，包括Picard–Lefschetz理论的应用和Stokes现象在该框架下的作用。文章提出了透镜图像概念的扩展，研究了Stokes现象的特征和可观测特征，这对于理解天体物理中的透镜效应具有重要意义。 <div>
As lensing of coherent astrophysical sources, e.g., pulsars, fast radio bursts, and gravitational waves, becomes observationally relevant, the mathematical framework of Picard–Lefschetz theory has recently been introduced to fully account for wave optics effects. Accordingly, the concept of lensing images has been generalized to include complex solutions of the lens equation referred to as “imaginary images,” and more radically, to the Lefschetz thimbles, which are a sum of the steepest descent contours connecting the real and imaginary images in the complex domain. In this wave-optics-based theoretical framework of lensing, we study the “Stokes phenomena” as the change of the topology of the Lefschetz thimbles. Similar to the well-known caustics at which the number of geometric images changes abruptly, the corresponding Stokes lines are the boundaries in the parameter space where the number of effective imaginary images changes. We map the Stokes lines for a few lens models. The resulting Stokes line-caustics network represents a unique feature of the lens models. The observable signature of the Stokes phenomena is the change of interference behavior, in particular the onset of frequency oscillation for some Stokes lines. We also demonstrate high-order Stokes phenomena where the system has a continuous number of effective images but with an abrupt change in the way they are connected to each other by the Lefschetz thimbles. Their full characterization calls for an analogy of the catastrophe theory for caustics.

Primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) play a pivotal role in influencing small-scale fluctuations within the primordial density field, thereby enhancing the matter power spectrum within the context of the ΛCDM model at small scales. These amplified fluctuations accelerate the early formation of galactic halos and stars, which can be observed through advanced high-redshift observational techniques. Therefore, stellar mass density (SMD) observations, which provide significant opportunities for detailed studies of galaxies at small scales and high redshifts, offer a novel perspective on small-scale cosmic phenomena and constrain the characteristics of PMFs. In this study, we compile 14 SMD data points at redshifts z > 6 and derive stringent constraints on the parameters of PMFs, which include the amplitude of the magnetic field at a characteristic scale of λ = 1 Mpc, denoted as B0, and the spectral index of the magnetic field power spectrum, nB. At 95% confidence level, we establish upper limits of B0 < 4.44 nG and nB < −2.24, along with a star formation efficiency of approximately . If we fix nB at specific values, such as −2.85, −2.9, and −2.95, the 95% upper limits for the amplitude of the magnetic field can be constrained to 1.33, 2.21, and 3.90 nG, respectively. Finally, we attempt to interpret recent early observations provided by the James Webb Space Telescope using the theory of PMFs and find that by selecting appropriate PMF parameters, it is possible to explain these results without significantly increasing the star formation efficiency.

<div> NGC6334I, ALMA, dust emission, magnetic field, high-mass star formation
总结:
NGC6334I是一个以其显著的流量突发事件而闻名的源。通过ALMA的观测，发现其总强度没有实质性变化，而线偏振有轻微的8%变化，暗示了稳定阶段或爆发的结束。从偏振辐射推断出的磁场显示出从西北到东南的主要径向模式，以及对主要核心的复杂扰动，提示螺旋结构的存在。能量分析表明，NGC6334I的流出能量约为3.5 × 10^45 erg，与之前的干涉研究结果相符。采用Davis–Chandrasekhar–Fermi方法确定的磁场强度区间为1至11 mG，平均为1.9 mG。考虑到Zeeman测量后，平均值增至4 ± 1 mG。而在引力、热和动能地图的比较分析中发现，磁能明显较弱，可能解释了观察到的场形态。此外，发现NGC6334I中的流出和膨胀的HII区域能量也比磁能大，暗示原恒星反馈可能是在我们观测的尺度范围内注入湍动的主要驱动力。文章还指出，NGC6334I中的气体主要表现出超声速和跨阿尔芬速条件，随着气体密度增加逐渐过渡到超阿尔芬速的状态，突显了磁场对气体的影响逐渐减弱。这些观测结果与之前在220 GHz进行的偏振研究相符，丰富了我们对高质量恒星形成区域动态过程的理解。 <div>
We report on Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of polarized dust emission at 1.2 mm from NGC6334I, a source known for its significant flux outbursts. Between five months, our data show no substantial change in total intensity and a modest 8% variation in linear polarization, suggesting a phase of stability or the conclusion of the outburst. The magnetic field, inferred from this polarized emission, displays a predominantly radial pattern from northwest to southeast with intricate disturbances across major cores, hinting at spiral structures. Energy analysis of CS (J = 5 → 4) emission yields an outflow energy of approximately 3.5 × 1045 erg, aligning with previous interferometric studies. Utilizing the Davis–Chandrasekhar–Fermi method, we determined magnetic field strengths ranging from 1 to 11 mG, averaging at 1.9 mG. This average increases to 4 ± 1 mG when incorporating Zeeman measurements. Comparative analyses using gravitational, thermal, and kinetic energy maps reveal that magnetic energy is significantly weaker, possibly explaining the observed field morphology. We also find that the energy in the outflows and the expanding cometary HII region is also larger than the magnetic energy, suggesting that protostellar feedback may be the dominant driver behind the injection of turbulence in NGC6334I at the scales sampled by our data. The gas in NGC6334I predominantly exhibits supersonic and trans-Alfvenic conditions, transitioning towards a super-Alfvenic regime, underscoring a diminished influence of the magnetic field with increasing gas density. These observations are in agreement with prior polarization studies at 220 GHz, enriching our understanding of the dynamic processes in high-mass star-forming regions.

通过对新地平线LORRI图像的分析，得出了宇宙光学背景的强度，采用了16个高银道纬度的观测场，以最小化来自银河系的散射漫射光的影响。该调查得出了宇宙光学背景在0.608μm波长下的强度为11.16 ± 1.65 nW m^-2 sr^-1，其中大部分信号可以由背景星系解释。剩下的部分被归类为异常强度，但与零没有显著差异。这项研究表明，宇宙光学背景完全源自星系。 
<br /><br />总结: 这项研究通过分析新地平线LORRI图像，得出了宇宙光学背景的强度，并发现大部分信号可以由背景星系解释，剩下的异常强度被认为也可能源自星系，指示宇宙光学背景可能完全源自星系。 <div>
We obtained New Horizons LORRI images to measure the cosmic optical background (COB) intensity integrated over 0.4 μm ≲ λ ≲ 0.9 μm. The survey comprises 16 high-Galactic-latitude fields selected to minimize scattered diffuse Galactic light (DGL) from the Milky Way, as well as scattered light from bright stars. This work supersedes an earlier analysis based on observations of one of the present fields. Isolating the COB contribution to the raw total sky levels measured in the fields requires subtracting the remaining scattered light from bright stars and galaxies, intensity from faint stars within the fields fainter than the photometric detection limit, and the DGL foreground. DGL is estimated from 350 μm and 550 μm intensities measured by the Planck High Frequency Instrument, using a new self-calibrated indicator based on the 16 fields augmented with eight additional DGL calibration fields obtained as part of the survey. The survey yields a highly significant detection (6.8σ) of the COB at 11.16 ± 1.65 (1.47 sys, 0.75 ran) nW m−2 sr−1 at the LORRI pivot wavelength of 0.608 μm. The estimated integrated intensity from background galaxies, 8.17 ± 1.18 nW m−2 sr−1, can account for the great majority of this signal. The rest of the COB signal, 2.99 ± 2.03 (1.75 sys, 1.03 ran) nW m−2 sr−1, is formally classified as anomalous intensity but is not significantly different from zero. The simplest interpretation is that the COB is completely due to galaxies.

Soft X-ray transients (SXTs) are a subclass of the low-mass X-ray binaries that occasionally show a sudden rise in their soft X-ray luminosity; otherwise, they remain in an extremely faint state. We investigate the accretion properties of the SXT XTE J1856+053 during its 2023 outburst obtained by NICER and NuSTAR data in July. We present detailed results on the timing and spectral analysis of the X-ray emission during the outburst. The power spectral density shows no quasi-periodic oscillation features. The source’s spectrum on July 19 can be well fitted with a multicolor blackbody component, a power-law component, and a reflection component with a broadened iron emission line. NICER spectra can be well fitted by considering a combination of a blackbody and a power law. The source exhibits a transition within just 5 days from a soft state to an intermediate state during the outburst decline phase. The inner accretion disk has a low inclination angle (∼18°). The spectral analysis also suggests a high-spin (a > 0.9) black hole as the central accreting object.

The origin of strong sodium absorption, which has been observed for a few nearby Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), remains elusive. Here we analyze two high-signal-to-noise, intermediate-resolution Very Large Telescope/X-shooter spectra at epochs +18 and +27 days past peak brightness of the strongly lensed and multiply imaged Type Ia SN 2016geu, which exploded at a redshift of z = 0.4. We show that SN 2016geu exhibits very strong multiple Na i and Ca ii absorption lines with a large total Na i D rest-frame equivalent width (EW) of 5.2 ± 0.2 Å, among the highest ever detected for an SN Ia and similar to only a handful of nearby SNe Ia with extraordinarily large Na i D EWs. The absorption system is time-invariant and extends over a large velocity span ∼250 km s−1. The majority of the absorption is blueshifted relative to the strongest component, while there are both blueshifted and redshifted components relative to the systemic redshift of the galaxy. The column density ratios and widths of the absorption lines indicate that the absorption likely arises from a combination of interstellar dusty molecular clouds and circumgalactic in- and outflowing material rather than circumstellar matter around the supernova.

总结:<br /><br />本文研究了高红移星系中强光谱线的金属丰度指示器的校准，并使用宇宙学模拟中的模拟发射线数据。研究结果表明，我们所研究的12个指标中存在轻微的红移演化，这意味着在模拟中演化的主要物理性质对高红移时期的金属丰度校准产生了可辨认的影响。与詹姆斯·韦伯太空望远镜的高红移辐射线观测进行比较时，我们发现模型结果与观测结果存在轻微偏差，高红移时的更高电离参数可能是其中一个可能的解释。我们还探讨了驱动强线金属丰度关系形状的物理机制，并提出了迄今未被探索的低金属丰度范围的校准。最后，我们研究了漫射电离气体对总发射线通量的贡献，在z∼0时发现，低电离氧和硫线的漫射电离气体贡献随金属丰度的增加而增加，甚至可能达到70%，这使得在建模星云发射线时包含其贡献至关重要。 <div>
The ratios of strong rest-frame optical emission lines are the dominant indicators of metallicities in high-redshift galaxies. Since typical strong-line-based metallicity indicators are calibrated on auroral lines at z = 0, their applicability for galaxies in the distant Universe is unclear. In this paper, we make use of mock emission-line data from cosmological simulations to investigate the calibration of rest-frame optical emission lines as metallicity indicators at high redshift. Our model, which couples the simba cosmological galaxy formation simulation with cloudy photoionization calculations, includes contributions from H ii regions, post-asymptotic-giant-branch stars, and diffuse ionized gas (DIG). We find mild redshift evolution in the 12 indicators that we study, which implies that the dominant physical properties that evolve in our simulations do have a discernible impact on the metallicity calibrations at high redshifts. When comparing our calibrations with high-redshift auroral line observations from the James Webb Space Telescope, we find a slight offset between our model results and the observations and find that a higher ionization parameter at high redshifts can be one of the possible explanations. We explore the physics that drives the shapes of strong-line metallicity relationships and propose calibrations for hitherto unexplored low-metallicity regimes. Finally, we study the contribution of DIG to total line fluxes. We find that the contribution of DIG increases with metallicity at z ∼ 0 for singly ionized oxygen and sulfur lines and can be as high as 70%, making it crucial to include their contribution when modeling nebular emission.

总结:<br />
本研究利用1000万颗红巨星星的化学动力学信息，阐述了银河系经历的三个阶段：无序混沌的原星系，动力学高的老盘，以及动力学冷的年轻盘。高α盘从[Fe/H]≈-1.0开始“加速旋转”，并在较高的金属性显示出更加有序和圆形的轨道。而年轻的低α盘在其金属丰度范围内表现出动力学上的冷状态，且受强烈的径向梯度影响。研究通过TNG50宇宙学模拟发现了与我们银河系动力学演化相匹配的模拟银河。该模拟银河的原星系在早期形成了相对薄而不一致的高α盘，随后被一次富含气体的重大并购所加热和扭曲。该并购提供了大量低金属丰度的气体和角动量，从而随后形成了动力学冷的低α恒星盘。该研究成果为我们对银河系的三阶段形成提供了全天境观的新视角，推动了旋转加速、合并和冷却这三个物理机制的形成。 <div>
We illustrate the formation and evolution of the Milky Way over cosmic time, utilizing a sample of 10 million red giant stars with full chemodynamical information, including metallicities and α-abundances from low-resolution Gaia XP spectra. The evolution of angular momentum as a function of metallicity—a rough proxy for stellar age, particularly for high-[α/Fe] stars—displays three distinct phases: the disordered and chaotic protogalaxy, the kinematically hot old disk, and the kinematically cold young disk. The old high-α disk starts at [Fe/H] ≈ −1.0, “spinning up” from the nascent protogalaxy, and then exhibiting a smooth “cooldown” toward more ordered and circular orbits at higher metallicities. The young low-α disk is kinematically cold throughout its metallicity range, with its observed properties modulated by a strong radial gradient. We interpret these trends using Milky Way analogs from the TNG50 cosmological simulation, identifying one that closely matches the kinematic evolution of our galaxy. This halo’s protogalaxy spins up into a relatively thin and misaligned high-α disk at early times, which is subsequently heated and torqued by a major gas-rich merger. The merger contributes a large amount of low-metallicity gas and angular momentum, from which the kinematically cold low-α stellar disk is subsequently born. This simulated history parallels several observed features of the Milky Way, particularly the decisive Gaia–Sausage–Enceladus merger that likely occurred at z ≈ 2. Our results provide an all-sky perspective on the emerging picture of our galaxy’s three-phase formation, impelled by the three physical mechanisms of spinup, merger, and cooldown.

We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of the [C ii] 158 μm line and the underlying continuum emission of TN J0924−2201, which is one of the most distant known radio galaxies at z > 5. The [C ii] line and 1 mm continuum emission are detected at the host galaxy. The systemic redshift derived from the [C ii] line is z[C II] = 5.1736 ± 0.0002, indicating that the Lyα line is redshifted by a velocity of 1035 ± 10 km s−1, marking the largest velocity offset between the [C ii] and Lyα lines recorded at z > 5 to date. In the central region of the host galaxy, we identify a redshifted substructure of [C ii] with a velocity of 702 ± 17 km s−1, which is close to the C iv line with a velocity of 500 ± 10 km s−1. The position and the velocity offsets align with a model of an outflowing shell structure, consistent with the large velocity offset of Lyα. The nondetection of [C ii] and dust emission from the three CO(1–0)-detected companions indicates their different nature compared to dwarf galaxies, based on the photodissociation region model. Given their large velocity of ∼1500 km s−1, outflowing molecular clouds induced by the active galactic nucleus are the most plausible interpretation, and they may exceed the escape velocity of a 1013M⊙ halo. These results suggest that TN J0924−2201, with ongoing and fossil large-scale outflows, is in a distinctive phase of removing molecular gas from a central massive galaxy in an overdense region in the early Universe. A dusty H i absorber at the host galaxy is an alternative interpretation.

本研究观测并分析了NOAA活跃区12127中的M1.5级耀斑(SOL2014-08-01T18:13)，该耀斑具有三个耀斑带、耀斑带之间的限制性丝状结构、和太阳黑子旋转运动。通过磁场外推模型发现了两个相交的准分离层构成的双曲型磁通管(HFT)，形成了三个耀斑带的结构。进一步的场外推模型显示了两个耀斑带之间存在磁通绳结构，这对于观测未清楚地呈现了出来。研究发现了太阳黑子周围的旋转流，可能通过减弱磁通绳向下的磁张力而导致了耀斑的爆发。总的来说，这次的耀斑爆发路径不同于通常由日珥内部丝状结构成功爆发引起的圆环耀斑。我们的研究结果展示了太阳磁爆发路径的多样性，这多样性来自太阳磁场复杂配置的影响。 <br /><br /> <div>
We present observations and analysis of an eruptive M1.5 flare (SOL2014-08-01T18:13) in NOAA active region (AR) 12127, characterized by three flare ribbons, a confined filament between ribbons, and rotating sunspot motions as observed by the Solar Dynamics Observatory. The potential field extrapolation model shows a magnetic topology involving two intersecting quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs) forming a hyperbolic flux tube (HFT), which constitutes the fishbone structure for the three-ribbon flare. Two of the three ribbons show separation from each other, and the third ribbon is rather stationary at the QSL footpoints. The nonlinear force-free field extrapolation model implies the presence of a magnetic flux rope (MFR) structure between the two separating ribbons, which was unclear in the observation. This suggests that the standard reconnection scenario for eruptive flares applies to the two ribbons, and the QSL reconnection for the third ribbon. We find rotational flows around the sunspot, which may have caused the eruption by weakening the downward magnetic tension of the MFR. The confined filament is located in the region of relatively strong strapping field. The HFT topology and the accumulation of reconnected magnetic flux in the HFT may play a role in holding it from eruption. This eruption scenario differs from the one typically known for circular ribbon flares, which is mainly driven by a successful inside-out eruption of filaments. Our results demonstrate the diversity of solar magnetic eruption paths that arises from the complexity of the magnetic configuration.

本文通过对RT Cru多种X射线数据的主成分分析，揭示了δ型共生双星系统的X射线变化特征。观测显示了RT Cru的X射线光谱在2012年出现了硬化状态转变，且存在小时级的波动。主成分分析显示Chandra HRC-S/LETG和XMM-Newton EPIC-pn数据具有主要的成分，其中可能包含了软过剩的一些变化信号。此外，Suzaku XIS1数据的主要成分包括吸收柱、源连续谱和可能是软波段热等离子体发射的第三个成分。NuSTAR数据的主成分对应于连续谱和可能的发射特征。研究结果表明，Suzaku观测到的光谱硬度转变主要归因于吸收材料和X射线连续谱的变化，而热等离子体发射的一些变化可能导致了闪烁型变化。 <div>
Hard X-ray-emitting (δ-type) symbiotic binaries, which exhibit a strong hard X-ray excess, have posed a challenge to our understanding of accretion physics in degenerate dwarfs. RT Cru, which is a member of the δ-type symbiotics, shows stochastic X-ray variability. Timing analyses of X-ray observations from XMM-Newton and NuSTAR, which we consider here, indicate hourly fluctuations, in addition to a spectral transition from 2007 to a harder state in 2012 seen with Suzaku observations. To trace the nature of X-ray variability, we analyze the multimission X-ray data using principal component analysis (PCA), which determines the spectral components that contribute most to the flickering behavior and the hardness transition. The Chandra HRC-S/LETG and XMM-Newton EPIC-pn data provide the primary PCA components, which may contain some variable emission features, especially in the soft excess. Additionally, the absorbing column (first order with 50%), along with the source continuum (20%), and a third component (9%)—which likely accounts for thermal emission in the soft band—are the three principal components found in the Suzaku XIS1 observations. The PCA components of the NuSTAR data also correspond to the continuum and possibly emission features. Our findings suggest that the spectral hardness transition between the two Suzaku observations is mainly due to changes in the absorbing material and X-ray continuum, while some changes in the thermal plasma emission may result in flickering-type variations.

总结:<br />
星系的性质与其所在的暗物质晕的质量和组装历史密切相关。使用半解析模型的模拟数据，研究发现星际介质质量与暗物质组装时间存在重要联系，尤其是在具有活跃中心（蓝组）和不活跃中心（红组）的星系团中。研究者开发了机器学习模型，用于使用模拟数据中的可观测量来估计星系团的暗物质组装时间。他们分别针对蓝组和红组进行了模型训练和验证。最后，他们将训练好的模型应用于SDSS观测数据中，并成功地推导出了每个星系团的暗物质组装历史。这项研究为观测中研究暗物质与星系的联接迈出了重要一步。 <div>
The properties of the galaxies are tightly connected to their host halo mass and halo assembly history. Accurate measurement of the halo assembly history in observation is challenging but crucial to the understanding of galaxy formation and evolution. The stellar-to-halo mass ratio (M*/Mh) for the centrals has often been used to indicate the halo assembly time th,50 of the group, where th,50 is the lookback time at which a halo has assembled half of its present-day virial mass. Using mock data from the semi-analytic models, we find that M*/Mh shows a significant scatter with th,50, with a strong systematic difference between the group with a star-forming central (blue group) and passive central (red group). To improve the accuracy, we develop machine learning models to estimate th,50 for galaxy groups using only observable quantities in the mocks. Since star formation quenching will decouple the co-growth of the dark matter and baryon, we train our models separately for blue and red groups. Our models have successfully recovered th,50, within an accuracy of ∼1.09 Gyr. With careful calibrations of individual observable quantities in the mocks with Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) observations, we apply the trained models to the SDSS Yang et al. groups and derive the th,50 for each group for the first time. The derived SDSS th,50 distributions are in good agreement with that in the mocks, in particular for blue groups. The derived halo assembly history, together with the halo mass, make an important step forward in studying the halo–galaxy connections in observation.

<div> 关键词: 太阳风, 地球, 太阳活动区, 日冕孔, 磁力线

总结:
太阳风预测和日冕事件模拟使用27天太阳旋转周期内的光球磁场图。研究发现，如果新的太阳活动区位于地球的经度约135°–180°处，那么对太阳风和日冕孔的影响将几乎可以忽略。然而，如果新的太阳活动区位于太阳边缘附近，可能会对中央经线附近的磁场产生明显影响。当新的太阳活动区和邻近的日冕孔有相反的极性时，可能导致日冕孔部分关闭，产生较慢的太阳风；但如果极性相同，则会增大日冕孔面积，产生更快的太阳风。总的来说，新的太阳活动区主要通过交换再连接来重新分配磁场。 <div>
Solar wind prediction algorithms and simulations of coronal events often employ photospheric field maps that are assembled over a 27 day solar rotation. This has stimulated efforts to update and better synchronize the maps by applying flux transport and including observations of the back side of the Sun. Here, using potential-field source-surface extrapolations, we address the question of how the emergence of a large active region (AR) on the Sun’s farside affects the coronal field and configuration of coronal holes on the Earth-facing side. We find that, if the new AR is located ∼135°–180° in longitude from Earth, the effect on the coronal field and solar wind near the central meridian will be almost negligible. This is because, when sunspot activity is relatively low, the outermost AR loops will become connected to the nearby polar fields; when sunspot activity is high, the newly emerged flux will connect to neighboring ARs. However, large ARs that emerge near the solar limb may sometimes have a significant effect on the field near the central meridian. In particular, a coronal hole having opposite polarity to that of the nearest sector of the AR may partially close down, resulting in slower wind; conversely, if the coronal hole has the same polarity as the facing AR sector, it will tend to increase in areal size, resulting in faster wind. In most cases, the main effect of a new AR will be to redistribute open flux between itself and neighboring coronal holes (including the polar holes) through interchange reconnection.

<div> Tidal disruption events, TDEs, low-mass black holes, X-ray spectroscopy, AT2021ehb
总结:
Tidal disruption events (TDEs)可能探测到宿主星系中未遵循星团或恒星离散关系的低质量黑洞（BH）。X射线光谱学可能可以限制BH质量，并揭示与超Eddington吸积相关的电离流出。我们对TDE AT2021ehb的XMM-Newton X射线观测进行了分析，并发现在大约300天的破坏之后，其软光谱可以用多彩盘黑体和幂律组分的组合来拟合。使用两个适用于TDE的独立盘模型，我们估计BH质量约为M≈105.5M⊙，表明AT2021ehb可能揭示核心BH种群的低质量端。这些模型提供简单而坚固的表征；不需要更复杂的模型，但在数据中等敏感性的情况下提供了重要的背景和警示。如果包括盘反射，盘流量会减少，推断的BH质量约高了0.35 dex。简单的风配方意味着极快的vout=−0.2c流出，并且排除了盘连续组分。假设一个单位填充因子，这样的风意味着瞬时质量流出率。如此高的速率表明超快流出(UFO)的填充因子必须非常低，和/或UFO相位是短暂的。我们讨论了分析的优势和局限性，以及TDE的未来观测途径。 <div>
Tidal disruption events (TDEs) can potentially probe low-mass black holes (BHs) in host galaxies that might not adhere to bulge or stellar-dispersion relationships. At least initially, TDEs can also reveal super-Eddington accretion. X-ray spectroscopy can potentially constrain BH masses, and reveal ionized outflows associated with super-Eddington accretion. Our analysis of XMM-Newton X-ray observations of the TDE AT2021ehb, around 300 days post-disruption, reveals a soft spectrum and can be fit with a combination of multicolor disk blackbody and power-law components. Using two independent disk models with properties suited to TDEs, we estimate a BH mass at M ≃ 105.5M⊙, indicating AT2021ehb may expose the elusive low-mass end of the nuclear BH population. These models offer simple yet robust characterization; more complicated models are not required, but provide important context and caveats in the limit of moderately sensitive data. If disk reflection is included, the disk flux is lower and inferred BH masses are ∼0.35 dex higher. Simple wind formulations imply an extremely fast vout = −0.2c outflow and obviate a disk continuum component. Assuming a unity filling factor, such a wind implies an instantaneous mass outflow rate of . Such a high rate suggests that the filling factor for the ultrafast outflow (UFO) must be extremely low, and/or the UFO phase is ephemeral. We discuss the strengths and limitations of our analysis and avenues for future observations of TDEs.

总结: <br />研究了活跃星系核（AGNs）的宽发射线区域（BLR），发现使用新的技术——速度分辨电离映射，可以发现不对称的BLR结构。通过分析光谱监测数据发现，氢线比例与连续谱呈反相关，与宽发射线速度延迟呈正相关。一些线比例轮廓不符合对称的BLR预期，提示红移和蓝移气体云可能不等距离于超大质量黑洞。这种不对称的几何结构可能代表一种形成痕迹，为AGNs的演化提供新视角，并影响超大质量黑洞质量的测量。 <div>
Broad emission lines of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) originate from the broad-line region (BLR), consisting of dense gas clouds in orbit around an accreting supermassive black hole. Understanding the geometry and kinematics of this region is crucial for gaining insights into the physics and evolution of AGNs. Conventional velocity-resolved reverberation mapping may face challenges in disentangling the degeneracy between intricate motion and geometry of this region. To address this challenge, new key constraints are required. Here, we report the discovery of an asymmetric BLR using a novel technique: velocity-resolved ionization mapping, which can map the distance of emitting gas clouds by measuring Hydrogen line ratios at different velocities. By analyzing spectroscopic monitoring data, we find that the Balmer decrement is anticorrelated with the continuum and correlated with the lags across broad emission line velocities. Some line ratio profiles deviate from the expectations for a symmetrically virialized BLR, suggesting that the redshifted and blueshifted gas clouds may not be equidistant from the supermassive black hole (SMBH). This asymmetric geometry might represent a formation imprint, provide new perspectives on the evolution of AGNs, and influence SMBH mass measurements.

<title>Should Zeros Count? Modeling the Galaxy–Globular Cluster Scaling Relation with(out) Zero-inflated Count Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The scaling relation between the size of a galaxy’s globular cluster (GC) population (NGC) and the galaxy’s stellar mass (M*) is usually described with a continuous, linear model, but in reality it is a count relationship that should be modeled as such. For massive galaxies, a negative binomial (NB) model has been shown to describe the data well, but it is unclear how the scaling relation behaves at low galaxy masses where a substantial portion of galaxies have NGC = 0. In this work, we test the utility of Poisson and NB models for describing the low-mass end of the NGC−M* scaling relation. We introduce the use of zero-inflated versions of these models, which allow for larger zero populations (e.g., galaxies without GCs) than would otherwise be predicted. We evaluate our models with a variety of predictive model comparison methods, including predictive intervals, the leave-one-out cross-validation criterion, and posterior predictive comparisons. We find that the NB model is consistent with our data, but the naive Poisson is not. Moreover, we find that zero inflation of the models is not necessary to describe the population of low-mass galaxies that lack GCs, suggesting that a single formation and evolutionary process acts over all galaxy masses. Under the NB model, there does not appear to be anything unique about the lack of GCs in many low-mass galaxies; they are simply the low-mass extension of the larger NGC−M* scaling relation.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report high-precision, multiwavelength linear-polarization observations of the bright B9 (or A0) star ϵ Sagittarii. The polarization shows the distinctive wavelength dependence expected for a rapidly rotating star. Analysis of the polarization data reveals an angular rotation rate ω (=Ω/Ωcrit) of 0.995 or greater, the highest yet measured for a star in our Galaxy. An additional wavelength-independent polarization component is attributed to electron scattering in a low-density, edge-on gas disk that also produces the narrow absorption components seen in the spectrum. Several properties of the star (polarization due to a disk, occasional weak Hα emission, and multiple periodicities seen in space photometry) resemble those of Be stars, but the level of activity in all cases is much lower than that of typical Be stars. The stellar properties are inconsistent with single-rotating-star evolutionary tracks, indicating that it is most likely a product of binary interaction. The star is an excellent candidate for observation by interferometry, optical spectropolarimetry to detect the Öhman effect, and ultraviolet polarimetry, any of which would allow its extreme rotation to be tested and its stellar properties to be refined.

<title>Modeling the Far-infrared Polarization Spectrum of a High-mass Star-forming Cloud</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The polarization spectrum, or wavelength dependence of the polarization fraction, of interstellar dust emission provides important insights into the grain alignment mechanism of interstellar dust grains. We investigate the far-infrared polarization spectrum of a realistic simulated high-mass star-forming cloud under various models of grain alignment and emission. We find that neither a homogeneous grain alignment model nor a grain alignment model that includes collisional dealignment is able to produce the falling spectrum seen in observations. On the other hand, we find that a grain alignment model with grain alignment efficiency dependent on local temperature is capable of producing a falling spectrum that is in qualitative agreement with observations of OMC-1. For the model most in agreement with OMC-1, we find no correlation between the temperature and the slope of the polarization spectrum. However, we do find a positive correlation between the column density and the slope of the polarization spectrum. We suggest this latter correlation to be the result of wavelength-dependent polarization by absorption.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The observability of afterglows from binary neutron star mergers occurring within active galactic nuclei (AGN) disks is investigated. We perform 3D GRMHD simulations of a postmerger system and follow the jet launched from the compact object. We use semianalytic techniques to study the propagation of the blast wave powered by the jet through an AGN disk-like external environment, extending to distances beyond the disk scale height. The synchrotron emission produced by the jet-driven forward shock is calculated to obtain the afterglow emission. The observability of this emission at different frequencies is assessed by comparing it to the quiescent AGN emission. In the scenarios where the afterglow could temporarily outshine the AGN, we find that detection will be more feasible at higher frequencies (≳1014 Hz) and the electromagnetic counterpart could manifest as a fast variability in the AGN emission, on timescales less than a day.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Classical T Tauri Stars (CTTSs) are highly variable stars that possess gas- and dust-rich disks from which planets form. Much of their variability is driven by mass accretion from the surrounding disk, a process that is still not entirely understood. A multiepoch optical spectral monitoring campaign of four CTTSs (TW Hya, RU Lup, BP Tau, and GM Aur) was conducted along with contemporaneous Hubble Space Telescope (HST) UV spectra and ground-based photometry in an effort to determine accretion characteristics and gauge variability in this sample. Using an accretion flow model, we find that the magnetospheric truncation radius varies between 2.5 and 5 R⋆ across all of our observations. There is also significant variability in all emission lines studied, particularly Hα, Hβ, and Hγ. Using previously established relationships between line luminosity and accretion, we find that, on average, most lines reproduce accretion rates consistent with accretion shock modeling of HST spectra to within 0.5 dex. Looking at individual contemporaneous observations, however, these relationships are less accurate, suggesting that variability trends differ from the trends of the population and that these empirical relationships should be used with caution in studies of variability.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
To gain a deeper understanding of the intricate process of filament eruption, we present a case study of a filament splitting and erupting by using multiwavelength data of the Solar Dynamics Observatory. It is found that the magnetic reconnection between the filament and the surrounding magnetic loops resulted in the formation of two new filaments, which erupted successively. The observational evidence of magnetic reconnection, such as the obvious brightening at the junction of two different magnetic structures, the appearance of a bidirectional jet, and subsequent filament splitting, were clearly observed. Even though the two newly formed filaments experienced failed eruptions, three obvious dimmings were observed at the footpoints of the filaments during their eruptions. Based on these observations, it is suggested that magnetic reconnection is the trigger mechanism for the splitting of the original filament and the subsequent eruption of the newly formed filaments. Furthermore, the process of filament splitting dominated by magnetic reconnection can shed light on the explanation of double-decker filament formation.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We investigate the centrifugal acceleration in an axisymmetric pulsar magnetosphere under the ideal MHD approximation. We solve the field-aligned equations of motion for flows inside the current sheet with finite thickness. We find that flows coming into the vicinity of a Y-point become super fast. The centrifugal acceleration takes place efficiently, and most of the Poynting energy is converted into kinetic energy. However, the super-fast flow does not provide enough centrifugal drift current to open the magnetic field. Opening of the magnetic field is possible by the plasmas that are accelerated in the azimuthal direction with a large Lorentz factor in the closed-field region. We find that this acceleration takes place if the field strength increases toward the Y-point from inside. The accelerated plasma is transferred from the closed-field region to the open-field region by magnetic reconnection with plasmoid emission. We also estimate the Lorentz factor to be reached in the centrifugal wind.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the first detection of the ground-state OH emission line at 1612 MHz toward the prototypical carbon-rich planetary nebula (PN) NGC 7027, utilizing the newly installed ultrawideband (UWB) receiver of the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). This emission is likely to originate from the interface of the neutral shell and the ionized region. The other three ground-state OH lines at 1665, 1667, and 1721 MHz are observed in absorption and have velocities well matched with that of HCO+ absorption. We infer that the OH absorption is from the outer shell of NGC 7027, although the possibility that they are associated with a foreground cloud cannot be completely ruled out. All the OH lines exhibit a single blueshifted component with respect to the central star. The formation of OH in carbon-rich environments might be via photodissociation-induced chemical processes. Our observations offer significant constraints for chemical simulations, and they underscore the potent capability of the UWB receiver of FAST to search for nascent PNe.

We study the anisotropy of centroid and integrated intensity maps with synthetic observations. We perform postprocess radiative transfer including the optically thick regime that was not covered in Hernández-Padilla et al. We consider the emission in various CO molecular lines that range from optically thin to optically thick (12CO, 13CO, C18O, and C17O). The results for the velocity centroids are similar to those in the optically thin case. For instance, the anisotropy observed can be attributed to the Alfvén mode, which dominates over the slow and fast modes when the line of sight is at a high inclination with respect to the mean magnetic field. A few differences arise in the models with higher opacity, where some dependence on the sonic Mach number becomes evident. In contrast to the optically thin case, maps of integrated intensity become more anisotropic in optically thick lines. In this situation the scales probed are restricted, due to absorption, to smaller scales, which are known to be more anisotropic. We discuss how the sonic Mach number can affect the latter results, with highly supersonic cases exhibiting a lower degree of anisotropy.

总结: 
本文介绍了使用Karl G. Jansky非常大阵列(VLA)对GOODS-N区域进行了首次高分辨率、高频率的射电连续波测量。使用X波段(8-12 GHz)接收器，共耗时380小时观测，获得了平均rms噪声为671 nJy beam−1，角分辨率为0.″22的10 GHz图。同时也生成了角分辨率为1.″0，rms噪声为968 nJy beam−1的低分辨率图。目录中包含了256个射电源的检测信息，其中假源比例为0.75%。通过蒙特卡洛模拟得出了目录的完整性修正。研究发现，在GOODS-N区域的10 GHz射电源计数与数值模拟/模型的预测以及1.4和3 GHz的射电源计数预期大体一致。 <div>
We present the first high-resolution, high-frequency radio continuum survey that fully maps an extragalactic deep field: the 10 GHz survey of the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey-North (GOODS-N) field. This is a Large Program of the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) that allocated 380 hr of observations using the X-band (8–12 GHz) receivers, leading to a 10 GHz mosaic of the GOODS-N field with an average rms noise σn = 671 nJy beam−1 and angular resolution θ1/2 = 0.″22 across 297 arcmin2. To maximize the brightness sensitivity we also produce a low-resolution mosaic with θ1/2 = 1.″0 and σn = 968 nJy beam−1, from which we derive our master catalog containing 256 radio sources detected with peak signal-to-noise ratio ≥ 5. Radio source size and flux density estimates from the high-resolution mosaic are provided in the master catalog as well. The total fraction of spurious sources in the catalog is 0.75%. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to derive completeness corrections of the catalog. We find that the 10 GHz radio source counts in the GOODS-N field agree, in general, with predictions from numerical simulations/models and expectations from 1.4 and 3 GHz radio counts.

<div> 关键词: 超新星遗迹，各向异性，功率谱，X射线图像，密度估计<br />
总结:<br />
本研究提出了一种通过计算高分辨率图像的功率谱来测量超新星遗迹中各向异性的技术。研究团队通过开发3D流体动力学模型生成合成X射线图像，并从中提取功率谱。这些功率谱展现出在早期时期的小尺度长度上的激增，表明了一种不符合Kolmogorov湍流的趋势，但在后期转变为Kolmogorov湍流。对Tycho超新星遗迹的观测确认了模型的功率谱，并且提供了该遗迹周围气体密度的估计和外部喷射物密度分布的估计。此外，还观察到了大尺度上额外的功率，这可能为爆炸机制本身提供了重要线索。 <div>
Supernova remnants (SNRs) exhibit varying degrees of anisotropy, which have been extensively modeled using numerical methods. We implement a technique to measure anisotropies in SNRs by calculating power spectra from their high-resolution images. To test this technique, we develop 3D hydrodynamical models of SNRs and generate synthetic X-ray images from them. Power spectra extracted from both the 3D models and the synthetic images exhibit the same dominant angular scale, which separates large-scale features from small-scale features due to hydrodynamic instabilities. The angular power spectrum at small length scales during relatively early times is too steep to be consistent with Kolmogorov turbulence, but it transitions to Kolmogorov turbulence at late times. As an example of how this technique can be applied to observations, we extract a power spectrum from a Chandra observation of Tycho’s SNR and compare with our models. Our predicted power spectrum picks out the angular scale of Tycho’s fleecelike structures and also agrees with the small-scale power seen in Tycho. We use this to extract an estimate for the density of the circumstellar gas (n ∼ 0.28 cm−3), consistent with previous measurements of this density by other means. The power spectrum also provides an estimate of the density profile of the outermost ejecta. Moreover, we observe additional power at large scales, which may provide important clues about the explosion mechanism itself.

<br />总结: 该研究利用超级姬巨大望远镜(HSC)和加拿大-法国-夏威夷望远镜大面积U波段深度调查的成像数据结合史隆数字天空调查(SDSS)中的U-dropout星系，研究了红移为z∼3的67个类星体周围的局部密度环境。研究发现，类星体周围的密度分布与U-dropout星系基本一致，有三个类星体与原团块候选体相关。根据宇宙演化模型的研究结果表明，这一时期的类星体位于 typcial mass 的暗物质晕中。此外，研究还调查了当地星系过密度与紫外线亮度、黑洞质量和类星体邻近区域尺寸之间的相关性，但没有发现显著的相关性。最后，研究发现在距离类星体0.51±0.05物理Mpc的地方，暗U-dropout星系的局部密度低于明亮U-dropout星系，其中类星体紫外辐射强度是背景紫外辐射的30倍。研究论证了在紫外辐射强烈的短距离处可能会抑制星系形成，即使是在大质量暗物质晕中也是如此。 <br /> <div>
We examine the local density environments around 67 quasars at z ∼ 3 by combining the imaging data of Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program and Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope Large Area U-band Deep Survey over about 20 deg2. Our measurements exploit U-dropout galaxies in the vicinities of quasars taken from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find that the quasars have an indistinguishable surrounding density distribution from the U-dropout galaxies and that three quasars are associated with protocluster candidates within a projected separation of 3′. According to a halo evolutionary model, our results suggest that quasars at this epoch occupy haloes with a typical mass of . We also investigate the dependence of the local galaxy overdensity on ultraviolet (UV) luminosities, black hole masses, and proximity zone sizes of the quasars, but no statistically significant correlation was found. Finally, we find that the local density of faint U-dropout galaxies are lower than that of bright U-dropout galaxies within a projected distance of 0.51 ± 0.05 physical Mpc, where the quasar UV radiation is 30 times more intense than background UV radiation. We argue that photoevaporation may suppress galaxy formation at short distances where the quasar UV intensity is strong, even in massive haloes.

总结:<br /><br />这项研究使用 CoRoT 空间任务观测了六颗光谱类型为 F 到 M 的恒星，分析了它们的星斑特征和旋转动力学。研究发现，这些恒星的星斑特征与太阳型恒星相似，而且它们的差分旋转随着平均恒星自转周期的增加而减小，这意味着随着恒星老化，其差分旋转减小。此外，这六颗恒星根据星斑通量的不同分为两类，提供了对恒星磁活动的新线索。 <div>
While direct magnetic field measurements are rare for slowly rotating stars, spots observed during planetary transits provide a potential indicator of magnetic activity on stellar surfaces. Moreover, the rotation of the stellar surface can be probed by monitoring the spots’ position with time in subsequent transits. This study investigates the dynamic interplay of rotational shear and stellar rotation rate in six stars of spectral types F to M, all hosting exoplanets observed by the CoRoT space mission, except for one binary star from Kepler. The analysis, facilitated by the ECLIPSE code, unveils the physical properties of stellar spots, including radius, intensity, temperature, and position. The five CoRoT stars exhibit spot characteristics consistent with those observed in solar type stars. The determination of a spot longitude during different transits allows for the inference of the star’s differential rotation profile, revealing a decreasing trend of rotational shear with the mean stellar rotation period, given by . This implies that, at least for slow rotators (mean rotation period >5 days), as stars age, their differential rotation decreases. Additionally, the six stars analyzed here seem to fall into two categories, according to their spot flux deficit: those with ΔFspot > 0.005 and those with ΔFspot < 0.002.

<div> 高质量X射线双星，LS I+61°303，由一个质量巨大的Be星和一个快速旋转的中子星组成。它的光谱能量分布横跨多个波长，被归类为γ射线双星系统。通过对Fermi大面积望远镜观测LS I+61°303的分析，科学家们确认了先前多波段观测中观测到的轨道、超轨道和轨道-超轨道拍频的三个周期性信号，并且发现了一个额外的周期信号。这个新发现的信号表现出大约26.3天的周期，在大约7σ的置信水平下。此外，新信号的功率谱峰随能量范围0.1-0.3、0.3-1.0和1.0-500.0 GeV的增加而逐渐减小。有趣的是，在奥文斯谷无线电天文台40米望远镜的数据中也发现了一个类似周期的信号。研究人员认为，新发现的周期信号可能源自轨道周期和逆行恒星岁差周期之间的耦合关系。<br /><br />总结:
1. LS I+61°303是一个高质量X射线双星系统
2. Fermi大面积望远镜观测确认了多个周期性信号
3. 新发现的周期信号具有26.3天周期，且在不同能量范围内表现出不同的功率谱特征

LS I+61°303 is a high-mass X-ray binary system comprising a massive Be star and a rapidly rotating neutron star. Its spectral energy distribution across multiwavelengths categorizes it as a γ-ray binary system. In our analysis of LS I+61°303 using Fermi Large Area Telescope observations, we not only confirmed the three previously discussed periodicities of orbital, superorbital, and orbital–superorbital beat periods observed in multiwavelength observations, but also identified an additional periodic signal. This newly discovered signal exhibits a period of ∼26.3 days at a ∼7σ confidence level. Moreover, the power spectrum peak of the new signal gradually decreases as the energy increases across the energy ranges of 0.1–0.3, 0.3–1.0, and 1.0–500.0 GeV. Interestingly, a potential signal with a similar period was found in data obtained from the Owens Valley Radio Observatory 40 m telescope. We suggest that the newly discovered periodic signal may originate from a coupling between the orbital period and the retrograde stellar precession period.

Detecting large-scale flux ropes (FRs) embedded in interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) and assessing their geoeffectiveness are essential, since they can drive severe space weather. At 1 au, these FRs have an average duration of 1 day. Their most common magnetic features are large, smoothly rotating magnetic fields. Their manual detection has become a relatively common practice over decades, although visual detection can be time-consuming and subject to observer bias. Our study proposes a pipeline that utilizes two supervised binary classification machine-learning models trained with solar wind magnetic properties to automatically detect large-scale FRs and additionally determine their geoeffectiveness. The first model is used to generate a list of autodetected FRs. Using the properties of the southward magnetic field, the second model determines the geoeffectiveness of FRs. Our method identifies 88.6% and 80% of large-scale ICMEs (duration ≥ 1 day) observed at 1 au by the Wind and the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory missions, respectively. While testing with continuous solar wind data obtained from Wind, our pipeline detected 56 of the 64 large-scale ICMEs during the 2008–2014 period (recall = 0.875), but also many false positives (precision = 0.56), as we do not take into account any additional solar wind properties other than the magnetic properties. We find an accuracy of 0.88 when estimating the geoeffectiveness of the autodetected FRs using our method. Thus, in space-weather nowcasting and forecasting at L1 or any planetary missions, our pipeline can be utilized to offer a first-order detection of large-scale FRs and their geoeffectiveness.

<title>Multivariate Predictors of Lyman Continuum Escape. I. A Survival Analysis of the Low-redshift Lyman Continuum Survey*</title>

<div> 关键词: galaxies, reionization, Lyman continuum photons, fesc, multivariate predictors<br />
总结: <br />
这篇文章研究了银河系是如何对宇宙进行再电离的，通过开发和分析了对逸出分数（fesc）的新的多变量预测模型，使用了Cox比例风险模型进行预测，发现最重要的预测变量是Lyman系列吸收线的等效宽度（EW）和紫外线尘埃衰减。文章还强调了H i吸收的重要性，特别是对最强的LyC发射体来说。预测模型对于高红移也具有适用性，证实了ΣSFR和[O iii]/[O ii]在预测fesc方面的重要性。总体来说，这些多变量模型为在高红移时预测fesc提供了一个有希望的工具。 <div>
To understand how galaxies reionized the Universe, we must determine how the escape fraction of Lyman continuum (LyC) photons (fesc) depends on galaxy properties. Using the z ∼ 0.3 Low-redshift Lyman Continuum Survey (LzLCS), we develop and analyze new multivariate predictors of fesc. These predictions use the Cox proportional hazards model, a survival analysis technique that incorporates both detections and upper limits. Our best model predicts the LzLCS fesc detections with an rms scatter of 0.31 dex, better than single-variable correlations. According to ranking techniques, the most important predictors of fesc are the equivalent width (EW) of Lyman-series absorption lines and the UV dust attenuation, which track line-of-sight absorption due to H i and dust. The H i absorption EW is uniquely crucial for predicting fesc for the strongest LyC emitters, which show properties similar to weaker LyC emitters and whose high fesc may therefore result from favorable orientation. In the absence of H i information, star formation rate surface density (ΣSFR) and [O iii]/[O ii] ratio are the most predictive variables and highlight the connection between feedback and fesc. We generate a model suitable for z > 6, which uses only the UV slope, ΣSFR, and [O iii]/[O ii]. We find that ΣSFR is more important in predicting fesc at higher stellar masses, whereas [O iii]/[O ii] plays a greater role at lower masses. We also analyze predictions for other parameters, such as the ionizing-to-nonionizing flux ratio and Lyα escape fraction. These multivariate models represent a promising tool for predicting fesc at high redshift.

Eruptive mass loss of massive stars prior to supernova (SN) explosion is key to understanding their evolution and end fate. An observational signature of pre-SN mass loss is the detection of an early, short-lived peak prior to the radioactive-powered peak in the lightcurve of the SN. This is usually attributed to the SN shock passing through an extended envelope or circumstellar medium. Such an early peak is common for double-peaked Type IIb SNe with an extended hydrogen envelope but uncommon for normal Type Ibc SNe with very compact progenitors. In this paper, we systematically study a sample of 14 double-peaked Type Ibc SNe out of 475 Type Ibc SNe detected by the Zwicky Transient Facility. The rate of these events is ∼3%–9% of Type Ibc SNe. A strong correlation is seen between the peak brightness of the first and the second peak. We perform a holistic analysis of this sample’s photometric and spectroscopic properties. We find that six SNe have ejecta mass less than 1.5 M⊙. Based on the nebular spectra and lightcurve properties, we estimate that the progenitor masses for these are less than ∼12 M⊙. The rest have an ejecta mass >2.4 M⊙ and a higher progenitor mass. This sample suggests that the SNe with low progenitor masses undergo late-time binary mass transfer. Meanwhile, the SNe with higher progenitor masses are consistent with wave-driven mass loss or pulsation-pair instability-driven mass-loss simulations.

Signals generated by dust impacting spacecraft can be detected by electric field instruments. These signals have been simulated by numerous models. However, few models can accurately characterize the expansion of the plasma cloud generated by dust impact. The COMSOL model presented in this paper provides a way to understand the expansion properties of ions and electrons. The model can also be used to analyze the various expected waveforms of dust impact signals as a function of different parameters, such as the spacecraft voltage and the ambient plasma temperature. The results show that close to 50% of ions and electrons in the impact plasma cloud are collected by spacecraft at weak spacecraft potentials and that a fraction of the ions is still collected rather than all of them streaming away from the impact location at VSC > 0 V. The model also confirms that in the expanding plasma cloud, ions are in the form of plumes, while electrons diffuse in an isotropic manner.

Ionization drives important chemical and dynamical processes within protoplanetary disks, including the formation of organics and water in the cold midplane and the transportation of material via accretion and magnetohydrodynamic flows. Understanding these ionization-driven processes is crucial for understanding disk evolution and planet formation. We use new and archival Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of HCO+, H13CO+, and N2H+ to produce the first forward-modeled 2D ionization constraints for the DM Tau protoplanetary disk. We include ionization from multiple sources and explore the disk chemistry under a range of ionizing conditions. Abundances from our 2D chemical models are postprocessed using non-LTE radiative transfer, visibility sampling, and imaging, and are compared directly to the observed radial emission profiles. The observations are best fit by a modestly reduced cosmic-ray ionization rate (ζCR ∼10−18 s−1) and a hard X-ray spectrum (hardness ratio = 0.3), which we associate with stellar flaring conditions. Our best-fit model underproduces emission in the inner disk, suggesting that there may be an additional mechanism enhancing ionization in DM Tau’s inner disk. Overall, our findings highlight the complexity of ionization in protoplanetary disks and the need for high-resolution multiline studies.

总结: <br /><br />这项研究分析了在月球磁层边界出现Kelvin-Helmholtz不稳定性（KHI）的情况，通过对ARTEMIS卫星观测数据的分析发现，KHI的发生率约为15％，低于侧磁层边界的发生率。研究还发现，KHI的发生率随着磁声马赫数、阿尔芬马赫数、太阳风速度和动压的增加而减少，仅与太阳风密度略微正相关。与白昼侧磁层边界不同，在月球距离磁层边界，KHI的发生率随太阳风速度增加而减少。此外，KHI的发生率也随着磁场的振幅减少，并受到磁场方向的影响。根据磁场钟角度的变化，KHI的发生率在钟角度为零时达到最大值，约为24％。这些统计结果基本与目前接受的KHI线性理论一致，为理解磁层边界KHI的激发和演化、尾部磁层边界等离子体输运过程做出了贡献。 <div>
Kelvin–Helmholtz waves can be observed frequently at the near-Earth magnetopause and play an important role in the transport of particles, momentum, and energy from the solar wind to the magnetosphere. This work analyzes the occurrence of Kelvin–Helmholtz instability (KHI) at lunar distance magnetopause, which has not been thoroughly studied currently based on Acceleration, Reconnection, Turbulence, and Electrodynamics of the Moon's Interaction with the Sun satellite observations, and it also investigates the effect of the upstream solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). Statistical results show that (1) the occurrence rate is about 15% of the time at lunar distance, lower than at the flank magnetopause, and (2) the occurrence rate decreases with the magnetoacoustic Mach number, Alfvén Mach number, solar wind velocity, and dynamic pressure but only shows a slightly positive correlation with solar wind density. Unlike at the dayside magnetopause, the occurrence rate of KHI diminishes as the solar wind velocity increases at the lunar distance magnetopause, and (3) the occurrence rate decreases with IMF amplitude and is influenced by IMF orientation. As a function of the IMF clock angle, the occurrence rate reaches its maximum at ∼24% when the clock angle is zero. The statistical results are basically consistent with the currently accepted linear theory of KHI, except for a lower rate for higher-speed solar wind. This work contributes to understanding the excitation and evolution of KHI along the magnetopause and plasma transport process in the tail magnetopause.

<div> Fermi Large Area Telescope, Cyg X-3, γ-ray, orbital modulation, anisotropic Compton scattering<br />
<br />研究团队利用Fermi Large Area Telescope对Cyg X-3的γ射线数据进行建模分析。他们发现该系统的γ射线在高通量时表现出明显的轨道调制特征，这种调制与先前的模型相吻合，可以解释为由喷流中的相对论电子对供体黑体辐射进行非均向康普顿散射所致。然而，他们发现如果喷流与旋转黑洞的自旋轴对齐，将会发生geodetic precession，其周期约为50年，但这一现象在γ和无线电数据中未被观测到。因此，研究团队提出另一种模型，认为喷流的平均方向虽然与轨道对齐，但受到供体恒星风的推力而弯曲，并以轨道周期进行进动。最终的γ射线调制现象则可以解释为自发辐射的多普勒增强效应。尽管该模型也能很好地拟合数据，但拟合的弯曲角却远大于基于当前已知的双星和恒星风参数的理论值。因此，当前的理论模型存在不足之处，需要进一步研究以找到正确的模型。 <br /><br />总结: Fermi Large Area Telescope对Cyg X-3的γ射线数据进行模型分析，发现γ射线表现出轨道调制特征，提出两种模型解释，但存在理论不足，需要进一步研究。 <div>
We model the currently available γ-ray data on Cyg X-3 from the Fermi Large Area Telescope. Thanks to Cyg X-3’s very strong γ-ray activity during 2018–2021, the data quality has significantly improved. We study the strong orbital modulation of the γ-rays observed at high γ-ray fluxes. The modulation, as found earlier, is well modeled by anisotropic Compton scattering of the donor blackbody emission by relativistic electrons in a jet strongly misaligned with respect to the orbital axis. We confirm that this model fits well both the average γ-ray modulation light curve and the spectrum. However, we find that if the jet were aligned with the spin axis of a rotating black hole, it would undergo geodetic precession with a period of ∼50 yr. However, its presence is ruled out by both the γ-ray and radio data. Therefore, we consider an alternative model in which the average jet direction is aligned, but it is bent outside the orbit owing to the thrust of the donor stellar wind, and thus precesses at the orbital period. The γ-ray modulation then appears as a result of the variable Doppler boosting of synchrotron self-Compton jet emission. This model also fits the data well. However, the fitted bending angle is much larger than the theoretical one based on the binary and wind parameters as currently known. Thus, both models disagree with important aspects of our current theoretical understanding of the system. We discuss possible ways to find the correct model.

这项研究报告了来自脉冲星PSR J1849-0001的脉冲星风星云（PWN）G32.64+0.53可能的GeV γ射线发射。研究利用了Fermi大面积望远镜Pass 8约14.7年的数据进行分析。研究发现，源的位置和光谱与X射线和TeV能量段的相匹配，因此我们认为GeV γ射线源表明了PWN G32.64+0.53。我们使用一个基于时间的单区模型解释了宽频谱能量分布（SED），假设目标源的多波段非热发射是通过电子/正电子的同步辐射和反康普顿散射（ICS）产生的。我们的发现表明，该模型在很大程度上阐明了观测到的SED。这些结果支持了γ射线源源自由PSR J1849-0001推动的PWN G32.64+0.53的假设。此外，TeV能带中的γ射线可能是通过星云内的电子/正电子通过ICS产生的。 <div>
In this study, we report the likely GeV γ-ray emissions originating from the pulsar PSR J1849-0001's pulsar wind nebula (PWN) G32.64+0.53. Our analysis covers approximately 14.7 yr of data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope Pass 8. The position of the source and its spectrum matches those in X-ray and TeV energy bands, so we propose that the GeV γ-ray source is indicative of PWN G32.64+0.53. We interpret the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) using a time-dependent one-zone model, which assumes that the multiband nonthermal emission of the target source can be generated by synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton scattering (ICS) of the electrons/positrons. Our findings demonstrate that the model substantially elucidates the observed SED. These results lend support to the hypothesis that the γ-ray source originates from the PWN G32.64+0.53 powered by PSR J1849-0001. Furthermore, the γ-rays in TeV bands are likely generated by electrons/positrons within the nebula through ICS.

<div> 关键词: Fermi gamma-ray bursts, spectral evolution, single-pulse morphology, citizen science, internal/external shocks

总结: 
Fermi伽玛射线暴的光谱演化得以研究，发展了一种新算法来测试单脉冲形态，开展了公民科学测试以评估光度曲线形态和光谱演化。研究发现，单峰暴往往具有持续衰减的峰能量或硬到软的光谱演化，而多峰暴则有非单调下降的峰频率。这一发现与内部/外部冲击模型一致，并表明一些单脉冲暴与特别高密度的环境有关。<br /><br /> <div>
We analyze the spectral evolution of 62 bright Fermi gamma-ray bursts with large enough signal-to-noise to allow for time-resolved spectral analysis. We develop a new algorithm to test for single-pulse morphology that is insensitive to the specific shape of pulses. Instead, it only checks whether or not there are multiple, isolated, or statistical significant peaks in the light curve. In addition, we carry out a citizen science test to assess light-curve morphology and spectral evolution. We find that, no matter the adopted assessment method, bursts characterized by single-peaked prompt emission light curves have a greater tendency to also have a consistently decaying peak energy or hard-to-soft spectral evolution. This contrasts with the behavior of multipeaked bursts, for which the tendency is to have a peak frequency that is not monotonically decreasing. We discuss this finding in the theoretical framework of internal/external shocks and find it to be consistent with at least some single-pulse bursts associated with particularly high-density environments.

We present X-ray polarimetry observations from the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) of three low spectral peak and one intermediate spectral peak blazars, namely 3C 273, 3C 279, 3C 454.3, and S5 0716+714. For none of these objects was IXPE able to detect X-ray polarization at the 3σ level. However, we placed upper limits on the polarization degree at ∼10%–30%. The undetected polarizations favor models where the X-ray band is dominated by unpolarized photons upscattered by relativistic electrons in the jets of blazars, although hadronic models are not completely eliminated. We discuss the X-ray polarization upper limits in the context of our contemporaneous multiwavelength polarization campaigns.

总结:
该研究提出了一个用于银河系普通射电脉冲星的人口综合模型，考虑了最新的磁转演化过程。模型考虑了脉冲星的自旋减速、以磁力线为主的磁层和磁场强度及倾角的衰减。通过Markov Chain Monte Carlo技术将模拟的脉冲星人口与大型观测样本进行了拟合，比较了四个主要观测指标的分布。研究测试了两种B场衰减情形，并发现指数模型能更好地拟合观测到的脉冲星分布，暗示脉冲星B场在演化中出现了显著的衰减。 <div>
We present a population synthesis model for normal radio pulsars in the Galaxy incorporating the latest developments in the field and the magnetorotational evolution processes. Our model considers spin-down with a force-free magnetosphere and the decay of the magnetic field strength and its inclination angle. The simulated pulsar population is fit to a large observation sample that covers the majority of radio surveys using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique. We compare the distributions of four major observables—spin period (P), spin-down rate ( ), dispersion measure, and radio flux density—using accurate high-dimensional Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistics. We test two B-field decay scenarios, an exponential model motivated by ohmic dissipation and a power-law model motivated by the Hall effect. The former clearly provides a better fit, and it can successfully reproduce the observed pulsar distributions with a decay timescale of Myr. The result suggests that significant B-field decay in aged pulsars and ohmic dissipation could be the dominant process.

Using a representative sample of Milky Way (MW)–like galaxies from the TNG50 cosmological simulation, we investigate physical processes driving the formation of galactic disks. A disk forms as a result of the interplay between inflow and outflow carrying angular momentum in and out of the galaxy. Interestingly, the inflow and outflow have remarkably similar distributions of angular momentum, suggesting an exchange of angular momentum and/or outflow recycling, leading to continuous feeding of prealigned material from the corotating circumgalactic medium. We show that the disk formation in TNG50 is correlated with stellar bulge formation, in qualitative agreement with a recent theoretical model of disk formation facilitated by steep gravitational potentials. Disk formation is also correlated with the formation of a hot circumgalactic halo with around half of the inflow occurring at subsonic and transonic velocities corresponding to Mach numbers of ≲2. In the context of recent theoretical works connecting disk settling and hot halo formation, our results imply that the subsonic part of the inflow may settle into a disk while the remaining supersonic inflow will perturb this disk via the chaotic cold accretion. We find that disks tend to form when the host halos become more massive than ∼(1–2) × 1011M⊙, consistent with previous theoretical findings and observational estimates of the predisk protogalaxy remnant in the MW. Our results do not prove that either corotating outflow recycling, gravitational potential steepening, or hot halo formation cause disk formation, but they show that all these processes occur concurrently and may play an important role in disk growth.

总结:
NGC 330是一个年龄约40百万年的S型小麦哲伦云球状星团，通过对30颗恒星的高分辨率光谱分析，发现存在Be星，并且它们主要分布在分裂主序列的冷侧。这些目标星的自转速度测量结果表明，星团内存在两种类型的恒星：一类是自转速度快的Be星，另一类是温度较高、自转速度较慢的恒星。大多数目标的Hα发射线显示出Hδ光球吸收线的核心发射。样本中所计算的外壳参数显示，大多数观测恒星的倾角应低于75°。这些结果不仅确认了光度法探测到的Be星，还揭示了一些目标存在狭窄的Hα和Hδ特征，这些特征无法通过低分辨率光谱或光度法检测到。另外，观测还发现Hα线轮廓的不对称变化，这可能提供了关于分离盘几何形状的信息。观测还显示，一些暗弱目标存在星云Hα发射，强度足以影响光谱提取和用于评估Hα发射的窄带光度法。<br /><br /> <div>
We present an analysis of high-resolution optical spectra recorded for 30 stars of the split extended main-sequence turnoff of the young (∼40 Myr) Small Magellanic Cloud globular cluster NGC 330. Spectra were obtained with the Michigan/Magellan Fiber System and Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle spectrographs located on the Magellan-Clay 6.5 m telescope. These spectra revealed the presence of Be stars, occupying primarily the cool side of the split main sequence. Rotational velocity ( ) measurements for most of the targets are consistent with the presence of two populations of stars in the cluster: one made up of rapidly rotating Be stars ( km s−1) and the other consisting of warmer stars with slower rotation ( km s−1). Core emission in the Hδ photospheric lines was observed for most of the Hα emitters. The shell parameter computed for the targets in our sample indicates that most of the observed stars should have inclinations below 75°. These results confirm the detection of Be stars obtained through photometry but also reveal the presence of narrow Hα and Hδ features for some targets that cannot be detected with low-resolution spectroscopy or photometry. Asymmetry variability of Hα line profiles on the timescales of a few years is also observed and could provide information on the geometry of the decretion disks. Observations revealed the presence of nebular Hα emission, strong enough in faint targets to compromise the extraction of spectra and to impact narrow-band photometry used to assess the presence of Hα emission.

<br /><br />总结:
该篇文章研究了M和K矮星系中类地行星可能存在的气候和可居住性，发现K矮星行星具有更稳定的恒星环境，可能在“眼球”气候中发现湿润的日侧气候。同时，M和K矮星系中陆地行星都可能存在“边缘居住性”，但在M矮星系中更为普遍。这些发现有助于未来在M和K矮星系中寻找适合生命的行星。 <div>
M and K dwarf stars make up 86% of the stellar population and host many promising astronomical targets for detecting habitable climates in the near future. Of the two, M dwarfs currently offer greater observational advantages and are home to many of the most exciting observational discoveries in the last decade. But K dwarfs could offer even better prospects for detecting habitability by combining the advantages of a relatively dim stellar flux with a more stable stellar environment. Here we explore the climate regimes that are possible on Earth-like synchronous planets in M and K dwarf systems, and how they vary across the habitable zone. We focus on surface temperature patterns, water availability, and implications for habitability. We find that the risk of nightside cold trapping decreases with increased orbital radius and is overall lower for K dwarf planets. With reduced atmospheric shortwave absorption, K dwarf planets have higher dayside precipitation rates and less day-to-night moisture transport, resulting in lower nightside snow rates. These results imply a higher likelihood of detecting a planet with a moist dayside climate in a habitable “eyeball” climate regime orbiting a K dwarf star. We also show that “terminator habitability” can occur for both M and K dwarf land planets, but would likely be more prevalent in M dwarf systems. Planets in a terminator habitability regime tend to have slightly lower fractional habitability, but offer alternative advantages including instellation rates more comparable to Earth in regions that have temperatures amenable to life.

使用来自Gaia第三次数据释放的星星样本，研究了银河系的逃逸速度剖面，推断了银河系黑暗物质晕的性质，并得出了银河系的总质量。研究结果表明，银河系的总质量较低，但与其他最近的估计相吻合。 <div>
The escape velocity profile of the Milky Way offers a crucial and independent measurement of its underlying mass distribution and dark matter (DM) properties. Using a sample of stars from the third data release of Gaia with 6D kinematics and strict quality cuts, we obtain an escape velocity profile of the Milky Way from 4 to 11 kpc in Galactocentric radius. To infer the escape velocity in radial bins, we model the tail of the stellar speed distribution with both traditional power-law models and a new functional form that we introduce. While power-law models tend to rely on extrapolation to high speeds, we find our new functional form gives the most faithful representation of the observed distribution. Using this for the escape velocity profile, we constrain the properties of the Milky Way’s DM halo modeled as a Navarro–Frenck–White profile. Combined with constraints from the circular velocity at the solar position, we obtain a concentration and mass of and . This corresponds to a total Milky Way mass of , which is on the low end of the historic range of the galaxy’s mass, but in line with other recent estimates.

总结:
本研究探讨了中子俘获元素对星球化学相似性的影响，发现考虑中子俘获元素后，对于铁丰度在-0.1<[Fe/H]<0.1范围内的恒星，其化学相似率从约2.2％降低到0.4％，几乎减少了6倍。化学相似性与年龄和动力学相似性相关，但包括中子俘获元素似乎不会选择更相似于这些特征的恒星。这表明中子俘获元素包含与轻元素不同的信息，在银河丰度空间中至少增加了一个维度。这项工作强调了在对恒星进行化学表征时考虑中子俘获元素的重要性，并激励了改进光谱调查中的原子数据和测量的持续工作。 <div>
The observed chemical diversity of Milky Way stars places important constraints on Galactic chemical evolution and the mixing processes that operate within the interstellar medium. Recent works have found that the chemical diversity of disk stars is low. For example, the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) “chemical doppelganger rate,” or the rate at which random pairs of field stars appear as chemically similar as stars born together, is high, and the chemical distributions of APOGEE stars in some Galactic populations are well-described by two-dimensional models. However, limited attention has been paid to the heavy elements (Z > 30) in this context. In this work, we probe the potential for neutron-capture elements to enhance the chemical diversity of stars by determining their effect on the chemical doppelganger rate. We measure the doppelganger rate in GALactic Archaeology with HERMES DR3, with abundances rederived using The Cannon, and find that considering the neutron-capture elements decreases the doppelganger rate from ∼2.2% to 0.4%, nearly a factor of 6, for stars with −0.1 < [Fe/H] < 0.1. While chemical similarity correlates with similarity in age and dynamics, including neutron-capture elements does not appear to select stars that are more similar in these characteristics. Our results highlight that the neutron-capture elements contain information that is distinct from that of the lighter elements and thus add at least one dimension to Milky Way abundance space. This work illustrates the importance of considering the neutron-capture elements when chemically characterizing stars and motivates ongoing work to improve their atomic data and measurements in spectroscopic surveys.

总结: 
本研究使用逆向问题分析测量的行程时间, 推断太阳经度环流的内部轮廓, 并应用了一个HK21型约束，该约束要求经度环流输运的角动量应该朝赤道方向。结果显示，如果HK21制约约束正确描述太阳对流区内的物理机制，那么经度环流的轮廓是一个双细胞结构。推断得到的双细胞结构与不使用HK21型约束获得的单细胞结构相比，可以更或多或少地解释数据。然而，我们发现增加HK21型约束会降低平均核函数的分辨率。尽管目前很难确定太阳经度环流的大尺度形态，但我们的尝试突出了从理论和观测两方面研究太阳经度环流轮廓的相关性。 <br /><br /> <div>
We have carried out inversions of travel times as measured by Gizon et al. to infer the internal profile of the solar meridional circulation (MC). A linear inverse problem has been solved by the regularized least-squares method with a constraint that the angular momentum (AM) transport by MC should be equatorward (HK21-type constraint). Our motivation for using this constraint is based on the result by Hotta & Kusano (hereafter HK21), where the solar equator-fast rotation was reproduced successfully without any manipulation. The inversion result indicates that the MC profile is a double-cell structure if the so-called HK21 regime, in which AM transported by MC sustains the equator-fast rotation, correctly describes the physics inside the solar convective zone. The sum of the squared residuals computed with the inferred double-cell MC profile is comparable to that computed with the single-cell MC profile obtained when we exclude the HK21-type constraint, showing that both profiles can explain the data more or less at the same level. However, we also find that adding the HK21-type constraint degrades the resolution of the averaging kernels. Although it is difficult for us to determine the large-scale morphology of the solar MC at the moment, our attempt highlights the relevance of investigating the solar MC profile from both theoretical and observational perspectives.

We simulate galaxy properties and redshift estimation for SPHEREx, the next NASA Medium Class Explorer. To make robust models of the galaxy population and test the spectrophotometric redshift performance for SPHEREx, we develop a set of synthetic spectral energy distributions based on detailed fits to COSMOS2020 photometry spanning 0.1–8 μm. Given that SPHEREx obtains low-resolution spectra, emission lines will be important for some fraction of galaxies. Here, we expand on previous work, using better photometry and photometric redshifts from COSMOS2020 and tight empirical relations to predict robust emission-line strengths and ratios. A second galaxy catalog derived from the GAMA survey is generated to ensure the bright (mAB < 18 in the i band) sample is representative over larger areas. Using template fitting to estimate photometric continuum redshifts, we forecast the recovery of 19 million galaxies over 30,000 deg2 with redshifts better than σz < 0.003(1 + z), 445 million with σz < 0.1(1 + z), and 810 million with σz < 0.2(1 + z). We also find through idealized tests that emission-line information from spectrally dithered flux measurements can yield redshifts with accuracy beyond that implied by the naive SPHEREx channel resolution, motivating the development of a hybrid continuum–line redshift estimation approach.

We present a new suite of numerical simulations of the star-forming interstellar medium (ISM) in galactic disks using the TIGRESS-NCR framework. Distinctive aspects of our simulation suite are (1) sophisticated and comprehensive numerical treatments of essential physical processes including magnetohydrodynamics, self-gravity, and galactic differential rotation, as well as photochemistry, cooling, and heating coupled with direct ray-tracing UV radiation transfer and resolved supernova feedback and (2) wide parameter coverage including the variation in metallicity over , gas surface density Σgas ∼ 5–150 M⊙ pc−2, and stellar surface density Σstar ∼ 1–50 M⊙ pc−2. The range of emergent star formation rate surface density is ΣSFR ∼ 10−4–0.5 M⊙ kpc−2 yr−1, and ISM total midplane pressure is Ptot/kB = 103–106 cm−3 K, with Ptot equal to the ISM weight . For given Σgas and Σstar, we find . We provide an interpretation based on the pressure-regulated feedback-modulated (PRFM) star formation theory. The total midplane pressure consists of thermal, turbulent, and magnetic stresses. We characterize feedback modulation in terms of the yield ϒ, defined as the ratio of each stress to ΣSFR. The thermal feedback yield varies sensitively with both weight and metallicity as , while the combined turbulent and magnetic feedback yield shows weaker dependence . The reduction in ΣSFR at low metallicity is due mainly to enhanced thermal feedback yield, resulting from reduced attenuation of UV radiation. With the metallicity-dependent calibrations we provide, PRFM theory can be used for a new subgrid star formation prescription in cosmological simulations where the ISM is unresolved.

该研究利用Planck探测器提供的极化尘埃图和中性氢(CNM)分数的大面积图，研究了高纬度天空中极化尘埃分数(p353)与CNM分数(fCNM)之间的关系。他们发现p353与fCNM的相关性与p353和H i柱密度（NH i）关系有所不同。在低柱密度区域（NH i < 4 × 1020 cm−2）中，p353和NH i不相关，但p353与fCNM之间存在强烈的正相关性。通过数据驱动模型，作者得出了p353–fCNM相关性的拟合，以约束沿视线方向中介质的磁场失序程度。他们认为，相较于CNM，暖中性介质(WNM)中磁场的更大失序能最好解释了p353–fCNM的正相关性。模型进一步表明，与CNM相关的尘埃柱被认为是最大程度地极化，极化分数pCNM约为0.2，然后他们发现WNM相关的尘埃柱的平均极化分数为0.22pCNM。该研究结果为星际介质中中性相之间磁场相对失序程度提供了新的大面积约束，并与一个更具磁场排列的CNM柱形成于WNM杂乱的物理图景一致。

Utilizing Planck polarized dust emission maps at 353 GHz and large-area maps of the neutral hydrogen (H i) cold neutral medium (CNM) fraction (fCNM), we investigate the relationship between dust polarization fraction (p353) and fCNM in the diffuse high latitude ( ) sky. We find that the correlation between p353 and fCNM is qualitatively distinct from the p353–H i column density (NH i) relationship. At low column densities (NH i < 4 × 1020 cm−2) where p353 and NH i are uncorrelated, there is a strong positive p353–fCNM correlation. We fit the p353–fCNM correlation with data-driven models to constrain the degree of magnetic field disorder between phases along the line of sight. We argue that an increased magnetic field disorder in the warm neutral medium (WNM) relative to the CNM best explains the positive p353–fCNM correlation in diffuse regions. Modeling the CNM-associated dust column as being maximally polarized, with a polarization fraction pCNM ∼ 0.2, we find that the best-fit mean polarization fraction in the WNM-associated dust column is 0.22pCNM. The model further suggests that a significant fCNM-correlated fraction of the non-CNM column (an additional 18.4% of the H i mass on average) is also more magnetically ordered, and we speculate that the additional column is associated with the unstable medium. Our results constitute a new large-area constraint on the average relative disorder of magnetic fields between the neutral phases of the interstellar medium, and are consistent with the physical picture of a more magnetically aligned CNM column forming out of a disordered WNM.

<div> 黑洞，引力波，轨道离心率，LIGO，Virgo
<br /><br />总结:
引力波探测黑洞双星系统的轨道离心率是区分可能的双星起源的关键特征之一。然而，由于黑洞质量和离心率范围内偏心引力波波形的有限可用性，迄今为止检测轨道离心率一直很困难。本研究使用TEOBResumS-DALI、TEOBResumS-GIOTTO和TEOBResumSP模型评估了LIGO和Virgo天文台探测到的五次黑洞并合事件的离心率。该分析研究了参考频率为5赫兹时高达0.6的离心率，并结合了对高度偏心轨道的引力波发射至关重要的高阶引力波模式。由于先前对某些事件的轨道离心率存在微弱迹象，或者由于它们不寻常的质量和自旋，因此选择了这些双星系统。虽然其他研究发现了对某些事件轨道离心率的微弱证据，但我们的分析不支持将离心率纳入与准圆情况相比。尽管缺乏其他分析的偏心证据，但发现当允许离心率不为零时，我们的分析在多个事件的多个参数后验中略微改变了后验。 <div>
The detection of orbital eccentricity for a binary black hole system via gravitational waves is a key signature to distinguish between the possible binary origins. The identification of eccentricity has been difficult so far due to the limited availability of eccentric gravitational waveforms over the full range of black hole masses and eccentricities. Here we evaluate the eccentricity of five black hole mergers detected by the LIGO and Virgo observatories using the TEOBResumS-DALI, TEOBResumS-GIOTTO, and TEOBResumSP models. This analysis studies eccentricities up to 0.6 at the reference frequency of 5 Hz and incorporates higher-order gravitational-wave modes critical to model emission from highly eccentric orbits. The binaries have been selected due to previous hints of eccentricity or due to their unusual mass and spin. While other studies found marginal evidence for eccentricity for some of these events, our analyses do not favor the incorporation of eccentricity compared to the quasi-circular case. While lacking the eccentric evidence of other analyses, we find our analyses marginally shifts the posterior in multiple parameters for several events when allowing eccentricity to be nonzero.

<title>Action-angle Variables for Axisymmetric Potentials via Birkhoff Normalization</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We describe a method for calculating action-angle (AA) variables in axisymmetric galactic potentials using Birkhoff normalization, a technique from Hamiltonian perturbation theory. An advantageous feature of this method is that it yields explicit series expressions for both the forward and inverse transformations between the AA variables and position–velocity data. It also provides explicit expressions for the Hamiltonian and dynamical frequencies as functions of the action variables. We test this method by examining orbits in a Milky Way model potential and compare it to the popular Stäckel approximation method. When vertical actions are not too large, the Birkhoff normalization method achieves fractional errors smaller than a part in 103 and outperforms the Stäckel approximation. We also show that the range over which Birkhoff normalization provides accurate results can be extended by constructing Padé approximants from the perturbative series expressions developed with the method. Numerical routines in Python for carrying out the Birkhoff normalization procedure are made available.

<title>Evidence of Gradients of Density and Magnetic Field in the Remnant of Tycho’s Supernova</title>

By using surface brightness maps of Tycho’s supernova remnant (SNR) in radio and X-rays, along with the properties of thermal and synchrotron emission, we have derived the postshock density and magnetic field (MF) strength distributions over the projection of this remnant. Our analysis reveals a density gradient oriented toward the northwest, while the MF strength gradient aligns with the Galactic plane, pointing eastward. Additionally, utilizing this MF map, we have derived the spatial distributions of the cutoff frequency and maximum energy of electrons in Tycho’s SNR. We further comment on the implications of these findings for interpreting the gamma-ray emission from Tycho’s SNR.

<title>5–25 μm Galaxy Number Counts from Deep JWST Data</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Galaxy number counts probe the evolution of galaxies over cosmic time and serve as a valuable comparison point to theoretical models of galaxy formation. We present new galaxy number counts in eight photometric bands between 5 and 25 μm from the Systematic Mid-infrared Instrument Legacy Extragalactic Survey and the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey deep MIRI parallel, extending to unprecedented depth. By combining our new MIRI counts with existing data from Spitzer and AKARI, we achieve counts across 3–5 orders of magnitude in flux in all MIRI bands. Our counts diverge from predictions from recent semianalytical models of galaxy formation, likely due to their treatment of mid-IR aromatic features. Finally, we integrate our combined JWST−Spitzer counts at 8 and 24 μm to measure the cosmic infrared background (CIB) light at these wavelengths; our measured CIB fluxes are consistent with those from previous mid-IR surveys but larger than predicted by models based on TeV blazar data.

<title>In-field Phasing at the Upgraded GMRT</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In time-domain radio astronomy with arrays, voltages from individual antennas are added together with proper delay and fringe correction to form the beam in real time. In order to achieve the correct phased addition of antenna voltages, one has to also correct for the ionospheric and instrumental gains. Conventionally this is done using observations of a calibrator source located near to the target field. This scheme is suboptimal since it does not correct for the variation of the gains with time and position in the sky. Further, since the ionospheric phase variation is typically most rapid at the longest baselines, the most distant antennas are often excluded while forming the beam. We present here a different methodology (“in-field phasing”), in which the gains are obtained in real-time using a model of the intensity distribution in the target field, which overcomes all of these drawbacks. We present observations with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) which demonstrates that in-field phasing does lead to a significant improvement in sensitivity. We also show, using observations of the millisecond pulsar J1120−3618 that this in turn leads to a significant improvement of measurements of the Dispersion Measure and Time of Arrival. Finally, we present test observations of the GMRT discovered eclipsing black widow pulsar J1544+4937 showing that in-field phasing leads to improvement in the measurement of the cut-off frequency of the eclipse.

<title>Apparently Ultralong Period Radio Signals from Self-lensed Pulsar–Black Hole Binaries</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Pulsar–black hole (BH) close binary systems, which have not been found yet, are unique laboratories for testing theories of gravity and understanding the formation channels of gravitational-wave sources. We study the self-gravitational lensing effect in a pulsar–BH system on the pulsar’s emission. Because this effect occurs once per orbital period for almost edge-on binaries, we find that it could generate apparently ultralong period (minutes to hours) radio signals when the intrinsic pulsar signal is too weak to detect. Each of such lensed signals, or “pulse,” is composed of a number of amplified intrinsic pulsar pulses. We estimate that a radio telescope with a sensitivity of 10 mJy could detect a few systems that emit such signals in our Galaxy. The model is applied to three recently found puzzling long-period radio sources: GLEAM-X J1627, PSR J0901-4046, and GPM J1839-10. To explain their observed signal durations and periods, the masses of their lensing components are estimated as ∼104M⊙, ∼4 M⊙, and 103−6M⊙, respectively, with their binary coalescence times ranging from a few tens to thousands of years. However, the implied merger rates (as high as ∼103−4 Myr−1 per galaxy) and the large period decay rates (>10−8 s s−1) tend to disfavor this self-lensing scenario for these three sources. Despite this, our work still provides observational characteristics for self-lensed pulsar–BH binaries, which could help the detection of related sources in the future. Finally, for a binary containing a millisecond pulsar and a stellar-mass BH, the Shapiro delay effect would cause a ≥10% variation of the profile width for the subpulses in such lensed signals.

<title>RRAT J1913+1330: An Extremely Variable and Puzzling Pulsar</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Rotating radio transients (RRATs) are neutron stars that emit sporadic radio bursts. We detected 1955 single pulses from RRAT J1913+1330 using the 19 beam receiver of the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope. These pulses were detected in 19 distinct clusters, with 49.4% of them occurring with a waiting time of one rotation period. The energy distribution of these individual pulses exhibited a wide range, spanning 3 orders of magnitude, reminiscent of repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs). Furthermore, we observed abrupt variations in pulse profile, width, peak flux, and fluence between adjacent sequential pulses. These findings suggest that this RRAT could be interpreted as a pulsar with extreme pulse-to-pulse modulation. The presence of sequential pulse trains during active phases, along with significant pulse variations in profile, fluence, flux, and width, should be intrinsic to a subset of RRATs. Our results indicate that J1913+1330 represents a peculiar source that shares certain properties with populations of nulling pulsars, giant pulses, and FRBs from different perspectives. The dramatic pulse-to-pulse variation observed in J1913+1330 could be attributed to unstable pair creation above the polar cap region and the variation of the site where streaming pairs emit coherently. Exploring a larger sample of RRATs exhibiting similar properties to J1913+1330 has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of pulsars, RRATs, and FRBs.

<title>The Dzhanibekov Effect as a Possible Source of Magnetar Activity</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Magnetars, which are neutron stars with strong magnetic fields, exhibit occasional bursting activities. The shape of a magnetar is not perfectly spherical due to the Lorentz force exerted by its strong magnetic fields and is described as a triaxial body. We study the unstable free precession in a triaxial magnetar; one of the principal axes undergoes an upside-down flip. This flip is known as the Dzhanibekov effect. We find that during the flip, the Euler force can suddenly disturb the force balance on the surface layer of the magnetar, potentially leading to plastic flow of the layer. This, in turn, may trigger different forms of magnetar activity, such as the emission of the bursts and/or of gravitational waves.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We have studied the cosmic microwave background (CMB) map looking for features beyond cosmological isotropy. We began by tiling the CMB variance maps (which are produced by different smoothing scales) with stripes of different sizes along the most prominent dipole direction. We were able to confirm previous findings regarding the significance of the dipole. Furthermore, we discovered that some of the higher multipoles exhibit significance comparable to the dipole that naturally depends on the smoothing scales. In the end, we discussed this result having an eye on the look-elsewhere-effect. We believe our results may indicate an anomalous patch in the CMB sky that warrants further investigation.

It is common for surveys that are designed to find artificial signals generated by distant civilizations to focus on galactic sources. Recently, researchers have started focusing on searching for all other sources within the field observed, including the vast population of background galaxies. Toward a population of galaxies in the background toward the Vela supernova remnant, we search for technosignatures, spectral and temporal features consistent with our understanding of technology. We set transmitter power limits for the detection of signals in a population of over 1300 galaxies within a single field of view observed with the Murchison Widefield Array.

GRB 221009A was the brightest gamma-ray burst (GRB) of all time (BOAT), surpassing in prompt brightness all GRBs discovered in ∼50 yr and in afterglow brightness in ∼20 yr. We observed the BOAT with XMM-Newton 2.3 days after the prompt. The X-ray afterglow was still very bright and we collected the largest number of photons with the reflection grating spectrometers (RGSs) on a GRB. We searched the RGS data for narrow emission or absorption features. We did not detect any bright line feature. A candidate narrow feature is identified at a (rest-frame) energy of keV, consistent with an Mg xiiKα emission line, slightly redshifted (0.012) with respect to the host galaxy. We assessed a marginal statistical significance of 3.0σ for this faint feature based on conservative Monte Carlo simulations, which requires caution for any physical interpretation. If this line feature would be for real, we propose that it might originate from the reflection in the innermost regions of the infalling funnel from low-level late-time activity emission of the central engine.

<div> NGC 5128, Cen A, elliptical galaxy, star formation, LPV stars
<br />
NGC 5128 (Cen A)是最近的巨型椭圆星系，是天空中最明亮的星系之一，具有明显的尘埃带和从其核心超大质量黑洞散发出的喷流。研究者构建了NGC 5128晕的两个小区域的恒星形成历史（SFH）：一个在东北方向（Field 1），距离中心约18.8千秒差距；另一个在南部（Field 2），距离中心约9.9千秒差距。他们基于长周期变星（LPV）的方法来追踪并重建恒星的形成历史，发现Field 1中有395颗LPV星，Field 2中有671颗LPV星。尽管这两个区域在距离中心28千秒差距的相反方向，它们显示出类似的SFH。在Field 1中，恒星形成率（SFR）在t∼800百万年和t∼3.8亿年左右显著增加，而在Field 2中，SFR在t∼800百万年，t∼3.8亿年和t∼6.3亿年左右明显增加。LPV星重建的SFH支持了多次核活动导致周期性的喷流引发的恒星形成的情景。这项方法的应用使我们能够限制NGC 5128这颗关键星系的复杂演化，这是首次在超出本地星系群的星系中进行此类研究。 
<br /><br />总结: NGC 5128是最近的巨型椭圆星系，通过LPV星的研究揭示了其恒星形成历史，显示出多次核活动导致的喷流引发的周期性恒星形成，支持了在800百万年前发生星系合并的假设。这是对星系演化复杂性的重要突破。 <div>
NGC 5128 (Cen A) is the nearest giant elliptical galaxy and one of the brightest extragalactic radio sources in the sky, boasting a prominent dust lane and jets emanating from its nuclear supermassive black hole. In this paper, we construct the star formation history (SFH) of two small fields in the halo of NGC 5128: a northeastern field (Field 1) at a projected distance of ∼18.8 kpc from the center, and a southern field (Field 2) ∼9.9 kpc from the center. Our method is based on identifying long-period variable (LPV) stars that trace their sibling stellar population and hence historical star formation due to their high luminosity and strong variability; we identified 395 LPV stars in Field 1 and 671 LPV stars in Field 2. Even though the two fields are ∼28 kpc apart on opposite sides from the center, they show similar SFHs. In Field 1, the star formation rate (SFR) increased significantly around t ∼ 800 Myr and t ∼ 3.8 Gyr and in Field 2, the SFR increased considerably around t ∼ 800 Myr, t ∼ 3.8 Gyr, and t ∼ 6.3 Gyr, where t is the lookback time. The increase in SFR ∼800 Myr ago agrees with previous suggestions that the galaxy experienced a merger around that time. The SFH reconstructed from LPV stars supports a scenario in which multiple episodes of nuclear activity lead to episodic jet-induced star formation. While there is no catalog of LPV stars for the central part of NGC 5128, applying our method to the outer regions (for the first time in a galaxy outside the Local Group) has enabled us to put constraints on the complex evolution of this cornerstone galaxy.

<div> 关键词: 太阳，差动旋转，机器学习算法，太阳活动，太阳观测<br />
总结:<br />
研究使用改进的机器学习算法对太阳观测数据进行分析，发现太阳差动旋转对太阳活动有关键影响。研究跟踪了超过321,440个日冕明亮点（CBPs），计算了它们的赤道和纬向速度，并确定它们出现在距离光球约5627公里的高度。通过追踪CBPs，在Fe xii（193 Å）辐射形成高度得到了太阳日冕的旋转图。发现赤道旋转速度和纬向旋转梯度与太阳活动（太阳黑子和耀斑）略微相关。研究还发现太阳北半球的差动旋转比南半球更加显著，而且纬向旋转梯度的不对称性与太阳黑子数在9年的太阳活动周期中有一定的一致性。水平雷诺应力的变化也显示出它对太阳活动有所指示，特别是负水平雷诺应力（向太阳赤道的动量传输）在2012年和2014年的高活动期间为-2500m2 s−2，在2019年的低活动期间为-100m2 s−2。 <div>
Differential rotation plays a crucial role in the dynamics of the Sun. We study the solar rotation and its correlation with solar activity by applying a modified machine learning algorithm to identify and track coronal bright points (CBPs) from the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly observations at 193 Å during cycle 24. For more than 321,440 CBPs, the sidereal and meridional velocities are computed. We find the occurring height of CBPs to be about 5627 km above the photosphere. We obtain a rotational map for the corona by tracking CBPs at the formation height of Fe xii (193 Å) emissions. The equatorial rotation (14.°40 to 14.°54 day−1) and latitudinal gradient of rotation (−3.°0 to −2.°64 day−1) show very slightly positive and negative trends with solar activity (sunspots and flares), respectively. For cycle 24, our investigations show that the northern hemisphere has more differential rotation than the southern hemisphere, confirmed by the asymmetry of the midlatitude rotation parameter. The asymmetry (ranked) of the latitudinal gradient of the rotation parameter is concordant with the sunspot numbers for 7 yr within the 9 yr of the cycle; however, for only 3 yr, it is concordant with the flare index. The minimum horizontal Reynolds stress changes from about −2500 m2 s−2 (corresponding to high activity) in 2012 and 2014 to −100 m2 s−2 (corresponding to low activity) in 2019 over 5° to 35° latitudes within cycle 24. We conclude that the negative horizontal Reynolds stress (momentum transfer toward the Sun’s equator) is a helpful indication of solar activity.

<div> HPAHs, interstellar space, IR action spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations, H2 formation
<br /><br />总结:
本研究对超氢化多环芳烃（HPAHs）进行了气相红外（IR）光谱研究，特别关注了4,5,9,10-四氢吡啶（THP; C16H14）。实验结果表明，在碰撞诱导解离的过程中，分子氢（H2）是THP阳离子的主要碎片，与通常认为的碳骨架碎裂截然不同。该研究还通过计算IR光谱和分子动力学模拟确定了HPAH碎片的分子结构及其分解途径。这些发现表明，HPAHs的降对称性和双或三脂肪基团能够改变它们的稳定性和碎裂模式，从而导致其在星际介质中可能对H2的形成产生影响。 <div>
While polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are now accepted to be abundant in interstellar space, the abundance and influence of superhydrogenated PAHs (HPAHs) in the interstellar medium (ISM) are still under investigation. HPAHs may act as catalysts for or reactants in small-molecule formation via hydrogen abstraction reactions, H2 evaporation, and carbon skeleton fragmentation. Here, we present a gas-phase infrared (IR) action spectroscopy study of the HPAH 4, 5, 9, 10-tetrahydropyrene (THP; C16H14), performed at the Free Electron Lasers for Infrared eXperiments facility. IR action spectroscopy was performed on the THP cation, protonated THP, and their fragments produced by collision-induced dissociation in the range from 600 to 1800 cm−1. Calculated IR spectra, at the density functional theory level, agree with experimental IR spectra to a high degree and were utilized to determine molecular structures of the HPAH fragments. Molecular dynamics simulations compared with experimental mass spectra reveal favorable HPAH fragmentation pathways. Molecular hydrogen (H2) is observed to be a primary fragment of [THP+H]+ with superhydrogenated duo groups. This contrasts the notion that HPAHs typically undergo carbon skeleton fragmentation leading to CxHy formation. These observations show that lowered symmetry and duo or trio aliphatic groups on HPAHs uniquely change their IR spectra, stability, and fragmentation patterns. As a result, these species may contribute to H2 formation in the ISM.

这篇文章研究了紧凑型行星系统中轨道不稳定性的相关问题。他们发现采用简化的动力学模型可以准确地预测N体模拟的不稳定时间，即使模型只考虑了少量共振相互作用。这些共振相互作用导致轨道的混沌扩散，最终造成系统的不稳定。根据他们的发现，他们建立了一个关于不稳定时间和行星间距离的幂律关系，同时指出了这个关系的参数和实际观测系统的适用范围。最后，他们提出了一个经验公式，可以快速预测系统的不稳定时间，从而得出了对观测到的行星系统轨道分布和偏心率的影响。

To improve our understanding of orbital instabilities in compact planetary systems, we compare suites of N-body simulations against numerical integrations of simplified dynamical models. We show that, surprisingly, dynamical models that account for small sets of resonant interactions between the planets can accurately recover N-body instability times. This points toward a simple physical picture in which a handful of three-body resonances, generated by interactions between nearby two-body mean motion resonances, overlap and drive chaotic diffusion, leading to instability. Motivated by this, we show that instability times are well described by a power law relating instability time to planet separations, measured in units of fractional semimajor axis difference divided by the planet-to-star mass ratio to the 1/4 power, rather than the frequently adopted 1/3 power implied by measuring separations in units of mutual Hill radii. For idealized systems, the parameters of this power-law relationship depend only on the ratio of the planets’ orbital eccentricities to the orbit-crossing value, and we report an empirical fit to enable quick instability time predictions. This relationship predicts that observed systems comprised of three or more sub-Neptune-mass planets must be spaced with period ratios and that tightly spaced systems ( ) must possess very low eccentricities (e ≲ 0.05) to be stable for more than 109 orbits.

总结:<br />
这篇文章讨论了X射线探测器的探测死时间对脉冲星的折叠光变曲线的影响，并给出了简单的公式来纠正这种扭曲，通过使用来自不同X射线观测卫星的螃蟹星数据进行验证。文章还提出了纠正螃蟹星X射线光变仪数据的方法，并讨论了为什么一个未扭曲的光变曲线对研究螃蟹星的X射线发射机制很重要。 <div>
After receiving an X-ray photon, an X-ray detector is not operational for a duration known as deadtime. It is detector specific and its effect on the data depends upon the luminosity of the source. It reduces the observed photon count rate in comparison to the expected one. In periodic sources such as the Crab pulsar, it can distort the folded light curve (FLC). An undistorted FLC of the Crab pulsar is required in combination with its polarization properties for studying its X-ray emission mechanism. This work derives a simple formula for the distortion of the FLC of a pulsar caused by the detector deadtime, and validates it using Crab pulsar data from the X-ray observatories Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer and Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array, which have very small and relatively large detector deadtimes respectively. Then it derives a method for correcting the distorted FLC of the Crab pulsar in Imaging X-ray Polarimeter Explorer data, which have intermediate detector deadtime. The formula is verified after addressing several technical issues. This work ends with a discussion of why an undistorted FLC is important for studying the formation of cusps in the FLC of the Crab pulsar.

<div> 关键词: WISPR, PSP, zodiacal dust cloud, zodiacal light, heliocentric distances<br /> 

总结:<br />WISPR是PSP任务上的一种成像仪器，可以从前所未有的视角观测到黄道尘云产生的亮度。该研究利用PSP在10到16轨道期间的科学观测，对ZL的位置和亮度演变进行了深入研究。WISPR-O观测角度独特，揭示了行星的引力扭曲了ZDC的对称平面，并导致ZL亮度的东西不对称性。此外，分析结果还首次一致观测到了在约25 R☉处由于尘埃颗粒升华而产生的环绕太阳的尘埃增强。总体来说，PSP平台上的WISPR观测正在打开黄道尘云遥感的新窗口。 <div>
The Wide-Field Imager for Solar Probe (WISPR) on the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) mission maps the brightness produced by the zodiacal dust cloud (ZDC) from an historically unprecedented viewpoint. The brightness results from the scattering of photospheric light by dust particles in the ZDC, and is called zodiacal light (ZL). We exploit the PSP nominal science encounters in orbits 10 through 16 for an in-depth study of the location and brightness evolution of the symmetry axis of the ZL in images taken with the WISPR outer telescope (WISPR-O). During these 11 day encounters, PSP covered heliocentric distances between 0.25 and 0.0617 au (∼53.78−13.28 R☉) and ∼255° in helioecliptic longitude from within the orbital plane of Venus. The unique WISPR-O viewpoint, which comprises line-of-sight elongations of 80° ± 27°, has led to further insights about the ZDC. Namely, we find that the gravitational pull of the planets warps the ZDC symmetry plane and shifts the ZDC towards the solar system barycenter, creating an east–west asymmetry in the ZL brightness. Additionally, our analysis provides the first consistent observational evidence of a circumsolar dust enhancement resulting from the sublimation of dust grains at ∼25 R☉. Overall, the WISPR observations from the PSP platform are opening a new window in the remote sensing of the ZDC.

这篇文章研究了Vela超星系团的性质，包括VC04、VC02和VC08三个星系团的Ks-band光度函数。研究发现了VC04的Schechter参数，并证实其为一个富集但尚未完全松弛的星系团。通过红序法确定了VC04的LF，并证明了这种方法可以在星系团缺乏高光谱覆盖的情况下使用。同时也确定了VC02和VC08的LF。将Coma、Norma和Virgo星系团的LF与VSCL星系团进行对比，发现它们的Schechter参数在1σ范围内相似，表明不同星系团环境的LF没有显著差异。总结: 这篇文章研究了Vela超星系团的性质，包括其富集程度、光度函数和环境对LF的影响。研究结果为我们了解星系团的形成和演化提供了重要的参考。 <div>
To learn more about the properties of the Vela Supercluster (VSCL), located behind the Milky Way at cz ∼ 18,000 km s−1, we determine the Ks-band luminosity function (LF) of VC04, the richest known galaxy cluster in the VSCL, and two other VSCL clusters (VC02 and VC08). The galaxy sample is based on NIR observations that are complete to an extinction-corrected absolute magnitude of (∼2.ͫ5 below ), within the clustercentric radius of rc < 1.5 Mpc (∼70% of the Abell radius). For VC04, we obtained 90 new spectroscopic redshifts of galaxies, observed with the 11 m Southern African Large Telescope. We found the Schechter parameters of the VC04 LF to be M* = −24.ͫ41 ± 0.44, α = −1.10 ± 0.20, and ϕ* = 8.84 ± 0.20. Both the redshift data and the LF confirm VC04 to be a rich but not yet fully relaxed cluster. We independently determined the LF of VC04 on membership defined by the red-sequence method and demonstrated that this method can be used in the absence of high spectroscopic coverage over a cluster. This allowed us to determine the LFs of VC02 and VC08. We also derived the LFs of the Coma, Norma, and Virgo clusters to similar depth and extent as the VSCL clusters. We found that the Schechter parameters of VC04 are within 1σ uncertainties of these local clusters, as well as VC02 and VC08. We do not find significant differences between the LFs in the different cluster environments probed in this work down to .

Electromagnetic follow-up observations of gravitational wave events offer critical insights and provide significant scientific gain from this new class of astrophysical transients. Accurate identification of gravitational wave candidates and rapid release of sky localization information are crucial for the success of these electromagnetic follow-up observations. However, searches for gravitational wave candidates in real time suffer from a nonnegligible false alarm rate. By leveraging the sky localization information and other metadata associated with gravitational wave candidates, GWSkyNet, a machine-learning classifier developed by Cabero et al., demonstrated promising accuracy for the identification of the origin of event candidates. We improve the performance of the classifier for LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA's (LVK) fourth observing run by reviewing and updating the architecture and features used as inputs by the algorithm. We also retrain and fine-tune the classifier with data from the third observing run. To improve the prospect of electromagnetic follow-up observations, we incorporate GWSkyNet into LVK's low-latency infrastructure as an automatic pipeline for the evaluation of gravitational wave alerts in real time. We test the readiness of the algorithm on an LVK mock data challenge campaign. The results show that by thresholding on the GWSkyNet score, noise masquerading as astrophysical sources can be rejected efficiently and the majority of true astrophysical signals can be correctly identified.

脉冲星定时阵列（PTAs）旨在检测低频引力波（GWs）。GWs在PTA数据中引起无色散信号，意味着定时延迟不依赖于射电频率。然而，脉冲到达时间也受到射频相关的“色散噪声”的影响。为了更好地理解这种影响，我们评估了不同色散噪声模型如何影响每颗脉冲星的无色散噪声特性。我们发现色散噪声模型的选择明显影响了几颗脉冲星的无色散噪声特性。此外，我们还比较了每颗脉冲星的噪声特性与EPTA DR2推断的噪声特性之间的差异，并识别了可以改进噪声模型的潜在领域。这些结果突显了定制的色散噪声模型提高PTA对GWs的灵敏度的潜力。<br /><br />总结: 该研究评估了不同色散噪声模型对PTA数据的影响，发现其明显影响了脉冲星的无色散噪声特性，尤其是PSR J1713+0747。同时，与EPTA DR2推断的噪声特性存在差异，为改进噪声模型提供了方向。这表明了定制的色散噪声模型可以提高PTA对GWs的探测灵敏度。 <div>
Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are designed to detect low-frequency gravitational waves (GWs). GWs induce achromatic signals in PTA data, meaning that the timing delays do not depend on radio frequency. However, pulse arrival times are also affected by radio-frequency-dependent “chromatic” noise from sources such as dispersion measure (DM) and scattering delay variations. Furthermore, the characterization of GW signals may be influenced by the choice of chromatic noise model for each pulsar. To better understand this effect, we assess if and how different chromatic noise models affect the achromatic noise properties in each pulsar. The models we compare include existing DM models used by the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational waves (NANOGrav) and noise models used for the European PTA Data Release 2 (EPTA DR2). We perform this comparison using a subsample of six pulsars from the NANOGrav 15 yr data set, selecting the same six pulsars as from the EPTA DR2 six-pulsar data set. We find that the choice of chromatic noise model noticeably affects the achromatic noise properties of several pulsars. This is most dramatic for PSR J1713+0747, where the amplitude of its achromatic red noise lowers from to , and the spectral index broadens from to . We also compare each pulsar's noise properties with those inferred from the EPTA DR2, using the same models. From the discrepancies, we identify potential areas where the noise models could be improved. These results highlight the potential for custom chromatic noise models to improve PTA sensitivity to GWs.

Hard X-ray (HXR) observations are crucial for understanding the initiation and evolution of solar eruptive events, as they provide a key signature of flare-accelerated electrons and heated plasma. The potential of high-cadence HXR imaging for deciphering the erupting structure, however, has not received adequate attention in an era of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) imaging abundance. An extreme solar eruptive event on 2022 September 5 observed on the solar far side by both Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter provides the opportunity to showcase the power of HXR imaging in the absence of high-cadence EUV imaging. We investigate the evolution of flare energy release through HXR timing, imaging, and spectral analyses using data from the Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) on board Solar Orbiter. STIX provides the highest cadence imaging of the energy release sites for this far-side event and offers crucial insight into the nature of energy release, timing of flare particle acceleration, and evolution of the acceleration efficiency. We find that this is a two-phase eruptive event, rather than two distinct eruptions, as has been previously suggested. The eruption begins with an initial peak in flare emission on one side of the active region (AR), marking the rise/destabilization of a loop system followed by notable episodes of energy release across the AR and an eruptive phase associated with a very fast coronal mass ejection, type III radio bursts, and solar energetic particles. We demonstrate that high-cadence HXR imaging spectroscopy is indispensable for understanding the formation of powerful, space-weather relevant eruptions.

总结:<br /><br /> 本文介绍了Transformer架构在深度学习领域的应用，重点是在天文图像处理中进行去卷积和去噪。实验结果表明，采用深度学习模型后，能够显著恢复光度、结构和形态信息。与James Webb Space Telescope图像相比，修复后的Hubble Space Telescope图像在等光度测量、Sérsic指数和半光半径方面的散射减少了4.4、3.6和4.7倍，皮尔逊相关系数接近于1。然而，在输入图像存在相关噪声、点状源、以及伪影的情况下，性能表现会下降。预计这一深度学习模型将在精密光度测量、形态分析和剪切校准等科学应用中发挥重要作用。 <div>
The Transformer architecture has revolutionized the field of deep learning over the past several years in diverse areas, including natural language processing, code generation, image recognition, and time-series forecasting. We propose to apply Zamir et al.'s efficient transformer to perform deconvolution and denoising to enhance astronomical images. We conducted experiments using pairs of high-quality images and their degraded versions, and our deep learning model demonstrates exceptional restoration of photometric, structural, and morphological information. When compared with the ground-truth James Webb Space Telescope images, the enhanced versions of our Hubble Space Telescope–quality images reduce the scatter of isophotal photometry, Sérsic index, and half-light radius by factors of 4.4, 3.6, and 4.7, respectively, with Pearson correlation coefficients approaching unity. The performance is observed to degrade when input images exhibit correlated noise, point-like sources, and artifacts. We anticipate that this deep learning model will prove valuable for a number of scientific applications, including precision photometry, morphological analysis, and shear calibration.

研究NGC 1068的高能中微子信号提供了研究超大质量黑洞中非热过程的机会。使用IceCube和最新的Fermi-LAT数据，研究人员提出了有关宇宙射线能量和中微子发射区域尺寸的一般性多信使约束。结果表明，在光子带电子场景中，所需的宇宙射线能量应大于Eddington光度的1%–10%，发射半径应在低β等离子体中小于15RS，在高β等离子体中小于3RS。而在电子场景中，所需的γ射线光度远大于Eddington光度，超出了NuSTAR或Fermi-LAT数据。而在β衰变场景中，不仅在能量上违反要求，而且在γ射线约束方面也不成立。这些结果几乎是无偏见的，支持了磁场驱动冠层中的强子机制，排除了电子和β衰变场景。 <div>
The detection of high-energy neutrino signals from the nearby Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068 provides us with an opportunity to study nonthermal processes near the center of supermassive black holes. Using the IceCube and latest Fermi-LAT data, we present general multimessenger constraints on the energetics of cosmic rays and the size of neutrino emission regions. In the photohadronic scenario, the required cosmic-ray luminosity should be larger than ∼1%−10% of the Eddington luminosity and the emission radius should be ≲15RS in low-β plasma and ≲3RS in high-β plasma. The leptonic scenario overshoots the NuSTAR or Fermi-LAT data for any emission radii we consider, and the required gamma-ray luminosity is much larger than the Eddington luminosity. The beta-decay scenario also violates not only the energetics requirement but also gamma-ray constraints, especially when the Bethe–Heitler and photomeson production processes are consistently considered. Our results rule out the leptonic and beta-decay scenarios in a nearly model-independent manner and support hadronic mechanisms in magnetically powered coronae if NGC 1068 is a source of high-energy neutrinos.

JWST observations have recently begun delivering the first samples of Lyα velocity profile measurements at z > 6, opening a new window into the reionization process. Interpretation of z ≳ 6 line profiles is currently stunted by limitations in our knowledge of the intrinsic Lyα profile (before encountering the intergalactic medium (IGM)) of the galaxies that are common at z ≳ 6. To overcome this shortcoming, we have obtained resolved (R ∼ 3900) Lyα spectroscopy of 42 galaxies at z = 2.1–3.4 with similar properties as are seen at z > 6. We quantify a variety of Lyα profile statistics as a function of [O iii]+Hβ equivalent width (EW). Our spectra reveal a new population of z ≃ 2–3 galaxies with large [O iii]+Hβ EWs (>1200 Å) and a large fraction of Lyα flux emerging near the systemic redshift (peak velocity ≃0 km s−1). These spectra indicate that low-density neutral hydrogen channels are able to form in a subset of low-mass galaxies (≲1 × 108M⊙) that experience a burst of star formation (sSFR > 100 Gyr−1). Other extreme [O iii] emitters show weaker Lyα that is shifted to higher velocities (≃240 km s−1) with little emission near the line center. We investigate the impact the IGM is likely to have on these intrinsic line profiles in the reionization era, finding that the centrally peaked Lyα emitters should be strongly attenuated at z ≳ 5. We show that these line profiles are particularly sensitive to the impact of resonant scattering from infalling IGM and can be strongly attenuated even when the IGM is highly ionized at z ≃ 5. We compare these expectations against a new database of z ≳ 6.5 galaxies with robust velocity profiles measured with JWST/NIRSpec.

In this article, we explore the dynamics of accretion structures encircling spherically symmetric black holes, comparing three accretion disk models with distinct angular momentum profiles: (i) the geometrically thin Keplerian disk, (ii) the Fishbone–Moncrief torus; and (iii) the Polish Doughnut. Employing general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations with the High Accuracy Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamics code, we investigate these three models, considering the magnetic field’s influence on the accretion disk angular momentum redistribution. We show that the magnetic field is a key factor in accretion disk structures, especially in regions with lower mass density. Our investigation verifies the well-established fact that the presence of a magnetic field significantly influences the accretion rate and its temporal variability.

The dependence of the sources and properties of the near-Earth solar wind on solar cycle activity is an important issue in solar and space physics. We use the improved “two-step” mapping procedure that takes into account the initial acceleration processes to trace the near-Earth solar winds back to their source regions from 1999–2020, covering solar cycles (SCs) 23 and 24. Then, the solar wind is categorized into coronal hole (CH), active region (AR), and quiet Sun (QS) solar wind based on the source region type. We find that the proportions of CH and AR (QS) wind during SC 23 are higher (lower) than those during SC 24. During solar maximum and declining phases, the magnetic field strength, speed, helium abundance (AHe), and charge states of all three types of solar wind during SC 23 are generally higher than those during SC 24. During solar minimum, these parameters of solar wind are generally lower during SC 23 than those during SC 24. There is a significant decrease in the charge states of all three types of solar wind during the solar minimum of SC 23. The present statistical results demonstrate that the sources and properties of the solar wind are both influenced by solar cycle amplitude. The temperatures of AR, QS, and CH regions exhibit significant differences at low altitudes, whereas they are almost uniform at high altitudes.

总结:<br />
该研究总结了1996年至2023年间510个行星际日冕物质抛射（ICME）事件的数据集，并训练了一个径向基函数支持向量机（RBF-SVM）模型，以研究ICME的地磁效应及其对观测在1天文单位处的太阳风条件的依赖性。模型展示了在特定扰动风暴时间阈值下对地磁风暴强度的分类、评估ICME的地磁效应方面的高性能。模型的输出使用了精度、召回率、F1分数和真实技能统计（TSS）进行评估，并通过分层k折交叉验证进行了鲁棒性检验。在-50 nT阈值下，该模型实现了分别为0.84和0.93的精度，0.94和0.82的召回率，以及相应的0.89和0.87的F1分数，总体准确率为0.88，TSS为0.76。尽管在-100 nT阈值处存在数据集不平衡和样本有限的挑战，但该模型仍然保持了0.87的总体准确率，TSS为0.69，表明了该模型有效处理不平衡数据的能力。通过SHapley Additive exPlanations（SHAP）值分析，模型解释获得了物理见解，指出了南向磁场分量在触发地磁风暴中的作用，以及冲击-ICME组合在加剧这些风暴中的关键影响。使用SVM模型和SHAP值分析的有效应用提供了一种理解和预测ICME地磁效应的方法，并突显了相对简单的机器学习模型在预测空间天气并揭示潜在物理机制方面的能力。 <div>
In this study, we compiled a data set of 510 interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICME) events from 1996–2023 and trained a radial basis function support vector machine (RBF-SVM) model to investigate the geoeffectiveness of ICMEs and its dependence on the solar wind conditions observed at 1 au. The model demonstrates high performance in classifying geomagnetic storm intensities at specific Disturbance Storm Time thresholds and evaluating the geoeffectiveness of ICMEs. The model’s output was assessed using precision, recall, F1 score, and true skill statistics (TSS), complemented by stratified k-folds cross-validation for robustness. At the −50 nT threshold, the model achieves precisions of 0.84 and 0.93, recalls of 0.94 and 0.82, and corresponding F1 scores of 0.89 and 0.87 for the categories separated by this threshold, respectively. Overall accuracy is noted at 0.88, with a TSS of 0.76. Despite challenges at the −100 nT threshold due to data set imbalance and limited samples, the model maintains an overall accuracy of 0.87, with a TSS of 0.69, demonstrating the model’s ability to effectively handle imbalanced data. Physical insights were gained through model explanation with a SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) value analysis, pinpointing the role of the southward magnetic field component in triggering geomagnetic storms, as well as the critical impact of shock-ICME combinations in intensifying these storms. The effective application of an SVM model with SHAP value analysis offers a way to understand and predict the geoeffectiveness of ICMEs. It also underscores the capability of a relatively simple machine learning model in predicting space weather and revealing the underlying physical mechanisms.

<div> 热尘埃遮蔽的星系（hot DOGs）、高红移、超亮、极度遮蔽的类星体，通过广域红外测量探测到。这些星系的增长可能是由星系合并所驱动。先前的环境研究统计显示，热DOGs可能存在于密集区域。研究使用大型望远镜窄带和宽带成像来搜索Lyα发射体（LAEs），发现在W2246-0526（最远的热DOGs）的领域中有比空白领域更多的LAEs。这直接证据表明，这个最遥远的热DOGs处于Mpc尺度上的过密环境中，结果与热DOGs的合并起源相关。

关键词: 热尘埃遮蔽的星系、类星体、红移、合并、过密环境

- 热尘埃遮蔽的星系是一类超亮、极度遮蔽的类星体，通过广域红外测量被探测到。
- 研究通过大型望远镜寻找Lyα发射体（LAEs），发现W2246-0526的领域中存在着比空白领域更多的LAEs，这表明这个最遥远的热DOGs处于Mpc尺度上的过密环境中。
- 热DOGs的增长可能是由星系合并所驱动，这项研究结果与热DOGs的合并起源相关。 <div>
Hot dust-obscured galaxies (hot DOGs) are a population of hyperluminous, heavily obscured quasars discovered by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer all-sky survey at high redshift. Observations suggested the growth of these galaxies may be driven by mergers. Previous environmental studies have statistically shown hot DOGs may reside in dense regions. Here we use the Very Large Telescope narrowband and broadband imaging to search for Lyα emitters (LAEs) in the field of the hot DOG W2246−0526 at z = 4.6. W2246−0526 is the most distant hot DOG. We find that there is an overdensity of LAEs in the W2246−0526 field compared with the blank fields. This is direct evidence that this most distant hot DOG is in an overdense environment on the Mpc scale, and the result relates to the merger origin of hot DOGs.

本文报道了M3球状星团内5颗脉冲星的相位连接定时解决方案，发现M3E和F具有低质量伴星，并处于分别为7.1和3.0天的圆形轨道上。未在所有41次观测中检测到M3C的信号，未在Chandra图像中发现这些脉冲星的X射线对应物。从M3A和M3B的动态谱的自相关函数分析中，发现了强烈的闪烁现象，散射介质是各向异性的。从次级谱中，只捕捉到M3B的一个弯曲度为649±23 m^-1 mHz^-2的闪烁弧。 <div>
We present the phase-connected timing solutions of all five pulsars in globular cluster M3 (NGC 5272), namely PSRs M3A to F (PSRs J1342+2822A to F), with the exception of PSR M3C, from FAST archival data. In these timing solutions, those of PSRs M3E and F are obtained for the first time. We find that PSRs M3E and F have low-mass companions and are in circular orbits with periods of 7.1 and 3.0 days, respectively. For PSR M3C, we have not detected its signal in all 41 observations. We found no X-ray counterparts for these pulsars in archival Chandra images in the band of 0.2–20 keV. From the autocorrelation function analysis of M3A and M3B’s dynamic spectra, the scintillation timescale ranges from 7.0 ± 0.3 to 60.0 ± 0.6 minutes, and the scintillation bandwidth ranges from 4.6 ± 0.2 to 57.1 ± 1.1 MHz. The measured scintillation bandwidths from the dynamic spectra indicate strong scintillation, and the scattering medium is anisotropic. From the secondary spectra, we captured a scintillation arc only for PSR M3B with a curvature of 649 ± 23 m−1 mHz−2.

<div> 关键词: 多波长观测, 星系团, 活动星系核, 射流, 冷丝

总结:
多波长观测表明，一些星系团中的介质包含冷丝，但其形成机制尚存争议。作者利用流体动力学模拟表明，冷丝可能自然凝结出热气体射流所产生的气泡所带起的热气体尾流之中。模拟结果与观测一致，显示冷丝可延伸到星系团中心几十千帕秒之远，质量典型为10^8–10^9太阳质量，与典型活动星系核输出能量10^60爱尔格相符。冷丝具有平滑的速度梯度，从内部流入到外部流出，速度分散约数百公里/秒。冷丝的性质对射流特性有显著影响。与动能占主导的射流相比，热能占主导的射流更容易产生质量大、延伸较长的冷丝。射流早期启动、低基础速度或非常高功率的AGN射流往往会使星系团中心过热，并产生需要相对较长时间才能凝结出的短冷丝。 <div>
Multiwavelength observations indicate that the intracluster medium in some galaxy clusters contains cold filaments, while their formation mechanism remains debated. Using hydrodynamic simulations, we show that cold filaments could naturally condense out of the hot gaseous wake flows uplifted by jet-inflated active galactic nucleus (AGN) bubbles. Consistent with observations, the simulated filaments extend to tens of kiloparsecs from the cluster center, with a representative mass of 108–109M⊙ for a typical AGN outburst energy of 1060 erg. They show smooth velocity gradients, stretching typically from inner inflows to outer outflows with velocity dispersions of several hundred kilometers per second. The properties of cold filaments are affected substantially by the jet properties. Compared to kinetic-energy-dominated jets, it is easier for thermal-energy-dominated jets to produce long cold filaments with large masses, as observed. AGN jets with an early turn-on time, a low jet base, or a very high power tend to overheat the cluster center and produce short cold filaments that take a relatively long time to condense out.

<br /><br />总结:
AGN中的喷流核心呈现出边缘增亮的结构，这种现象可以通过喷流洛伦兹因子的角度依赖性来解释。喷流沿着其轴线具有较高的洛伦兹因子，沿着极角呈幂律下降。这导致观测者在喷流轴线附近看到较低的光学深度，而在较外部区域观测者看到较高的光学深度。通过蒙特卡洛模拟得到的分析和数值结果证实了边缘增亮现象。这项研究为通过观测到的喷流核心确定喷流结构和相关参数提供了独特的工具。这项研究为未来探索具有结构化洛伦兹因子的光学厚核心的谱特性铺平了道路。 <div>
The jet cores in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are resolved and found to harbor an edge-brightened structure where the jet base appears extended at the sides compared to its propagation axis. This peculiar phenomenon invites various explanations. We show that the photosphere of an optically thick jet base in AGNs is observed edge brightened if the jet Lorentz factor harbors an angular dependence. The jet assumes a higher Lorentz factor along the jet axis and decreases following a power law along its polar angle. For an observer near the jet axis, the jet has a lower optical depth along its propagation axis compared to off-axis regions. Higher optical depth at the outer region makes the jet photosphere appear to extend to larger radii compared to a deeper photosphere along its propagation axis. We tackle the problem both analytically and numerically, confirming the edge brightening through Monte Carlo simulations. Other than the edge brightening, the outcomes are significant as they provide a unique tool to determine the jet structure and associated parameters by their resolved observed cores. The study paves the way to explore the spectral properties of optically thick cores with structured Lorentz factors in the future.

总结: 本研究利用印度乌代浦太阳天文台的观测数据，对太阳光球和光球-色球界面区域的低频（ν < 5.0 mHz）声波的相位移和相位传播时间进行了估计和讨论。结果表明，在绝对视向磁场小于10 G的区域内，低频声波在光球和光球-色球界面区域均表现出非消散性特征，而且相位传播时间显示出非零值。此外，观测还揭示了高频声波向下传播的现象，表明它们在太阳大气的高层发生了折射。这些发现有助于深入了解太阳大气不同层次内声波的复杂动力学，揭示了声波的非消散性和向下传播特性。<br /><br /> <div>
We report and discuss the phase shift and phase travel time of low-frequency (ν < 5.0 mHz) acoustic waves estimated within the photosphere and photosphere–chromosphere interface regions, utilizing multiheight velocities in the quiet Sun. The bisector method has been employed to estimate seven height velocities in the photosphere within the Fe i 6173 Å line scan, while nine height velocities are estimated from the chromospheric Ca ii 8542 Å line scan observations obtained from the narrowband imager instrument installed on the Multi-Application Solar Telescope operational at the Udaipur Solar Observatory, India. Utilizing a fast Fourier transform at each pixel over the full field of view, phase shift and coherence have been estimated. The frequency and height-dependent phase shift integrated over the regions having an absolute line-of-sight magnetic field of less than 10 G indicates the nonevanescent nature of low-frequency acoustic waves within the photosphere and photosphere–chromosphere interface regions. Phase travel time estimated within the photosphere shows nonzero values, aligning with previous simulations and observations. Further, we report that the nonevanescent nature persists beyond the photosphere, encompassing the photospheric–chromospheric height range. We discuss possible factors contributing to the nonevanescent nature of low-frequency acoustic waves. Additionally, our observations reveal a downward propagation of high-frequency acoustic waves indicating refraction from higher layers in the solar atmosphere. This study contributes valuable insights into the understanding of the complex dynamics of acoustic waves within different lower solar atmospheric layers, shedding light on the nonevanescent nature and downward propagation of the acoustic waves.

<br /><br />总结:
本研究分析了磁环弯曲环流对横波和振荡的影响。在模型中发现，在准垂直传播极限下，模型支持两种快速表面模式：一个频率较高的模式（FSW+）和一个频率较低的模式（FSW-）。弱流速时，随着流速增加，FSW+（FSW-）的频率在传播和准驻波区域都会增加（减少）。我们展示了FSW+和FSW-受Kelvin-Helmholtz（KH）不稳定性的影响，并且对于FSW+（FSW-），临界流速大于（小于）内阿尔文速度。流体流动的存在导致了基本谐波与第一次超音波谐波的周期比P1/2P2小于（大于）1的情况，该影响在直线波导限制下退化。亚阿尔文流动可以阻止丝状模式的共振吸收，当FSW+和FSW-的频率脱离阿尔文连续的范围时。同时还表明，在静态情况和弱流动情况下，FSW+（FSW-）可解释为垂直（水平）极化的扭曲模式，而对于中等流动，两种模式都具有倾斜极化。我们将所开发的理论应用于解释具有虹吸流和沿环形磁结构引发的KH不稳定性爆发喷流的皇冠环中扭曲振荡的观测情况。 <div>
The effect of plasma flow in curved arcade loops on transverse waves and oscillations is examined analytically. The model under study is a semicircular magnetic slab with finite transverse extensions and a mass flow inside, in the zero-β plasma approximation. It is found that in the quasi-perpendicular propagation limit, the model supports two fast surface modes: one with higher (FSW+) and another with lower (FSW−) frequency. For a weak flow, the frequency of the FSW+ (FSW−) increases (decreases) as the flow speed grows in both propagating and quasi-standing wave regimes. We show that the FSW+ and FSW− are subjected to the Kelvin–Helmholtz (KH) instability, and the threshold flow is greater (less than) the internal Alfvén speed for the FSW+ (FSW−). The presence of plasma flow results in modifying the period ratio P1/2P2 of the fundamental harmonic to the first overtone with P1/2P2 less (more) than 1 for the FSW+ (FSW−), and this effect degenerates in the straight waveguide limit. The sub-Alfvénic flow can prohibit resonant absorption of kink modes when the frequencies of the FSW+ and FSW− become out of the Alfvén continuum. It is also shown that in the static case and for a weak flow case, the FSW+ (FSW−) is interpreted as a vertically (horizontally) polarized kink mode, while for moderate flow, both modes have oblique polarization. We apply the developed theory to interpret the observational cases of kink oscillations in coronal loops with signatures of a siphon flow and the onset of KH instability induced by the blowout jet along a loop-shaped magnetic structure.

The chemistry within the interstellar medium (ISM) is notably influenced by the interplay between kinetics and photochemical processes, which play significant roles in both the formation and destruction of molecular species. This study focuses on theoretical investigations of Al2O photochemistry, aiming to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the production of AlO and Al in the VY-CMa star. Utilizing advanced theoretical methodologies, we explore the lowest electronic states with singlet and triplet spin multiplicities in linear Al2O. We investigated the photostability of Al2O in the near UV‒Vis region, revealing the low likelihood of photodissociation and photoconversion while suggesting the plausibility of fluorescence and phosphorescence phenomena. Calculations also identify three prominent peaks in the UV range at 261.5, 206.2, and 199 nm. Finally, Al2O is predicted to be photostable and cannot be the parent molecule of the diatomic AlO or even the astrochemical reservoir of atomic aluminum. These results contribute to improving the astronomical models in simulating aluminum chemistry in the ISM.

这篇文章报告了对爆发变星（CVs）的周期性变化进行统计研究的结果。研究假设第三体假说是导致周期变化的原因，估算了21个CVs的第三体质量m3和其与二元系统的分离距离a3。推断的a3值与二元轨道周期Porb无关，而m3值随着Porb增加一个数量级，从最短周期（最老）到最长周期（最年轻）的系统中，意味着第三体的显著质量损失。三体系统的时间演化模型无法同时解释观测到的m3(Porb)和a3(Porb)分布的行为，因为从二元系统和第三体的联合质量损失要求随着二元系统朝着更短的Porb发展，轨道分离增加约140倍，与观测到的分布明显不符。我们得出结论，第三体假说在统计上不一致，不能用来解释CVs中观察到的周期性变化。另一方面，周期变化振幅图与太阳型捐赠者恒星的磁活动所致的候选假说以及CVs的标准演化情景是一致的。 <div>
We report the results of a statistical study of cyclical period changes in cataclysmic variables (CVs). Assuming the third-body hypothesis as the cause of period changes, we estimate the third-body mass, m3, and its separation from the binary, a3, for 21 CVs showing cyclical period changes from well-sampled observed-minus-calculated diagrams covering more than a decade of observations. The inferred a3 values are independent of the binary orbital period, Porb, whereas the m3 values increase with Porb by 1 order of magnitude from the shortest period (oldest) to the longest period (youngest) systems, implying significant mass loss from the third body with time. A model for the time evolution of the triple system is not able to simultaneously explain the observed behavior of the m3(Porb) and a3(Porb) distributions because the combined mass loss from the binary and the third body demands an increase in orbital separation by factors ∼140 as the binary evolves toward shorter Porb's, in clear disagreement with the observed distribution. We conclude that the third-body hypothesis is statistically inconsistent and cannot be used to explain cyclical period changes observed in CVs. On the other hand, the diagram of the amplitude of the period change versus the CV donor-star mass is consistent both with the alternative hypothesis that the observed cyclical period changes are a consequence of magnetic activity in the solar-type donor star, and with the standard evolutionary scenario for CVs.

New highly exothermic formation pathways incorporating both thermodynamic and kinetic control for the newly astronomically detected H2CNCN molecule are paired with extremely accurate quantum chemical rovibrational spectroscopic computations. The reactions between astronomically known CH2CN/CH2CCH + HNCN follow effectively identical pathways and proceed through stable intermediates and over deeply submerged transition states to form H2CNCN and HCN/HCCH coproducts. Similarly, the reaction between CH2CN and NCN− can also form H2CNCN, although this pathway first requires the initial formation of NCN−, which is currently undetected in space, via HNCN + CN−. This two-step mechanism uses the highly abundant CN− as the catalyst. Incredibly accurate quantum chemical spectroscopic data are reported for all reactants and products of these reactions, with errors between experimental values and the computations herein on the order of 0.1% or less. Anharmonic vibrational frequencies and intensities are also reported in order to guide experimental and observational searches for these molecules that have mostly been detected in the radio but may now be detectable via JWST.

Based on the magnetization, an accretion disk with a large-scale magnetic field can be separated into either standard and normal evolution or magnetically arrested disk (MAD), which are difficult to identify from observations. It is still unclear whether all the radio-loud active galactic nuclei (RLAGNs) with a thin disk and strong radio emissions contain a MAD. We investigate this issue by utilizing the 3CRR catalog. We compile a sample of 35 quasars and 14 high-excitation radio galaxies powered by a thin accretion disk. In order to consistently compare with the MAD sample given by Li et al., the optical-UV emissions of our sample are all detected by the Hubble Space Telescope. It is found that the average X-ray luminosity (LX) of our sample is about 5.0 times higher than that of radio-quiet active galactic nuclei with matching optical-UV luminosity (LUV), in general accord with the factor of 4.5 times in MAD sample within the uncertainty. The relationship between radio (5 GHz) and X-ray (2 keV) luminosities in the 3CRR sources is also found to be consistent with the MAD sample. Furthermore, the jet efficiencies of 3CRR sources are consistent with those from the GRMHD simulations of MAD. Therefore, we suggest that probably all the quasars and at least a fraction of high-excitation radio galaxies in the 3CRR catalog, and perhaps all the RLAGNs with strong radio emissions contain a MAD.

总结:<br />
最近的观测证实了存在于母行星盘中的环行行星盘（CPDs）。与PPDs不同，CPDs和其他类似行星的盘通常太紧凑，无法被现有的仪器空间分辨。研究团队生成了超过4000个环行行星物体盘（CPMODs）的光谱能量分布，提出了一种基于近红外到中红外颜色的分类方案，并利用JWST合成了相关的光度测量数据。研究结果表明，JWST的观测有望揭示CPMODs的结构和性质。 <div>
Recent observations have confirmed circumplanetary disks (CPDs) embedded in parental protoplanetary disks (PPDs). On the other hand, planetary-mass companions and planetary-mass objects (PMOs) are likely to harbor their own accretion disks. Unlike PPDs, CPDs and other disks around planet analogs are generally too compact to be spatially resolved by current instrumentation. In this study, we generate over 4000 spectral energy distributions of circum-PMO disks (CPMODs) with various host temperature and disk properties, which can be categorized into four prototypes, i.e., full, pretransitional, transitional, and evolved CPMODs. We propose a classification scheme based on their near-to-mid-infrared colors. Using those CPMOD models, we synthesize JWST (NIRCam and MIRI) photometry for F444W, F1000W, and F2550W wide filters. We show that F444W−F1000W and F444−F2550W colors can be applied to distinguish different types of CPMODs, especially for those around hot hosts. Our results indicate that the ongoing and future JWST observations are promising to unveil structures and properties of CPMODs.

<div> HESS J1809-193, TeV源, H.E.S.S. 协作, 分子云, 多波段观测

总结:
HESS J1809-193是一个未经鉴定的TeV源，最初被认为是一个脉冲星风星云候选者，但最近的研究表明其峰值与一组分子云重叠。该区域被认为是一个潜在的PeVatron候选者，发出的光子能量高达210TeV。研究人员使用HAWC望远镜对该区域进行了系统性的源搜索，并成功解析出一个扩展组分。他们通过时间依赖的轻子模型和轻子-强子模型对该区域的多波段观测进行了建模，并发现两种情景都可以解释观测到的数据。 <div>
HESS J1809-193 is an unidentified TeV source, first detected by the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) collaboration. The emission originates in a source-rich region that includes several supernova remnants (SNRs) and pulsars including SNR G11.1+0.1, SNR G11.0-0.0, and the young radio pulsar PSR J1809-1917. Originally classified as a pulsar wind nebula candidate, recent studies show the peak of the TeV region overlapping with a system of molecular clouds. This resulted in the revision of the original leptonic scenario to look for alternate hadronic scenarios. Marked as a potential PeVatron candidate, this region has been studied extensively by H.E.S.S. due to its emission extending up to several tens of TeV. In this work, we use 2398 days of data from the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) observatory to carry out a systematic source search of the HESS J1809-193 region. We were able to resolve emission detected as an extended component (modelled as a symmetric Gaussian with a 1σ radius of 0.°21) with no clear cutoff at high energies and emitting photons up to 210 TeV. We model the multiwavelength observations for the region around HESS J1809-193 using a time-dependent leptonic model and a lepto-hadronic model. Our model indicates that both scenarios could explain the observed data within the region of HESS J1809-193.

这篇文章使用AstroSat对低质量黑洞X射线双星GX 339–4进行了五次硬态观测的宽频谱分析，发现2021年的爆发是唯一成功/完整的爆发，而2019年和2022年的另外两次爆发中，源无法转变为软态。谱分析采用了两种不同的模型组合，需要两个独立的Compton化区域及其反射组分和软X射线过剩发射。更硬的Compton化组分占主导地位，而较软的组分相对较弱。我们的谱拟合表明，盘随着源的亮度而演化，内盘半径随着亮度的增加而减小。然而，盘在所有观测中仍然明显被切截，在源亮度约为Eddington亮度的∼2%–8%×时。我们注意到，我们假设软X射线过剩发射为盘黑体可能并不现实，这种软过剩可能是由于盘/辐射圈几何的非均匀性而产生的。我们的时间分析得到的功率密度谱的断裂频率随着源亮度增加而增加。此外，我们的分析证明了从功率密度谱的断裂频率和反射建模中得到的内盘半径的一致性，支持硬态中的截断盘几何结构。<br /><br />总结: AstorSat对GX 339–4进行了五次观测，发现2021年为成功的爆发，而2019年和2022年的爆发未能转变为软态。谱分析显示，Compton化区域和反射组分的硬度不同，盘随着亮度而演化，但在所有观测中都明显被切截。功率密度谱的断裂频率随着亮度增加而增加，与反射建模得到的内盘半径一致，支持硬态中的截断盘几何结构。 <div>
We perform broadband (0.7–100 keV) spectral analysis of five hard state observations of the low-mass black hole X-ray binary GX 339–4 taken by AstroSat during the rising phase of three outbursts from 2019 to 2022. We find that the outburst in 2021 was the only successful/full outburst, while the source was unable to make the transition to the soft state during the other two outbursts in 2019 and 2022. Our spectral analysis employs two different model combinations, requiring two separate Comptonizing regions and their associated reflection components and soft X-ray excess emission. The harder Comptonizing component dominates the overall bolometric luminosity, while the softer one remains relatively weak. Our spectral fits indicate that the disk evolves with the source luminosity, where the inner disk radius decreases with increasing luminosity. However, the disk remains substantially truncated throughout all the observations at the source luminosity of ∼2%–8%× of the Eddington luminosity. We note that our assumption of the soft X-ray excess emission as disk blackbody may not be realistic, and this kind of soft excess may arise due the nonhomogeneity in the disk/corona geometry. Our temporal analysis deriving the power density spectra suggests that the break frequency increases with the source luminosity. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates a consistency between the inner disk radii estimated from the break frequency of the power density spectra and those obtained from the reflection modeling, supporting the truncated disk geometry in the hard state.

<br /><br />总结: 这篇文章对于Markarian 421进行了X-ray观测分析，发现其X-ray发射在不同观测时段具有不同的强度状态和时间延迟。文章提出了一个包含两个区域的喷流模型，可以同时对X射线光谱和观测到的时间延迟进行满意的描述。结果表明，喷流内部的激波可能是触发快速变化的主要能量耗散过程，尽管磁重联也可能起到作用。 <div>
We present the timing analysis of 10 archived XMM-Newton observations with an exposure of >40 ks of Markarian 421. Mrk 421 is the brightest high-frequency-peaked BL Lac object emitting in X-rays produced by electrons accelerated in the innermost regions of a relativistic jet pointing toward us. For each observation, we construct averaged X-ray spectra in 0.5–10 keV band, as well as 100 s binned light curves (LCs) in various subbands. During these observations, the source exhibited various intensity states differing by close to an order of magnitude in flux, with the fractional variability amplitude increasing with energy through the X-ray band. Bayesian power spectral density analysis reveals that the X-ray variability can be characterized by a colored noise, with an index ranging from ∼ −1.9 to −3.0. Moreover, both the standard cross-correlation function and cross-spectral methods indicate that the amount of time lags increases with the energy difference between two compared LCs. A time-dependent two-zone jet model is developed to extract physical information from the X-ray emission of Mrk 421. In the model, we assume that the jet emission mostly comprises a quasi-stationary component and a highly variable one. Our results show that the two-zone model can simultaneously provide a satisfactory description for both the X-ray spectra and time lags observed in different epochs, with the model parameters constrained in a fully acceptable interval. We suggest that shocks within the jets may be the primary energy dissipation process responsible for triggering the rapid variability, although magnetic reconnection cannot be excluded.

<div> gravitational wave background, supermassive black hole binary mergers, Pulsar Timing Array, early merger model, James Webb Space Telescope

<br /><br />总结:
2023年，脉冲星定时阵列协作宣布发现了引力波背景，主要归因于超大质量黑洞双星的合并。最近的詹姆斯·韦伯太空望远镜的发现揭示了大量的高红移星系，这意味着在早期时期存在更大质量的超大质量黑洞双星的合并。通过比较早期和标准的“晚期合并”模型，我们发现早期合并模型对单个双星的检测概率明显较低，并预测了第一个可检测到的单源有大概30%的可能是高红移和极大质量的，并且频率变化快速。未来的确认将大大支持早期融合模型，为我们提供关于星系和超大质量黑洞进化的重要见解。 <div>
In 2023, the Pulsar Timing Array Collaborations announced the discovery of a gravitational wave background (GWB), predominantly attributed to supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) mergers. However, the detected GWB is several times stronger than the default value expected from galactic observations at low and moderate redshifts. Recent findings by the James Webb Space Telescope have unveiled a substantial number of massive, high-redshift galaxies, suggesting more massive SMBHB mergers at these early epochs. Motivated by these findings, we propose an “early merger” model that complements the standard merger statistics by incorporating these early, massive galaxies. We compare the early and standard “late merger” models, which assume peak merger rates in the local Universe, and match both merger models to the currently detected GWB. Our analysis shows that the early merger model has a significantly lower detection probability for single binaries and predicts a ∼30% likelihood that the first detectable single source will be highly redshifted and remarkably massive with rapid frequency evolution. In contrast, the late merger model predicts a nearly monochromatic first source at low redshift. The future confirmation of an enhanced population of massive high-redshift galaxies and the detection of fast-evolving binaries would strongly support the early merger model, offering significant insights into the evolution of galaxies and SMBHs.

<div> 关键词: 银河系演化, 大质量星团, 群团环境, 恒星形成, 光谱能量分布拟合

总结:
银河系的演化取决于它们的质量和局部环境，研究环境抑制开始操作的时间和方式仍然是一个挑战。研究高红移区域的工作受限于大质量星团成员，这在灵敏度限制或场景范围小时存在偏见。在这项工作中，我们使用堆叠技术研究了来自WISE巨大和遥远星团调查Ⅱ的10,000多个星团的平均恒星形成历史。我们的分析涵盖了近紫外线到远红外波长的星系过密度，处于0.5 ≲ z ≲ 2.54。我们使用光谱能量分布拟合来测量具有半径在0到1000千秒差距之间的四个环形孔径中的比星形成率（sSFR）。在z≳1.6时，平均sSFR在核心和星团外围的演化与领域内一致。在和之间，核心中的sSFR急剧下降，并且在较低红移时继续相对于领域sSFR下降。我们解释这一变化是环境抑制的影响在z∼1.5时显著增加的证据，转变的短时间跨度表明在这个红移上占主导地位的环境抑制机制具有快速的时间尺度。我们发现迹象表明sSFR可能随着母体暗物质哈洛质量的增加而下降，但需要比信噪比更低的质量示踪器来确认这种关系。 <br /><br /> <div>
The evolution of galaxies depends on their masses and local environments; understanding when and how environmental quenching starts to operate remains a challenge. Furthermore, studies of the high-redshift regime have been limited to massive cluster members, owing to sensitivity limits or small fields of view when the sensitivity is sufficient, intrinsically biasing the picture of cluster evolution. In this work, we use stacking to investigate the average star formation history of more than 10,000 groups and clusters drawn from the Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey 2. Our analysis covers near-ultraviolet to far-infrared wavelengths, for galaxy overdensities at 0.5 ≲ z ≲ 2.54. We employ spectral energy distribution fitting to measure the specific star formation rates (sSFRs) in four annular apertures with radii between 0 and 1000 kpc. At z ≳ 1.6, the average sSFR evolves similarly to the field in both the core and the cluster outskirts. Between and , the sSFR in the core drops sharply, and it continues to fall relative to the field sSFR at lower redshifts. We interpret this change as evidence that the impact of environmental quenching dramatically increases at z ∼ 1.5, with the short time span of the transition suggesting that the environmental quenching mechanism dominant at this redshift operates on a rapid timescale. We find indications that the sSFR may decrease with increasing host halo mass, but lower-scatter mass tracers than the signal-to-noise ratio are needed to confirm this relationship.

总结: 该研究主要通过数值模拟研究了围绕旋转超大质量黑洞的二维辐射、相对论性、磁流体力学吸积流。首先构建了一个初始平衡的磁场嵌入扭转圆环，其内部包含初始磁场。通过比较磁致凝固盘和标准演化状态的研究，发现较高的初始磁场强度会导致磁致凝固盘状态。采用自洽的双温度模型评估了模型的总发光度和能谱。发现总发光度主要由自由电子辐射发光而非同步辐射发光所主导。同时通过功率密度谱分析发现了相似的准周期振荡。最后指出，磁致凝固盘状态适用于顺行和逆行吸积流。 <div>
In our study, we examine a 2D radiation, relativistic, magnetohydrodynamics accretion flow around a spinning supermassive black hole. We begin by setting an initial equilibrium torus around the black hole, with an embedded initial magnetic field inside the torus. The strength of the initial magnetic field is determined by the plasma beta parameter, which is the ratio of the gas pressure to the magnetic pressure. In this paper, we perform a comparative study of the magnetically arrested disc (MAD) and standard and normal evolution (SANE) states. We observe that the MAD state is possible for comparatively high initial magnetic field strength flow. Additionally, we also adopt a self-consistent two-temperature model to evaluate the luminosity and energy spectrum for our model. We observe that the total luminosity is mostly dominated by bremsstrahlung luminosity compared to the synchrotron luminosity due to the presence of a highly dense torus. We also identify similar quasi-periodic oscillations for both MAD and SANE states based on power-density spectrum analysis. Furthermore, our comparative study of the energy spectrum does not reveal any characteristic differences between MAD and SANE states. Last, we note that the MAD state is possible for both prograde and retrograde accretion flow.

Dark energy is believed to be responsible for the acceleration of the Universe. In this paper, we reconstruct the dark energy scalar field potential V(ϕ) using the Hubble parameter H(z) through Gaussian process analysis. Our goal is to investigate dark energy using various H(z) data sets and priors. We find that the selection of the prior and the H(z) data set significantly affects the reconstructed V(ϕ). We compare two models, Power Law and Free Field, to the reconstructed V(ϕ) by computing the reduced chi-square. The results suggest that the models are generally in agreement with the reconstructed potential within a 3σ confidence interval, except in the case of Observational H(z) data with the Planck 18 prior. Additionally, we simulate H(z) data to measure the effect of increasing the number of data points on the accuracy of reconstructed V(ϕ). We find that doubling the number of H(z) data points can improve the accuracy rate of reconstructed V(ϕ) by 5%–30%.

The polarization of the cosmic microwave background is rich in information but obscured by foreground emission from the Milky Way’s interstellar medium (ISM). To uncover relationships between the underlying turbulent ISM and the foreground power spectra, we simulated a suite of driven, magnetized, turbulent models of the ISM, varying the fluid properties via the sonic Mach number, , and magnetic (Alfvén) Mach number, . We measure the power spectra of density (ρ), velocity (v), magnetic field (H), total projected intensity (T), parity-even polarization (E), and parity-odd polarization (B). We find that the slopes of all six quantities increase with . Most increase with , while the magnetic field spectrum steepens with . By comparing spectral slopes of E and B to those measured by Planck, we infer typical values of and for the ISM. As the fluid velocity increases, , the ratio of BB power to EE power increases to approach a constant value near the Planck-observed value of ∼0.5, regardless of the magnetic field strength. We also examine correlation coefficients between projected quantities, and find that rTE ≈ 0.3, in agreement with Planck, for appropriate combinations of and . Finally, we consider parity-violating correlations rTB and rEB.

本研究探讨了关于盘状星系的URC，并使用来自PROBES-I、PROBES-II和MaNGA数据库的大量空间分辨旋转曲线（RCs），配合DESI-LIS和Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer调查的多色面亮度剖面。研究发现常见的URC公式无法以足够的准确度预测RC的形状和幅度。他们开发了用于预测更高准确度的URC的神经网络（NN）等价物，表明URC的不准确性并非是由于不足的数据，而是非最佳的表述或采样效应。最新的URC处方及其在对称RCs的579个盘状星系子样本上训练得到的NN等效物表现与在完整数据样本上训练得到的URC/NN相似。他们得出结论，具有所有半径上可接受水平准确度（ΔVcirc ≲ 15%）的URC将需要详细建模星系的中心区域和外围（例如，对导致暗物质晕受到收缩或膨胀的重子效应）。 <div>
The universal rotation curve (URC) of disk galaxies was originally proposed to predict the shape and amplitude of any rotation curve (RC) based solely on photometric data. Here, the URC is investigated with an extensive set of spatially resolved RCs drawn from the PROBES-I, PROBES-II, and MaNGA databases with matching multiband surface brightness profiles from the DESI-LIS and Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer surveys for 3846 disk galaxies. Common URC formulations fail to achieve an adequate level of accuracy to qualify as truly universal over fully sampled RCs. We develop neural network (NN) equivalents for the proposed URCs that predict RCs with higher accuracy, showing that URC inaccuracies are not due to insufficient data but rather nonoptimal formulations or sampling effects. This conclusion remains even if the total RC sample is pruned for symmetry. The latest URC prescriptions and their NN equivalents trained on our subsample of 579 disk galaxies with symmetric RCs perform similarly to the URC/NN trained on the complete data sample. We conclude that a URC with an acceptable level of accuracy (ΔVcirc ≲ 15%) at all radii would require a detailed modeling of a galaxy’s central regions and outskirts (e.g., for baryonic effects leading to contraction or expansion of any dark-matter-only halo).

The Jovian plasma sheet is a key region of the Jovian magnetosphere populated by a mix of warm and hot plasma. It is the main channel for radial transport of mass and energy in the Jovian magnetosphere and provides a favorable environment for magnetic reconnection and wave–particle interactions although the understanding of its plasma properties is incomplete. This study combines observations from the Jovian Auroral Distributions Experiment and Juno Energetic Particle Detector Instrument on board the Juno spacecraft during its first 31 orbits to analyze the plasma properties of the Jovian plasma sheet from 20 RJ to 100 RJ. Our results indicate that the plasma number density decreases from 1 cm−3 at 20 RJ to 0.005 cm−3 at 100 RJ, while the plasma pressure decreases from 2 nPa at 20 RJ to 0.02 nPa at 100 RJ. The plasma pressure inside the plasma sheet is comparable to the magnetic pressure in the lobe region, suggesting a rough balance between the two. In the plasma sheet with r > 70 RJ, the H+ density and pressure remain relatively constant, likely due to other plasma sources such as the solar wind. Additionally, we find that the pressure (density) ratios for heavy ions between the center and the edge of the plasma sheet are generally an order of magnitude, while that for H+ decreases with radial distance. These findings contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the plasma properties of the Jovian plasma sheet.

<div> T Tauri stars, UVIT/AstroSat, spectral energy distribution, mass accretion, CTTS, WTTS, UV excess, Hα line emission

总结:<br /><br />这项研究使用UVIT/AstroSat对Taurus分子云中的T Tauri恒星进行了远紫外和近紫外观测，发现经典T Tauri星（CTTSs）在FUV至IR波段的发射比弱线T Tauri星（WTTSs）显著更高。CTTSs显示了更高的等效黑体温度和更强的FUV和NUV波段超出辐射。通过UV超出辐射，还将两个WTTSs（BS Tau和V836 Tau）重新分类为CTTSs，这得到了喜马拉雅钱德拉望远镜的光学光谱研究的支持。此外，发现UV光度（质量吸积的主要指示器）和Hα光度（质量吸积的次要指示器）之间存在线性相关。 <div>
We present results from simultaneous far-ultraviolet (FUV) and near-ultraviolet (NUV) observations of T Tauri stars (TTSs) in the Taurus molecular cloud with UVIT/AstroSat. This is the very first UVIT study of TTSs. From the spectral energy distribution of TTSs from FUV to IR, we show that classical TTSs (CTTSs) emit significantly higher UV excess compared to weak-line TTSs (WTTSs). The equivalent blackbody temperatures corresponding to the UV excess in CTTSs (>104 K) are also found to be relatively higher than those in WTTSs (<9250 K). From the UV excess, we have reclassified two WTTSs (BS Tau and V836 Tau) as CTTSs, which has been supported by the follow-up optical spectroscopic study using the Himalayan Chandra Telescope, showing strong Hα line emission. We find that CTTSs show strong excess emission in both the FUV (>107) and NUV (>103) bands, while WTTSs show strong excess only in the FUV (≲105), suggesting that excess emission in the NUV can be used as a tool to classify the TTSs. We also find a linear correlation between UV luminosity (a primary indicator of mass accretion) and Hα luminosity (a secondary indicator of mass accretion) with a slope of 1.20 ± 0.22 and intercept of 2.16 ± 0.70.

总结: 
磁场梯度技术是一种新的追踪磁场的工具，基于磁流体力学湍流和磁重新连接的特性。研究表明，在缺乏低空间频率时，GT追踪磁场的准确性得到了改善。通过将低空间频率滤波器应用到GALFA-H i调查中选择的扩散中性氢区域，结果显示GT推断的磁场与Planck 353 GHz极化测量之间的对齐度增加。这项研究对探测天体物理环境中的磁场具有重要意义。 <br /> <div>
Probing magnetic fields in astrophysical environments is both important and challenging. The Gradient Technique (GT) is a new tool for tracing magnetic fields, rooted in the properties of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence and turbulent magnetic reconnection. In this work, we examine the performance of GT when applied to synthetic synchrotron emission and spectroscopic data obtained from sub-Alfvénic and trans-Alfvénic MHD simulations. We demonstrate the improved accuracy of GT in tracing magnetic fields in the absence of low spatial frequencies. Additionally, we apply a low-spatial-frequency filter to a diffuse neutral hydrogen region selected from the GALFA-H i survey. Our results show an increased alignment between the magnetic fields inferred from GT and the Planck 353 GHz polarization measurements.

Sgr B2是一个微小星爆复合体，通过极向观测揭示了该区域三个密集核心Sgr B2 N(orth), M(ain),和S(outh)的磁场形态。推测这些核心的总面磁场强度分别为4.3–10.0 mG，6.2–14.7 mG 和1.9–4.5 mG。结合来自大气成分探测望远镜的解析尺度为等级的偏振数据分析，发现Sgr B2在云层尺度(约10 pc)到核心尺度(约0.2 pc)上存在磁超临界条件，这与该区域星形成活动的爆发一致，这很可能是由云到密集核心的多尺度重力坍缩引起的。<br /><br />总结: Sgr B2是一个微小星爆复合体，研究发现了其核心的磁场形态和强度，并指出了区域内存在的磁超临界条件，这与多尺度重力坍缩引起的星形成活动一致。 <div>
We report the first arcsecond-resolution observations of the magnetic field in the ministarburst complex Sgr B2. SMA polarization observations revealed magnetic field morphology in three dense cores of Sgr B2 N(orth), M(ain), and S(outh). The total plane-of-sky magnetic field strengths in these cores are estimated to be 4.3–10.0 mG, 6.2–14.7 mG, and 1.9–4.5 mG derived from the angular dispersion function method after applying the correction factors of 0.21 and 0.5. Combining with analyses of the parsec-scale polarization data from Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy, we found that a magnetically supercritical condition is present from the cloud scale (∼10 pc) to core scale (∼0.2 pc) in Sgr B2, which is consistent with the burst of star formation activities in the region likely resulting from a multiscale gravitational collapse from the cloud to dense cores.

We use cyclic spectroscopy to perform high-frequency resolution analyses of multihour baseband Arecibo observations of the millisecond pulsar PSR B1937+21. This technique allows for the examination of scintillation features in far greater detail than is otherwise possible under most pulsar timing array observing setups. We measure scintillation bandwidths and timescales in each of eight subbands across a 200 MHz observing band in each observation. Through these measurements we obtain intra-epoch estimates of the frequency scalings for scintillation bandwidth and timescale. Thanks to our high-frequency resolution and the narrow scintles of this pulsar, we resolve scintillation arcs in the secondary spectra due to the increased Nyquist limit, which would not have been resolved at the same observing frequency with a traditional filterbank spectrum using NANOGrav’s current time and frequency resolutions, and the frequency-dependent evolution of scintillation arc features within individual observations. We observe the dimming of prominent arc features at higher frequencies, possibly due to a combination of decreasing flux density and the frequency dependence of the plasma refractive index of the interstellar medium. We also find agreement with arc curvature frequency dependence predicted by Stinebring et al. in some epochs. Thanks to the frequency-resolution improvement provided by cyclic spectroscopy, these results show strong promise for future such analyses with millisecond pulsars, particularly for pulsar timing arrays, where such techniques can allow for detailed studies of the interstellar medium in highly scattered pulsars without sacrificing the timing resolution that is crucial to their gravitational-wave detection efforts.

总结: 
本研究提出了一种新的方法来确定X射线双星Hercules X-1中的等离子体数密度。通过对Hercules X-1的脉冲分辨分析，直接检测到了风的响应，确认风密度至少为1012cm-3。最后，我们模拟了对Hercules X-1的XRISM观测，并展示了它们将允许我们准确地测量离流的不同位置的数密度。使用XRISM，我们将排除约3个数量级的密度参数空间，约束风的质量流出率、能量学和其发射机制。 <div>
X-ray binaries are known to launch powerful accretion disk winds that can have a significant impact on the binary systems and their surroundings. To quantify the impact and determine the launching mechanisms of these outflows, we need to measure the wind plasma number density, an important ingredient in the theoretical disk wind models. While X-ray spectroscopy is a crucial tool for understanding the wind properties, such as their velocity and ionization, in nearly all cases, we lack the signal-to-noise ratio to constrain the plasma number density, weakening the constraints on the outflow location and mass outflow rate. We present a new approach to determining this number density in the X-ray binary Hercules X-1, by measuring the speed of the wind ionization response to the time-variable illuminating continuum. Hercules X-1 is powered by a highly magnetized neutron star, pulsating with a period of 1.24 s. We show that the wind number density in Hercules X-1 is sufficiently high to respond to these pulsations by modeling the ionization response with the time-dependent photoionization model tpho. We then perform a pulse-resolved analysis of the best-quality XMM-Newton observation of Hercules X-1 and directly detect the wind response, confirming that the wind density is at least 1012 cm−3. Finally, we simulate XRISM observations of Hercules X-1 and show that they will allow us to accurately measure the number density at different locations within the outflow. With XRISM, we will rule out ∼3 orders of magnitude in density parameter space, constraining the wind mass outflow rate, energetics, and its launching mechanism.

总结:
本研究探讨了伽马射线暴（GRBs）的偏振角度（PA）在快速阶段观察到两次90°的突然旋转现象，提出了多个发射壳体模型解决这一难题。针对发射壳体中大尺度有序磁场的构型，考虑了环形和对齐两种情况。研究发现，通过多壳体对齐磁场配置（MFC）可以很好地解释GRB 170114A和GRB 160821A中观测到的两次90°的PA旋转现象。数值计算还表明，多个发射壳体采用环形MFC无法解释观测到的两次90°的PA旋转。对齐MFC通常意味着磁星中心引擎的偏好，而环形磁场配置通常与中心黑洞相关。因此，两个GRBs的磁星中心引擎的可能性更大。<br /><br /> <div>
The observed abrupt twice-90° rotations of the polarization angle (PA) in the prompt phase of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are difficult to understand within the current one-emitting-shell models. Here, we apply a model with multiple emitting shells to solve this new challenging problem. Two configurations of large-scale ordered magnetic fields in the shells are considered: toroidal and aligned. Together with the light curves and the spectral peak energy evolutions, the twice-90° PA rotations in GRB 170114A and GRB 160821A could be well interpreted with the multishell aligned magnetic field configuration (MFC). Our numerical calculations also show that the multiple shells with the toroidal MFC could not explain the observed twice-90° PA rotations. An aligned MFC in the GRB outflow usually indicates the preference of a magnetar central engine, while a toroidal field configuration is typically related to a central black hole. Therefore, the magnetar central engines for the two GRBs are favored.

该研究通过宇宙学模拟发现，星系团周围的溅飞回半径随着ΩM或σ8值的变化而变化，从而打破了S8参数带来的ΩM和σ8的退化关系。研究还指出，这种变化在原则上是可以通过观测来测量的，因为溅飞回半径可以通过弱引力透镜分析来确定。这种新方法可以加强对宇宙学参数的低红移限制，可以利用现有数据或即将到来的欧几里德和大型巡天望远镜（LSST）的数据来实现。 
<br />
总结: 该研究发现星系团的溅飞回半径可以作为一个重要的观测指标，能够帮助打破ΩM和σ8之间的退化关系，从而加强对宇宙学参数的约束。通过宇宙学模拟和观测数据的对比，研究揭示了这一现象并指出了进一步的研究方向。Euclid和LSST等未来的观测数据有望进一步验证这一发现。 <div>
Cosmological parameters such as ΩM and σ8 can be measured indirectly using various methods, including galaxy cluster abundance and cosmic shear. These measurements constrain the composite parameter S8, leading to degeneracy between ΩM and σ8. However, some structural properties of galaxy clusters also correlate with cosmological parameters, due to their dependence on a cluster’s accretion history. In this work, we focus on the splashback radius, an observable cluster feature that represents a boundary between a cluster and the surrounding Universe. Using a suite of cosmological simulations with a range of values for ΩM and σ8, we show that the position of the splashback radius around cluster-mass halos is greater in cosmologies with smaller values of ΩM or larger values of σ8. This variation breaks the degeneracy between ΩM and σ8 that comes from measurements of the S8 parameter. We also show that this variation is, in principle, measurable in observations. As the splashback radius can be determined from the same weak lensing analysis already used to estimate S8, this new approach can tighten low-redshift constraints on cosmological parameters, either using existing data, or using upcoming data such as that from Euclid and LSST.

<title>A Brown Dwarf Orbiting around the Planetary-nebula Central Binary KV Vel</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
KV Vel is a noneclipsing short-period (P = 0.3571 days) close binary containing a very hot subdwarf primary (77,000 K) and a cool low-mass secondary star (3400 K) that is located at the center of the planetary nebula DS 1. The changes in the orbital period of the close binary were analyzed based on 262 new times of light maximum together with those compiled from the literature. It is discovered that the O − C curve shows a small-amplitude (0.ͩ0034) cyclic period variation with a period of 29.55 yr. The explanation by the solar-type magnetic activity cycles of the cool component is ruled out because the required energies are much larger than the total radiant energy of this component in a whole cycle. Therefore, the cyclic variation was plausibly explained as the light-travel time effect via the presence of a tertiary component, which is supported by the periodic changes of the O − C curve and the rather symmetric and stable light curves obtained by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. The mass of the tertiary companion is determined to be M⊙. If the third body is coplanar with the central binary (i.e., ), the mass of the tertiary component is computed as M3 ∼ 0.068 M⊙, and thus it would be below the stable hydrogen-burning limit and is a brown dwarf. The orbital separation is shorter than 9.35 au. KV Vel together with its surrounding planetary nebula and the brown-dwarf companion may be formed through the common-envelope evolution after the primary filled its Roche lobe during the early asymptotic giant branch stage.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The extreme-ultraviolet emission line (424 Å) of the intercombination 1s22s21S0–1s22s2p3P1 transition of Ar xv can potentially characterize the electron temperature of astrophysical plasma. Various theoretical studies have investigated the intercombination transition rate, which is essential for the plasma diagnostics; however, experimental difficulties have prevented its measurement. We present here measurement of the lifetime of the 3P1 excited state of Ar xv, providing the experimental value of the intercombination transition rate. Employing time-resolved plasma-assisted laser spectroscopy, a method we recently demonstrated, enables us to measure this submicrosecond lifetime. The experimental result exhibits a 25%–43% higher transition rate than theoretical predictions.

<title>STELLA Lightcurves of Energetic Pair-instability Supernovae in the Context of SN2018ibb</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
SN2018ibb is a recently observed hydrogen-poor superluminous supernova that appears to be powered by the decay of 30 M⊙ of radioactive nickel. This supernova has been suggested to show hybrid signatures of a pair-instability supernova and an interacting supernova. In a previous paper, we found that rotating, metal-enriched pair-instability supernova progenitors appeared to check both of these boxes. In this paper, we model the lightcurves of the pair-instability supernovae using STELLA. We find that the STELLA models can explain the overall shape of the bolometric lightcurve of SN2018ibb, though not specific morphological features such as the luminosity peak or the bump at roughly 300 days after the peak. We also estimate the contribution from interaction and find that with relatively low wind velocities, the circumstellar medium originating from the stellar winds is consistent with the evidence for interaction in the spectra. The observed values of the photosphere velocity in the 100 days after peak luminosity are similar to the STELLA models, but the deceleration is lower. This leads to the biggest inconsistency, which is the blackbody temperature of SN2018ibb being much hotter than any of the STELLA models. We note that this high temperature (and the flat velocity) may be difficult to reconcile with the long rise time of SN2018ibb, but nevertheless conclude that if it is accurate, this discrepancy represents a challenge for SN2018ibb being a robust PISN candidate. This result is noteworthy given the lack of other scenarios for this supernova.

<title>Local Transition of Electron Pitch Angle Distribution within Flux Pileup Region behind Dipolarization Front</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Dipolarization fronts (DFs), earthward-propagating magnetic transients with a strong magnetic field, are important regions favorable for energetic electron acceleration in the magnetotail. The DF-driven electron acceleration usually generates coherent pitch angle distributions (PADs) inside flux pileup regions (FPRs), i.e., strong magnetic field regions behind the DFs, such as pancake, butterfly, and cigar distributions, which dominate at different tail regions and often occur separately. Here we present unique observations of electron PAD evolution inside the FPR, showing that electron PAD underwent local transition from cigar distribution, to butterfly distribution, then toward pancake distribution, forming a U-shaped distribution. During the local transition, electron perpendicular flux (relative to the local magnetic field) is anticorrelated with magnetic field strength, contrary to traditional expectation. The unexpected feature of the electron U-shaped distribution is associated with multiple physical processes at different scales, including local expansion of flux tubes and pitch angle variation near the neutral sheet. These atypical observations can advance our current understanding of electron acceleration and transport in the magnetosphere.

The Bright Transient Survey (BTS) aims to obtain a classification spectrum for all bright (mpeak ≤ 18.5 mag) extragalactic transients found in the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) public survey. BTS critically relies on visual inspection (“scanning”) to select targets for spectroscopic follow-up, which, while effective, has required a significant time investment over the past ∼5 yr of ZTF operations. We present BTSbot, a multimodal convolutional neural network, which provides a bright transient score to individual ZTF detections using their image data and 25 extracted features. BTSbot is able to eliminate the need for daily human scanning by automatically identifying and requesting spectroscopic follow-up observations of new bright transient candidates. BTSbot recovers all bright transients in our test split and performs on par with scanners in terms of identification speed (on average, ∼1 hr quicker than scanners). We also find that BTSbot is not significantly impacted by any data shift by comparing performance across a concealed test split and a sample of very recent BTS candidates. BTSbot has been integrated into Fritz and Kowalski, ZTF’s first-party marshal and alert broker, and now sends automatic spectroscopic follow-up requests for the new transients it identifies. Between 2023 December and 2024 May, BTSbot selected 609 sources in real time, 96% of which were real extragalactic transients. With BTSbot and other automation tools, the BTS workflow has produced the first fully automatic end-to-end discovery and classification of a transient, representing a significant reduction in the human time needed to scan.

<div> 关键词: common envelop jets, supernovae, r-process scenario, neutron-capture process, metal-poor stars
总结:
本研究提出了一种新的超新星r过程核合成理论，即共同包络喷流超新星(CEJSNe)场景。研究发现，在这种场景下形成的强子流密度分布可以产生最大比例的第三r过程峰元素与镧系元素，相比其他r过程理论而言。与观测到的r过程金属贫星和其他r过程场景相比，CEJSN场景能够很好地模拟特定r增强金属贫星的观测特征，这对于r过程核合成场景的研究具有重要意义。此外，CEJSN场景还可以通过宇宙年龄测定提供最重的元素的形成估计。 <div>
The common envelop jet supernovae (CEJSNe) r-process scenario has been proposed as an r-process nucleosynthesis site in the past decade. Jets launched by a neutron star that spirals in inside the core of a red supergiant star in a common envelope evolution supply the proper conditions for forming elements heavier than iron through the rapid neutron-capture process. The present work initially unveils the r-process abundance patterns that result from the density profile in the relatively long-lived jets. The results indicate that the expansion profile unique to the CEJSN scenario can produce the largest ratio of the third r-process peak elements to lanthanides among current r-process scenarios and, in addition, can form quite an amount of lanthanides, about 1% of matters above the first peak, in a single event. The comparison of the ratio of the third-peak elements to the lanthanides with several observed r-enhanced metal-poor stars and with other r-process scenarios suggests that a high mass of third-peak elements is anticorrelated with a high fraction of lanthanides, both in observations and theory. The CEJSN-like scenario plays a significant role in this conclusion since it reproduces the observational features of some particular r-enhanced metal-poor stars where other r-process scenarios encounter problems. Due to the formation of extremely heavy elements, the CEJSN also offers a credible estimation of the age of the most actinide-boosted star by cosmochronometry.

<div> 磁重联，粒子加速，偏角各向异性，离子-电子等离子体，粒子动力学<br />
总结：<br />
本文研究了高度磁化离子-电子等离子体中磁重联产生的粒子加速和偏角各向异性。通过全粒子动力学模拟，我们证明磁重联产生了各向异性粒子分布，其特征是在粒子能量谱中呈现出破裂的幂律分布fs(ε) ∝ ε−p和偏角。这些分布的特征由磁场的导向和重联分量（Bg/B0）的相对强度以及等离子体磁化（σ0）决定。在注入断裂能量ε0以下，无论Bg/B0和σ0均≳ 1，离子和电子能谱都非常硬（p< ≲ 1），而在ε0以上，谱指数变陡（p> ≳ 2），对Bg/B0和σ0显示出很高的敏感性。偏角呈现出具有负斜率（m<）的幂律范围，在ε0以下且具有正斜率（m>）的幂律范围，在ε0以上，并且随着Bg/B0和σ0的增加而变陡。偏角各向异性还引起温度各向异性，并减缓了同步辐射冷却，同时产生了与磁场对齐的射束辐射，这可能是频率快速变化的原因。磁场的重分布还导致了光学薄的同步辐射功率谱Fν(ν) ∝ ν(2−2p+m)/(4+m)和线偏振度Πlin = (p + 1)/(p + 7/3 + m/3)。 <div>
Particle acceleration and pitch-angle anisotropy resulting from magnetic reconnection are investigated in highly magnetized ion-electron plasmas. By means of fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations, we demonstrate that magnetic reconnection generates anisotropic particle distributions , characterized by broken power laws in the particle energy spectrum fs(ε) ∝ ε−p and pitch angle . The characteristics of these distributions are determined by the relative strengths of the magnetic field’s guide and reconnecting components (Bg/B0) and the plasma magnetization (σ0). Below the injection break energy ε0, ion and electron energy spectra are extremely hard (p< ≲ 1) for any Bg/B0 and σ0 ≳ 1, while above ε0 the spectral index steepens (p> ≳ 2), displaying high sensitivity to both Bg/B0 and σ0. The pitch angle displays power-law ranges with negative slopes (m<) below and positive slopes (m>) above , steepening with increasing Bg/B0 and σ0. The ratio Bg/B0 regulates the redistribution of magnetic energy between ions (ΔEi) and electrons (ΔEe), with ΔEi ≫ ΔEe for Bg/B0 ≪ 1, ΔEi ∼ ΔEe for Bg/B0 ∼ 1, and ΔEi ≪ ΔEe for Bg/B0 ≫ 1, with ΔEi/ΔEe approaching unity when σ0 ≫ 1. The anisotropic distribution of accelerated particles results in an optically thin synchrotron power spectrum Fν(ν) ∝ ν(2−2p+m)/(4+m) and a linear polarization degree Πlin = (p + 1)/(p + 7/3 + m/3) for a uniform magnetic field. Pitch-angle anisotropy also induces temperature anisotropy and eases synchrotron cooling, along with producing beamed radiation aligned with the magnetic field, which is potentially responsible for rapid frequency-dependent variability.

<div> 关键词: UVCANDELS, Hubble Space Telescope, UV imaging, photometric redshift, luminosity function
总结: 
UVCANDELS是哈勃空间望远镜授予的研究项目，通过对四个CANDELS领域进行紫外线和光学成像，覆盖面积约为426平方弧分，比之前深空紫外线数据覆盖面积大约多2.7倍。研究团队采用了新的光度测定方法，识别了5810个红移在0.6 < z < 1之间的星系，并进行了UV LF的分析。研究发现在z ∼ 0.8时的最佳拟合斜率，同时观察到在红移上可能发生的演化。最后得到了在MUV < −10时的UV光度密度。UVCANDELS的新光度目录已经公开发布在巴巴拉·米库尔斯基空间望远镜存档中。<br /><br /> <div>
UVCANDELS is a Hubble Space Telescope Cycle-26 Treasury Program awarded 164 orbits of primary ultraviolet (UV) F275W imaging and coordinated parallel optical F435W imaging in four CANDELS fields—GOODS-N, GOODS-S, EGS, and COSMOS—covering a total area of ∼426 arcmin2. This is ∼2.7 times larger than the area covered by previous deep-field space UV data combined, reaching a depth of about 27 and 28 ABmag (5σ in 0.”2 apertures) for F275W and F435W, respectively. Along with new photometric catalogs, we present an analysis of the rest-frame UV luminosity function (LF), relying on our UV-optimized aperture photometry method, yielding a factor of 1.5 increase over H-isophot aperture photometry in the signal-to-noise ratios of galaxies in our F275W imaging. Using well-tested photometric redshift measurements, we identify 5810 galaxies at redshifts 0.6 < z < 1, down to an absolute magnitude of MUV = −14.2. In order to minimize the effect of uncertainties in estimating the completeness function, especially at the faint end, we restrict our analysis to sources above 30% completeness, which provides a final sample of 4726 galaxies at −21.5 < MUV < −15.5. We performed a maximum likelihood estimate to derive the best-fit parameters of the UV LF. We report a best-fit faint-end slope of at z ∼ 0.8. Creating subsamples at z ∼ 0.7 and z ∼ 0.9, we observe a possible evolution of α with redshift. The unobscured UV luminosity density at MUV < −10 is derived as using our best-fit LF parameters. The new F275W and F435 photometric catalogs from UVCANDELS have been made publicly available on the Barbara A. Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes.

<div> 星等，南极望远镜，毫米波，耀斑星，事件<br />
总结:<br />
这篇文章介绍了南极望远镜进行的毫米波观测数据，通过短暂持续时间的过渡性搜寻发现了111次耀斑事件来自66颗恒星，扩大了之前 SPT-3G 数据发布中检测到的耀斑事件和耀斑星数量的数量级。研究人员提供了与Gaia DR3的匹配，并与第二个ROSAT全天巡天中发现的X射线点源进行了匹配。他们还发现了各种类型的耀斑星，包括主序星和演化恒星，这些星大多都在附近，距离为10-1000 pc。耀斑事件的时间尺度范围从几分钟到几小时不等，而峰值νLν光度在SPT-3G频段为10^27到10^31 erg s^−1。 <div>
We present a flare star catalog from 4 yr of nontargeted millimeter-wave survey data from the South Pole Telescope (SPT). The data were taken with the SPT-3G camera and cover a 1500 deg2 region of the sky from 20h40m0s to 3h20m0s in right ascension and from −42° to −70° in declination. This region was observed on a nearly daily cadence from 2019 to 2022 and chosen to avoid the plane of the galaxy. A short-duration transient search of this survey yields 111 flaring events from 66 stars, increasing the number of both flaring events and detected flare stars by an order of magnitude from the previous SPT-3G data release. We provide cross-matching to Gaia DR3, as well as matches to X-ray point sources found in the second ROSAT all-sky survey. We have detected flaring stars across the main sequence, from early-type A stars to M dwarfs, as well as a large population of evolved stars. These stars are mostly nearby, spanning 10–1000 pc in distance. Most of the flare spectral indices are constant or gently rising as a function of frequency at 95/150/220 GHz. The timescale of these events can range from minutes to hours, and the peak νLν luminosities range from 1027 to 1031 erg s−1 in the SPT-3G frequency bands.

<div> 关键词: JWST-NIRCam, Serpens Main, protostellar outflows, alignment, filament

JWST-NIRCam（詹姆斯·韦伯太空望远镜-近红外相机）使用深度1.4–4.8μm波段拍摄了Serpens Main恒星形成区的图像，识别出20个候选原恒星喷流，大多具有双极结构，并确定了驱动源。喷流的位置角（PA）强相关，并且与Serpens小丝的主轴±24°内对齐。这些方向进一步与该区域两个盘阴影的角动量矢量对齐。通过估算发现，如果采样自均匀PA分布，这么多年轻恒星对齐的概率为10^-4。这表明，这些对齐的原恒星，根据其喷流动力学，似乎处于类似的演化阶段，是在类似时间内形成，并且继承了一个局部云小丝的类似自旋。此外，还有初步证据表明，西北部和东南部星团的平均PA之间存在系统性变化，以及东南部原恒星的PA散度增加。Serpens Main的SOFIA-HAWC+存档尘埃偏振观测数据显示，在特别是西北地区，与主导的喷流方向垂直。我们测量并定位了所有喷流的冲击节点和边缘，并提供了一个识别目录。我们推测Serpens Main是一个从孤立小丝形成的星团，由于其年轻性保留了其原始喷流对齐性。 <br /><br />总结: 本研究利用JWST-NIRCam深度观测了Serpens Main星形成区，并发现了20个候选原恒星喷流，并确定了它们的驱动源。研究发现这些喷流的位置角呈现强相关，并与该区域的小丝主轴对齐。这表明这些对齐的原恒星可能是在相似时间内形成，并继承自局部云小丝的类似自旋。此外，还发现了对北西和东南星团的平均PA存在系统性变化，以及东南部原恒星的PA散度增加。SOIA-HAWC+存档的观测数据也显示了垂直于主导喷流方向的情况。 <div>
We present deep 1.4–4.8 μm JWST-NIRCam imaging of the Serpens Main star-forming region and identify 20 candidate protostellar outflows, most with bipolar structure and identified driving sources. The outflow position angles (PAs) are strongly correlated, and they are aligned within ±24° of the major axis of the Serpens filament. These orientations are further aligned with the angular momentum vectors of the two disk shadows in this region. We estimate that the probability of this number of young stars being coaligned if sampled from a uniform PA distribution is 10−4. This in turn suggests that the aligned protostars, which seem to be at similar evolutionary stages based on their outflow dynamics, formed at similar times with a similar spin inherited from a local cloud filament. Further, there is tentative evidence for a systematic change in average PA between the northwestern and southeastern cluster, as well as increased scatter in the PAs of the southeastern protostars. SOFIA-HAWC+ archival dust polarization observations of Serpens Main at 154 and 214 μm are perpendicular to the dominant jet orientation in the northwestern region in particular. We measure and locate shock knots and edges for all of the outflows and provide an identifying catalog. We suggest that Serpens main is a cluster that formed from an isolated filament and due to its youth retains its primordial outflow alignment.

<div> UHECRs, cosmic magnetism, Local Sheet, transient emissions, gamma-ray bursts
<br /><br />总结:
本研究基于UHECRs的到达方向和射线强度提供了瞬变源的证据，并将光学和红外调查得到的三维物质分布作为UHECRs源的密度模型。研究发现，本地薄片是地球观测者所观察到的UHECR爆发的磁化结构，并且还提出了磁场的湍流振幅必须在0.5-20 nG范围内，换言之，UHECRs的爆发率密度必须在50-5000 Gpc^-3 yr^-1的范围内才能合理解释观测到的UHECRs。最后，研究表明，唯一符合加速UHECRs能谱要求的星际瞬变事件是长持续时间的伽玛射线暴。 <div>
The arrival directions of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) observed above 4 × 1019 eV provide evidence of localized excesses that are key to identifying their sources. We leverage the 3D matter distribution from optical and infrared surveys as a density model of UHECR sources, which are considered to be transient. Agreement of the sky model with UHECR data imposes constraints on both the emission rate per unit matter and the time spread induced by encountered turbulent magnetic fields. Based on radio measurements of cosmic magnetism, we identify the Local Sheet as the magnetized structure responsible for the kiloyear duration of UHECR bursts for an observer on Earth and find that the turbulence amplitude must be within 0.5–20 nG for a coherence length of 10 kpc. At the same time, the burst-rate density must be above 50 Gpc−3 yr−1 for Local Sheet galaxies to reproduce the UHECR excesses and below 5000 Gpc−3 yr−1 (30,000 Gpc−3 yr−1) for the Milky Way (Local Group galaxies) not to outshine other galaxies. For the transient emissions of protons and nuclei to match the energy spectra of UHECRs, the kinetic energy of the outflows responsible for UHECR acceleration must be below 4 × 1054 erg and above 5 × 1050 erg (2 × 1049 erg) if we consider the Milky Way (or not). The only stellar-sized transients that satisfy both Hillas’ and our criteria are long-duration gamma-ray bursts.

该研究对大麦哲伦星云和小麦哲伦星云内34个mYSOs进行了观测，发现在大麦哲伦星云中宽双星的比例为9% ± 5%，而在小麦哲伦星云中则低于5%。研究排除了大麦哲伦星云和小麦哲伦星云中宽双星比例高于35%和38%的可能性。相比之下，据文献报道，银河系中mYSOs的宽双星比例约为15%–60%。研究认为金属丰度和环境因素可能影响了大质量恒星宽双星的形成。未来需要更大规模的低金属丰度环境下的高质量系统样本，以确认或反驳该观点。<br /><br /> <div>
Constraints on the binary fraction of massive young stellar objects (mYSOs) are important for binary and massive star formation theory. Here, we present speckle imaging of 34 mYSOs located in the Large Magellanic Cloud (1/2 Z⊙) and Small Magellanic Cloud (∼1/5 Z⊙), probing projected separations in the 2000 to 20,000 au (at angular scales of 0.″02–0.″2) range, for stars above 8 M⊙. We find two wide binaries in the Large Magellanic Cloud (from a sample of 23 targets), but none in a sample of 11 in the Small Magellanic Cloud, leading us to adopt a wide binary fraction of 9% ± 5% and <5%, respectively. We rule out a wide binary fraction greater than 35% in the Large Magellanic Cloud and 38% in the Small Magellanic Cloud at the 99% confidence level. This is in contrast to the wide binary fraction of mYSOs in the Milky Way (presumed to be 1 Z⊙), which within the physical parameter space probed by this study is ∼15%–60% from the literature. We argue that while selection effects could be responsible for the lower binary fraction observed, it is more likely that there are underlying physical mechanisms responsible for the observed properties. This indicates that metallicity and environmental effects may influence the formation of wide binaries among massive stars. Future larger, more statistically significant samples of high-mass systems in low-metallicity environments for comparison to the Milky Way, are essential to confirm or repudiate our claim.

总结:
太阳III型射电爆发是太阳冕层和星际空间中高能电子活动的重要指标。本研究分析了帕克太阳探测器在05至11次接触期间记录的43次星际III型射电爆发，观察频率范围在19-0.5 MHz之间的时间特征。研究结果显示，这些射电爆发的持续时间、速度、带宽和漂移速率均与频率有关。电子束的速度与爆发持续时间呈负相关，速度越快，持续时间越短。此外，爆发持续时间与上升、峰值和衰减时间呈现出明显的相关性，说明整个时间轮廓共同影响事件持续时间。这些复杂的发现揭示了影响爆发动态的物理机制，揭示了电子束特性与观测到的III型太阳射电爆发的时间和频谱特性之间错综复杂的相互作用。 <br /><br /> <div>
Solar type III radio bursts are crucial indicators of energetic electron activity in the solar corona and interplanetary space. Our assessment of 43 interplanetary type III bursts, recorded by the FIELDS instrument on board the Parker Solar Probe during Encounters 05 to 11, has led to significant and complex findings. We have analyzed time profile features across a frequency range of 19–0.5 MHz, revealing dependencies on frequency and providing insights into duration, burst speeds, bandwidths, and drift rates. This novel analysis has unveiled a spectral index of −0.63 ± 0.04 for rise, −0.69 ± 0.03 for decay time, and −0.68 ± 0.03 for the total duration. We have determined the average electron beam velocities for front, middle, and back as 0.15c, 0.13c, and 0.08c, respectively. Our findings show that faster electron beams generate emissions with shorter duration. The average ratio of the front-to-back velocity is 1.87, and the ratio of front-to-middle velocity is 1.23. We have also discovered a strong relationship between burst duration with rise, peak, and decay times, particularly pronounced with decay time (correlation coefficient = 0.95). This indicates that the entire temporal profile, including rise, peak, and decay phases, collectively contributes to event duration and is not solely influenced by external factors like plasma conditions or electron beam dynamics but also by internal burst processes. These complex findings shed light on the physical mechanisms governing burst dynamics, revealing intricate interactions between electron beam characteristics and observed temporal and spectral traits of type III solar radio bursts.

总结:
本研究通过对所有已知红移的Fermi GRB的时间分辨光谱进行广泛分析，通过对比热辐射和非热辐射组分，诊断了每个时间段的σ0。结果表明，大多数GRB射流可能包含显著的磁能量组分，可能具有磁化因子σ0 ≥ 10。σ0的值在同一个GRB内似乎变化显著。未来的研究将通过更多样本的实验，特别是那些覆盖更低能光谱信息的实验，进一步验证我们的结果。 <div>
The composition of gamma-ray burst (GRB) jets remained a mystery until recently. In practice, we usually characterize the magnetization of the GRB jets (σ0) through the ratio between the Poynting flux and matter (baryonic) flux. With the increasing value of σ0, magnetic energy gradually takes on a dominant role in the acceleration and energy dissipation of the jet, causing the proportion of thermal component in the prompt-emission spectrum of GRBs to gradually decrease or even be completely suppressed. In this work, we conducted an extensive analysis of the time-resolved spectrum for all Fermi GRBs with known redshift, and we diagnose σ0 for each time bin by contrasting the thermal and nonthermal radiation components. Our results suggest that most GRB jets should contain a significant magnetic energy component, likely with magnetization factors σ0 ≥ 10. The value of σ0 seems to vary significantly within the same GRB. Future studies with more samples, especially those with lower-energy spectral information coverage, will further verify our results.

We present a stellar dynamical mass measurement of the supermassive black hole in the elliptical (E1) galaxy NGC 3258. Our findings are based on integral field unit spectroscopy from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) observations in narrow-field mode with adaptive optics and the MUSE wide-field mode, from which we extract kinematic information by fitting the Ca ii and Mg b triplets, respectively. Using axisymmetric, three-integral Schwarzschild orbit library models, we fit the observed line-of-sight velocity distributions to infer the supermassive black hole mass, the H-band mass-to-light ratio, the asymptotic circular velocity, and the dark matter halo scale radius of the galaxy. We report a black hole mass of (2.2 ± 0.2) × 109M⊙ at an assumed distance of 31.9 Mpc. This value is in close agreement with a previous measurement from Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array CO observations. The consistency between these two measurements provides strong support for both the gas dynamical and stellar dynamical methods.

本文通过使用CHARA阵列对Cepheid Polaris进行了30年的轨道观测，并在Apache Point Observatory使用斑点干涉测量进行了额外的测量。使用自定义网格模型拟合程序和CANDID软件确认了伴星的星位置，结合大量的径向速度数据拟合了轨道，推导出Cepheid的质量为5.13 ± 0.28 M⊙。此外，文章还讨论了Polaris的一些异常特性，以及关于表面斑点的识别。文章提出了脉动模式、轨道近日点穿越和低脉动幅度这些因素在脉动中的作用，以解释这些特性。 <div>
The 30 yr orbit of the Cepheid Polaris has been followed with observations by the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy (CHARA) Array from 2016 through 2021. An additional measurement has been made with speckle interferometry at the Apache Point Observatory. Detection of the companion is complicated by its comparative faintness—an extreme flux ratio. Angular diameter measurements appear to show some variation with pulsation phase. Astrometric positions of the companion were measured with a custom grid-based model-fitting procedure and confirmed with the CANDID software. These positions were combined with the extensive radial velocities (RVs) discussed by Torres to fit an orbit. Because of the imbalance of the sizes of the astrometry and RV data sets, several methods of weighting are discussed. The resulting mass of the Cepheid is 5.13 ± 0.28 M⊙. Because of the comparatively large eccentricity of the orbit (0.63), the mass derived is sensitive to the value found for the eccentricity. The mass combined with the distance shows that the Cepheid is more luminous than predicted for this mass from evolutionary tracks. The identification of surface spots is discussed. This would give credence to the identification of a radial velocity variation with a period of approximately 120 days as a rotation period. Polaris has some unusual properties (rapid period change, a phase jump, variable amplitude, and unusual polarization). However, a pulsation scenario involving pulsation mode, orbital periastron passage, and low pulsation amplitude can explain these characteristics within the framework of pulsation seen in Cepheids.

总结: 
该研究描述了与Chamaeleon-MMS1候选FHSC（首个静力核）相关的局部（∼4000天文单位）流出活动及其对周围物质的影响，以确定这个年轻的低质量源的演化状态。观测结果显示Chamaeleon-MMS1存在低能流出，流出物质对周围气体的影响并推断其旋转温度。通过分析分子示踪物质，结果表明Chamaeleon-MMS1虽然不是FHSC，但其流出的能量较其他0级天体要小，并且其物理特性与其他低光度原恒星的范围相符。推测Chamaeleon-MMS1是已知最年轻的星源之一。 <br /><br /> <div>
The earliest stages of low-mass star formation are unclear, with the first hydrostatic core (FHSC) as the transition stage between a prestellar and protostellar core. This work describes the local (∼4000 au) outflow activity associated with candidate FHSC Chamaeleon-MMS1 and its effect on the surrounding material to determine the evolutionary state of this young low-mass source. We observed Chamaeleon-MMS1 with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array at 220 GHz at high spatial (∼75 au) and spectral resolutions (0.1–0.3 km s−1). A low-energy outflow is detected, consisting of two components, a broad spectral feature (Δv ∼ 8 km s−1) to the northeast and narrow spectral features (Δv ∼ 1 km s−1) to both the northeast and southwest. The molecular tracers CS, formaldehyde (H2CO), and methanol (CH3OH) were used to analyze the effect of the outflows on the surrounding gas and determine its rotational temperature. The rotational temperature of H2CO is 40 K toward the continuum source with similarly low temperatures (10–75 K) toward clumps affected by the outflow. CH3OH is only detected toward gas clumps located away from the continuum source, where the methanol is expected to have been released by the energy of the outflow through ice sputtering. While molecular emission and high outflow speeds rule Cha-MMS1 out as an FHSC, its outflow is less energetic than those of other Class 0 objects and its physical properties are within the range covered by other low-luminosity protostars. The inferred gas temperatures toward the continuum source are also relatively low, indicating that Cha-MMS1 is one of the youngest known sources.

<div> TP-AGB, R Hya, MESA, GYRE, mode driving<br />
<br />Evolutionary and asteroseismic features of the evolved thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) star R Hya are studied using theoretical pulse spectra computed with MESA and oscillation spectra with GYRE. The star is found to be most likely driven by the fundamental mode and currently in the "power-down" phase of an intermediate pulse. The pulsation period is predicted to continue to shorten for millennia. The analysis suggests that R Hya has undergone third dredge-up in its most recent pulse. The MESA + GYRE model grid used in this study is the first publicly available grid of TP-AGB models with seismology and includes exact solutions to the linear, adiabatic equations of stellar oscillation for the first 10 radial-order pressure modes for every time step in every evolutionary track. The grid is open source and packaged with a data visualization application.<br /><br />总结: <br />通过MESA和GYRE计算了R Hya的脉动光谱和振荡光谱，并确定其可能由基频模式驱动，并处于中级脉冲的“功率下降”阶段。预测其脉动周期将在千年内继续缩短。分析表明，R Hya最近的脉冲中很可能经历了第三次深度混合。使用MESA + GYRE模型网格是首个包含来自MESA的TP-AGB模型和地震学数据的公开网格，该网格包括针对每个演化轨道的每个时间步长的前10个径向压力模式的线性绝热方程的确切解。 <div>
We present a comprehensive characterization of the evolved thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) star R Hydrae (R Hya), building on the techniques applied in Stellar Evolution in Real Time I (Molnár et al.) to T Ursae Minoris. We compute over 3000 theoretical TP-AGB pulse spectra using MESA and the corresponding oscillation spectra with GYRE. We combine these with classical observational constraints and nearly 400 years of measurements of R Hya’s period evolution to fit R Hya’s evolutionary and asteroseismic features. Two hypotheses for the mode driving R Hya’s period are considered. Solutions that identify this as the fundamental mode (FM) as well as the first overtone are consistent with observations. Using a variety of statistical tests, we find that R Hya is most likely driven by the FM and currently occupies the “power-down” phase of an intermediate pulse (TP ∼ 9–16). We predict that its pulsation period will continue to shorten for millennia. Supported by calculations from the Monash stellar evolution code, we find that R Hya has most likely undergone third dredge-up in its most recent pulse. The MESA + GYRE model grid used in this analysis includes exact solutions to the linear, adiabatic equations of stellar oscillation for the first 10 radial-order pressure modes for every time step in every evolutionary track. The grid is fully open source and packaged with a data visualization application. This is the first publicly available grid of TP-AGB models with seismology produced with MESA.

<div> TDEs, radio observations, late-time brightening, delayed launch, radio emission<br />
<br />
这篇文章报道了对23个光学发现的潮汐撕裂事件（TDEs）进行的射电观测结果。研究发现9个TDEs在较早时期没有检测到射电发射的现象，但在数百至2300天之后出现了迟来的明亮现象。另外还有7个TDEs的射电发射的起源不明确，可能归因于宿主星系或活动星系核。同时，报告了一个TDE在之前射电观测到约103天后出现了新的上升成分。有些TDE的射电发射在约2-4年内达到峰值，但超过一半的样本仍在上升阶段。数据显示大约40%的光学TDE会在发现后数百到数千天之后在射电波段被探测到，这可能比在约102天时出现的早期射电发射更为普遍。利用等离子体平衡分析，研究发现射电发射喷流可能存在延迟启动现象，延迟时间约为500-2000天，推测速度为0.02-0.15c，动能约为1047-1049 erg。该研究排除了非轴向相对论性喷流的可能性，得出延迟的流出可能是更可能的解释，可能是由于延迟的盘形成。最后得出结论，晚期射电发射标志着TDE演化的一个相当普遍但迄今被忽视的阶段。<br /><br />总结: TDE中存在晚期射电亮度增幅现象，可能由延迟启动的射电喷流产生，而非相对论性喷流，暗示了TDE演化的一个普遍但被忽视的阶段。 <div>
We present radio observations of 23 optically discovered tidal disruption events (TDEs) on timescales of ∼500–3200 days postdiscovery. We detect nine new TDEs that did not have detectable radio emission at earlier times, indicating a late-time brightening after several hundred (and up to 2300) days; an additional seven TDEs exhibit radio emission whose origin is ambiguous or may be attributed to the host galaxy or an active galactic nucleus. We also report a new rising component in one TDE previously detected in the radio at ∼103 days. While the radio emission in some of the detected TDEs peaked on a timescale ≈2–4 yr, over half of the sample still show rising emission. The range of luminosities for the sample is ∼1037–1039 erg s−1, about 2 orders of magnitude below the radio luminosity of the relativistic TDE Sw J1644+57. Our data set indicates ∼40% of all optical TDEs are detected in radio hundreds to thousands of days after discovery, and that this is probably more common than early radio emission peaking at ∼102 days. Using an equipartition analysis, we find evidence for a delayed launch of the radio-emitting outflows, with delay timescales of ∼500–2000 days, inferred velocities of ≈0.02–0.15c, and kinetic energies of ∼1047–1049 erg. We rule out off-axis relativistic jets as a viable explanation for this population, and conclude delayed outflows are a more likely explanation, possibly from delayed disk formation. We conclude late radio emission marks a fairly ubiquitous but heretofore overlooked phase of TDE evolution.

<div> 关键词: 双线发射, Mg ii, 共振散射, 球对称, 线比

总结:<br />
这项研究探讨了共振散射对Mg ii双线及恒星连续谱在球形和圆柱形几何中的影响。研究结果表明，在特定情况下，共振散射可导致双线流量比和逃逸流超出球形介质中期望的水平。在球对称且带尘埃的散射介质中，双线比一贯低于固有比值。然而，如果散射介质呈盘状，如正对盘状星系，并且被正对观察到，则预计双线比将高于2。同时还指出，在球形模型中，纯尘埃衰减无法解释紧凑星形成星系中观察到的双线比低于1.5的现象，除非灰尘不透明度明显偏离我们银河系的灰尘与Mg+气体比。讨论了连续泵浦发射线和膨胀介质对观测方面的重要性，包括双线流量比可能低于1.5或高于2，以及对称或不对称的线型。还讨论了扩散的温暖中性介质可能是Mg ii发射的重要来源。这些结果为理解遥远、空间未解析星系的形状和方向的复杂性提供了见解。 <div>
Observations of metallic doublet emission lines, particularly Mg iiλλ2796, 2803, provide crucial information for understanding galaxies and their circumgalactic medium. This study explores the effects of resonant scattering on the Mg ii doublet lines and the stellar continuum in spherical and cylindrical geometries. Our findings show that under certain circumstances, resonance scattering can cause an increase in the doublet flux ratio and the escaping flux of the lines beyond what is expected in optically thin spherical media. As expected, the doublet ratio is consistently lower than the intrinsic ratio when the scattering medium is spherically symmetric and dusty. However, if the scattering medium has a disk shape, such as face-on disk galaxies, and is viewed face-on, the doublet ratio is predicted to be higher than 2. It is also shown that doublet ratios as low as those observed in compact star-forming galaxies cannot be explained solely by pure dust attenuation of intrinsic Mg ii emission lines in spherical models unless dust opacity deviates markedly from that expected based on the dust-to-Mg+ gas ratio of our Galaxy. The importance of the continuum-pumped emission lines and expanding media is discussed to understand observational aspects, including doublet flux ratios, which can be lower than 1.5 or higher than 2, as well as symmetric or asymmetric line profiles. It is also discussed that the diffuse warm neutral medium may be an important source of Mg ii emission. These results provide insight into the complexity of the shape and orientation of distant, spatially unresolved galaxies.

<title>Resonant Absorption of Standing Magnetohydrodynamic Waves in Coronal Loops in the Absence of Directional Symmetry: The Effect of Plasma Flow</title>

<div> Magnetohydrodynamic, Standing Waves, Coronal Loops, Plasma Flow, Damping Rate
<br /><br />总结:
本文研究了日冕回路中静止磁流体动力学（MHD）波的振荡特性。研究模型将日冕回路建模为一个纯粹纵向磁场和沿磁场方向的等离子体流动的直筒。该模型包括一个不均匀的过渡层，导致波的谐振衰减。研究的目的是确定在流动回路中的静止MHD波的阻尼率，其中由于等离子体流动的存在，回路的方向对称性被破坏。为了解决这个问题，在采用的摄动方法中，我们让振荡频率和阻尼率都受到摄动。随着流速的增加，静止波的振荡频率减小，但阻尼率增加。因此，静止波的振荡频率与阻尼率的比值成为流速的一个更为下降的函数。流动是决定谐振吸收效果的重要因素。在流动回路中，即使是在薄的过渡层的情况下，谐振吸收也可以导致阻尼率达到周期时间的量级，这与观测结果一致。 <div>
The oscillation properties of standing magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves in coronal loops have been investigated. The coronal loop is modeled as a straight cylinder with a purely longitudinal magnetic field and a field-aligned plasma flow. The loop model includes an inhomogeneous transitional layer that causes the wave to be resonantly damped. Our aim is to determine the damping rate of the standing MHD waves in flowing loops, in which the directional symmetry of the loop has been broken due to the presence of plasma flow. To do this, the standing wave has been considered as the superposition of two propagating waves with opposite directions of propagation but the same oscillation frequency and damping rate. Due to the absence of directional symmetry in the loop, it seems that the propagating components of the standing wave cannot have the same oscillation frequency and damping rate. To overcome this problem, in the perturbation method employed, we let both the oscillation frequency and damping rate be perturbed. As the flow speed increases the oscillation frequency of the standing wave decreases but its damping rate increases. As a result, the ratio of the oscillation frequency to the damping rate of the standing wave becomes a more decreasing function of the flow speed. The flow is an important quantity in determining the effectiveness of resonant absorption. In flowing loops even in the case of a thin transitional layer, resonant absorption can result in a damping rate on the order of the period time, which is in agreement with observations.

<div> 关键词: 太阳耀斑, 电离层, X射线, 极端紫外线, 电子浓度
总结:
太阳耀斑发出的X射线和极端紫外辐射会导致地球电离层中电子浓度显著增加。过去的研究已经对太阳耀斑的冲击阶段对总电子含量（TEC）的影响进行了充分的研究，但最近的研究表明，大部分X级耀斑都会有一个强烈的“EUV晚期”辐射峰，其对电离层层化的影响尚不清楚。通过对2011年11月3日发生的X2.9太阳耀斑的冲击、逐渐和晚期阶段的太阳辐射及其引起的TEC变化进行综合分析，得出了较弱的Fe xv 28.4 nm太阳辐射在EUV晚期的高地球效应。研究发现，相对较弱的EUV晚期辐射对X2.9太阳耀斑的电离层反应几乎相当于冲击阶段的TEC增加的三分之一。 <div>
Variations in X-ray and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) irradiance during solar flares lead to a noticeable increase in the electron concentration in the illuminated part of the Earth’s ionosphere. Due to the large amount of experimental data accumulated by global navigation satellite systems, the total electron content (TEC) response to the impulsive phase of a solar flare has been studied quite well. However, recent studies have shown that a large fraction of X-class flares have a second strong peak of warm coronal emission (which is called “EUV late phase”), whose influence on the ionization of ionospheric layers is not yet clear. A combined analysis of successive solar emissions and the caused TEC changes made it possible to numerically estimate the ionospheric response to the impulsive, gradual, and late phases of the X2.9 solar flare that occurred on 2011 November 3 and demonstrate the high geoeffectiveness of the rather weak Fe xv 28.4 nm solar emission during the EUV late phase. It was found that the ionospheric response to the relatively weak emissions of the EUV late phase of the X2.9 solar flare amounted to almost a third of the TEC increase during the impulsive phase.

We report evidence for enhanced quenching in low-redshift galaxy clusters hosting radio relics. This effect is strongest for low-mass galaxies and is consistent with a rapid quenching of star formation. These results imply that merger shocks in the intracluster medium play a role in driving environmental quenching, which we argue is due to elevated ram pressure in these disturbed systems.

利用PCWI观测了AGC 102004的离子化气体(Hα和[N II])，并使用JCMT接收机进行了深入的CO(2–1)观测。Hα的速度场显示出北西部盘的异常分布，其谱线以两个高斯分量进行良好拟合，其中弱高斯分量由北西盘的异常Hα主导。Hα发射的高斯拟合中心偏离了+24.2 km s−1，得到的系统速度与H i发射的系统速度不符。我们利用[N II]λ6583/Hα比值作为代理推导了气相金属丰度12+log(O/H)，整个星系的平均值为8.30 ± 0.19。外部盘的金属丰度低至探测限7.72，表明AGC 102004存在金属丰度梯度。我们推测北西盘可能发生了次要/微小并合事件。AGC 102004中的CO(2–1)发射未探测到，噪声水平为0.33 mK，经过30 km s−1平滑。AGC 102004中的分子气体质量上限为2.1 × 107M⊙，XCO = 3.02 × 1020 cm−2 (K km s−1)−1。AGC 102004的M_gas/L_B比值低于0.0037，低于正常星系。

We present the integral field spectroscopic observations of ionized gas (Hα and [N II]) using the PCWI, along with deep CO(2–1) observations by the receiver on JCMT for AGC 102004. The velocity field of Hα shows an anomalous distribution in the northwestern (NW) disk. The Hα spectrum is well-fitted by two Gaussian components, and the weak Gaussian component is dominated by the anomalous Hα in the NW disk. The Gaussian fit center of Hα emission is offset by +24.2 km s−1 from the systemic velocity obtained from the H i emission. We derive the gas-phase metallicity, 12+log(O/H), using [N II]λ6583/Hα ratio as a proxy. The mean value of 12+log(O/H) is 8.30 ± 0.19 over the whole galaxy. The metallicity in the outer disk is lower than the detection limit of 7.72, indicating the metallicity gradient exists in AGC 102004. We speculate a minor/mini-merger event could have happened to the NW disk. CO(2–1) emission has nondetection in AGC 102004, reaching a noise level of 0.33 mK smoothed to 30 km s−1. The upper limit of molecular gas mass in AGC 102004 is 2.1 × 107M⊙ with XCO = 3.02 × 1020 cm−2 (K km s−1)−1. The /M of AGC 102004 is lower than 0.0037 and lower than that of normal galaxies.

Low-mass galaxies can significantly contribute to reionization due to their potentially high Lyman continuum (LyC) escape fraction and relatively high space density. We present a constraint on the LyC escape fraction from low-mass galaxies at z = 1.3–3.0. We obtained rest-frame UV continuum imaging with the ACS/SBC and the WFC3/UVIS from the Hubble Space Telescope for eight strongly lensed galaxies that were identified in the Sloan Giant Arc Survey and the Cluster Lensing and Supernova survey with Hubble. The targeted galaxies were selected to be spectroscopically confirmed, highly magnified, and blue in their UV spectral shapes (β < −1.7). Our targets include intrinsically low-luminosity galaxies down to a magnification-corrected absolute UV magnitude MUV ∼ −14. We perform custom-defined aperture photometry to place the most reliable upper limits of LyC escape from our sample. From our observations, we report no significant (>2σ) detections of LyC fluxes, placing 1σ upper limits on the absolute LyC escape fractions of 3%–15%. Our observations do not support the expected increased escape fractions of LyC photons from intrinsically UV faint sources. Considering the highly anisotropic geometry of LyC escape, increasing the sample size of faint galaxies in future LyC observations is crucial.

总结: 该研究调查了117个本地宿主低光度、宽谱线活动星系核(AGN)的星团质量和黑洞质量之间的关系。研究发现，相比于静止的黑洞，这些AGN的黑洞质量比早期星系中的黑洞要小上一个数量级。通过使用星团-盘分解和颜色相关的质量-光度比确定星团质量，发现这些AGN样本的黑洞质量与星系早期类型中的动态探测到的黑洞所定义的黑洞-星团质量关系仍存在明显偏离。研究提示，对于非椭圆形和星团主导系统的星系，使用传统的黑洞-星团质量关系可能会导致高度偏见的解释。这项工作对于与本地黑洞-星团质量关系相关的引力波探测和宇宙学模拟的预测具有直接影响。 <div>
We investigate the relation between black hole (BH) mass and bulge stellar mass for a sample of 117 local (z ∼ 0) galaxies hosting low-luminosity, broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Our sample comes from Reines & Volonteri, who found that, for a given total stellar mass, these AGNs have BH masses more than an order of magnitude smaller than those in early-type galaxies with quiescent BHs. Here, we aim to determine whether or not this AGN sample falls on the canonical BH-to-bulge mass relation by utilizing bulge–disk decompositions and determining bulge stellar masses using color-dependent mass-to-light ratios. We find that our AGN sample remains offset by more than an order of magnitude from the MBH–Mbulge relation defined by early-type galaxies with dynamically detected BHs. We caution that using canonical BH-to-bulge mass relations for galaxies other than ellipticals and bulge-dominated systems may lead to highly biased interpretations. This work bears directly on predictions for gravitational-wave detections and cosmological simulations that are tied to the local BH-to-bulge mass relations.

<div> Event Horizon Telescope, black hole image, Bayesian imaging, ring shape, ellipticity
<br /><br />总结:
2019年，事件视界望远镜（EHT）首次在视界尺度上产生了黑洞图像。该研究重新分析了2017年的M87* EHT数据，使用贝叶斯成像技术构建了环形形状的后验概率。结果发现，贝叶斯成像更可靠地恢复了真实的环形形状。进一步发现，M87*的环形椭圆度与广义相对论磁流体动力学模拟得到的测量结果一致。这一发现表明，通过测量黑洞图像的属性，可以限制对广义相对论在视界尺度上的偏差。 <div>
Measuring the properties of black hole images has the potential to constrain deviations from general relativity on horizon scales. Of particular interest is the ellipticity of the ring that is sensitive to the underlying spacetime. In 2019, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) produced the first-ever image of a black hole on horizon scales. Here, we reanalyze the M87* EHT 2017 data using Bayesian imaging (BI) techniques, constructing a posterior of the ring shape. We find that BI recovers the true on-sky ring shape more reliably than the original imaging methods used in 2019. As a result, we find that M87*'s ring ellipticity is and is consistent with the measured ellipticity from general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations.

<div> 频谱特性，脉冲星，uGMRT，光度变化，干涉比<br />
总结:<br />
本文研究了使用uGMRT发现的10颗脉冲星的频谱特性，观测时间跨度为2017年至2023年，使用uGMRT的band 3（300-500 MHz）和band 4（550-750 MHz）。对这些脉冲星，我们报道了平均观测频段和所有观测时段的一系列频谱指数，范围约为0至-4.8。我们还计算了每颗脉冲星跨7-8个子频段的平均流量密度，计算了调制指数以及每个子频段内的平均和最大-中位数流量密度。我们使用流量密度的时间变化计算了折射闪烁时间尺度，并估计了样本中8颗脉冲星的时间滞后结构函数。我们注意到频谱的显著时间演化，分为三类：具有单一正频谱指数、多段折断功率谱、以及单一负频谱指数。此外，所有脉冲星均显示了低频拐点的迹象，拐点频率的时间变化（有些时段观测到了拐点，而另一些时段未观测到）也引起了注意。据我们所知，这是首次系统的探索脉冲星频谱和拐点频率的时间变化。未来的密集监测和频谱建模探索将为我们提供关于脉冲星固有发射特性和星际介质性质的重要见解。 <div>
This paper presents an investigation of the spectral properties of 10 millisecond pulsars (MSPs) discovered by the uGMRT, observed from 2017 to 2023 using band 3 (300–500 MHz) and 4 (550–750 MHz) of the uGMRT. For these MSPs, we have reported a range of spectral indices from ∼0 to −4.8, while averaging the full observing band and all the observing epochs. For every MSP, we calculated the mean flux density across 7–8 subbands, each with approximately 25 MHz bandwidth spanning band 3 and band 4. We computed their modulation indices as well as average and maximum-to-median flux density within each subband. Using the temporal variations of the flux density we calculated the refractive scintillation timescales and estimated a structure function with a time lag for eight MSPs in the sample. We note a significant temporal evolution of the in-band spectra, classified into three categories based on the nature of the best-fit power-law spectra, having single positive spectral indices, multiple broken power laws, and single negative spectral indices. Additionally, indications of a low-frequency turnover and temporal variations of the turnover frequency (to the extent that turnover was observed for some of the epochs while not seen for the rest) were noted for all the MSPs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic investigation probing temporal changes in MSP spectra as well as in the turnover frequency. Future exploration with dense monitoring combined with the modeling of spectra can provide vital insight into the intrinsic emission properties of MSPs and interstellar medium properties.

<div> PHANGS survey, PAH fraction, JWST, interstellar medium, MIRI filters
<br /><br />总结:
研究使用JWST的MIR观测19个邻近星系，发现PAH的分数在H ii区域急剧下降，显示了这些小颗粒在电离气体区域的破坏。而在H ii区域之外，PHANGS样本中的RPAH呈均匀分布，平均值为3.43 ± 0.98，对应于照射辐射强度为太阳邻域的2-5倍，PAH的值为3%-6%。 <div>
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a ubiquitous component of the interstellar medium (ISM) in z ∼ 0 massive, star-forming galaxies and play key roles in ISM energy balance, chemistry, and shielding. Wide field-of-view, high-resolution mid-infrared (MIR) images from JWST provide the ability to map the fraction of dust in the form of PAHs and the properties of these key dust grains at 10–50 pc resolution in galaxies outside the Local Group. We use MIR JWST photometric observations of a sample of 19 nearby galaxies from the Physics at High Angular Resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS) survey to investigate the variations of the PAH fraction. By comparison to lower-resolution far-infrared mapping, we show that a combination of the MIRI filters (RPAH = [F770W+F1130W]/F2100W) traces the fraction of dust by mass in the form of PAHs (i.e., the PAH fraction, or qPAH). Mapping RPAH across the 19 PHANGS galaxies, we find that the PAH fraction steeply decreases in H ii regions, revealing the destruction of these small grains in regions of ionized gas. Outside H ii regions, we find RPAH is constant across the PHANGS sample with an average value of 3.43 ± 0.98, which, for an illuminating radiation field of intensity 2–5 times that of the radiation field in the solar neighborhood, corresponds to qPAH values of 3%–6%.

在第四版Fermi-LAT 14年目录中，大部分的射电源仍未被识别。研究人员通过改进机器学习管道，成功对1206个具有信噪比大于3的X射线源进行分类，并在光学上对73个未被识别的Fermi-LAT 14年目录中的源进行了分类。他们对X射线源进行了八种天体物理类别的分类。作者还提出了未来的观测策略和管道改进，以实现更准确的分类。研究人员在光学数据中确定了42个GeV源的103个可靠X射线对应物。他们还发现2个GeV源可能是孤立的中子星候选体，16个可能是活跃星系核候选体，七个与星系的形成区相关，还有八个模糊的案例。最后，他们提出了管道的进一步改进以及可能导致更准确分类的观测策略。 
<br /><br />总结: <div>
A large fraction of Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT) sources in the fourth Fermi-LAT 14 yr catalog (4FGL) still remain unidentified (unIDed). We continued to improve our machine-learning pipeline and used it to classify 1206 X-ray sources with signal-to-noise ratios >3 located within the extent of 73 unIDed 4FGL sources with Chandra X-ray Observatory observations included in the Chandra Source Catalog 2.0. Recent improvements to our pipeline include astrometric corrections, probabilistic cross-matching to lower-frequency counterparts, and a more realistic oversampling method. X-ray sources are classified into eight broad predetermined astrophysical classes defined in the updated training data set, which we also release. We present details of the machine-learning classification, describe the pipeline improvements, and perform an additional spectral and variability analysis for brighter sources. The classifications give 103 plausible X-ray counterparts to 42 GeV sources. We identify 2 GeV sources as isolated neutron star candidates, 16 as active galactic nucleus candidates, seven as sources associated with star-forming regions, and eight as ambiguous cases. For the remaining 40 unIDed 4FGL sources, we could not identify any plausible counterpart in X-rays, or they are too close to the Galactic Center. Finally, we outline the observational strategies and further improvements in the pipeline that can lead to more accurate classifications.

<div> 关键词: Solar Orbiter, turbulence, wave packets, coherent structures, PDFs
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章总结了Solar Orbiter（SO）任务的观测结果，研究了太阳风湍流的演变过程。通过对九个均匀湍流的扩展时间段的观测分析，确定了磁场涨落的波包和相干结构的特征。研究使用了两种小波进行分解，分别是能够解析波包和不连续性的Daubechies 10（Db10）和Haar小波。结果显示，在小尺度上，湍流涨落的概率分布函数（PDFs）呈现出伸展的尾部，在级联的外尺度处变为高斯分布。对小波涨落的PDFs进行直方图和Q-Q图比较，揭示了三个不同的行为阶段。研究还发现了在惯性范围和动能范围内，小波涨落的PDFs存在差异，并确定了波包和相干结构的物理特性在不同尺度范围内发生了交叉。这些结果为认识湍流级联过程中的不同物理机制提供了新的见解。 <div>
The Solar Orbiter (SO) mission provides the opportunity to study the evolution of solar wind turbulence. We use SO observations of nine extended intervals of homogeneous turbulence to determine when turbulent magnetic field fluctuations may be characterized as: (i) wave packets and (ii) coherent structures (CSs). We perform the first systematic scale-by-scale decomposition of the magnetic field using two wavelets known to resolve wave packets and discontinuities, the Daubechies 10 (Db10) and Haar, respectively. The probability distribution functions (PDFs) of turbulent fluctuations on small scales exhibit stretched tails, becoming Gaussian at the outer scale of the cascade. Using quantile–quantile plots, we directly compare the wavelet fluctuations PDFs, revealing three distinct regimes of behavior. Deep within the inertial range (IR) both decompositions give essentially the same fluctuation PDFs. Deep within the kinetic range (KR) the PDFs are distinct as the Haar decompositions have larger variance and more extended tails. On intermediate scales, spanning the IR–KR break, the PDF is composed of two populations: a core of common functional form containing ∼97% of fluctuations, and tails that are more extended for the Haar decompositions than the Db10 decompositions. This establishes a crossover between wave-packet (core) and CS (tail) phenomenology in the IR and KR, respectively. The range of scales where the PDFs are two-component is narrow at 0.9 au (4–16 s) and broader (0.5–8 s) at 0.4 au. As CS and wave–wave interactions are both candidates to mediate the turbulent cascade, these results offer new insights into the distinct physics of the IR and KR.

总结:<br />本研究利用帕克太阳探测器(FIELDS)仪器持续采集的谱数据，确定了威斯勒波的传播方向，并验证了技术的准确性。研究发现在25到35太阳半径范围内增强的威斯勒波主要是由于朝向太阳传播的波与磁场波动相关的磁场减小有关。在30到40太阳半径之间观察到逆向传播的情况，而在40到50太阳半径之间，朝向太阳和逆向传播的威斯勒波出现率相当。50太阳半径以上几乎没有观察到向太阳或逆向传播的威斯勒波。这些发现有助于更好地了解太阳风等离子体中威斯勒波的性质和行为。 <div>
In the interplanetary space solar wind plasma, whistler waves are observed in a wide range of heliocentric distances (from ∼20 solar radii (RS) to Jupiter’s orbit). They are known to interact with solar wind suprathermal electrons (strahl and halo) and to regulate the solar wind heat flux through scattering the strahl electrons. We present the results of applying the technique to determine the whistler wave propagation directions to the spectral data continuously collected by the FIELDS instruments on board Parker Solar Probe (PSP). The technique was validated based on the results obtained from burst mode magnetic and electric field waveform data collected during Encounter 1. We estimated the effective length of the PSP electric field antennas for a variety of solar wind conditions in the whistler wave frequency range and utilized these estimates for determining the whistler wave properties during PSP Encounters 1–11. Our findings show that (1) the enhancement of the whistler wave occurrence rate and wave amplitudes observed between 25 and 35 RS is predominantly due to the sunward-propagating whistler wave population associated with the switchback-related magnetic dips; (2) the antisunward or counterpropagating cases are observed at 30–40 RS; (3) between 40 and 50 RS, sunward and antisunward whistlers are observed with comparable occurrence rates; and (4) almost no sunward or counterpropagating whistlers were observed at heliocentric distances above 50 RS.

总结: CO排放已被广泛用作分子气体质量的示踪剂。文章通过Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array的观测数据，首次展示了对星暴星系中αCO建模结果的研究。研究发现，在Antennae星暴星系中，GMCs的αCO值约为普遍采用的银河系值的四分之一。此外，13CO/CO线比和GMC速度离散度可以用来推断星暴区域的αCO。研究还表明，Antennae星暴星系中的GMCs比普通螺旋星系中的GMCs更少地受到引力束缚。在千秒差距尺度上，建模出的αCO值比GMC尺度上的值小40％，这可能是由于包含了具有较低αCO值的弥散气体组分。对于千秒差距尺度上的αCO和CO强度之间存在着类似的相关性。<br /><br /> <div>
CO emission has been widely used as a tracer of molecular gas mass. However, it is a long-standing issue to accurately constrain the CO-to-H2 conversion factor (αCO) that converts CO luminosity to molecular gas mass, especially in starburst galaxies. We present the first resolved αCO modeling results with multiple Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array CO and 13CO transition observations at both giant molecular cloud (GMC) scale at 150 pc and kiloparsec scale for one of the closest starburst mergers, the Antennae. By combining our CO modeling results and measurements of 350 GHz dust continuum, we find that most GMCs in the Antennae have αCO values approximately four times smaller than the commonly adopted Milky Way value (4.3). We find that αCO at GMC scales shows a strong dependence on CO intensity, 13CO/CO ratio, and GMC velocity dispersion, which is consistent with various theoretical and simulation predictions. Specifically, we suggest that the 13CO/CO line ratio and the velocity dispersion can be used to infer αCO in starburst regions. By applying our modeled αCO in GMC analyses, we find that GMCs in the Antennae are less gravitationally bound than in normal spiral galaxies, which is more consistent with what is predicted by merger simulations. At kiloparsec scale, we find that our modeled αCO values are smaller than the modeled αCO at GMC scale by 40%, which can be due to inclusion of a diffuse gas component with lower αCO values. We find a similar correlation of αCO and CO intensity at kiloparsec scales to that at GMC scales.

The Rockets for Extended-source X-ray Spectroscopy (tREXS) are a series of suborbital rocket payloads designed to collect spectral emission from extended astronomical sources of soft X-rays. The tREXS spectrograph uses mechanical beam-shaping modules and reflection gratings to passively focus and then disperse incident X-rays to an array of Teledyne/e2v CIS 113 CMOS X-ray sensors. Designed to achieve a moderate spectral resolution, R ⪆ 50, from ≈15 to 40 Å over a large field of view (>10 deg2), the tREXS instrument is sensitive to line emission from key ion species over the soft-X-ray band. Here we present the complete end-to-end design of the tREXS spectrograph and discuss its significance and expected performance, using simulated observations of the Cygnus Loop supernova remnant and an enhanced region in the soft X-ray background.

<div> 关键词: 银河系, 恒星年龄, 星周围, 化学元素, 运动轨道
总结: 
本文报告了对120颗高径向轨道的亚巨星星周围恒星的发表年龄，这些星星可能属于盖亚-恒河/香肠(GES)星系的残骸。这些星系中大部分恒星年龄较老，中位数为11.6亿年，16分位数为10.5亿年和84分位数为12.7亿年。然而，分布呈偏态，存在一些年龄较轻的星星，它们的年龄范围在6-9亿年左右。所有高径向轨道的星周围恒星具有与GES残骸相关的化学和运动/轨道特性。初步结果表明，这些中间年龄的星星并非来自质量转移和/或恒星并合，这可能会降低它们的年龄确定。如果未来的光谱光度学研究证实了这一结论，那么这些星星的存在将对限制GES并购的性质和银河系的吸积历史构成重要挑战。 <br /><br /> <div>
Reconstructing the mass assembly history of the Milky Way relies on obtaining detailed measurements of the properties of many stars in the galaxy, especially in the stellar halo. One of the most constraining quantities is stellar age, as it can shed light on the accretion time and quenching of star formation in merging satellites. However, obtaining reliable age estimates for large samples of halo stars is difficult. We report published ages of 120 subgiant halo stars with highly radial orbits that likely belong to the debris of the Gaia-Enceladus/Sausage (GES) galaxy. The majority of these halo stars are old, with an age distribution characterized by a median of 11.6 Gyr and a 16th (84th) percentile of 10.5 (12.7) Gyr. However, the distribution is skewed, with a tail of younger stars that span ages down to ∼6–9 Gyr. All highly radial halo stars have chemical and kinematic/orbital quantities that associate them with the GES debris. Initial results suggest that these intermediate-age stars are not a product of mass transfer and/or stellar mergers, which can bias their age determination low. If this conclusion is upheld by upcoming spectrophotometric studies, then the presence of these stars will pose an important challenge for constraining the properties of the GES merger and the accretion history of the galaxy.

<div> 星系密度；恒星质量函数；过密环境；Elentári proto-supercluster；融合率

总结：<br /><br />本研究分析了在COSMOS领域中，恒星质量函数（SMF）随恒星质量的数量密度变化，比较了过密环境和同期场域中的SMF。研究区域包括Elentári proto-supercluster，其中包含六个延伸的过密区域，每边约70 cMpc。研究发现，过密区域的高质量星系相对于低质量星系的比例增加，表明在过密环境中恒星质量的积累速度较快。尽管过密区域和场域在z∼3.3时的SMF存在差异，但这一结果与对z∼1时的星系团的分析是一致的，表明过密环境可能通过增加融合率来促进成员星系的演化。然而，是否这种增进是在原生星系团环境中开始，甚至更早的群环境中开始，仍不清楚。研究发现，过密环境与场域之间测得的静止星系比例差异不大，暗示这种恒星质量的增进是持续进行的，并且由融合活动引发的星暴尚未熄灭。需要更多良好表征的过密区域样本才能得出更广泛的结论。 <div>
We present an analysis of the number density of galaxies as a function of stellar mass (i.e., the stellar mass function (SMF)) in the COSMOS field at z ∼ 3.3, making a comparison between the SMF in overdense environments and the SMF in the coeval field. In particular, this region contains the Elentári proto-supercluster, a system of six extended overdensities spanning ∼70 cMpc on a side. A clear difference is seen in the high-mass slope of these SMFs, with overdense regions showing an increase in the ratio of high-mass galaxies to low-mass galaxies relative to the field, indicating a more rapid buildup of stellar mass in overdense environments. This result qualitatively agrees with analyses of clusters at z ∼ 1, though the differences between protocluster and field SMFs at z ∼ 3.3 are smaller. While this is consistent with overdensities enhancing the evolution of their member galaxies, potentially through increased merger rates, whether this enhancement begins in protocluster environments or even earlier in group environments is still unclear. Though the measured fractions of quiescent galaxies between the field and overdense environments do not vary significantly, implying that this stellar mass enhancement is ongoing and any starbursts triggered by merger activity have not yet quenched, we note that spectroscopic observations are biased toward star-forming populations, particularly for low-mass galaxies. If mergers are indeed responsible, high-resolution imaging of Elentári and similar structures at these early epochs should then reveal increased merger rates relative to the field. Larger samples of well-characterized overdensities are necessary to draw broader conclusions in these areas.

We report experimental values for the CH stretch frequencies of the protonated fullerenes C60H+ and C70H+. Anharmonic frequency calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G level of theory, which are independent of empirical scaling factors, reproduce the experimental values to within approximately 5 cm−1. Scaling theoretical harmonic frequencies by applying factors derived for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons deviate significantly from the experimentally measured frequency. We attribute this deviation to the unusual hydrocarbon structure that affects the degree of anharmonicity of the CH stretch. This result allows us to propose an original, specific scaling factor of 0.9524 to correct harmonic frequencies of CH stretches of protonated fullerenes calculated at the B3LYP/6-311 + G(d,p) level of theory. The special spectral position of the protonated fullerene CH stretch bands makes it a diagnostic marker that may aid in their detection in the interstellar medium.

总结:
Radcliffe wave (RW)的运动信息对于确定其存在以及获取关于其起源和演化的洞察是至关重要的。本文利用径向速度（RV）测量，通过两种方法准确测量了RW的垂直速度（VZ），这是先前被忽略的关键信息。首先，利用年轻恒星的RV测量和Gaia DR3的天体运动测量，测量了朝向年轻恒星的速度。其次，将云的RV测量与关联年轻恒星物体的天体运动测量相结合，确定了云的垂直速度。结果显示，VZ的振荡与垂直坐标Z不同步，与先前研究的结论不同。相反，我们发现VZ沿着RW呈现出每千秒5公里的梯度，呈现出一个偶极子的模式。因此，这种运动的排列与空间排列不相一致，这对RW模型提出了质疑。 <div>
The kinematic information of the Radcliffe wave (RW) is essential for determining its existence and gaining insights into its origin and evolution. In this work, we present an accurate measurement of the vertical velocity (VZ) of the RW by incorporating the radial velocity (RV) measures through two methods, which is crucial but was neglected previously. First, the velocities are measured toward young stars, using their RV measurements from APOGEE-2 and proper motion measurements from Gaia DR3. Second, we combine RV measurements toward clouds with proper motion measurements of associated young stellar objects to determine the vertical velocities of the clouds. The results reveal that the oscillations in VZ are not synchronous with the vertical coordinate Z, which differs from the conclusions of previous studies. Instead, we find a 5 km s−1 kpc−1 gradient in VZ along the RW, exhibiting a dipole-like pattern. Consequently, the kinematic arrangement does not show a corresponding coherence with the spatial arrangement, bringing the RW model into question.

<div> CNN, large-scale structure, machine learning, cosmological parameter inference, N-point correlation functions

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章介绍了一个新的机器学习应用——宇宙学相关卷积神经网络（C3NN），它结合了CNN架构和宇宙学N点相关函数（NPCFs）。作者指出很多基于CNN的模型被批评为“黑匣子”，因为很难直观和定量地将它们的输出与研究中的宇宙学领域联系起来。他们展示了C3NN的输出可以明确地用可分析的NPCFs表示。此外，他们还表明了C3NN在分类任务中能够定量地对不同阶的可解释输出进行排名。通过应用到高斯和对数正态随机场的二元分类任务以及利用N体模拟的弱引力透镜收敛图来区分不同的暗能量场景，作者展示了C3NN将机器学习架构的先进方面与宇宙学NPCFs的框架结合在一起，从而成为从观测数据中提取稳健和可解释的物理洞见的激动人心的工具。 <div>
Modern cosmological research in large-scale structure has witnessed an increasing number of machine-learning applications. Among them, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have received substantial attention due to their outstanding performance in image classification, cosmological parameter inference, and various other tasks. However, many models based on CNNs are criticized as "black boxes" due to the difficulties in relating their outputs intuitively and quantitatively to the cosmological fields under investigation. To overcome this challenge, we present the Cosmological Correlator Convolutional Neural Network (C3NN)—a fusion of CNN architecture and cosmological N-point correlation functions (NPCFs). We demonstrate that its output can be expressed explicitly in terms of the analytically tractable NPCFs. Together with other auxiliary algorithms, we can open the "black box" by quantitatively ranking different orders of the interpretable outputs based on their contribution to classification tasks. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate this by applying our framework to a series of binary classification tasks using Gaussian and log-normal random fields and relating its outputs to the NPCFs describing the two fields. Furthermore, we exhibit the model's ability to distinguish different dark energy scenarios (w0 = −0.95 and −1.05) using N-body simulated weak-lensing convergence maps and discuss the physical implications coming from their interpretability. With these tests, we show that C3NN combines advanced aspects of machine learning architectures with the framework of cosmological NPCFs, thereby making it an exciting tool to extract physical insights in a robust and explainable way from observational data.

这项研究使用国际紫外线探测器的档案，对非异常OB型恒星进行观测，发现它们的UV风迹线变化普遍存在。研究采用简单模型将观测到的谱线变化转化为光学厚度的变化，从而推导出质量损失率的变化。结果表明，由单次观测得出的质量损失率整体上有大约22%的1σ变化，这种变化似乎与恒星表面温度有关，对于最热的恒星可能只有8%，而对于较冷的恒星可能高达45%。此外，研究还指出，从非同时进行的观测中得出的质量损失率不一定一致。观测还揭示了造成这种变化的结构的性质，结果表明光学厚度的变化是由于遮挡了更多或更少观测到的天体表面。最后，档案中的观测结果还表明，在更强大的恒星风中负责观测变化的结构会被破坏，从而导致光学厚度的变化较小。 <br /><br />总结: 恒星的UV风迹线变化普遍存在，并且质量损失率变化的1σ变化约为22%，受恒星表面温度影响，最热的恒星可能为8%，而较冷的可能高达45%。非同时进行的观测得出的质量损失率不一定一致。观测结果推断造成变化的结构会随着恒星风的强度而被破坏，导致光学厚度的变化较小。 <div>
UV wind-line variability in OB stars appears to be universal. In order to quantify this variation and to estimate its effect on a mass-loss rate determined from a single observation, we use the International Ultraviolet Explorer archive to identify nonpeculiar OB stars with well-developed but unsaturated Si ivλ1400 doublets and at least 10 independent observations. This resulted in 1699 spectra of 25 stars. A simple model was used to translate the observed profile variations into optical depth variations and, hence, variations in measured mass-loss rates. These variations quantify the intrinsic error inherent in any single mass-loss rate derived from a single observation. The derived rates have an overall 1σ variation of about 22%, but this appears to differ with Teff, being as small at 8% for the hottest stars and up to 45% for the cooler ones. Furthermore, any single determination can differ from the mean by a factor of 2 or more. Our results also imply that mass-loss rates determined from nonsimultaneous observations (such as UV and ground-based data) need not agree. In addition, we use our results to examine the nature of the structures responsible for the variability. Our findings suggest that the optical depth variations result from optically very thick structures occulting more or less of the line of sight to the stellar disk. Further, the smaller optical depth variations in the hottest stars suggest that the structures responsible for the variations are disrupted in their more powerful winds.

<title>Interstellar Nitrogen Isotope Ratios: Measurements on Tracers of C14N and C15N</title>

<div> 关键词: 氮同位素比率, 银河化学演化, 恒星核合成, 星际物质, 分子云
总结:<br />
本研究利用氮同位素比率对银河系内恒星核合成进行了追踪，并约束了银河化学演化的过程。观测结果显示，银河中心地区的14N/15N比率较低，而银河盘中区域的比率较高，符合银河内部向外形成的情况。研究中采用了C14N和C15N分子的观测数据，确定了物理参数，并利用CN和C15N的超精细成分得到了可靠的14N/15N数值。研究表明14N/15N同位素比率随着银心距的增加而升高，但在向外银河区域则趋于下降，与之前H13CN/HC15N的发现一致。银河化学演化模型也与观测结果相一致，支持了14N/15N比率在银心区域到大约9千秒差距处升高，随着银心距的增加而下降的趋势。 <div>
The nitrogen isotope ratio 14N/15N is a powerful tool to trace Galactic stellar nucleosynthesis and constrain Galactic chemical evolution. Previous observations have found lower 14N/15N ratios in the Galactic center and higher values in the Galactic disk. This is consistent with the inside-out formation scenario of our Milky Way. However, previous studies mostly utilized double isotope ratios also including 12C/13C, which introduces additional uncertainties. Here we present observations of C14N and its rare isotopologue, C15N, toward a sample of star-forming regions measured by the IRAM 30 m and/or the ARO 12 m telescope at λ ∼ 3 mm wavelength. For those 35 sources detected in both isotopologues, physical parameters are determined. Furthermore, we have obtained nitrogen isotope ratios using the strongest hyperfine components of CN and C15N. For those sources showing small deviations from local thermodynamical equilibrium and/or self-absorption, the weakest hyperfine component, likely free of the latter effect, was used to obtain reliable 14N/15N values. Our measured 14N/15N isotope ratios from C14N and C15N measurements are compatible with those from our earlier measurements of NH3 and 15NH3 (Paper I), i.e., increasing ratios to a Galactocentric distance of ∼9 kpc. The unweighted second-order polynomial fit yields . Toward the outer galaxy, the isotope ratio tends to decrease, supporting an earlier finding by H13CN/HC15N. Galactic chemical evolution models are consistent with our measurements of the 14N/15N isotope ratio, i.e., a rising trend from the Galactic center region to approximately 9 kpc, followed by a decreasing trend with increasing RGC toward the outer Galaxy.

<title>Exploring the Origin of Ultralong Gamma-Ray Bursts: Lessons from GRB 221009A</title>

The brightest gamma-ray burst (GRB) ever, GRB 221009A, displays ultralong GRB (ULGRB) characteristics, with a prompt emission duration exceeding 1000 s. To constrain the origin and central engine of this unique burst, we analyze its prompt and afterglow characteristics and compare them to the established set of similar GRBs. To achieve this, we statistically examine a nearly complete sample of Swift-detected GRBs with measured redshifts. We categorize the sample to bronze, silver, and gold by fitting a Gaussian function to the log-normal of T90 duration distribution and considering three subsamples respectively to 1, 2, and 3 times of the standard deviation to the mean value. GRB 221009A falls into the gold subsample. Our analysis of prompt emission and afterglow characteristics aims to identify trends between the three burst groups. Notably, the gold subsample (a higher likelihood of being ULGRB candidates) suggests a collapsar scenario with a hyperaccreting black hole as a potential central engine, while a few GRBs (GRB 060218, GRB 091024A, and GRB 100316D) in our gold subsample favor a magnetar. Late-time near-IR observations from 3.6 m Devasthal Optical Telescope rule out the presence of any bright supernova associated with GRB 221009A in the gold subsample. To further constrain the physical properties of ULGRB progenitors, we employ the tool MESA to simulate the evolution of low-metallicity massive stars with different initial rotations. The outcomes suggest that rotating (Ω ≥ 0.2 Ωc) massive stars could potentially be the progenitors of ULGRBs within the considered parameters and initial inputs to MESA.

We report our search for infrared excesses in the Spitzer/Infrared Array Camera survey of the Kepler field at 3.6 and 4.5 μm. The Spitzer Kepler Survey contains ∼190,000 targets, which we reduce to ∼117,000 targets after applying multiple filters to arrive at a high-quality sample for spectral energy distribution fitting. Of the ∼117,000, we find 11 Sun-like stars (Teff ∼ 6000 K) with infrared excesses of high significance (>4σ) ranging from 10% to 40% above the photosphere at 4.5 μm, which is characteristic of debris disk systems. Blackbody fits of the infrared excesses for the 11 debris disk candidates suggest dust temperatures of 400–1400 K. None of the candidates have reported exoplanet detections. High-quality 1–5 μm or longer spectra or photometry would be necessary to confirm the candidates as debris disk systems.

<br />总结:
该研究利用ALMA多频尘埃连续观测数据对5 < z < 8的28个光谱确认的Lyman break星系进行了分析。研究发现，在z ∼ 6的星系中，红外过量与紫外斜率之间的关系较之前的z ∼ 2-4的结果更为浅。另外，对于z ∼ 6-7的星系，观测到的尘埃温度平均值支持从z = 0到z ∼ 6-7的温度缓慢增加。研究还讨论了尘埃温度的红移演化可以通过气体耗尽时间尺度和金属丰度的降低来解释。此外，高红移星系中观测到的尘埃温度的多样性也可以通过星系主序的离散和平均质量-金属丰度关系的变化来自然解释，包括在z = 8.3的一个星系中观测到的极高尘埃温度(Tdust > 80 K)。 <div>
We present an analysis of the Atacama Large Millimeter-submillimeter Array (ALMA) multiband dust continuum observations for 28 spectroscopically confirmed bright Lyman break galaxies at 5 < z < 8. Our sample consists of 11 galaxies at z ∼ 6 newly observed in our ALMA program, which substantially increases the number of 5 < z < 8 galaxies with both rest-frame 88 and 158 μm continuum observations, allowing us to simultaneously measure the IR luminosity and dust temperature for a statistical sample of z ≳ 5 galaxies for the first time. We derive the relationship between the ultraviolet (UV) slope (βUV) and infrared excess (IRX) for the z ∼ 6 galaxies, and find a shallower IRX–βUV relation compared to the previous results at z ∼ 2–4. Based on the IRX–βUV relation consistent with our results and the βUV–MUV relation including fainter galaxies in the literature, we find a limited contribution of the dust-obscured star formation to the total star formation rate density, ∼30% at z ∼ 6. Our measurements of the dust temperature at z ∼ 6–7, on average, support a gentle increase of Tdust from z = 0 to z ∼ 6–7. Using an analytic model with parameters consistent with recent James Webb Space Telescope results, we discuss that the observed redshift evolution of the dust temperature can be reproduced by an ∼0.6 dex decrease in the gas depletion timescale and ∼0.4 dex decrease in the metallicity. The variety of Tdust observed at high redshifts can also be naturally explained by scatters around the star formation main sequence and average mass–metallicity relation including an extremely high dust temperature of Tdust > 80 K observed in a galaxy at z = 8.3.

Panspermia is the hypothesis that life originated on Earth from the bombardment of foreign interstellar ejecta harboring polyextremophile microorganisms. Since the 2017 discovery of the interstellar body ‘Oumuamua (1I/2017 U1) by the Pan-STARRS telescope, various studies have reexamined panspermia based on updated number density models that accommodate for ‘Oumuamua’s properties. By utilizing ‘Oumuamua’s properties as an anchor, we estimate the mass and number density of ejecta in the interstellar medium (ρm [units of kg au−3] and ρn [units of au−3]). We build upon prior work by first accounting for the minimum ejecta size to shield microbes from supernova radiation. Second, we estimate the total number of impact events Cn on Earth after its formation and prior to the emergence of life (≈0.8 Gyr). We derive a conditional probability relation for the likelihood of panspermia for Earth specifically of <10−5, given a number of factors including fB, the fraction of ejecta harboring extremophiles and other factors that are poorly constrained. However, we find that panspermia is a plausible potential life-seeding mechanism for (optimistically) potentially up to ∼105 of the ∼109 Earth-sized habitable zone worlds in our Galaxy.

Line intensity mapping (LIM) has emerged as a promising tool for probing the 3D large-scale structure through the aggregate emission of spectral lines. The presence of interloper lines poses a crucial challenge in extracting the signal from the target line in LIM. In this work, we introduce a novel method for LIM analysis that simultaneously extracts line signals from multiple spectral lines, utilizing the covariance of native LIM data elements defined in the spectral–angular space. We leverage correlated information from different lines to perform joint inference on all lines simultaneously, employing a Bayesian analysis framework. We present the formalism, demonstrate our technique with a mock survey setup resembling the SPHEREx deep-field observation, and consider four spectral lines within the SPHEREx spectral coverage in the near-infrared: Hα, [O iii], Hβ, and [O ii]. We demonstrate that our method can extract the power spectrum of all four lines at the ≳10σ level at z < 2. For the brightest line, Hα, the 10σ sensitivity can be achieved out to z ∼ 3. Our technique offers a flexible framework for LIM analysis, enabling simultaneous inference of signals from multiple line emissions while accommodating diverse modeling constraints and parameterizations.

总结:<br />
这篇文章报告了2MASS J22132050−5137385这颗非常金属贫的星的恒星参数和化学丰度。这颗星的光谱呈现出异常强烈的铁组元素以外的元素线，分析揭示这些元素产生于快速中子俘获（r-过程）核合成。星中铪和铀的检测使得计算出了r-过程物质的年龄为13.6 ± 2.6 Gyr。此外，该星含有相对较大的元素增益，可能是由于超铀裂变碎片的产生。该文提出了一种新方法来评估r-过程增强星样本中的r-过程产物产量和气体稀释。根据假设的普通重子迷你暗物质晕的质量和金属保留率，得出该星形成于一个质量约为600 M⊙的云团。因此，文章得出结论，2MASS J22132050−5137385具有高水平的r-过程增强，因为它形成于r-过程物质稀释程度低于平均水平的环境中。 <div>
We present stellar parameters and chemical abundances of 47 elements detected in the bright (V = 11.63) very metal-poor ([Fe/H] = −2.20 ± 0.12) star 2MASS J22132050−5137385. We observed this star using the Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle spectrograph as part of ongoing work by the R-Process Alliance. The spectrum of 2MASS J22132050−5137385 exhibits unusually strong lines of elements heavier than the iron group, and our analysis reveals that these elements were produced by rapid neutron-capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis. We derive a europium enhancement, [Eu/Fe] = +2.45 ± 0.08, that is higher than any other r-process-enhanced star known at present. This star is only the eighth r-process-enhanced star where both thorium and uranium are detected, and we calculate the age of the r-process material, 13.6 ± 2.6 Gyr, from the radioactive decay of these isotopes. This star contains relatively large enhancements of elements that may be produced as transuranic fission fragments, and we propose a new method using this characteristic to assess the r-process yields and gas dilution in samples of r-process-enhanced stars. Assuming a canonical baryonic minihalo mass of 106M⊙ and a 1% metal retention rate, this star formed in a cloud of only ∼600 M⊙. We conclude that 2MASS J22132050−5137385 exhibits a high level of r-process enhancement because it formed in an environment where the r-process material was less diluted than average.

In the hierarchical evolution framework of cosmology, larger halos grow through matter accretion and halo mergers. To clarify halo evolution, we need to define the halo mass and radius physically. However, the pseudoevolution problem makes the process difficult. Thus, we aim to measure the splash-back radius (Rsp), a physically defined halo radius for a large number of halos with various mass and redshift, and to determine the most important parameters that affect it. We use the typical definition of splash-back radius as the radius with the steepest radial density profile. In this work, we measure the splash-back radius of dark matter halos within the mass of 1013M⊙ to 3 × 1015M⊙ and redshifts spanning 0.08–0.65. This is the measurement of the Rsp in the largest range of halo mass and redshift. Using the shear catalog of the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey Data Release 8, we investigate the splash-back radius of halos associated with galaxies and galaxy clusters identified in the various catalogs. Our finding reveals a trend wherein massive halos demonstrate a larger splash-back radius, and the normalized splash-back radius (Rsp/R200m) shows a U-shaped mass evolution. The upturn in these relations mainly comes from the contribution of massive halos with low redshifts. We further find the splash-back radius increases with the peak height, while the normalized splash-back radius has a negative relation with the peak height. We also find that Rsp ≳ R200m for most halos, indicating their low accretion rates. Our result is consistent with previous literature across a wide range of mass, redshift, and peak height, as well as the simulation work from More et al.

In NGC 2992, a galaxy-scale ionized gas outflow driven by active galactic nuclei (AGNs) has long been recognized, yet its impact on the host galaxy has remained elusive. In this paper, we utilize data from the archival Very Large Telescope/MUSE to present a spatially resolved analysis of stellar populations in this galaxy. Two different stellar population templates are employed to fit the stellar continuum, allowing us to determine the light-weighted stellar age, metallicity, the fraction of the young stellar population (age <100 Myr, PY), and the average age and metallicity of PY. Our results reveal the presence of a very young stellar population (≤40 Myr) within the dust lane and nearly along the galaxy’s major axis. The light-weighted stellar age and the fraction of PY show negative trends along the major and minor axes. The average age and metallicity of PY present positive trends with increasing distance, except along the northern direction of the major axis. Within the circumnuclear region (<1 kpc), the distribution of the young stellar population is spatially anticorrelated with the AGN outflow cone. The highest fraction of PY is observed at the outskirts of the nuclear radio bubble in the northern region near the nucleus. Considering the coupling efficiency and timescales, we propose that the AGN outflow in this galaxy may exert both negative and positive feedback on its host. Additionally, the star formation and the AGN activities could be attributed to the interaction between NGC 2992 and NGC 2993.

<title>JWST Photometry of Globular Clusters in A2744. II. Luminosity and Color Distributions</title>

Deep JWST imaging of the giant galaxy cluster A2744, at redshift z = 0.308, is used to explore the features of its rich population of globular clusters (GCs), building on our initial survey of the system. We use the photometry of more than 10,000 GCs over a 3 mag range to construct the GC luminosity function and color distribution. These results now specifically account for photometric incompleteness as a function of location relative to the five giant galaxies that dominate the gravitational potential of A2744. The total GC population in A2744 is estimated at NGC ≥ 1.1 × 105, consistent with its high total mass. We also directly compare the observed distributions with theoretical predictions for GC populations drawn from the recent EMP-Pathfinder simulations, viewed at the same 3.5 Gyr look-back time as the cluster. The simulations match the observations well, with the only notable disagreement being that the simulations predict larger numbers of GCs at high metallicity formed after z ≃ 2 than are seen in the data.

<title>X-Ray Spectral and Temporal Properties of LMXB 4U 1608-52—Observed with AstroSat and NICER</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report results from a detailed study of the neutron star X-ray binary, 4U 1608-52, using observations with AstroSat (Large Area X-ray Proportional Counter/Soft X-ray Telescope) and the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer during its 2016 and 2020 outbursts. The 0.7–20.0 keV spectra could be well described with the disk blackbody and thermal Comptonization model. The best-fitting inner disk temperature is ∼1 keV and radius ∼ –27.19 km and no significant evolution was observed in the disk radius after performing flux and time-resolved spectroscopy. We used a multi-Lorentzian approach to fit the power density spectra and obtained broadband noise variability. We estimated the energy-dependent fractional rms and time lag of the broadband noise, and these variations are quantitatively modeled as being due to the coherent variation of the disk emission and the coronal heating rate. Thus, the rapid temporal modeling is consistent with the longer-term spectral evolution where the inner disk radius does not vary, and instead, the variations can be attributed to accretion rate variations that change the inner disk temperature and the coronal heating rate.

<title>Simulated Coronal Mass Ejections on a Young Solar-type Star and the Associated Instantaneous Angular Momentum Loss</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) on stars can change the stars’ magnetic field configurations and mass-loss rates during the eruption and propagation and therefore, may affect the stars’ rotation properties on long timescales. The dynamics of stellar CMEs and their influence on the stellar angular momentum loss rate are not yet well understood. In order to start investigating these CME-related aspects on other stars, we conducted a series of magnetohydrodynamic simulations of CMEs on a solar-type star of moderate activity levels. The propagation and evolution of the CMEs were traced in the three-dimensional outputs and the temporal evolution of their dynamic properties (such as masses, velocities, and kinetic energies) were determined. The simulated stellar CMEs are more massive and energetic than their solar analog, which is a result of the stronger magnetic field on the surface of the simulated star than that of the Sun. The simulated CMEs display masses ranging from ∼1016 to ∼1018 g and kinetic energies from ∼1031 to ∼1033 erg. We also investigated the instantaneous influence of the CMEs on the star’s angular momentum loss rate. Our results suggest that angular momentum can either be added to or removed from the star during the evolution of CME events. We found a positive correlation between the amplitude of the angular momentum loss rate variation and the CME’s kinetic energy as well as mass, suggesting that more energetic/massive CMEs have a higher possibility to add angular momentum to the star.

<title>The Chemical Puzzle of Weak G-Band Stars: A Comprehensive Study of HD 54627, HD 105783, HD 198718, and HD 201557</title>

Weak G-band stars (WGBs) are a unique class of objects characterized by weak CH molecular lines in the Fraunhofer G band, indicative of a deficiency in 12C. This peculiar spectral feature is often accompanied by significant enrichments in N and, occasionally, Li and Na abundances. Despite their rarity and recent discoveries of new WGB candidates, the underlying formation mechanism of these stars remains unknown. In this study, we present a comprehensive chemical analysis of four neglected WGBs: HD 54627, HD 105783, HD 198718, and HD 201557. These stars, though identified as WGBs, have been poorly studied to date. Our analysis utilizes high-resolution échelle spectra with a power resolution of R ≈ 48,000, complemented by photometric and astrometric data from the literature. Applying the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) approximation we determine the chemical abundance and then we conduct posterior non-LTE (NLTE) corrections for specific chemical abundances, including Li, O, Na, and Mg. Additionally, we provide details on the projected rotational velocities ( ) and conduct a thorough investigation of the kinematics and orbits of our sample, comparing them with other well-studied WGBs reported in the literature. Our findings indicate that these stars originate from the thin disk, as evidenced by the absence of alpha-element enrichment and kinematics. Notably, half of the WGBs in our sample exhibit Li-rich characteristics, and we identify no rapid rotators ( 8.0 km s−1) or infrared excess among our studied stars.

Combined with data assimilation methods, a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) numerical model is an effective tool to explore the mechanism of space weather. As a driver of space weather, the dynamic development of stream interaction regions (SIRs) near the orbit of Mars is an area of active research. In this study, we use the interplanetary total variation diminishing (TVD) MHD model to simulate solar wind parameters and model SIRs near Mars from 2021 November 15 to 2021 December 31. In this model, the MHD equations are solved by the conservation TVD Lax–Friedrichs scheme in a rotating spherical coordinate system with six component meshes used on the spherical shell. Solar wind velocity, density, temperature, and magnetic field strength are given at the inner boundary due to the characteristic waves propagating outward. We compared modeled results with observations from Mars Atmospheric Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) and Tianwen-1 (China’s first Mars exploration mission). Statistical analysis shows that the simulated results can capture SIRs and are in good agreement with observations; moreover, the assimilated results based on the Kalman filter improve the accuracy of numerical prediction compared with simulated results. This paper is the first attempt to simulate SIR events combined with MAVEN and Tianwen-1 in situ observations. Our work demonstrates that using the MHD model with the Kalman filter to reconstruct solar wind parameters can help us study the characteristics of SIRs near Mars, improve the capabilities of space weather forecasting, and understand the background solar wind environment.

<title>Denser Environments Cultivate Larger Galaxies: A Comprehensive Study beyond the Local Universe with 3 Million Hyper Suprime-Cam Galaxies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The relationship between galaxy size and environment has remained enigmatic, with over a decade of conflicting results. We present one of the first comprehensive studies of the variation of galaxy radius with environment beyond the local Universe and demonstrate that large-scale environmental density is correlated with galaxy radius independent of stellar mass and galaxy morphology. We confirm with >5σ confidence that galaxies in denser environments are up to ∼25% larger than their equally massive counterparts with similar morphology in less dense regions of the Universe. We achieve this result by correlating projected two-dimensional densities over ∼360 deg2 with the structural parameters of ∼3 million Hyper Suprime-Cam galaxies at 0.3 ≤ z < 0.7 with . Compared to most previous studies, this sample is ∼100–10,000 times larger and goes ∼1 dex deeper in mass completeness. We demonstrate that past conflicting results have been driven by small sample sizes and a lack of robust measurement uncertainties. We verify the presence of the above correlation separately for disk-dominated, bulge-dominated, star-forming, and quiescent subpopulations. We find the strength of the correlation to be dependent on redshift, stellar mass, and morphology. The correlation is strongest at lower redshifts and systematically weakens or disappears beyond z ≥ 0.5. At z ≥ 0.5, more massive galaxies still display a statistically significant correlation. Although some existing theoretical frameworks can be selectively invoked to explain some of the observed correlations, our work demonstrates the need for more comprehensive theoretical investigations of the correlation between galaxy size and environment.

PINT is a pure-Python framework for high-precision pulsar timing developed on top of widely used and well-tested Python libraries, supporting both interactive and programmatic data analysis workflows. We present a new frequentist framework within PINT to characterize the single-pulsar noise processes present in pulsar timing data sets. This framework enables parameter estimation for both uncorrelated and correlated noise processes, as well as model comparison between different timing and noise models in a computationally inexpensive way. We demonstrate the efficacy of the new framework by applying it to simulated data sets as well as a real data set of PSR B1855+09. We also describe the new features implemented in PINT since it was first described in the literature.

We conduct a spectral and timing analysis of GX 339−4 and EXO 1846−031 with the aim of studying the evolution of type-C quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) with spectral parameters. The high-cadence data from Insight-HXMT and NICER allow us to track the evolution of QPOs and spectra simultaneously. Type-C QPOs appear at the end of the low–hard state and/or the hard–intermediate state. Our results reveal that the QPO frequency is closely related to the inner disk radius and mass accretion rate in the two sources. This correlation aligns well with the dynamic frequency model of a truncated disk.

Plasmoid instability usually accounts for the onset of fast reconnection events observed in astrophysical plasmas. However, the measured reconnection rate from observations can be one order of magnitude higher than that derived from magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. In this study, we present the results of magnetic reconnection in the partially ionized low solar atmosphere based on 2.5D MHD simulations. The whole reconnection process covers two different fast reconnection phases. In the first phase, the slow Sweet–Parker reconnection transits to the plasmoid-mediated reconnection, and the reconnection rate reaches about 0.02. In the second phase, a faster explosive reconnection appears, with the reconnection rate reaching above 0.06. At the same time, a sharp decrease in plasma temperature and density at the principle X-point is observed, which is associated with the strong radiative cooling, the ejection of hot plasma from the local reconnection region, or the motion of the principle X-point from a hot and dense region to a cool and less dense region along the narrow current sheet. This causes gas pressure depletion and increases magnetic diffusion at the main X-point, resulting in the local Petschek-like reconnection and a violent and rapid increase in the reconnection rate. This study for the first time reveals a common phenomenon where the plasmoid-dominated reconnection transits to an explosive faster reconnection with a rate approaching the order of 0.1 in partially ionized plasma in the MHD scale.

<title>Hadronuclear Interactions in Active Galactic Nuclei Jets as the Origin of the Diffuse High-energy Neutrino Background</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The origin of diffuse high-energy neutrinos from TeV to PeV energies detected by the IceCube Observatory remains a mystery. In our previous work, we have shown that hadronuclear (p − p) interactions in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) jets could be important and generate detectable very-high-energy emissions. Here, we further explore these interactions in the AGN jets based on their luminosity function. The diffuse neutrino flux and corresponding γ-ray flux have been calculated and compared with observational data. In our modeling, two beaming patterns are considered separately. To make sure that the corresponding γ-ray flux does not overshoot the diffuse γ-ray background, we find that if the neutrino production region in a jet is opaque to γ-rays, p − p interactions in AGN jets with a small viewing angle (the blazar case) are able to interpret the PeV neutrino background. Similarly, AGN jets with a large viewing angle (the radio galaxy case) may interpret the TeV neutrino background. While, if the neutrino production region is transparent to γ-rays, only blazars have the potential to interpret the diffuse neutrino background around the PeV band. Some caveats are also discussed.

<title>Testing General Relativity with Juno at Jupiter</title>

The Juno spacecraft has been orbiting Jupiter since 2016 July to deepen our comprehension of the solar system by studying the gas giant. The radio science experiment enables the determination of Jupiter’s gravitational field, thus shedding light on its interior structure. The experiment relies on determining the orbit of the spacecraft during its pericenter passages. Previous gravity data analyses assumed the correctness of the general theory of relativity, which was used for trajectory integration and radio signal propagation modeling. In this work, we aim to test general relativity within the unique context of a spacecraft orbiting Jupiter, by employing the parameterized post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism, an established framework for comparing various gravitational theories. Within this framework, we focus our attention toward the PPN parameters γ and β, which offer insights into the curvature of spacetime and the nonlinearity of gravitational effects, respectively. Additionally, we extend our investigation to the Lense–Thirring effect, which models the dragging of spacetime induced by a rotating mass. By measuring the relativistic frequency shift on Doppler observables caused by Jupiter during Juno’s perijove passes, we estimate γ = 1 + (1.5 ± 4.9) × 10−3, consistent with the general theory of relativity. Our estimated γ is primarily influenced by its effect on light-time computation, with a negligible contribution from spacecraft dynamics. Furthermore, we also present a modest level of accuracy for the β parameter, reflecting the minimal dynamical perturbation on Juno from general relativity. This also applies to the Lense–Thirring effect, whose signal is too small to be confidently resolved.

<title>Scaling of Ion Bulk Heating in Magnetic Reconnection Outflows for the High-Alfvén-speed and Low-β Regime in Earth’s Magnetotail</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We survey 20 reconnection outflow events observed by Magnetospheric MultiScale in the low-β and high-Alfvén-speed regime of the Earth’s magnetotail to investigate the scaling of ion bulk heating produced by reconnection. The range of inflow Alfvén speeds (800–4000 km s−1) and inflow ion β (0.002–1) covered by this study is in a plasma regime that could be applicable to the solar corona and flare environments. We find that the observed ion heating increases with increasing inflow (upstream) Alfvén speed, VA, based on the reconnecting magnetic field and the upstream plasma density. However, ion heating does not increase linearly as a function of available magnetic energy per particle, . Instead, the heating increases progressively less as rises. This is in contrast to a previous study using the same data set, which found that electron heating in this high-Alfvén-speed and low-β regime scales linearly with , with a scaling factor nearly identical to that found for the low-VA and high-β magnetopause. Consequently, the ion-to-electron heating ratio in reconnection exhausts decreases with increasing upstream VA, suggesting that the energy partition between ions and electrons in reconnection exhausts could be a function of the available magnetic energy per particle. Finally, we find that the observed difference in ion and electron heating scaling may be consistent with the predicted effects of a trapping potential in the exhaust, which enhances electron heating, but reduces ion heating.

The observation of a kilonova AT2017gfo associated with the gravitational wave event GW170817 provides the first strong evidence that neutron star mergers are dominant contributors to the production of heavy r-process elements. Radioactive gamma-ray lines emitted from neutron star merger remnants provide a unique probe for investigating the nuclide composition and tracking its evolution. In this work, we studied the gamma-ray line features arising from the radioactive decay of heavy nuclei in the merger remnants based on the r-process nuclear reaction network and the astrophysical inputs derived from numerical relativity simulations. The decay chain of Sn (T1/2 = 230 kyr) → Sb (T1/2 = 12.35 days) → Te (stable) produces several bright gamma-ray lines with energies of 415, 667, and 695 keV, making it the most promising decay chain during the remnant phase. The photon fluxes of these bright gamma-ray lines reach ∼10−5γ cm−2 s−1 for Galactic merger remnants with ages less than 100 kyr, which can be detected by the high energy resolution MeV gamma-ray detectors like the MASS mission.

SN 2021gmj是一颗低亮度的II型超新星，通过扩张光球方法确定了其距离，从尾部光谱曲线推导了放射性镍质量，提出了环绕星际物质的存在，并通过光谱特征和辐射动力学模拟发现了类似的低亮度II型超新星可能存在的高密度物质。总结: 该研究通过观测和模拟分析了低亮度II型超新星SN 2021gmj的光学特性和物理特征，推测了其距离、放射性镍质量和环绕星际物质的存在，为研究相似超新星提供了重要信息和参考。 <div>
We present comprehensive optical observations of SN 2021gmj, a Type II supernova (SN II) discovered within a day of explosion by the Distance Less Than 40 Mpc survey. Follow-up observations show that SN 2021gmj is a low-luminosity SN II (LL SN II), with a peak magnitude MV = −15.45 and an Fe ii velocity of ∼1800 km s−1 at 50 days past explosion. Using the expanding photosphere method, we derive a distance of Mpc. From the tail of the light curve we obtain a radioactive nickel mass of = 0.014 ± 0.001 M⊙. The presence of circumstellar material (CSM) is suggested by the early-time light curve, early spectra, and high-velocity Hα in absorption. Analytical shock-cooling models of the light curve cannot reproduce the fast rise, supporting the idea that the early-time emission is partially powered by the interaction of the SN ejecta and CSM. The inferred low CSM mass of 0.025 M⊙ in our hydrodynamic-modeling light-curve analysis is also consistent with our spectroscopy. We observe a broad feature near 4600 Å, which may be high-ionization lines of C, N, or/and He ii. This feature is reproduced by radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of red supergiants with extended atmospheres. Several LL SNe II show similar spectral features, implying that high-density material around the progenitor may be common among them.

We present a new code for the tracing of magnetic field lines and calculation of related quantities such as the squashing factor in the solar corona. The Universal Fieldline Tracer (UFiT) is an open-source package that can currently take inputs directly from four well-established coronal models, with additional models planned to be made directly accessible in the future. This package contains tools to make use of large-scale three-dimensional field line maps to calculate volumetric quantities, such as the total volume of the open corona, or the fraction that maps to regions on the solar surface within some distance of a coronal hole boundary, which may be relevant to phenomenological models of solar wind speed such as the Wang–Sheeley–Arge model. Synthetic coronagraphs can also be produced rapidly by this package. We have postprocessed long-term magnetofrictional simulations to demonstrate that the separatrix web occupies a larger fraction of the corona during solar maximum than solar minimum.

内容概要：这篇文章讨论了银河系中可能存在的具有非零椭圆度的紧凑天体（COs）产生连续引力波的可能性。作者使用贝叶斯框架对高度变形的银河系eCOs的总数量Ntot进行了限制。他们将约束分为两类：一种是基于CGW频率和椭圆度网格的“不可知”上限，另一种是基于频率分布先验信息的上限。研究发现，椭圆度ϵ≳10−5的COs在90%置信度下的数量上限为，而ϵ≳10−6的COs的数量上限为。此外，作者还根据不同丰度Ntot的空间分布选择，给出了银河系COs的椭度上限。 <br /><br />总结: 本研究讨论了银河系中产生连续引力波的紧凑天体可能性，使用贝叶斯框架对其数量进行了限制。作者发现对于椭圆度大于10^-5的天体的数量限制，以及椭圆度大于10^-6的天体的数量限制，并根据空间分布选择给出了银河系COs的椭度上限。 <div>
Galactic spinning compact objects (COs) with nonzero ellipticity are expected to be sources of continuous gravitational waves (CGWs). Certain classes of hypothetical COs, such as neutron stars with quark cores (hybrid stars) and quark stars, are thought to be capable of sustaining large ellipticities from theoretical considerations. Such exotic COs (eCOs) with large ellipticities and spins should produce CGWs detectable by the current LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA GW detector network. Since no detections for CGWs from searches in LIGO-Virgo data have so far been reported, we place constraints on the abundance of highly elliptical, rapidly spinning eCOs in our Galaxy. We formulate a Bayesian framework to place upper limits on the number count Ntot of highly deformed Galactic eCOs. We divide our constraints into two classes: an “agnostic” set of upper limits on Ntot evaluated on a CGW frequency and ellipticity grid that depend only on the choice of spatial distribution of COs; and a model-dependent set that additionally assumes prior information on the distribution of frequencies. We find that COs with ellipticities ϵ ≳ 10−5 have abundance upper limits at 90% confidence, of , and those with ϵ ≳ 10−6 have . We additionally place upper limits on the ellipticity of Galactic COs informed by our choices of spatial distributions, given different abundances Ntot.

<div> AGNs, black hole mass, host galaxy, variability, scaling relation
<br /><br />总结:
本研究通过对COSMOS区域z < 4的光学变化活动星系核（AGNs）样本进行研究，探讨了黑洞质量-宿主星系恒星质量关系。研究发现，变化搜寻可以识别出低质量星系中的AGNs，但它们的黑洞质量相比于预期的本地活跃星系关系更大。而在z ∼ 0.5–4范围内选择的AGNs则更符合本地非活跃早期星系的MBH–M*关系。这一结果表明了对于类似红移下中等质量黑洞候选者的稳健黑洞和恒星质量估算的需求，以锚定这一比例关系。假设这些结果不反映选择偏差，它们似乎与自调节反馈模型一致，其中中心黑洞和星系中的恒星同步增长。 <div>
We study the black hole mass–host galaxy stellar mass relation, MBH–M*, of a sample of z < 4 optically variable active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the COSMOS field. The parent sample of 491 COSMOS AGNs were identified by optical variability from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) program. Using publicly available catalogs and spectra, we consolidate their spectroscopic redshifts and estimate virial black hole masses using broad-line widths and luminosities. We show that variability searches with deep, high-precision photometry like the HSC-SSP can identity AGNs in low-mass galaxies up to z ∼ 1. However, their black holes are more massive given their host galaxy stellar masses than predicted by the local relation for active galaxies. We report that z ∼ 0.5–4 variability-selected AGNs are meanwhile more consistent with the MBH–M* relation for local inactive early-type galaxies. This result is in agreement with most previous studies of the MBH–M* relation at similar redshifts and indicates that AGNs selected from variability are not intrinsically different from the broad-line Type 1 AGN population at similar luminosities. Our results demonstrate the need for robust black hole and stellar mass estimates for intermediate-mass black hole candidates in low-mass galaxies at similar redshifts to anchor this scaling relation. Assuming that these results do not reflect a selection bias, they appear to be consistent with self-regulated feedback models wherein the central black hole and stars in galaxies grow in tandem.

近期研究发现，Gaia观测到的宽双星的离心率分布倾向于更强烈地支持大离心率，超过了经典热分布。基于这一观察，研究者重新审视三星系统中黑洞双星合并的形成渠道，并研究外部二进制的超热离心率分布对其影响。他们发现，对于满足ain/aout ≳ 0.005的黑洞三星系统，在每个成员都经历了超新星爆炸引起的质量损失后，外部离心率分布可能仍然明显超热，而其他情况下则受质量损失引起的脉冲和动力失稳的影响。然后，他们研究了剩余的黑洞三星系统的不同外部离心率分布对通过第三星诱导渠道产生的合并的影响。有趣的是，他们发现，即使初始恒星轨道接近对齐（不受冯-塞皮尔–利多夫–科赛效应影响），只要系统足够分层，仍然可以产生合并。另一方面，尽管外部二进制更离心时，八级冯-塞皮尔–利多夫–科赛效应的影响更大，但他们发现，由于最大离心率往往导致动力失稳，极端外部离心率分布时合并比例变化不大。 <br /><br />总结: Gaia观察的宽双星的离心率分布超出了经典热分布，黑洞三星系统的外部离心率分布可能保持超热，外部离心率分布对三星系统中合并的影响，系统分层可以产生合并，最大离心率导致动力失稳。 <div>
Recent studies show that the eccentricity distribution of wide binaries (semimajor axis ≳103 au) observed by Gaia tends to favor large eccentricities more strongly than the canonical thermal distribution (P(e) ∝ e)—such distributions are termed “superthermal.” Motivated by this observation, we revisit the formation channel of black hole (BH) binary mergers in triple stellar systems and study the impact of superthermal eccentricity distributions in the outer binaries. We explore the persistence of the highly eccentric outer orbits after each component in a stellar triple has undergone mass loss due to supernova explosions. We find that the outer eccentricity distribution can remain significantly superthermal for modestly hierarchical BH triples satisfying ain/aout ≳ 0.005 (where ain and aout are the semimajor axes of the inner and outer orbits), and are otherwise shaped by mass-loss induced kicks and dynamical instability. We then study the impact of these different outer eccentricity distributions of the remaining BH triples on mergers via the tertiary-induced channel. Of interest, we find that mergers can sometimes be produced even when the initial stellar orbits are near alignment (not subject to the von-Zeipel–Lidov–Kozai effect; ZLK effect) as long as the system is sufficiently hierarchical. On the other hand, although the impact of the octupole-order ZLK effect is much greater when the outer binary is more eccentric, we find that the merger fraction only changes modestly for extreme outer eccentricity distributions because the largest eccentricities tend to lead to dynamical instability.

<div> 强耦合、暖胀、引力理论、潮汐力、观测数据
总结: 
在本研究中，我们研究了暖胀情景下强耦合的线性版本f(Q, T)引力理论，该理论与标量场和辐射场相耦合。我们首先计算了修正的Friedmann方程和修正的慢滚参数。随后，我们应用慢滚近似推导了标量功率谱和张量功率谱。此外，我们为f(Q, T)引力理论与暖胀情景发展了标量和张量扰动的公式。我们进一步研究了两种不同形式的耗散系数，即恒定和与标量场的函数，以确定幂律势情况下的标量谱指数、张量标量比和功率谱的温度。通过对模型的自由参数施加一些约束，我们得到了与Planck 2018数据和Planck、BK15以及宇宙学声学振荡数据联合结果吻合良好的结果，且与Planck 2018数据一致的标量谱指数。此外，获得的结果在观测数据范围内的标量功率谱幅度。因此，我们能够复活先前被观测数据排除的幂律势。此外，对于两种耗散系数，该模型导致的标量谱指数都与威尔金森微波各向异性探测3年数据一致，呈蓝色和红色倾斜。 <div>
We investigate the warm inflationary scenario within the context of the linear version of f(Q, T) gravity, coupled with both the inflaton scalar field and the radiation field, under the conditions of the strong dissipation regime. First, we calculate the modified Friedmann equations and the modified slow-roll parameters. Subsequently, we apply the slow-roll approximations to derive the scalar power spectrum and the tensor power spectrum. Also, we develop formulations of the scalar and tensor perturbations for the f(Q, T) gravity with the warm inflation scenario. Furthermore, we scrutinize two different forms of the dissipation coefficient, a constant and a function of the inflaton field, to determine the scalar spectral index, the tensor-to-scalar ratio, and the temperature for the power-law potential case. By imposing some constraints on the free parameters of the model, we attain results in good agreement with both the Planck 2018 data and the joint Planck, BK15, and baryon acoustic oscillation data for the tensor-to-scalar ratio, and consistent results aligned with the Planck 2018 data for the scalar spectral index. In addition, the obtained results are within the range of observational data for the amplitude of the scalar power spectrum. Consequently, we are able to revive the power-law potential that was previously ruled out by observational data. Moreover, for both dissipation coefficients, the model leads to a scalar spectral index with the blue and red tilts in agreement with the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe 3 yr data.

<div> Lyα emitters, spectroscopic samples, redshift evolution, ionized bubbles, double-peaked profiles

总结:
观测到两个红移 (z = 5.7 和 z = 6.6) 的Lyα发射体 (LAE) 的样本，探讨了这些红移下LAE群体的演化。发现在 z = 6.6 时，高光度的LAE可能自己产生大的电离气泡，或者位于产生这些气泡的过密星系位置。双峰LAE需要蓝光透传，估计了在 z = 6.6 时的电离源周围的近距离半径。由于所需的半径较大，可能需要附近的多个电离源。这些发现对于理解早期星系的形成和演化具有重要意义。 <br /><br /> <div>
We present two uniformly observed spectroscopic samples of Lyα emitters (LAEs; 127 at z = 5.7 and 82 at z = 6.6), which we use to investigate the evolution of the LAE population at these redshifts. The observations cover a large field (44 deg2) in the North Ecliptic Pole, as well as several smaller fields. We have a small number of exotic LAEs in the samples: double-peaked Lyα profiles; very extended red wings; and one impressive lensed LAE cross. We also find three broad-line active galactic nuclei. We compare the Lyα line width measurements at the two redshifts, finding that the lower-luminosity LAEs show a strong evolution of decreasing line width with increasing redshift, while the high-luminosity LAEs do not, with a transition luminosity of log L(Lyα) ≈ 43.25 erg s−1. Thus, at z = 6.6, the high-luminosity LAEs may be producing large ionized bubbles themselves, or they may be residing in overdense galaxy sites that are producing such bubbles. In order to avoid losses in the red wing, the radius of the ionized bubble must be larger than 1 pMpc. The double-peaked LAEs also require transmission on the blue side. For the four at z = 6.6, we use models to estimate the proximity radii, Ra, where the ionizing flux of the galaxy is sufficient to make the surroundings have a low enough neutral fraction to pass the blue light. Since the required Ra are large, multiple ionizing sources in the vicinity may be needed.

3C 275.1 is a blue quasar at z = 0.55522, hosting powerful outflows and residing in a complex environment. We present a serendipitously detected giant nebula surrounding 3C 275.1, which shows morphological features resembling those of objects known as “jellyfish galaxies,” with extremely long tails of ionized gas extending to 170 kpc in projection. We analyze its optical spectra taken by MUSE on the Very Large Telescope. The brighter part of this giant nebula exceeds 100 kpc, and its rotation curve does not flatten out, making it very different from those of normal spiral galaxies. This system shares some characteristics common to those formed via ram pressure stripping (RPS), yet its long narrow tails and higher ionization are unusual compared to known tails in jellyfish galaxies, not fully consistent with a simple RPS scenario. Our photoionization simulation and the inferred short recombination timescale both suggest that, besides the quasar 3C 275.1, an extra source of ionization is necessary to keep the gas ionized at such a distance from the nucleus, which could be related to RPS, tidal interaction, or active galactic nucleus outflow, providing new evidence of active dynamical interaction of a galaxy with the intracluster medium.

<div> 高质量X射线双星；Be-XRBs；POSYDON；双星演化；自旋分布

高质量X射线双星（Be-XRBs）是高质量X射线双星中的一个重要子类，由一个快速旋转的Be星和一个中子星伴星组成，它们在离心轨道上间歇性地从捐赠者周围的排除盘中吸积物质。通过使用最先进的BPS代码POSYDON，我们研究了银河系中的Be-XRB种群。POSYDON在MT阶段自洽地纳入了恒星自旋，使我们能够详细考察多个演化阶段中Be星的自旋分布。我们的模型与银河系中Be-XRB的轨道特性很好地吻合，强调了自转限制的作用。我们的建模揭示了一个快速旋转的种群（ω/ωcrit ≳ 0.3），在中等自转速率处（ω/ωcrit ≃ 0.6）有一个明显的高峰，与观测结果高度一致。所有的Be-XRB在第一个紧凑天体形成之前都经历了一次MT阶段，其中超过一半经历了来自剥夺的氦伴星的第二次MT阶段（Case BB）。通过计算受限于自转的MT效率并将其应用于我们的种群，我们得出了一个物理合理的MT效率分布，发现大多数Be-XRB经历了高度非保守的MT。我们的研究强调了在解释Be-XRB种群时在MT期间进行详细的角动量建模的重要性，并强调了这一种群作为相互作用双星中MT稳定性和效率的关键探针。 <br /><br />总结: 高质量X射线双星（Be-XRBs）由快速旋转的Be星和中子星伴星组成，在银河系中具有明显的自旋分布特点。它们在演化过程中经历了多次质量传递（MT），大多数经历了高度非保守的MT。研究强调了在解释Be-XRB种群时在MT期间进行详细的角动量建模的重要性。 <div>
Be X-ray binaries (Be-XRBs) are one of the largest subclasses of high-mass X-ray binaries, comprised of a rapidly rotating Be star and neutron star companion in an eccentric orbit, intermittently accreting material from a decretion disk around the donor. Originating from binary stellar evolution, Be-XRBs are of significant interest to binary population synthesis (BPS) studies, encapsulating the physics of supernovae, common envelope, and mass transfer (MT). Using the state-of-the-art BPS code, POSYDON, which relies on precomputed grids of detailed binary stellar evolution models, we investigate the Galactic Be-XRB population. POSYDON incorporates stellar rotation self-consistently during MT phases, enabling detailed examination of the rotational distribution of Be stars in multiple phases of evolution. Our fiducial BPS and Be-XRB model aligns well with the orbital properties of Galactic Be-XRBs, emphasizing the role of rotational constraints. Our modeling reveals a rapidly rotating population (ω/ωcrit ≳ 0.3) of Be-XRB-like systems with a strong peak at intermediate rotation rates (ω/ωcrit ≃ 0.6) in close alignment with observations. All Be-XRBs undergo an MT phase before the first compact object forms, with over half experiencing a second MT phase from a stripped helium companion (Case BB). Computing rotationally limited MT efficiencies and applying them to our population, we derive a physically motivated MT efficiency distribution, finding that most Be-XRBs have undergone highly nonconservative MT ( ). Our study underscores the importance of detailed angular momentum modeling during MT in interpreting Be-XRB populations, emphasizing this population as a key probe for the stability and efficiency of MT in interacting binaries.

Thorne–Żytkow objects (TŻOs), hypothetical merger products in which a neutron star is embedded in a stellar core, are traditionally considered steady-state configurations. Their assembly, especially through dynamical channels, is not well understood. The predominant focus in the literature has been on the observational signatures related to the evolution and long-term fate of TŻOs, with their initial formation often treated as a given. However, the foundational calculations supporting the existence of TŻOs assume nonrotating spherically symmetric initial conditions that we find to be inconsistent with a binary merger scenario. In this work, we explore the implications of postmerger dynamics in TŻO formation scenarios with field binary progenitors, specifically the role that angular momentum transport during the common envelope phase plays in constraining the possible merger products, using the tools of stellar evolution and three-dimensional hydrodynamics. We also propose an alternative steady-state outcome for these mergers: the thin-envelope TŻO, an equilibrium solution consisting of a low-mass spherical envelope supported by the accretion disk luminosity of a central stellar-mass black hole. These configurations may be of interest to upcoming time-domain surveys as potential X-ray sources that may be preceded by a series of bright transient events.

FASHI调查通过与IRAS选择的PSCz交叉相关，从FASHI已覆盖的145个PSCz源中获得27个OHMs，检测率为18.6％，包括9个先前已知和18个新发现的OHMs。测量了9个OHMs的1667和1665 MHz线之间的超精细比，平均值为R1667:1665 = 4.74。研究证实OHMs是（超）明亮红外星系（（U）LIRGs）并通过FAST和其19束阵列和超宽带接收机将是未来观察更多OHMs和揭开它们谜团的有力工具。<br /><br /> <div>
The FAST All Sky H i survey (FASHI) is broader in frequency band and sky volume, and deeper in detection sensitivity than the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA survey. To efficiently expand the sample of OH megamasers (OHMs), whose strongest line has a rest frequency of 1667.35903 MHz, we directly matched the IRAS Point Source Catalog Redshift (PSCz) catalog with the corresponding FASHI data cube. From 145 PSCz sources already covered by FASHI, we obtained 27 OHMs with a detection rate of 18.6%, including 9 previously known and 18 new ones, within a redshift range of 0.14314 ≲ zOH ≲ 0.27656. We also measured the hyperfine ratio of nine OHMs between the 1667 and 1665 MHz lines. The ratio ranges from 1.32 to 15.22, with an average of R1667:1665 = 4.74. In a fit to the LOH versus LFIR relation, we have , which is almost the same as derived from previous observations. As expected, since the OHM sample was selected by cross correlation with the IRAS-selected PSCz, our detected OHMs are (ultra)luminous infrared galaxies ((U)LIRGs). However, not all (U)LIRGs have detectable OH emission, suggesting that the OH emission may be triggered within a specific stage of the merger or can only be seen in specific orientations. In general, FAST, with its 19-beam array and Ultra-Wide Bandwidth receiver, will be a powerful tool for observing more OHMs and unraveling their mystery in the future.

总结:
本文通过高分辨率的3D和2D数值流体动力学模拟研究了粘性盘中嵌入天体在盘的粘性时间尺度上的迁移动力学。研究发现，在主要由粘性控制的盘中，吸积行星倾向于向外迁移，与非吸积行星向内轨道衰减形成对比。3D和2D模拟得出了相一致的吸积行星向外迁移的结果。在这种情况下，吸积行星的向外迁移主要是由于从全局盘向希尔半径内输送的不对称螺旋臂。这类似于未饱和的共转扭矩，尽管不平衡是由于在回转时间尺度内的物质吸积而不是扩散到内盘。在粘度较小的盘中，吸积行星在其轨道附近形成深深的间隙。向内迁移的倾向被恢复，尽管速率受到抑制。通过对一系列粘性盘进行参数调查，发现对木星质量的行星而言，从向外迁移到向内迁移的转变发生在有效粘性效率因子α约为0.003时。 <br /><br /> <div>
Migration commonly occurs during the epoch of planet formation. For emerging gas giant planets, it proceeds concurrently with their growth through the accretion of gas from their natal protoplanetary disks. A similar migration process should also be applied to the stellar-mass black holes embedded in active galactic nucleus disks. In this work, we perform high-resolution 3D and 2D numerical hydrodynamical simulations to study the migration dynamics for accreting embedded objects over the disk viscous timescales in a self-consistent manner. We find that an accreting planet embedded in a predominantly viscous disk has a tendency to migrate outward, in contrast to the inward orbital decay of nonaccreting planets. 3D and 2D simulations find the consistent outward migration results for the accreting planets. Under this circumstance, the accreting planet’s outward migration is mainly due to the asymmetric spiral arms feeding from the global disk into the Hill radius. This is analogous to the unsaturated corotation torque although the imbalance is due to material accretion within the libration timescale rather than diffusion onto the inner disk. In a disk with a relatively small viscosity, the accreting planets clear deep gaps near their orbits. The tendency of inward migration is recovered, albeit with suppressed rates. By performing a parameter survey with a range of disks’ viscosity, we find that the transition from outward to inward migration occurs with the effective viscous efficiency factor α ∼ 0.003 for Jupiter-mass planets.

Rings and gaps are among the most widely observed forms of substructure in protoplanetary disks. A gap–ring pair may be formed when a planet carves a gap in the disk, which produces a local pressure maximum following the gap that traps inwardly drifting dust grains and appears as a bright ring owing to the enhanced dust density. A dust-trapping ring would provide a promising environment for solid growth and possibly planetesimal production via the streaming instability. We present evidence of dust trapping in the bright ring of the planet-hosting disk Elias 2-24, from the analysis of 1.3 and 3 mm Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations at high spatial resolution (0.″029, 4.0 au). We leverage the high spatial resolution to demonstrate that larger grains are more efficiently trapped and place constraints on the local turbulence (8 × 10−4 < αturb < 0.03) and the gas-to-dust ratio (Σg/Σd < 30) in the ring. Using a scattering-included marginal probability analysis, we measure a total dust disk mass of . We also show that at the orbital radius of the proposed perturber the gap is cleared of material down to a flux contrast of 10−3 of the peak flux in the disk.

The Earth’s magnetosheath serves as a natural laboratory to study the transition of highly turbulent fluctuations. The fundamental information about plasma turbulences can be examined observationally with the help of electron vorticity measurements. This study presents the first statistics of the electron vorticity field in the magnetosheath by utilizing 4 yr data from NASA’s Magnetospheric Multiscale mission. In this study, the magnetosheath vorticity has a dominant perpendicular anisotropy. The vorticity field in the subsolar region is much stronger than that of magnetosheath flanks. Clear dusk-favored asymmetry for large vorticity is identified in the subsolar region. We examine that the electron flow vorticity in the turbulent magnetosheath is well anticorrelated with the electron density. The vorticity is of great importance in energy dissipation and electron heating in the magnetosheath flanks. This study can improve the current understanding of electron vorticity due to its ubiquitous role in space plasma turbulences.

<title>An Empirical Extinction Curve Revealed by Gaia XP Spectra and LAMOST</title>

We present a direct measurement of extinction curves using corrected Gaia XP spectra of the common sources in Gaia DR3 and LAMOST DR7. Our analysis of approximately 370,000 high-quality samples yielded a high-precision average extinction curve for the Milky Way. After incorporating infrared photometric data from Two Micron All Sky Survey and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, the extinction curve spans wavelengths from 0.336 to 4.6 μm. We determine an average R55 of 2.730 ± 0.007, corresponding to RV = 3.073 ± 0.009, and a near-infrared power-law index α of 1.935 ± 0.037. Our study confirmed some intermediate-scale structures within the optical range. One new feature was identified at 540 nm, and its intensity exhibited a correlation with extinction. This extinction curve can be used to investigate the characteristics of dust and enhance the extinction correction of Milky Way stars. A Python package for this extinction curve is available.

<div> X-ray flux, pulse period, unscented Kalman filter, accretion physics, fluctuation statistics
<br /><br />总结:
本研究通过对小麦哲伦云中24个X射线瞬变体的观测数据进行分析，利用无迹卡尔曼滤波器追踪未经平均的时间序列L(t)和P(t)的波动，唯一地估计出了磁偶极矩μ。此外，还得到了每颗恒星的质量吸积率和磁盘-磁层边界的最大应力的时间演化历史，以及涉及这两个状态变量的自相关和交叉相关。推断的波动统计信息传达了有关磁盘-磁层边界的复杂吸积物理学的重要信息。 <div>
Many accretion-powered pulsars rotate in magnetocentrifugal disequilibrium, spinning up or down secularly over multiyear intervals. The magnetic dipole moment μ of such systems cannot be inferred uniquely from the time-averaged aperiodic X-ray flux 〈L(t)〉 and pulse period 〈P(t)〉, because the radiative efficiency of the accretion is unknown and degenerate with the mass accretion rate. Here, we circumvent the degeneracy by tracking the fluctuations in the unaveraged time series L(t) and P(t) using an unscented Kalman filter, whereupon μ can be estimated uniquely, up to the uncertainties in the mass, radius, and distance of the star. The analysis is performed on Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer observations for 24 X-ray transients in the Small Magellanic Cloud, which have been monitored regularly for ∼16 yr. As well as independent estimates of μ, the analysis yields time-resolved histories of the mass accretion rate and the Maxwell stress at the disk–magnetosphere boundary for each star, and hence auto- and cross-correlations involving the latter two state variables. The inferred fluctuation statistics convey important information about the complex accretion physics at the disk–magnetosphere boundary.

<div> 白矮星，生命迹象，可居住区，大气循环，行星旋转

白矮星周围的可居住区内可能存在可以寻找生命迹象的行星，但这些行星的可居住区尚不完全清楚。研究人员使用全球气候模型ExoCAM来研究白矮星周围的可居住区的内边界。他们的模拟显示，具有超短轨道周期的可居住行星会进入一种名为“蝙蝠旋转”的大气循环状态，这与M型矮星周围的典型大气环流状态不同。蝙蝠旋转会导致行星的赤道区域出现平均次旋转，以及最热区域从赤道向中纬度区域的位移。研究人员指出这一循环变化会增加行星白天的云覆盖，并减少平流层水汽，从而将白矮星的可居住区扩大约50%。未来，詹姆斯·韦伯空间望远镜有望通过行星独特的热相位曲线快速确认白矮星周围的蝙蝠旋转行星。这项研究强调了潮汐锁定行星在超短轨道上可能表现出独特的大气动力学，并指导了未来白矮星系统的可居住性研究。 <br /><br />总结: 白矮星可能有可居住行星，气流循环状态为“蝙蝠旋转”，这增加了可居住区的范围。未来可通过观测热相位曲线确认这种状态。 <div>
White dwarfs offer a unique opportunity to search nearby stellar systems for signs of life, but the habitable zone around these stars is still poorly understood. Since white dwarfs are compact stars with low luminosity, any planets in their habitable zone should be tidally locked, like planets around M dwarfs. Unlike planets around M dwarfs, however, habitable white dwarf planets have to rotate very rapidly, with orbital periods ranging from hours to several days. Here we use the ExoCAM global climate model to investigate the inner edge of the habitable zone around white dwarfs. Our simulations show habitable planets with ultrashort orbital periods (P ≲ 1 day) enter a “bat rotation” regime, which differs from typical atmospheric circulation regimes around M dwarfs. Bat rotators feature mean equatorial subrotation and a displacement of the surface’s hottest regions from the equator toward the midlatitudes. We qualitatively explain the onset of bat rotation using shallow water theory. The resulting circulation shifts increase the dayside cloud cover and decrease the stratospheric water vapor, expanding the white dwarf habitable zone by ∼50% compared to estimates based on 1D models. The James Webb Space Telescope should be able to quickly characterize bat rotators around nearby white dwarfs thanks to their distinct thermal phase curves. Our work underlines that tidally locked planets on ultrashort orbits may exhibit unique atmospheric dynamics, and guides future habitability studies of white dwarf systems.

We present volume-averaged neutral hydrogen fractions xH I and ionized bubble radii Rb measured with Lyα damping wing absorption of galaxies at the epoch of reionization. We combine JWST/NIRSpec spectra taken by the CEERS, GO-1433, DDT-2750, and JADES programs and obtain a sample containing 27 bright UV-continuum (MUV < −18.5 mag) galaxies at 7 < z < 12. We construct four composite spectra binned by redshift and find the clear evolution of the softening break toward high redshift at rest-frame 1216 Å, suggesting an increase of Lyα damping wing absorption. We estimate Lyα damping wing absorption in the galaxy spectra with realistic templates including Lyα emission and circumgalactic medium absorptions. Assuming the standard inside-out reionization picture having an ionized bubble with radius Rb around a galaxy embedded in the intergalactic medium with xH I, we obtain xH I (Rb) values generally increasing (decreasing) from to ( to comoving Mpc) at redshift to . The redshift evolution of xH I indicates a moderately late reionization history consistent with the one previously suggested from the electron scattering of cosmic microwave background and the evolution of UV luminosity function with an escape fraction fesc ∼ 0.2. Our Rb measurements suggest that bubble sizes could be up to a few dex larger than the cosmic average values estimated by analytic calculations for a given xH I, while our Rb measurements are roughly comparable with the values for merged ionized bubbles around bright galaxies predicted by recent numerical simulations.

We analyzed images of every northern hemisphere Sd galaxy listed in the Third Reference Catalogue of Bright Galaxies with a relatively face-on inclination (θ ≤ 30°). Specifically, we measured the spiral arms’ winding angle, ϕ, in 85 galaxies. We applied a novel black hole mass planar scaling relation involving the rotational velocities (from the literature) and pitch angles of each galaxy to predict central black hole masses. This yielded 23 galaxies, each having at least a 50% chance of hosting a central intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH), 102 < M• ≤ 105M☉. These 23 nearby (≲50 Mpc) targets may be suitable for an array of follow-up observations to check for active nuclei. Based on our full sample of 85 Sd galaxies, we estimate that the typical Sd galaxy (which tends to be bulgeless) harbors a black hole with , but with a 27.7% chance of hosting an IMBH, making this morphological type of galaxy fertile ground for hunting elusive IMBHs. Thus, we find that a ∼106M☉ black hole corresponds roughly to the onset of bulge development and serves as a conspicuous waypoint along the galaxy–supermassive black hole coevolution journey. Our survey suggests that >1.22% of bright galaxies (BT ≲ 15.5 mag) in the local Universe host an IMBH (i.e., the “occupation fraction”), which implies a number density >4.96 × 10−6 Mpc−3 for central IMBHs. Finally, we observe that Sd galaxies exhibit an unexpected diversity of properties that resemble the general population of spiral galaxies, albeit with an enhanced signature of the eponymous prototypical traits (i.e., low masses, loosely wound spiral arms, and smaller rotational velocities).

We report for the first time the detection of thermal free–free emission from post-flare loops at 34 GHz in images from the Nobeyama Radioheliograph. We studied eight loops, seven of which were from regions with an extremely strong coronal magnetic field reported by Fedenev et al. Loop emission was observed in a wide range of wavelength bands, up to soft X-rays, confirming their multitemperature structure and was associated with noise storm emission in metric λ. The comparison of the 17 GHz emission with that at 34 GHz, after a calibration correction of the latter, showed that the emission was optically thin at both frequencies. We describe the structure and evolution of the loops and we computed their density, obtaining values for the top of the loops between 1 and 6 × 1010 cm−3, noticeably varying from one loop to another and in the course of the evolution of the same loop system; these values have only a weak dependence on the assumed temperature, 2 × 106 K in our case, as we are in the optically thin regime. Our density values are above those reported from EUV observations, which go up to about 1010 cm−3. This difference could be due to the fact that different emitting regions are sampled in the two domains and/or due to the more accurate diagnostics in the radio range, which do not suffer from inherent uncertainties arising from abundances and non-LTE excitation/ionization equilibria. We also estimated the magnetic field in the loop tops to be in the range of 10–30 G.

We present an atmospheric retrieval analysis of the Y0 brown dwarf WISE J035934.06−540154.6 using the low-resolution 0.96–12 μm James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) spectrum presented in Beiler et al. We obtain volume number mixing ratios of the major gas-phase absorbers (H2O, CH4, CO, CO2, PH3, and H2S) that are three to five times more precise than previous work that used Hubble Space Telescope (HST) spectra. We also find an order-of-magnitude improvement in the precision of the retrieved thermal profile, a direct result of the broad wavelength coverage of the JWST data. We used the retrieved thermal profile and surface gravity to generate a grid of chemical forward models with varying metallicity, (C/O)atm, and strengths of vertical mixing as encapsulated by the eddy diffusion coefficient Kzz. Comparison of the retrieved abundances with this grid of models suggests that the deep atmosphere of WISE 0359−54 shows signs of vigorous vertical mixing with Kzz = 109 [cm2 s−1]. To test the sensitivity of these results to our five-knot spline thermal profile model, we performed a second retrieval using the Madhusudhan & Seager thermal profile model. While the results of the two retrievals generally agree well, we do find differences between the retrieved values of mass and volume number mixing ratio of H2S with fractional differences of the median values of −0.64 and −0.10, respectively. In addition, the five-knot thermal profile is consistently warmer at pressure between 1 and 70 bar. Nevertheless, our results underscore the power that the broad-wavelength infrared spectra obtainable with the JWST have to characterize the atmospheres of cool brown dwarfs.

4U 1538-522 is a persistent high-mass X-ray binary that exhibits secular spin evolution. In 2019, it underwent a torque reversal from spinning up to spinning down. We performed an extensive study using four NuSTAR observations to compare temporal and spectral properties during different states. We observed no abrupt change in luminosity associated with the torque reversal. In addition, the pulse profile, the spectral shape, and the power spectrum remained unchanged before and after the torque reversal. The orbital and superorbital modulation profiles also showed no significant changes. We discuss possible mechanisms for the torque reversal and conclude that it is unlikely to be caused by interactions between the accretion disk and the magnetosphere. Instead, the transition of accretion modes in spherical accretion may be a plausible explanation.

总结:
JWST-FEAST项目利用JWST近红外和中红外成像来校准星系NGC 628的21 μm发射作为星形成率的指标，同时使用Paα (1.8756 μm)氢再组合发射线作为参考星形成率指标。研究发现，21 μm发射与星云线发射密切相关，使用模型分析表明星形成在星系中分布不均匀，使用混合SFR指标需要先了解主导尘埃加热的恒星年龄的平均值，这使得它们的应用变得不确定。与此相反，仅使用L(24)的非线性SFR校准更加稳健，从H ii区到星系的整个L(24)亮度范围内的变化小于2.5倍。<br /><br /> <div>
New JWST near-infrared imaging of the nearby galaxy NGC 628 from the JWST Cycle 1 program Feedback in Emerging extrAgalactic Star clusTers (JWST-FEAST) is combined with archival JWST mid-infrared imaging to calibrate the 21 μm emission as a star formation rate (SFR) indicator at ∼120 pc scales. The Paα (1.8756 μm) hydrogen recombination emission line targeted by FEAST provides a reference SFR indicator that is relatively insensitive to dust attenuation, as demonstrated by combining this tracer with Hubble Space Telescope Hα imaging. Our analysis is restricted to regions that appear compact in nebular line emission and are sufficiently bright to mitigate effects of both age and stochastic sampling of the stellar initial mass function. We find that the 21 μm emission closely correlates with the nebular line emission, with a power law with exponent = 1.07 ± 0.01, in agreement with past results. We calibrate a hybrid SFR indicator using a combination of Hα and 24 μm (extrapolated from 21 μm) tracers and derive the proportionality constant between the two tracers, b = 0.095 ± 0.007, which is ∼3–5 times larger than previous derivations using large regions/entire galaxies. We model these discrepancies as an increasing contribution to the dust heating by progressively older stellar populations for increasing spatial scale, in agreement with earlier findings that star formation is hierarchically distributed in galaxies. Thus, the use of hybrid SFR indicators requires prior knowledge of the mean age of the stellar populations dominating the dust heating, which makes their application uncertain. Conversely, nonlinear calibrations of SFRs from L(24) alone are more robust, with a factor ≲ 2.5 variation across the entire range of L(24) luminosities from H ii regions to galaxies.

We present maps of ionized gas (traced by Paα and Brα) and 3.3 μm polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 628, derived from new JWST/NIRCam data from the Feedback in Emerging extrAgalactic Star clusTers (FEAST) survey. With this data, we investigate and calibrate the relation between 3.3 μm PAH emission and star formation rate (SFR) in and around emerging young star clusters (eYSCs) on a scale of ∼40 pc. We find a tight (correlation coefficient ρ ∼ 0.9) sublinear (power-law exponent α ∼ 0.75) relation between the 3.3 μm PAH luminosity surface density and SFR traced by Brα for compact, cospatial (within 0.″16 or ∼7 pc) peaks in Paα, Brα, and 3.3 μm (eYSC–I). The scatter in the relationship does not correlate well with variations in local interstellar medium metallicity, due to a radial metallicity gradient, but rather is likely due to stochastic sampling of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) and variations in the PAH heating and age of our sources. The deviation from a linear relation may be explained by PAH destruction in more intense ionizing environments, variations in age, and IMF stochasticity at intermediate to low luminosities. We test our results with various continuum subtraction techniques using combinations of NIRCam bands and find that they remain robust with only minor differences in the derived slope and intercept. An unexpected discrepancy is identified between the relations of hydrogen recombination lines (Paα versus Brα; Hα versus Brα).

In this investigation, we leverage the combination of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Legacy Imaging Surveys Data Release 9, Survey Validation 3, and Year 1 data sets to estimate the conditional luminosity functions and conditional stellar mass functions (CLFs and CSMFs) of galaxies across various halo mass bins and redshift ranges. To support our analysis, we utilize a realistic DESI mock galaxy redshift survey (MGRS) generated from a high-resolution Jiutian simulation. An extended halo-based group finder is applied to both MGRS catalogs and DESI observation. By comparing the r- and z-band luminosity functions (LFs) and stellar mass functions (SMFs) derived using both photometric and spectroscopic data, we quantified the impact of photometric redshift (photo-z) errors on the galaxy LFs and SMFs, especially in the low-redshift bin at the low-luminosity/mass end. By conducting prior evaluations of the group finder using MGRS, we successfully obtain a set of CLF and CSMF measurements from observational data. We find that at low redshift, the faint-end slopes of CLFs and CSMFs below ∼109h−2L⊙ (or h−2M⊙) evince a compelling concordance with the subhalo mass functions. After correcting the cosmic variance effect of our local Universe following Chen et al., the faint-end slopes of the LFs/SMFs turn out to also be in good agreement with the slope of the halo mass function.

<div> SCUBA-2, 450 μm observations, COSMOS-CANDELS, instrumental noise levels, confusion noise levels <br />
深空SCUBA-2 450μm观测在COSMOS-CANDELS区域进行。覆盖面积为450平方弧分。实现了仪器噪声水平为σ450 = 0.59 mJy beam−1和σ850 = 0.09 mJy beam−1。深度区域的混淆噪声水平分别为0.65和0.36 mJy beam−1。450μm和850μm阈值以上，分别探测到360和479个源以及237和314个源。得出了450μm最深的空白场数目，且得出了对九平方度的450 μm外星系背景光的贡献为41% ± 4%。这些结果表明，450μm外星系背景光可能被解析至2.1 mJy，而极度深的透镜星团观测和下一代大口径次毫米波仪器可能能够实现此目标。<br /> <br />总结: SCUBA-2观测COSMOS-CANDELS区域，在450和850μm波段探测到大量源，为450μm外星系背景光研究提供了重要数据。对450μm数目进行了深入研究，结果与其他观测和模型相符合，表明450μm外星系背景光可能被完全解析。 <div>
We present confusion-limited SCUBA-2 450 μm observations in the COSMOS-CANDELS region as part of the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope Large Program SCUBA-2 Ultra Deep Imaging EAO Survey. Our maps at 450 and 850 μm cover an area of 450 arcmin2. We achieved instrumental noise levels of σ450 = 0.59 mJy beam−1 and σ850 = 0.09 mJy beam−1 in the deepest area of each map. The corresponding confusion noise levels are estimated to be 0.65 and 0.36 mJy beam−1. Above the 4σ (3.5σ) threshold, we detected 360 (479) sources at 450 μm and 237 (314) sources at 850 μm. We derive the deepest blank-field number counts at 450 μm, covering the flux-density range of 2–43 mJy. These are in agreement with other SCUBA-2 blank-field and lensing-cluster observations but are lower than various model counts. We compare the counts with those in other fields and find that the field-to-field variance observed at 450 μm at the scale is consistent with Poisson noise, so there is no evidence of strong 2D clustering at this scale. Additionally, we derive the integrated surface brightness at 450 μm down to 2.1 mJy to be Jy deg−2, contributing to 41% ± 4% of the 450 μm extragalactic background light (EBL) measured by Cosmic Background Explorer and Planck. Our results suggest that the 450 μm EBL may be fully resolved at mJy, which extremely deep lensing-cluster observations and next-generation submillimeter instruments with large aperture sizes may be able to achieve.

<div> breakBRD galaxies, gas content, H i fractions, quenching, merger activity
总结:
通过深度的Green Bank望远镜21厘米观测数据和光学光谱数据的结合分析，揭示了breakBRD星系的气体含量特征。这些星系的特点是蓝色星形中心和红色熄灭盘，不符合螺旋星系典型的内外逐渐演化规律。研究确认了breakBRD的中性原子氢(H i)气体分数平均低于典型星系，但一般高于绿谷星系，H i消耗时间比典型星系低一个数量级，但远远高于绿谷星系。breakBRD的核气相金属丰度分布宽，倾向于略高于平均值。在质量旋转速度相同时，这些星系偏离了巴里奥-图利-费舍尔关系，H i的不对称性也更高。大部分星系的气体速度场高度扭曲或与恒星盘完全不一致，这些证据支持了一种场景，即breakBRD处于早期熄灭阶段，并且有混合的迹象表明它们的行为与过去的并合活动有关。 <div>
By combining newly obtained deep Green Bank Telescope 21 cm observations with optical spectroscopic data, we present an analysis of the gas content of break bulges in red disks (breakBRD) galaxies, a population denoted by their blue star-forming centers and red quenched disks that do not appear to follow the typical inside-out evolution of spiral galaxies. We confirm previous results that the neutral atomic hydrogen (H i) gas fractions of breakBRDs are, on average, lower than those of typical galaxies on the star-forming sequence (SFS), and find that their H i fractions are generally higher than green valley (GV) galaxies. H i depletion times for breakBRDs are roughly an order of magnitude lower than those of SFS galaxies, in stark contrast with GV galaxies that typically have much longer depletion times than SFS galaxies. The nuclear gas-phase metallicities of breakBRDs have a broader distribution than SFS galaxies and are skewed toward slightly above-average values. BreakBRDs are systematically offset from the baryonic Tully–Fisher relation toward lower baryonic mass at a given rotation velocity. They also have higher typical H i asymmetries than SFS galaxies, and of those galaxies with spatially resolved gas velocity fields from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory survey, two-thirds are either highly distorted or completely misaligned relative to the stellar disk. Evidence supports a scenario where breakBRDs are in an early phase of quenching, and there is mixed evidence that their behavior is related to past merger activity.

<div> M型恒星，耀斑能量，GWAC探测，恒星年龄，等效持续时间
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章讨论了M型恒星的耀斑活动。研究发现，这些恒星的耀斑能量范围很广，且耀斑振幅与恒星表面温度无关。通过对TESS和K2光变曲线、LAMOST、SDSS、2.16米望远镜和Gaia DR3数据的分析，发现这些GWAC耀斑星都很年轻。另外，研究了耀斑能量与恒星半球面积的关系，发现其呈正相关。对M7-L1型恒星来说，在限制其最大耀斑能量的同时，似乎还存在其他因素。 <div>
M-type stars are the ones that flare most frequently, but how big their maximum flare energy can reach is still unknown. We present 163 flares from 162 individual M2 through L1-type stars that triggered the GWAC, with flare energies ranging from 1032.2 to 1036.4 erg. The flare amplitudes range from △G = 0.84 to ∼10 mag. Flare energy increases with stellar surface temperature (Teff) but both △G and equivalent duration seem to be independent of Teff. Combining periods detected from light curves of TESS and K2, spectra from LAMOST, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the 2.16 m telescope, and the Gaia DR3 data, we found that these GWAC flare stars are young. For the stars that have spectra, we found that these stars are in or very near the saturation region, and is lower for M7–L1 stars than for M2–M6 stars. We also studied the relation between GWAC flare bolometric energy Ebol and stellar hemispherical area S, and found that (in erg) increases with increasing S (in square centimeters), and the maximum flare energy . For M7–L1 stars, there seem to be other factors limiting their maximum flare energies in addition to the stellar hemispherical area.

<div> 关键词: TESS, 光度测量, 天体光谱, 二元星, 磁活动<br />
总结: <br />
使用TESS高精度光度测量和大天区多目标光纤分光镜中分辨率的光谱分析了OO Leo，发现它是W型接触双星，具有较低质量比和适度接触程度。发现次星表面有一个逆行冷斑，Hα线的调查证实其具有较高的磁活动。轨道周期研究表明OO Leo正经历着轨道周期的线性减小和周期性变化，可通过无形第三体的光程效应或次星的周期性磁活动解释。这些发现使OO Leo成为研究接触双星差异旋转的绝佳目标。 <div>
With Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) high-precision photometry and Large Sky Area Multi-object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope medium-resolution spectra, we present the first light and radial velocity curve analyses for the eclipsing binary OO Leo. The simultaneous solution suggests that OO Leo is a W-subtype contact binary with a relatively low mass ratio (1/q = 0.173) and a moderate degree of contact (f = 28.1%). The asymmetry and continuous changes observed in the TESS light curve were properly modeled by one retrograde cool spot on its secondary surface. A detailed investigation of the Hα line also confirmed that the secondary star had a high level of magnetic activity. The retrograde longitudinal motion of the spot can be explained by a solar-like differential rotation in the secondary component. The orbital period investigation revealed that OO Leo is undergoing a secular decrease and a cyclic variation in its orbital period. The secular decrease may be mainly caused by mass transfer from the more massive secondary star to the less massive primary star. The cyclic period variation can be explained by the light–time effect of an invisible third body or the cyclic magnetic activity of the secondary star. The long-lived spot migration in the longitudinal direction makes OO Leo an excellent target for investigating the differential rotations of contact binaries.

总结:
这篇文章研究了昴星团中62个M-矮星成员的平均磁场测量值。他们使用马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛方法来对磁填充因子进行建模，并发现磁场强度与恒星自转之间存在正相关关系。他们还发现，平均而言，样本中的星体显示半径膨胀，并且磁场强度和半径膨胀之间存在正相关关系。研究结果还表明，具有更高色球和日冕活动的恒星往往具有更强的磁场。 <div>
Average magnetic field measurements are presented for 62 M-dwarf members of the Pleiades open cluster, derived from Zeeman-enhanced Fe i lines in the H band. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo methodology was employed to model magnetic filling factors using Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) IV APOGEE high-resolution spectra, along with the radiative transfer code Synmast, MARCS stellar atmosphere models, and the APOGEE Data Release 17 spectral line list. There is a positive correlation between mean magnetic fields and stellar rotation, with slow-rotator stars (Rossby number, Ro > 0.13) exhibiting a steeper slope than rapid rotators (Ro < 0.13). However, the latter sample still shows a positive trend between Ro and magnetic fields, which is given by 〈B〉 = 1604 × Ro−0.20. The derived stellar radii when compared with physical isochrones show that, on average, our sample shows radius inflation, with median enhanced radii ranging from +3.0% to +7.0%, depending on the model. There is a positive correlation between magnetic field strength and radius inflation, as well as with stellar spot coverage, correlations which together indicate that stellar spot-filling factors generated by strong magnetic fields might be the mechanism that drives radius inflation in these stars. We also compare our derived magnetic fields with chromospheric emission lines (Hα, Hβ, and Ca ii K), as well as with X-ray and Hα to bolometric luminosity ratios, and find that stars with higher chromospheric and coronal activity tend to be more magnetic.

<div> 星系；形成；抑制；卫星；环境
总结:
本研究使用NewHorizon模拟探讨了两个低质量星系团中M* > 107M⊙卫星星系的星系形成（SF）抑制现象。研究确认了卫星星系（M* ≲ 1010M⊙）比同等质量的场星系更容易被抑制。随着恒星质量增加，这种抑制比例下降，与最近的研究结果一致。与团簇环境的发现相似，我们注意到星系在星系团内的轨道运动与星系形成抑制现象之间存在相关性。具体而言，在星系团中心，星系形成被抑制，对于M* > 109.1M⊙的星系，通常在暂时抑制后会出现明显的“复苏”阶段。星系团中心的星系形成抑制主要受到星系形成效率和可用气体量的影响，这两者均受到星际介质和群星系周围热气体之间的流体动力学相互作用的影响。相反，M* < 108.2M⊙的卫星星系在星系团内经历了显著的气体去除，导致星系形成受到抑制。我们的分析凸显了星系群环境中卫星星系的星系形成抑制的复杂性，涉及星系形成效率（取决于气体的动力学状态）和寒冷致密气体的可用性之间的复杂竞争。这挑战了基于尘埃压力带来的气体剥离的环境效应的典型理解，表明需要对轻微环境效应下的星系演化进行新的描述。 <div>
We study star formation (SF) quenching of satellite galaxies with M* > 107M⊙ within two low-mass groups (Mvir = 1012.9 and 1012.7M⊙) using the NewHorizon simulation. We confirm that satellite galaxies (M* ≲ 1010M⊙) are more prone to quenching than their field counterparts. This quenched fraction decreases with increasing stellar mass, consistent with recent studies. Similar to the findings in cluster environments, we note a correlation between the orbital motions of galaxies within these groups and the phenomenon of SF quenching. Specifically, SF is suppressed at the group center, and for galaxies with M* > 109.1M⊙, there is often a notable rejuvenation phase following a temporary quenching period. The SF quenching at the group center is primarily driven by changes in SF efficiency and the amount of gas available, both of which are influenced by hydrodynamic interactions between the interstellar medium and surrounding hot gas within the group. Conversely, satellite galaxies with M* < 108.2M⊙ experience significant gas removal within the group, leading to SF quenching. Our analysis highlights the complexity of SF quenching in satellite galaxies in group environments, which involves an intricate competition between the efficiency of SF (which depends on the dynamical state of the gas) on the one hand, and the availability of cold dense gas on the other hand. This challenges the typical understanding of environmental effects based on gas stripping through ram pressure, suggesting a need for a new description of galaxy evolution under mild environmental effects.

总结：<br /><br />本文研究了太阳活跃区域（ARs）对太阳极场的贡献以及它们对太阳循环变化的影响。通过提供了1996年以来AR的初始和最终二极磁场的数据库以及其双极磁区（BMR）近似的结果，作者发现了BMR近似对于初始二极磁场的预测较为准确，但对于最终二极磁场存在显著偏差。因此，准确评估AR对极场的贡献需要采用最终二极磁场的真实配置。此外，虽然单个AR的磁通输送可能会增加或减少其二极磁场，但在整个太阳循环中，所有AR的集体影响是减少其总二极磁场。 <div>
Solar active regions (ARs) determine solar polar fields and cause solar cycle variability within the framework of the Babcock–Leighton dynamo. The contribution of an AR to the polar field is measured by its dipole field, which results from flux emergence and subsequent flux transport over the solar surface. The dipole fields contributed by an AR before and after the flux transport are referred to as the initial and final dipole fields, respectively. For a better understanding and prediction of solar cycles, in this paper, we provide a database including AR's initial and final dipole fields and the corresponding results of their bipolar magnetic region (BMR) approximation from 1996 onward. We also identify the repeated ARs and provide the optimized transport parameters. Based on our database, we find that although the commonly used BMR approximation performs well for the initial dipole field, it exhibits a significant deviation for the final dipole field. To accurately assess an AR’s contribution to the polar field, the final dipole field with its real configuration should be applied. Despite the notable contributions of a few rogue ARs, approximately the top 500 ARs ordered by their final dipole fields are necessary to derive the polar field at the cycle minimum. While flux transport may increase or decrease the dipole field for an individual AR, its collective impact over all ARs in a cycle is a reduction in their total dipole field.

Energy dissipation in collisionless plasmas is one of the most outstanding open questions in plasma physics. Magnetic reconnection and turbulence are two phenomena that can produce the conditions for energy dissipation. These two phenomena are closely related to each other in a wide range of plasmas. Turbulent fluctuations can emerge in critical regions of reconnection events, and magnetic reconnection can occur as a product of the turbulent cascade. In this study, we perform 2D particle-in-cell simulations of a reconnecting Harris current sheet in the presence of turbulent fluctuations to explore the effect of turbulence on the reconnection process in collisionless nonrelativistic pair plasmas. We find that the presence of a turbulent field can affect the onset and evolution of magnetic reconnection. Moreover, we observe the existence of a scale-dependent amplitude of magnetic field fluctuations above which these fluctuations are able to disrupt the growing of magnetic islands. These fluctuations provide thermal energy to the particles within the current sheet and preferential perpendicular thermal energy to the background population.

总结:
本研究介绍了一种名为LuNfit的新算法，旨在校正源自望远镜和检测管道的选择偏差，估计脉冲星发射的单脉冲固有光度分布和nulling fraction。LuNfit依赖于贝叶斯嵌套抽样，可以完全探索参数空间。研究还发现，传统方法通过“放大”未检测到的射电暂现现象的部分可能不可靠。最后，讨论了LuNfit目前的实施限制，同时深入探讨了潜在的增强措施，使LuNfit能够应用于具有复杂脉冲形态的源。 <div>
Studying transient phenomena, such as individual pulses from pulsars, has garnered considerable attention in the era of astronomical big data. Of specific interest to this study are rotating radio transients (RRATs), nulling, and intermittent pulsars. This study introduces a new algorithm named LuNfit, tailored to correct the selection biases originating from the telescope and detection pipelines. Ultimately LuNfit estimates the intrinsic luminosity distribution and nulling fraction of the single pulses emitted by pulsars. LuNfit relies on Bayesian nested sampling so that the parameter space can be fully explored. Bayesian nested sampling also provides the additional benefit of simplifying model comparisons through the Bayes ratio. The robustness of LuNfit is shown through simulations and applying LuNfit onto pulsars with known nulling fractions. LuNfit is then applied to three RRATs, J0012+5431, J1538+1523, and J2355+1523, extracting their intrinsic luminosity distribution and burst rates. We find that their nulling fractions are 0.4(2), 0.749(5), and 0.995(2), respectively. We further find that a log-normal distribution likely describes the single pulse luminosity distribution of J0012+5431 and J1538+1523, while the Bayes ratio for J2355+1523 slightly favors an exponential distribution. We show the conventional method of correcting selection effects by “scaling up” the missed fraction of radio transients can be unreliable when the mean luminosity of the source is faint relative to the telescope sensitivity. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the current implementation of LuNfit while also delving into potential enhancements that would enable LuNfit to be applied to sources with complex pulse morphologies.

总结: 
硅单硫化物（SiS）在宇宙空间的形成过程一直被认为困难重重，但现有研究显示，之前排除的反应途径可能对其天体丰度做出贡献。SH + SiH基团反应产生SiS，并产生一个稳定的H2分子作为产物来消散动能。这种反应是一种有利的气相化学反应。虽然之前提出的原子硫和硅与SiH、SH和H2S反应的机制仍然是SiS生成的主要贡献者，但在某些区域SiS的丰度可能是SiH存在的标志，而这之前并未观察到。量子化学计算得出的反应轨迹表明，分子云、震撼区域或原行星盘的硅-硫化合物化学可能比之前预想的更加丰富。此外，还提供了中间体顺式和反式HSiSH的量子化学光谱数据，以帮助其进行潜在的光谱表征。 <div>
The formation of silicon monosulfide (SiS) in space appears to be a difficult process, but the present work shows that a previously excluded pathway may contribute to its astronomical abundance. Reaction of the radicals SH + SiH produces SiS with a submerged transition state and generates a stabilizing H2 molecule as a product to dissipate the kinetic energy. Such is a textbook chemical reaction for favorable gas-phase chemistry. While previously proposed mechanisms reacting atomic sulfur and silicon with SiH, SH, and H2S will still be major contributors to the production of SiS, an abundance of SiS in certain regions could be a marker for the presence of SiH where it has previously been unobserved. These quantum chemically computed reaction profiles imply that the silicon-chalcogen chemistry of molecular clouds, shocked regions, or protoplanetary disks may be richer than previously thought. Quantum chemical spectral data for the intermediate cis- and trans-HSiSH are also provided to aid in their potential spectroscopic characterization.

首次使用加拿大氢强度映射实验的极化地图，对G137+7进行分析。发现一个长达10°的尾部并称之为蝌蚪。蝌蚪的头部是一个Faraday旋转特征，尾部暗示了气体或电离星在星际介质中的运动。在频谱中发现了多个组分。在约600兆赫兹的Faraday旋转观测对低密度的电离或部分电离气体敏感，这在其他追踪器中无法检测到。
<br /><br />总结: 本文首次利用加拿大氢强度映射实验的极化地图对G137+7进行详细分析，发现了一个有趣的天体结构——蝌蚪，并推测其头部是一个Faraday旋转特征，尾部暗示了气体或电离星的运动。在频谱中发现多个组分，而在约600兆赫兹的Faraday旋转观测对低密度的电离或部分电离气体敏感。 <div>
A direct consequence of Faraday rotation is that the polarized radio sky does not resemble the total intensity sky at long wavelengths. We analyze G137+7, which is undetectable in total intensity but appears as a depolarization feature. We use the first polarization maps from the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment. Our 400–729 MHz bandwidth and angular resolution, – , allow us to use Faraday synthesis to analyze the polarization structure. In polarized intensity and polarization angle maps, we find a tail extending 10° from the head and designate the combined object, the tadpole. Similar polarization angles, distinct from the background, indicate that the head and tail are physically associated. The head appears as a depolarized ring in single channels, but wideband observations show that it is a Faraday rotation feature. Our investigations of H i and Hα find no connections to the tadpole. The tail suggests motion of either the gas or an ionizing star through the interstellar medium; the B2(e) star HD 20336 is a candidate. While the head features a coherent, ∼ −8 rad m−2 Faraday depth, Faraday synthesis also identifies multiple components in both the head and tail. We verify the locations of the components in the spectra using QU fitting. Our results show that approximately octave-bandwidth Faraday rotation observations at ∼600 MHz are sensitive to low-density ionized or partially ionized gas, which is undetectable in other tracers.

<div> 演化, 星系, 大小, 熄灭, 红移
<br /><br />总结: 本研究跟踪了4518个老年和583个年轻的静止星系样本，在红移0.5 < z < 3期间进行了数量密度和结构演化的研究。在z∼2时期，大约50%的静止星系是最近熄灭的，而这些年轻的静止星系在较低红移时变得越来越稀少，支持了大质量星系熄灭的高峰时期发生在z > 2。我们的数据显示，尽管静止星系的有效半光半径随时间普遍增加，但在相同红移下，年轻的静止星系要比它们的老年对应物体明显更小。我们研究了这种大小差异与其他结构特性之间的关联，包括轴比、颜色梯度、恒星质量和有效半径的内禀离散度。我们证明了这种大小差异是由最大的亚种群（log(M⋆/M⊙) > 11）驱动的，并且当将样本限制在中等质量星系（10.4 < log(M⋆/M⊙) < 11）时，这种差异并不持续。有趣的是，在研究的时期内，物理大小的内禀离散度显示出强烈的共同演化，并在z ∼ 2附近达到峰值，只有在z < 1时才出现分歧。综上所述，并假设我们没有错过大量的低表面亮度星系群，尽管在更高红移时主导形成和熄灭机制产生了紧凑的遗迹，但在z < 1时期可能有多种演化路径可以解释熄灭的星系的多样形态。 <div>
We present a study of the growth of the quiescent galaxy population between 0.5 < z < 3 by tracing the number density and structural evolution of a sample of 4518 old and 583 young quiescent galaxies with log(M⋆/M⊙) > 10.4, selected from the COSMOS2020 catalog with complementary Hubble Space Telescope F160W imaging from the 3D-DASH survey. Among the quiescent population at z ∼ 2, roughly 50% are recently quenched galaxies; these young quiescent galaxies become increasingly rare toward lower redshift, supporting the idea that the peak epoch of massive galaxy quenching occurred at z > 2. Our data show that while the effective half-light radius of quiescent galaxies generally increases with time, young quiescent galaxies are significantly smaller than their older counterparts at the same redshift. In this work we investigate the connection between this size difference and other structural properties, including axis ratio, color gradients, stellar mass, and the intrinsic scatter in effective radius. We demonstrate that the size difference is driven by the most massive subpopulation (log(M⋆/M⊙) > 11) and does not persist when restricting the sample to intermediate-mass galaxies (10.4 < log(M⋆/M⊙) < 11). Interestingly, the intrinsic scatter in physical size shows a strong coevolution over the investigated time period and peaks around z ∼ 2 for both populations, only diverging at z < 1. Taken together, and assuming we are not missing a significant population of lower surface brightness galaxies, while the formation and quenching mechanisms that dominate at higher redshifts yield compact remnants, multiple evolutionary pathways may explain the diverse morphologies of galaxies that quench at z < 1.

总结：<br /><br />这篇文章介绍了对小麦哲伦星云中最亮的星形成区域NGC 346进行的JWST成像调查。通过两个仪器的光度测量，已经检测到200,000多个独特的源。使用近红外颜色分析，观察到了包括196个年轻恒星对象（YSO）在内的各种不同演化阶段的星团。进一步进行了中红外颜色-星等图并确定了颜色分割，以识别了833个红化的YSO候选源。这些候选源与尘埃丝状星云区域有空间关联。此外，对在所有MIRI波段上均有探测的一些源，拟合了YSO光谱能量分布模型。对这些样本中的23个YSO进行了高度自信的分类，并估计了它们的半径、辐射温度、光度和质量。检测到了质量接近1太阳质量的星际年轻恒星对象，这是迄今为止已确认的质量最低的星系外YSO。 <div>
We present a JWST imaging survey with NIRCam and MIRI of NGC 346, the brightest star-forming region in the Small Magellanic Cloud. By combining aperture and point-spread function photometry of 11 wavelength bands across these two instruments, we have detected more than 200,000 unique sources. Using a near-infrared color analysis, we observe various evolved and young populations, including 196 young stellar objects (YSOs) and pre-main-sequence stars suitable for forthcoming spectroscopic studies. We expand upon this work, creating mid-infrared color–magnitude diagrams and determining color cuts to identify 833 reddened sources which are YSO candidates. We observe that these candidate sources are spatially associated with regions of dusty, filamentary nebulosity. Furthermore, we fit model YSO spectral energy distributions to a selection of sources with detections across all of our MIRI bands. We classify with a high degree of confidence 23 YSOs in this sample and estimate their radii, bolometric temperatures, luminosities, and masses. We detect YSOs approaching 1 M⊙, the lowest-mass extragalactic YSOs confirmed to date.

We have determined the proper motions (PMs) of 12 dwarf galaxies in the Local Group (LG), ranging from the outer Milky Way (MW) halo to the edge of the LG. We used the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) as the first and Gaia as the second epoch using the GaiaHub software. For Leo A and Sag DIG, we also used multi-epoch HST measurements relative to background galaxies. Orbital histories derived using these PMs show that two-thirds of the galaxies in our sample are on first infall with >90% certainty. The observed star formation histories of these first-infall dwarfs are generally consistent with infalling dwarfs in simulations. The remaining four galaxies have crossed the virial radius of either the MW or M31. When we compare their star formation (SF) and orbital histories we find tentative agreement between the inferred pattern of SF with the timing of dynamical events in the orbital histories. For Leo I, SF activity rises as the dwarf crosses the MW’s virial radius, culminating in a burst of SF shortly before pericenter (≈1.7 Gyr ago). The SF then declines after pericenter, but with some smaller bursts before its recent quenching (≈0.3 Gyr ago). This shows that even small dwarfs like Leo I can hold onto gas reservoirs and avoid quenching for several gigayears after falling into their host, which is longer than generally found in simulations. Leo II, NGC 6822, and IC 10 are also qualitatively consistent with this SF pattern in relation to their orbit, but more tentatively due to larger uncertainties.

总结:<br />
研究对四颗CTTSs进行了多波段的光度监测，并结合哈勃太空望远镜的紫外和光学光谱。发现这四颗恒星的光变性强烈，变化通常在数天至数年之间，与恒星自转周期和随机的吸积变化有关。光度变化与质量吸积存在强烈的关联，但关系因目标和时期而异。因此，在CTTSs中，光度测量应谨慎用作吸积的直接测量。 <div>
Classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs) are young, low-mass stars that accrete material from their surrounding protoplanetary disk. To better understand accretion variability, we conducted a multiepoch, multiwavelength photometric monitoring campaign of four CTTSs, TW Hya, RU Lup, BP Tau, and GM Aur, in 2021 and 2022, contemporaneous with Hubble Space Telescope UV and optical spectra. We find that all four targets display significant variability in their light curves, generally on days-long timescales (but in some cases year-to-year), often due to periodicity associated with stellar rotation and to stochastic accretion variability. There is a strong connection between mass accretion and photometric variability in all bands, but the relationship varies per target and epoch. Thus, photometry should be used with caution as a direct measure of accretion in CTTSs.

<title>Detection of a Spatially Extended Stellar Population in M33: A Shallow Stellar Halo?</title>

这篇论文利用Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam多色成像技术对M33星系的外部区域进行了分析。他们使用RGB和RC星等作为研究目标，并构建了这些星体的径向表面密度分布图。研究发现M33存在一个扩展的星体组分，其斜率较浅，表明M33可能具有双重结构的星系组分。另外，在星系外部区域检测到了老化或者贫金属成分，支持了星际晕的延伸。最后，他们估计这一星体组分的表面亮度为μV = 35.72 ± 0.08 mag arcsec−2，这与之前的观测限制是一致的。
<br /><br />总结: M33通过Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam进行外部区域分析，发现扩展星体组分，估计表面亮度为35.72 ± 0.08 mag arcsec−2；通过径向分布图发现浅斜率的星系组分，支持双重结构或者延伸盘的存在；检测到了老化或者贫金属成分，支持星际晕的延伸。 <div>
We analyze the outer regions of M33, beyond 15 kpc in projected distance from its center, using Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam multicolor imaging. We identify red giant branch (RGB) stars and red clump (RC) stars using the surface-gravity-sensitive NB515 filter for the RGB sample and a multicolor selection for both samples. We construct the radial surface density profiles of these RGB and RC stars and find that M33 has an extended stellar population with a shallow power-law index of α > −3, depending on the intensity of the contamination. This result represents a flatter profile than the stellar halo that was detected by the previous study focusing on the central region, suggesting that M33 may have a double-structured halo component, i.e., inner/outer halos or a very extended disk. Also, the slope of this extended component is shallower than those typically found for halos in large galaxies, implying intermediate-mass galaxies may have different formation mechanisms (e.g., tidal interaction) from large spirals. We also analyze the radial color profiles of RC/RGB stars and detect a radial gradient, consistent with the presence of an old and/or metal-poor population in the outer region of M33, thereby supporting our proposal that the stellar halo extends beyond 15 kpc. Finally, we estimate that the surface brightness of this extended component is μV = 35.72 ± 0.08 mag arcsec−2. If our detected component is the stellar halo, this estimated value is consistent with the detection limit of previous observations.

In this work, more than a dozen solar energetic particle (SEP) events are identified where the source region is magnetically well connected to at least one spacecraft at 1 au. The observed intensity–time profiles, for all available proton and electron energy channels, are compared to results computed using a numerical one-dimensional SEP transport model in order to derive the parallel mean free paths (pMFPs) as a function of energy (or rigidity) at 1 au. These inversion results are then compared to theoretical estimates of the pMFP, using observed turbulence quantities with observationally motivated variations as input. For protons, a very good comparison between inversion and theoretical results is obtained. It is shown that the observed inter-event variations in the inversion pMFP values can be explained by natural variations in the background turbulence values. For electrons, there is relatively good agreement with pMFPs derived assuming the damping model of dynamical turbulence, although the theoretical values are extremely sensitive to the details of the turbulence dissipation range, which themselves display a high level of variation.

Most galaxies, including the Milky Way, harbor a central supermassive black hole (SMBH) weighing millions to billions of solar masses. Surrounding these SMBHs are dense regions of stars and stellar remnants, such as neutron stars (NSs) and black holes (BHs). NSs and possibly BHs receive large natal kicks at birth on the order of hundreds of kilometers per second. The natal kicks that occur in the vicinity of an SMBH may redistribute the orbital configuration of the compact objects and alter their underlying density distribution. We model the effects of natal kicks on a Galactic center (GC) population of massive stars and stellar binaries with different initial density distributions. Using observational constraints from stellar orbits near the GC, we place an upper limit on the steepness of the initial stellar profile and find it to be core-like. In addition, we predict that 30%–70% of compact objects become unbound from the SMBH due to their kicks and will migrate throughout the Galaxy. Different BH kick prescriptions lead to distinct spatial and kinematic distributions. We suggest that the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope may be able to distinguish between these distributions and thus be able to differentiate between natal kick mechanisms.

This study addresses the prediction of geomagnetic disturbances by exploiting machine learning techniques. Specifically, the Long Short-term Memory recurrent neural network, which is particularly suited for application over long time series, is employed in the analysis of in situ measurements of solar wind plasma and magnetic field acquired over more than one solar cycle, from 2005 to 2019, at the Lagrangian point L1. The problem is approached as a binary classification aiming to predict 1 hr in advance a decrease in the SYM-H geomagnetic activity index below the threshold of −50 nT, which is generally regarded as indicative of magnetospheric perturbations. The strong class imbalance issue is tackled by using an appropriate loss function tailored to optimize appropriate skill scores in the training phase of the neural network. Beside classical skill scores, value-weighted skill scores are then employed to evaluate predictions, suitable in the study of problems, such as the one faced here, characterized by strong temporal variability. For the first time, the content of magnetic helicity and energy carried by solar transients, associated with their detection and likelihood of geoeffectiveness, were considered as input features of the network architecture. Their predictive capabilities are demonstrated through a correlation-driven feature selection method to rank the most relevant characteristics involved in the neural network prediction model. The optimal performance of the adopted neural network in properly forecasting the onset of geomagnetic storms, which is a crucial point for giving real warnings in an operational setting, is finally showed.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The origin and formation of globular clusters (GCs) has remained a mystery. We present a formation scenario for ancient GC-like objects that form in ultrahigh-resolution simulations (smallest cell size < 0.1 pc, mass resolution Mcell = 4 M⊙). The simulations are cosmological zoom-in simulations of dwarf galaxies within the stellar mass range 106−7M⊙ that match Local Group dwarf properties well. Our investigation reveals GCs hosting ancient stellar populations, characterized by a lack of dark matter (DM) in the present epoch. The clusters exhibit short, episodic star formation histories, occasionally marked by the presence of multiple stellar generations. The metallicity distributions show a widening, encompassing stars in the range of 10−4 < Z⋆/Z⊙ < 1. The presence of these objects is attributable to star formation occurring within low-mass DM halos (Mhalo ≈ 106M⊙) during the early stages of the Universe, preceding reionization (z ≳ 7). As these clusters are accreted into dwarf galaxies, DM is preferentially subjected to tidal stripping, with an average accretion redshift of .

Spectropolarimetric observation of a quiescent prominence was performed in He i 1083 nm. With the slit of the spectrograph fixed on the prominence, we obtained a time series of Stokes profiles for a duration of 108 minutes with a cadence of 8 s. Also using imaging spectroscopic data in Hα and extreme-ultraviolet images at 193 Å, we obtained the following results: (1) The prominence harbors persistent waves propagating across its body. (2) The waves are conspicuous in the line-of-sight (LOS) velocity with an amplitude of about 2 km s−1 but not detectable in the intensity of emission lines or magnetic field. (3) Noticeable periods are about 4 minutes (220 and 260 s) and 15 minutes (910 s), and they propagate with phase speeds of 140 ∼ 200 and ∼24 km s−1 preferentially in horizontal and vertical directions, respectively. (4) Magnetic field strength was estimated to be about 2.5 G with its LOS component of 0 ± 1 G on average. We interpret the 4 minute oscillation as Alfvénic waves propagating in the corona containing the prominence threads, and it is not a resonant wave trapped in the prominence body but excited by an external source. On the other hand, a 15 minute oscillation is interpreted as Alfvénic waves propagating upward in the prominence body. The prominence was evolving in its height during our observation, and there is a hint that the 15 minute period gradually gets longer during the observation. These waves are thought to be taking place in layers with different field directions and strength superposed in the LOS.

<title>Particle Acceleration in Relativistic Alfvénic Turbulence</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Strong magnetically dominated Alfvénic turbulence is an efficient engine of nonthermal particle acceleration in a relativistic collisionless plasma. We argue that in the limit of strong magnetization, the type of energy distribution attained by accelerated particles depends on the relative strengths of turbulent fluctuations δB0 and the guide field B0. If δB0 ≪ B0, the particle magnetic moments are conserved, and the acceleration is provided by magnetic curvature drifts. Curvature acceleration energizes particles in the direction parallel to the magnetic field lines, resulting in log-normal tails of particle energy distribution functions. Conversely, if δB0 ≳ B0, interactions of energetic particles with intense turbulent structures can scatter particles, creating a population with large pitch angles. In this case, magnetic mirror effects become important, and turbulent acceleration leads to power-law tails of the energy distribution functions.

This study is motivated by recent observations from the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) mission, which have been identified as ion-acoustic waves from 15 to 25 solar radii. These observations reveal characteristic sequences of narrowband, high-frequency bursts exceeding 100 Hz embedded into a slower evolution around 1 Hz, persisting for several hours. To explore the potential role of the ion-acoustic instability (IAI) in these phenomena, we begin by reviewing classical findings on the IAI within the framework of linear kinetic theory. Focusing on proton distributions comprising both a core and a beam component, we analyze the IAI instability range and growth rates within the parameter regime relevant to PSP observations. Our findings indicate that the IAI can indeed occur in this regime, albeit requiring electron-to-core and beam-to-core temperature ratios slightly different from reported values during electrostatic burst detection. Furthermore, employing one-dimensional kinetic plasma simulations, we validate the growth rates predicted by linear theory and observe the saturation behavior of the instability. The resultant nonlinear structures exhibit trapped proton beam populations and oscillatory signatures comparable to those observed, both in terms of timescales and amplitude.

<div> solar prominences, filament, mass-cycle, thermal instability, magnetohydrodynamic

总结:
太阳日冕突和日冕丝的物质循环过程尚未完全被理解。研究人员一致认为，这些密集结构是由于日冕中的原位凝结和从下方色球中的等离子体虹吸而形成的。通过极高分辨率的三维磁流体力学模拟，研究人员发现热不稳定性可以驱动从低日冕到色球的虹吸流，而无需任何局部加热。研究还表明，冷凝结可以引起磁场线内的虹吸流，从而形成主要的原位质量收集机制。模拟结果与真实观测结果相吻合，包括在极紫外发射通道中的暗日冕腔、细微的垂直结构和再连接流动。 <div>
The mass cycle of solar prominences or filaments is still not completely understood. Researchers agree that these dense structures form by coronal in situ condensations and plasma siphoning from the underlying chromosphere. In the evaporation–condensation model siphoning arises due to evaporation of chromospheric plasma from localized footpoint heating, but this is challenging to justify observationally. Here, we simulate the reconnection–condensation model at extreme resolutions down to 20.8 km within a three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic coronal volume. We form a draining, quiescent prominence and associated coronal rain simultaneously. We show that thermal instability—acting as a trigger for local condensation formation—by itself drives siphoning flows from the low corona without the need of any localized heating. In addition, for the first time, we demonstrate through a statistical analysis along more than 1000 magnetic field lines that cold condensations give rise to siphoning flows within magnetic threads. This siphoning arises from the strong pressure gradient along field lines induced by thermal instability. No correlation is found between siphoning flows and the prominence mass, making thermal instability the main in situ mass-collection mechanism. Our simulated prominence drains by gliding along strongly sheared, asymmetric, dipped magnetic arcades, and develops natural vertical fine structure in an otherwise horizontal magnetic field due to the magnetic Rayleigh–Taylor instability. By synthesising our data, our model shows remarkable agreement with observations of quiescent prominences such as its dark coronal cavity in extreme-ultraviolet emission channels, fine-scale vertical structure, and reconnection outflows, which, for the first time, have been self-consistently obtained as the prominence evolves.

总结:
卫星土星的白天辐射通过卫星的紫外成像光谱仪观测后发现，这些辐射与太阳光通量、太阳入射角、辐射角和观测纬度相关。这些辐射在纬度和季节上显示出强烈的相关性，光学深度的推断也随之变化。研究还发现，辐射模型预测的与实际观测的光学深度存在显著的时间变化。最后，通过与星际氢辐射的模型比对，验证了观测结果的准确性。 <br /><br />总结：土星的白天辐射与太阳光通量、太阳入射角、辐射角和观测纬度相关，光学深度存在季节和时间变化。观测结果与星际氢辐射模型吻合。 <div>
We examine Saturn’s nonauroral (dayglow) emissions at Lyα observed by the Cassini/Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) instrument from 2003 until 2017, to constrain meridional and seasonal trends in the upper atmosphere. We separate viewing geometry effects from trends driven by atmospheric properties, by applying a multivariate regression to the observed emissions. The Lyα dayglow brightnesses depend on the incident solar flux, solar incidence angle, emission angle, and observed latitude. The emissions across latitudes and seasons show a strong dependence with solar incidence angle, typical of resonantly scattered solar flux and consistent with no internal source such as electroglow. We observe a bulge in Lyα brightnesses that shifts with the summer season from the southern to the northern hemisphere. We estimate atomic hydrogen optical depths above the methane homopause level for dayside disk observations (2004–2016) by comparing observed Lyα emissions to a radiative transfer model. We model emissions from resonantly scattered solar flux and a smaller but significant contribution by scattered photons from the interplanetary hydrogen (IPH) background. During the northern summer, inferred hydrogen optical depths steeply decrease with latitude toward the winter hemisphere from a northern hemisphere bulge, as predicted by a 2D seasonal photochemical model. The southern hemisphere mirrors this trend during its summer. However, inferred optical depths show substantially more temporal variation between 2004 and 2016 than predicted by the photochemical model. We benchmark our brightness values by comparing observed IPH Lyα emissions from Cassini/UVIS in 2006 with a model of the IPH emissions. Cassini/UVIS observations agree well with the modeled IPH background.

<div> FR0 galaxies, jet population, multimessenger sources, gamma-ray emission, spectral energy distribution modeling <br />
<br />总结: 本研究确认FR0星系总体上是伽马射线发射体，并发现了两个显著的发射源。研究还发现了5 GHz核心无线电亮度和1-800 GeV带的伽马射线亮度之间存在相关性。使用一区域自同步辐射自康普顿模型，研究通过宽频谱能量分布建模表明这些发现的伽马射线可以解释为反康普顿光子。该建模结果指出了低洛伦兹因子和远离等离子状态、粒子能量密度高于磁场能量密度的射流组成，以解释这些星系的多波段观测。 <div>
FR0 galaxies constitute the most abundant jet population in the local Universe. With their compact jet structure, they are broadband photon emitters and have been proposed as multimessenger sources. Recently, these sources have been detected for the first time in γ rays. Using a revised FR0 catalog, we confirm that the FR0 population as a whole are γ-ray emitters, and we also identify two significant sources. For the first time, we find a correlation between the 5 GHz core radio luminosity and γ-ray luminosity in the 1–800 GeV band, having a 4.8σ statistical significance. This is clear evidence that the jet emission mechanism is similar in nature for FR0s and the well-studied canonical FR (FRI and FRII) radio galaxies. Furthermore, we perform broadband spectral energy distribution modeling for the significantly detected sources as well as the subthreshold source population using a one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model. Within the maximum jet power budget, our modeling shows that the detected γ rays from the jet can be explained as inverse Compton photons. To explain the multiwavelength observations for these galaxies, the modeling results stipulate a low bulk Lorentz factor and a jet composition far from equipartition, with the particle energy density dominating over the magnetic field energy density.

<div> 磁偶极体环结构, 太阳磁场, Joy's law, Hale's polarity law, 太阳活动周期
总结:
本文提出了一个由两个关于赤道面对称的磁偶极体环组成的结构，作为太阳磁场可能的模型。通过近似计算得出该结构产生的磁场符合Joy's law和Hale's polarity law。它还解释了太阳活动高峰期太阳黑子分布中出现两个峰（格涅维舍夫间隙）的现象。通过磁滞原理计算极地磁场，预测了太阳活动的行为。分析偶极子章动有助于预测未来太阳活动的强度。尽管这个磁偶极体环结构的涌现和运行是从陀螺磁力和热力的角度进行了简化的考虑，但这并不限制这个结构作为其他更全球范围内的太阳磁理论的潜在模型的应用。 <div>
This paper considers a structure consisting of two rings of magnetic dipoles symmetrical relative to the equatorial plane as a possible model for the source of the solar magnetic field. It shows that the magnetic field generated by this structure corresponds to Joy’s law and Hale’s polarity law. Approximate calculations show that the form and shape of the equatorial field of this structure are close to measured values, and the resulting distribution of sunspots is in agreement with Joy's law to Maunder’s butterfly diagram. Based on this structure, it is possible to explain the appearance of two peaks (Gnevyshev gap) in the distribution of sunspots at the maximum of solar activity. Calculating the polar field based on the principles of magnetic hysteresis shows a good coincidence of the calculated and measured values and makes it possible to predict the behavior of the polar field in the interval to the nearest minimum of solar activity. Analyzing dipole nutation makes it possible to predict the intensity of the upcoming solar activity maxima, while a nutation period of approximately 8 months can be associated with 1.3 yr-period field oscillations. Despite the fact that the emergence and the functioning of the proposed configuration of magnetic dipoles is considered in a simplified manner and only from the point of view of gyromagnetic and thermal forces for speed and clarity, this does not limit the use of the proposed structure as a potential model in other, more global-scale general hydromagnetic theories of solar magnetism.

<br />
通过对S5 0716+716的光学B、V、R和I波段在2019年3月至2023年8月进行的观测研究，发现这个类星体在不同时间尺度上具有变化。使用土耳其T60机器人望远镜对其进行了416个夜晚的长期观测。另外，为了寻找类星体的日内变化，用T100望远镜进行了至少1小时的观测，共21个夜晚。研究发现，该类星体在光学R波段在观测期间呈现约2.47等变化，亮度最高于2020年1月18日（MJD 58866），R = 12.109±0.011等，最暗于2019年3月23日（MJD 58565），R = 14.580±0.013等。应用嵌套ANOVA检验和加权F检验量化了日内变异性，发现其中12个夜晚类星体在R波段显著变化。光变曲线的相关性分析显示，BVRI光学波段的发射在短期和长期内都强相关且没有时间延迟。根据加权小波Z变换和Lomb-Scargle周期图分析，发现该类星体在光学R波段光变曲线上可能有186±30和532±76天的准周期。文章对日内变化和长期变化特征进行了讨论，提出了一些潜在的情景。 <br /><br />总结: <br />研究对S5 0716+716类星体的光学变异性进行了长期观测，并发现了日内和长期的变化特征。BVRI光学波段的发射与时间相关，并且可能存在准周期。 <div>
We present the results of the observational study of the blazar S5 0716+716 in the optical bands B, V, R, and I between 2019 March and 2023 August to investigate its variability on diverse timescales. The blazar was followed up by the T60 robotic telescope in Türkiye for 416 nights to obtain long-term variability during this period. In order to search for the intraday variability of the object, we have carried out 21 nights of observations with the T100 telescope for at least 1 hr. The blazar showed a ∼2.47 mag variation in the optical R band during our monitoring period, the brightest state on 2020 January 18 (MJD 58866) as R = 12.109 ± 0.011 mag and the faintest state on 2019 March 23 (MJD 58565) as R = 14.580 ± 0.013 mag. We employed the nested ANOVA test and the power-enhanced F-test to quantify intraday variability, which showed that the blazar was significantly variable in the R band on 12 out of 21 nights. Correlation analysis of the light curves shows that the emission in the BVRI optical bands was strongly correlated both in the short and long term without any time lag. The blazar has likely quasiperiods of 186 ± 30 and 532 ± 76 days in the optical R-band light curve according to the weighted wavelet Z-transform and Lomb–Scargle periodogram. The intraday variation and long-term variation features are discussed within the frame of prospective scenarios.

总结:
本研究利用斯隆数字化天空勘测的Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA)目录，发现301个具有广Hα发射线的星系和801个具有广Hβ发射线的星系。在总计1042个独特的广发射线星系中，60个同时具有广Hα和广Hβ发射线。研究显示，广发射线区域的半径范围在0.01到46 lt-days之间，其中广Hβ样本的中值半径为0.1 lt-days（0.02 pc）。此外，研究还发现，与MaNGA星系全样本（26%）相比，广Hα样本和广Hβ样本都具有更高的星系合并比例（分别为44%和43%），这表明星系合并推动的燃料补给在我们的样本中非常活跃。<br /><br /> <div>
Broad Hα and Hβ emission lines (FWHM > 1000 km s−1) are incredibly efficient tracers of the high-velocity clouds encircling active galactic nuclei (AGNs). As a result, we search for these broad-line AGN in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey’s Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) catalog. We identify 301 broad-line Hα galaxies and 801 broad-line Hβ galaxies in the catalog. In total, we detect 1042 unique broad-line galaxies with luminosities between 1037 and 1043 erg s−1; 60 feature both broad Hα and broad Hβ emission. We also determine that the broad-line region radius ranges between 0.01 and 46 lt-days, with a median radius of 0.1 lt-days (0.02 pc) for our broad Hβ sample. In addition, we find that both samples feature a higher fraction of galaxy mergers (44% for the broad Hα sample and 43% for the broad Hβ sample), compared to the full MaNGA galaxy sample (26%), which suggests that merger-driven fueling is strongly active in our sample.

总结:<br />
本研究使用矩阵方法和线性响应理论研究了被略微置于动态平衡之外的孤立恒星系统的松弛过程。研究表明，最终的平衡状态的全相空间分布可以直接从非平衡的初始条件中恢复，无需计算系统的时间演化，从而减少了计算的复杂性。此外，还开发了工具来模拟系统在线性近似下的完整时间演化，尤其是表明可以利用广义矩矩阵高效地计算速度分布的矩。研究应用线性方法对能量截断的Hernquist球体进行了松弛过程的研究，模拟了一个具有等离子体的暗物质次哈洛的潮汐剥离。与受控的孤立N体模拟进行比较显示，在预期会出现线性对扰动相响应的部分，线性预测与实际结果一致。研究结果发现，尽管初始的非平衡状态具有各向同性的运动学特性，但是松弛会在中间区域生成切向速度各向异性。结果还加强了松弛过程会消减密度尖峰幅度，但不会影响其渐近斜率的观点。最后，将线性理论与椭圆轨道潮汐剥离的N体模拟进行比较，验证了该理论仍然准确预测了系统大部分区域的密度和速度分散特性。 <div>
Placed slightly out of dynamical equilibrium, an isolated stellar system quickly returns toward a steady virialized state. We study this process of collisionless relaxation using the matrix method of linear response theory. We show that the full phase-space distribution of the final virialized state can be recovered directly from the disequilibrium initial conditions, without the need to compute the time evolution of the system. This shortcut allows us to determine the final virialized configuration with minimal computational effort. Complementing this result, we develop tools to model the system's full time evolution in the linear approximation. In particular, we show that moments of the velocity distribution can be efficiently computed using a generalized moment matrix. We apply our linear methods to study the relaxation of energy-truncated Hernquist spheres, mimicking the tidal stripping of a cuspy dark matter subhalo. Comparison of our linear predictions against controlled, isolated N-body simulations shows agreement at percent level for the parts of the system where a linear response to the perturbation is expected. We find that relaxation generates a tangential velocity anisotropy in the intermediate regions, despite the initial disequilibrium state having isotropic kinematics. Our results also strengthen the case for relaxation depleting the amplitude of the density cusp, without affecting its asymptotic slope. Finally, we compare the linear theory against an N-body simulation of tidal stripping on a radial orbit, confirming that the theory still accurately predicts density and velocity dispersion profiles for most of the system.

总结: 
文章研究了太阳风湍流中的间歇性相干结构，利用Park Solar Probe的数据，跨越了从MHD到动力学等离子体尺度的范围，首次在物理空间中应用了多尺度分析。研究发现在MHD尺度范围内，存在电流片和阿尔芬涡等结构，而在这些事件中嵌入了更小尺度的结构，通常是离子尺度的阿尔芬涡和亚离子尺度的可压缩涡旋。观察到的结构数量随着尺度的减小而增多，在MHD尺度约为200个事件，在离子尺度约为103个，在亚离子尺度约为104个。通过统计分析，结果显示阿尔芬涡在各个尺度上占据主导地位，这与以往普遍认为电流片占主导地位的观点有所不同，这表明阿尔芬涡是太阳风湍流中重要的构建模块。 <br /><br /> <div>
We study intermittent coherent structures in solar wind turbulence from MHD to kinetic plasma scales using Parker Solar Probe data during its first perihelion (at 0.17 au) in the highly Alfvénic slow solar wind. We detect coherent structures using Morlet wavelets. For the first time, we apply a multiscale analysis in physical space. At MHD scales within the inertial range, times scales τ ∈ (1, 102) s, we find (i) current sheets including switchback boundaries and (ii) Alfvén vortices. Within these events are embedded structures at smaller scales: typically Alfvén vortices at ion scales, τ ∈ (0.08, 1) s, and compressible vortices at sub-ion scales, τ ∈ 8(10−3, 10−2) s. The number of coherent structures grows toward smaller scales: we observe ∼200 events during a 5 hr time interval at MHD scales, ∼103 at ion scales, and ∼104 at sub-ion scales. In general, there are multiple structures of ion and sub-ion scales embedded within one MHD structure. There are also examples of ion and sub-ion scale structures outside MHD structures. To quantify the relative importance of different types of structures, we do a statistical comparison of the observed structures with the expectations of models of the current sheets and vortices. The results show the dominance of Alfvén vortices at all scales in contrast to the widespread view of the dominance of current sheets. This means that Alfvén vortices are important building blocks of Alfvénic solar wind turbulence.

We report the first experimental detection of a reflected Alfvén wave from an Alfvén-speed gradient under conditions similar to those in coronal holes. The experiments were conducted in the Large Plasma Device at the University of California, Los Angeles. We present the experimentally measured dependence of the coefficient of reflection versus the wave inhomogeneity parameter, i.e., the ratio of the wavelength of the incident wave to the length scale of the gradient. Two-fluid simulations using the Gkeyll code qualitatively agree with and support the experimental findings. Our experimental results support models of wave heating that rely on wave reflection at low heights from a smooth Alfvén-speed gradient to drive turbulence.

本研究对漩涡星系M101中的九个H ii区的恒星和星云特性进行了调查，使用了远紫外（FUV; ∼900–2000 Å）和光学（∼3200–10,000 Å）光谱。我们检测到了7个区域中显著的C iii] λλ1907,1909星云发射，但只在最低金属丰度的区域中发现了O iii] λ1666。我们提出了关于金属丰度的碳离子化校正因子的新解析函数，以进行初步的C/O丰度分析。FUV光谱还包含了大量的恒星发射和P-Cygni特征，我们用单次爆发的Starburst99和BPASS模型的辐射加权组合对其进行拟合。我们发现，最佳拟合的Starburst99模型与观察到的非常高电离P-Cygni特征很好地匹配，需要非常炽热、年轻(≲3百万年)、金属丰度高的大质量恒星。最年轻的恒星群体与宽He ii发射、氮Wolf–Rayet（WR）FUV和光学光谱特征以及增强的N/O气体丰度密切相关。因此，短寿命的WR相可能在几个N P-Cygni风特征（λ955, λ991, λ1720）中驱动多余的发射，导致了对较高金属丰度的恒星连续体拟合与气相金属丰度的偏差。精确表征这些H ii区需要在恒星群体合成模型中进一步包含WR恒星。我们的FUV光谱证明了∼900–1200 Å FUV可以为未来WR大气和进化模型提供强有力的试验基础。<br /><br /> <div>
We investigate the stellar and nebular properties of nine H ii regions in the spiral galaxy M101 with far-ultraviolet (FUV; ∼900–2000 Å) and optical (∼3200–10,000 Å) spectra. We detect significant C iii] λλ1907,1909 nebular emission in seven regions, but O iii] λ1666 only in the lowest-metallicity region. We produce new analytic functions of the carbon ionization correction factors as a function of metallicity in order to perform a preliminary C/O abundance analysis. The FUV spectra also contain numerous stellar emission and P-Cygni features that we fit with luminosity-weighted combinations of single-burst Starburst99 and BPASS models. We find that the best-fit Starburst99 models closely match the observed very-high-ionization P-Cygni features, requiring very hot, young (≲3 Myr), metal-enriched massive stars. The youngest stellar populations are strongly correlated with broad He ii emission, nitrogen Wolf–Rayet (WR) FUV and optical spectral features, and enhanced N/O gas abundances. Thus, the short-lived WR phase may be driving excess emission in several N P-Cygni wind features (λ955, λ991, λ1720) that bias the stellar continuum fits to higher metallicities relative to the gas-phase metallicities. Accurate characterization of these H ii regions requires additional inclusion of WR stars in the stellar population synthesis models. Our FUV spectra demonstrate that the ∼900–1200 Å FUV can provide a strong test bed for future WR atmosphere and evolution models.

<br />总结: 
本研究提供了1996年11月至2023年5月期间在Wind和Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory飞船上观察到的139个DH类型IV爆发的全面目录。其中73％与快速（> 900 km/s）和宽泛（> 60°）的CME相关联，平均CME速度为1301 km/s。所有DH类型IV爆发均与白光CME相关，其中78％与光晕CME相关。CME源纬度在±45°范围内。77个事件有多颗卫星不同位置的观测数据，发现观测角度对动态光谱的影响。观察到的爆发在±60°的视线范围内效果最佳。持续时间超过120分钟的爆发在±60°的经度范围内。这些结果确认了类型IV辐射的固有定向性。此外，该目录形成了一个以太阳为星的DH类型IV爆发数据库。 <div>
Decameter hectometric (DH; 1–14 MHz) type IV radio bursts are produced by flare-accelerated electrons trapped in postflare loops or the moving magnetic structures associated with the coronal mass ejections (CMEs). From a space weather perspective, it is important to systematically compile these bursts, explore their spectrotemporal characteristics, and study the associated CMEs. We present a comprehensive catalog of DH type IV bursts observed by the Radio and Plasma Wave Investigation instruments on board the Wind and Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory spacecraft covering the period of white-light CME observations by the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory mission between 1996 November and 2023 May. The catalog has 139 bursts, of which 73% are associated with a fast (>900 km s−1) and wide (>60°) CME, with a mean CME speed of 1301 km s−1. All DH type IV bursts are white-light CME-associated, with 78% of the events associated with halo CMEs. The CME source latitudes are within ±45°. Seventy-seven events had multiple-vantage-point observations from different spacecraft, letting us explore the impact of the line of sight on the dynamic spectra. For 48 of the 77 events, there were good data from at least two spacecraft. We find that, unless occulted by nearby plasma structures, a type IV burst is best viewed when observed within a ±60° line of sight. Also, bursts with a duration above 120 minutes have source longitudes within ±60°. Our inferences confirm the inherent directivity in the type IV emission. Additionally, the catalog forms a Sun-as-a-star DH type IV burst database.

<div> Parker Solar Probe, WSA coronal model, EUHFORIA, calibration, solar wind observations
总结:
Parker Solar Probe观测在最近的太阳活动极小期间，使用Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA)日冕模型进行校准，该模型是欧洲日球层预报信息资源(EUHFORIA)的一部分。通过PSP观测，校准了WSA模型的四个常数，并将更新后的WSA边界条件同PSP观测进行对比，并在整个日球层中传播这些条件。通过对地球的预测结果来评估模型的性能，发现接近太阳的模型配置与提供更好地球预测的配置不同。原因可能是PSP记录的快速太阳风速度的稀缺性，并且还可能与EUHFORIA的日球层中缺少的物理过程以及WSA关系与日球层MHD域耦合可能需要全面重新制定有关。 <div>
We employ Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observations during the latest solar minimum period (years 2018–2021) to calibrate the version of the Wang–Sheeley–Arge (WSA) coronal model used in the European Heliospheric Forecasting Information Asset (EUHFORIA). WSA provides a set of boundary conditions at 0.1 au necessary to initiate the heliospheric part of EUHFORIA, namely, the domain extending beyond the solar Alfvénic point. To calibrate WSA, we observationally constrain four constants in the WSA semiempirical formula based on PSP observations. We show how the updated (after the calibration) WSA boundary conditions at 0.1 au are compared to PSP observations at similar distances, and we further propagate these conditions in the heliosphere according to EUHFORIA’s magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) approach. We assess the predictions at Earth based on the dynamic time-warping technique. Our findings suggest that, for the period of interest, the WSA configurations that resembled optimally the PSP observations close to the Sun were different from the ones needed to provide better predictions at Earth. One reason for this discrepancy can be attributed to the scarcity of fast solar wind velocities recorded by PSP. The calibration of the model was performed based on unexpectedly slow velocities that did not allow us to achieve generally and globally improved solar wind predictions compared to older studies. Other reasons can be attributed to missing physical processes from the heliospheric part of EUHFORIA but also the fact that the currently employed WSA relationship, as coupled to the heliospheric MHD domain, may need a global reformulation beyond that of just updating the four constant factors that were taken into account in this study.

<br />
研究发现，伽马射线暴余辉中的电子加速不符合纯幂律分布，还有额外的低能“热”部分占据了相当大的能量比例。通过对热电子对伽马射线暴余辉的影响进行研究，可以深入了解粒子加速机制。研究解决了电子能量空间中的连续方程，推导了多波段余辉，并包含了包括辐射、自吸收、自康普顿散射和伽马-伽马湮灭等过程。首先，由于电子冷却，时间和能谱指数之间存在正相关性。此外，热电子导致多波段上同时出现能谱和时间指数的非单调变化，这些可以被2.5米广域调查望远镜和维拉·鲁宾天文台空间和时间遗产调查单独记录。热电子也可以通过光学（与维拉·鲁宾天文台）和X射线（与微通道X射线望远镜）波段的余辉光谱进行诊断。最后，我们使用蒙特卡洛模拟得到了软和硬X射线峰值通量比（RX）的分布，以及软X射线和光学光曲线峰值时间之间的时间延迟（Δt）的分布。热电子显著提高了RX和Δt的上限。因此，具有热电子的伽马射线暴余辉的分布在RX-Δt平面上更加分散。<br /><br />总结: 电子加速不符合幂律分布，热电子对余辉造成影响，同时影响能谱和时间指数，LSST和微通道X射线望远镜可以用于记录这些变化，热电子导致RX和Δt的上限提高。 <div>
Particle-in-cell simulations have unveiled that shock-accelerated electrons do not follow a pure power-law distribution, but have an additional low-energy “thermal” part, which owns a considerable portion of the total energy of the electrons. Investigating the effects of these thermal electrons on gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows may provide valuable insights into the particle acceleration mechanisms. We solve the continuity equation of electrons in energy space, from which multiwavelength afterglows are derived by incorporating processes including synchrotron radiation, synchrotron self-absorption, synchrotron self-Compton scattering, and γ–γ annihilation. First, there is an underlying positive correlation between the temporal and spectral indices due to the cooling of electrons. Moreover, thermal electrons result in simultaneous nonmonotonic variations of both the spectral and temporal indices at multiple wavelengths, which could be individually recorded by the 2.5 m Wide Field Survey Telescope and Vera Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). The thermal electrons could also be diagnosed using afterglow spectra from synergistic observations in the optical (with LSST) and X-ray (with the Microchannel X-ray Telescope on board the Space Variable Objects Monitor) bands. Finally, we use Monte Carlo simulations to obtain the distribution of the peak flux ratio (RX) between the soft and hard X-rays, and of the time delay (Δt) between the peak times of the soft X-ray and optical light curves. The thermal electrons significantly raise the upper limits of both RX and Δt. Thus, the distribution of GRB afterglows with thermal electrons is more scattered in the RX−Δt plane.

<div> 关键词: 自转速度、磁致减速、双星演化、质量传递、磁致制动方案
总结:
受到后质量传递系统中吸积星自转速度测量的启发，我们研究了磁致制动对双星演化过程中各个恒星自转速度减缓的影响。我们首先计算了潮汐力是否足够强大来同步轨道，从而影响了恒星的自转减速和轨道分离。我们应用了四种磁致制动方案来减小整个双星演化模拟中两颗恒星的自转角动量。我们的研究发现，尽管磁致制动导致吸积星持续自转减速，但当捐赠者开始向吸积星传递物质时，吸积星可以快速旋转至临界自转速率。质量传递后，磁致制动对恒星角动量的演化变得更加重要。因此，后质量传递吸积星可以作为观察磁致制动方案如何将恒星从临界自转速率减速的宝贵试验平台。吸积星的自转速度结合其质量，可以提供自质量传递停止后的年龄信息。通过将模型与观测数据进行比较，发现Garraffo等人的磁致制动方案更符合后质量传递吸积星的自转数据。 <div>
Motivated by measurements of the rotation speed of accretor stars in post-mass-transfer (post-MT) systems, we investigate how magnetic braking affects the spin-down of individual stars during binary evolution with the MESAbinary module. Unlike the conventional assumption of tidal synchronization coupled with magnetic braking in binaries, we first calculate whether tides are strong enough to synchronize the orbit. Subsequently, this influences the spin-down of stars and the orbital separation. In this study, we apply four magnetic braking prescriptions to reduce the spin angular momentum of the two stars throughout the entire binary evolution simulation. Our findings reveal that despite magnetic braking causing continuous spin-down of the accretor, when the donor begins to transfer material onto the accretor, the accretor can rapidly spin up to its critical rotation rate. After MT, magnetic braking becomes more important in affecting the angular momentum evolution of the stars. Post-MT accretor stars thus serve as a valuable test bed for observing how the magnetic braking prescriptions operate in spinning down stars from their critical rotation, including the saturation regimes of the magnetic braking. The rotation rate of the accretor star, combined with its mass, could provide age information since the cessation of MT. By comparing the models against observations, the magnetic braking prescription by Garraffo et al. is found to better align with the rotation data of post-MT accretors.

<div> 磁瓶结构，带电粒子，太阳耀斑，多波段观测，宏观磁流体和粒子建模

总结:<br /><br />本研究通过多波段观测和数据驱动的宏观磁流体和粒子建模，揭示了在真实的耀斑几何结构中存在磁瓶结构。观测结果显示，磁瓶结构不仅具有磁场强度的局部最小值，还引起了等离子体的急剧减速。这一结构与上方环顶区域紧凑的硬X射线源和横跨耀斑拱的扩展微波源位置吻合。空间分辨谱分析表明，非热电子高度聚集在这一区域。模型还返回了与观测相匹配的合成发射特征。研究结果表明，由于湍流的作用，高能电子受困在磁瓶区域内，只有很小一部分得以逃逸。这些电子主要通过等离子体压缩加速，并通过费米机制在快模终止激波加速。我们的结果为磁瓶结构成为耀斑中主要的电子加速场提供了坚实的依据。同时，它还为理解早前报道的进入星际空间的小型耀斑加速电子群体提供了新的见解。 <div>
Where and how flares efficiently accelerate charged particles remains an unresolved question. Recent studies revealed that a “magnetic bottle” structure, which forms near the bottom of a large-scale reconnection current sheet above the flare arcade, is an excellent candidate for confining and accelerating charged particles. However, further understanding its role requires linking the various observational signatures to the underlying coupled plasma and particle processes. Here we present the first study combining multiwavelength observations with data-informed macroscopic magnetohydrodynamics and particle modeling in a realistic eruptive flare geometry. The presence of an above-the-loop-top magnetic bottle structure is strongly supported by the observations, which feature not only a local minimum of magnetic field strength but also abruptly slowing plasma downflows. It also coincides with a compact above-the-loop-top hard X-ray source and an extended microwave source that bestrides the flare arcade. Spatially resolved spectral analysis suggests that nonthermal electrons are highly concentrated in this region. Our model returns synthetic emission signatures that are well matched to the observations. The results suggest that the energetic electrons are strongly trapped in the magnetic bottle region due to turbulence, with only a small fraction managing to escape. The electrons are primarily accelerated by plasma compression and facilitated by a fast-mode termination shock via the Fermi mechanism. Our results provide concrete support for the magnetic bottle as the primary electron acceleration site in eruptive solar flares. They also offer new insights into understanding the previously reported small population of flare-accelerated electrons entering interplanetary space.

Kilonovae represent a category of astrophysical transients, identifiable as the electromagnetic (EM) counterparts associated with the coalescence events of binary systems comprising neutron stars and neutron star–black hole pairs. They act as probes for heavy-element nucleosynthesis in astrophysical environments. These studies rely on an inference of the physical parameters (e.g., ejecta mass, velocity, composition) that describe kilonovae-based on EM observations. This is a complex inverse problem typically addressed with sampling-based methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo or nested sampling algorithms. However, repeated inferences can be computationally expensive, due to the sequential nature of these methods. This poses a significant challenge to ensuring the reliability and statistical validity of the posterior approximations and, thus, the inferred kilonova parameters themselves. We present a novel approach: simulation-based inference using simulations produced by KilonovaNet. Our method employs an ensemble of amortized neural posterior estimation (ANPE) with an embedding network to directly predict posterior distributions from simulated spectral energy distributions. We take advantage of the quasi-instantaneous inference time of ANPE to demonstrate the reliability of our posterior approximations using diagnostics tools, including coverage diagnostic and posterior predictive checks. We further test our model with real observations from AT 2017gfo, the only kilonova with multimessenger data, demonstrating agreement with previous likelihood-based methods while reducing inference time down to a few seconds. The inference results produced by ANPE appear to be conservative and reliable, paving the way for testable and more efficient kilonova parameter inference.

<br /><br />总结:
本研究通过20个类似于银河系的宿主暗物质的冷暗物质缩放模拟，筛选出符合银河系暗物质质量、浓度、近期和早期进入的分支星系大麦哲伦云和Gaia–Sausage–Enceladus的宿主系统。这些宿主系统比未包含大麦哲伦云和Gaia–Sausage–Enceladus分支星系的系统有着更多的次星系，尤其是在内部区域。同时，研究发现Gaia–Sausage–Enceladus分支星系对目前的银河系次星系数量贡献不大。这些结果有助于我们更好地理解银河系的暗物质结构和次星系数量，并对目前仅能在银河系中测量的一系列数据进行解释。 <div>
We present Milky Way-est, a suite of 20 cosmological cold-dark-matter-only zoom-in simulations of Milky Way (MW)-like host halos. Milky Way-est hosts are selected such that they (i) are consistent with the MW’s measured halo mass and concentration, (ii) accrete a Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC)-like (≈1011M⊙) subhalo within the last 2 Gyr on a realistic orbit, placing them near 50 kpc from the host center at z ≈ 0, and (iii) undergo a >1:5 sub-to-host halo mass ratio merger with a Gaia–Sausage–Enceladus (GSE)-like system at early times (0.67 < z < 3). Hosts satisfying these LMC and GSE constraints constitute <1% of all halos in the MW’s mass range, and their total masses grow rapidly at late times due to LMC analog accretion. Compared to hosts of a similar final halo mass that are not selected to include LMC and GSE analogs, Milky Way-est hosts contain 22% more subhalos with present-day virial masses above 108M⊙ throughout the virial radius, on average. This enhancement reaches ≈80% in the inner 100 kpc and is largely, if not entirely, due to LMC-associated subhalos. These systems also induce spatial anisotropy in Milky Way-est subhalo populations, with ≈60% of the total subhalo population within 100 kpc found in the current direction of the LMC. Meanwhile, we find that GSE-associated subhalos do not significantly contribute to present-day Milky Way-est subhalo populations. These results provide context for our Galaxy’s dark matter structure and subhalo population and will help interpret a range of measurements that are currently only possible in the MW.

We calculated cross sections for the dielectronic recombination (DR) satellite lines of Fe xvii and benchmarked our predictions with experimental cross sections of Fe xvii resonances that were monoenergetically excited in an electron-beam ion trap. We extend the benchmark to all resolved DR and direct electron-impact excitation (DE) channels in the experimental data set, specifically the n ≥ 4 DR resonances of Fe xvii, complementing earlier investigations of n = 3 channels. Our predictions for the DR and DE absolute cross sections for the higher n complexes disagree considerably with experimental results when using the same methods as in previous works. However, we achieve agreement within ∼10% of the experimental results by an approach whereby we doubly convolve the predicted cross sections with both the spread of the electron-beam energy and the photon energy resolution of our experiment. We then calculated rate coefficients from the experimental and theoretical cross sections, finding general agreement within 2σ with the rates found in the OPEN-ADAS atomic database.

Recent analyses of millimeter-wavelength protoplanetary disk observations have revealed several emission excesses on the previously identified dust rings, referred to as dust shoulders. The prevalence of dust shoulders suggests that they trace a common but unclear mechanism. In this work, we combine 3D, multifluid hydrodynamic simulations with radiative transfer calculations to explain the formation of dust shoulders. We find that the ring-shoulder pairs can result from the 3D planet–disk interactions with massive, gap-opening planets. The key driver is the dust filtration effect at the local pressure maximum due to planet-driven outward gas flows. Our work provides a possible explanation for the outer dust shoulders in recent super-resolution analyses of Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations. It also provides insights into the formation of the inner dust shoulder in the PDS 70 disk and highlights the role of 3D effects in planet–disk interaction studies.

总结:
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)的深度调查揭示了在4≲z≲13范围内出现了由早期大质量黑洞的吸积过程驱动的中等亮度、宽线活跃星系核(AGNs)的新群体。这些AGNs显示出很高的光子泄漏率和大量的氢、氦LyC辐射产生效率，这使得重新评估AGNs是否是宇宙氢/氦再电离过程中的唯一驱动因素。研究假设了一些前提条件，并且提出了模型来解释氢再电离的进程，得到了一些与宇宙微波背景各向异性数据一致的结果。研究结果表明，在JWST探测到的丰富AGN群体不会违反对未解析的X射线背景的限制。 <div>
Deep surveys with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed an emergent population of moderate-luminosity, broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at 4 ≲ z ≲ 13 powered by accretion onto early massive black holes. The high number densities reported, together with the large Lyman-continuum (LyC) production efficiency and leakiness into the intergalactic medium that are typical of UV-selected AGNs, lead us to reassess a scenario where AGNs are the sole drivers of the cosmic hydrogen/helium reionization process. Our approach is based on the assumptions, grounded in recent observations, that (a) the fraction of broad-line AGNs among galaxies is around 10%–15%; (b) the mean escape fraction of hydrogen LyC radiation is high, at ≳80%, in AGN hosts and is negligible otherwise; and (c) internal absorption at 4 ryd or a steep ionizing EUV spectrum delay full reionization of He ii until z ≃ 2.8–3.0, in agreement with observations of the He ii Lyα forest. In our fiducial models, (1) hydrogen reionization is 99% completed by redshift z ≃ 5.3–5.5 and reaches its midpoint at z ≃ 6.5–6.7; (2) the integrated Thomson scattering optical depth to reionization is ≃0.05, consistent with constraints from cosmic microwave background anisotropy data; and (3) the abundant AGN population detected by JWST does not violate constraints on the unresolved X-ray background.

We examine the dynamics and stability of circumbinary particles orbiting around the Earth–Moon binary system. The moon formed close to the Earth (semimajor axis aEM ≈ 3 R⊕) and expanded through tides to its current day semimajor axis (aEM = 60 R⊕). Circumbinary orbits that are polar or highly inclined to the Earth–Moon orbit are subject to two competing effects: (i) nodal precession about the Earth–Moon eccentricity vector and (ii) Kozai–Lidov oscillations of eccentricity and inclination driven by the Sun. While we find that there are no stable polar orbits around the Earth–Moon orbit with the current day semimajor axis, polar orbits were stable immediately after the formation of the Moon, at the time when there was a lot of debris around the system, up to when the semimajor axis reached about aEM ≈ 10 R⊕. We discuss implications of polar orbits on the evolution of the Earth–Moon system and the possibility of polar orbiting moons around exoplanet–moon binaries.

We investigated the stellar mass function and the binary fraction of 114 nearby open clusters (OCs) using the high-precision photometric data from Gaia Data Release 3 (Gaia DR3). We estimated the mass of member stars by using a ridge line that is better in line with the observed color–magnitude diagram, thus obtaining more accurate stellar mass and binary mass ratio (q) at the low-mass region. By analyzing the present-day mass function (PDMF) of star clusters, we found that 108 OCs follow a two-stage power-law distribution, whereas six OCs present a single power-law PDMF. Subsequently, we fitted the high(low)-mass index of PDMF ( ), denoted as αh(αl), and segmentation point mc. For our cluster sample, the median values of αh and αl are 2.65 and 0.95, respectively, which are approximately consistent with the initial mass function results provided by Kroupa. We utilized the cumulative radial number distribution of stars with different masses to quantify the degree of mass segregation. We found a significant positive correlation between the state of dynamical evolution and mass segregation in OCs. We also estimated the fraction of binary stars with q ≥ 0.5, ranging from 6% to 34% with a median of 17%. Finally, we provided a catalog of 114 nearby cluster properties, including the total mass, the binary fraction, the PDMF, and the dynamical state.

<div> VLA Imaging, THINGS, 3D-BAROLO, Milky Way, DM distribution
总结:
本研究利用VLA Imaging和THINGS选取了五个类似于银河系的星系作为样本，通过3D-BAROLO模型分析其旋转曲线，将旋转曲线分解为星体和气体的贡献并隔离暗物质成分。通过Markov Chain Monte Carlo方法推导出在这些星系中的太阳邻域的暗物质密度范围，结果与文献中银河系本地暗物质密度的数值一致。 <div>
Our current understanding of how dark matter (DM) is distributed within the Milky Way (MW) halo, particularly in the solar neighborhood, is based on either careful studies of the local stellar orbits, model assumptions on the global shape of the MW halo, or from direct acceleration measurements. In this work, we undertake a study of external galaxies, with the intent of providing insight into the DM distribution in MW-analog galaxies. For this, we carefully select a sample of galaxies similar to the MW, based on maximum atomic hydrogen (H i) rotational velocity ( km s−1) and morphological type (Sab–Sbc) criteria. With a need for deep, highly resolved H i, our resulting sample is composed of five galaxies from the VLA Imaging of Virgo in Atomic Gas (VIVA) survey and The H i Nearby Galaxy Survey (THINGS). To perform our baryonic analysis, we use deep mid-IR images at 3.6 and 4.5 μm from the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structures in Galaxies (S4G). Based on the dynamical three-dimensional modeling software 3D-Based Analysis of Rotating Objects via Line Observations (3D-BAROLO), we construct rotation curves (RCs) and derive the gas and stellar contributions from the galaxy's gaseous and stellar disks' mass surface density profiles. Through a careful decomposition of their RCs into their baryonic (stars, gas) and DM components, we isolate the DM contribution by using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo-based approach. Based on the Sun's location and the MW’s R25, we define the corresponding location of the solar neighborhood in these systems. We put forward a window for the DM density (ρdm = 0.21–0.55 GeV cm−3) at these galactocentric distances in our MW analog sample, consistent with the values found for the MW’s local DM density, based on more traditional approaches found in the literature.

<div> 关键词: 矮星系、活动星系核、AGN 选择技术、恒星质量、光谱学数据

总结: 这篇文章研究了733个矮星系中具有活动星系核的情况，并探讨了不同AGN选择技术之间的交叉点。研究采用光谱学、X射线、红外颜色和光学光变等方法来识别AGN，发现任何单一选择方法仅能捕获不超过总AGN人口的一半，并且在这一恒星质量范围内，各种AGN选择方法存在普遍不一致。最大的重叠发生在两种方法都使用光学光谱数据的情况下。相反，当比较使用不同波长光度数据的方法时，AGN的种群交叉最少。这些结果可以用来更好地约束矮星系中的活跃分数，这对于黑洞种子形成模型来说是一个重要的约束条件。在随后的论文中，我们将探索每种选择技术的有效性与宿主星系属性之间的联系。 <br /><br /> <div>
We assemble a sample of 733 dwarf galaxies (M* ≤ 109.5M⊙) with signatures of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and explore the intersection between different AGN-selection techniques. Objects in our database are compiled from previous studies that identify AGN in dwarf galaxies through spectroscopy, X-ray emission, infrared colors, and optical photometric variability. We apply a uniform set of AGN diagnostic tools to the database using archival data. We find that any single selection method captures no more than half of the overall AGN population, and there is a general disagreement among the AGN-selection methods in this stellar-mass regime. The largest overlap between methods is found when both methods use optical spectroscopic data. In contrast, the populations of AGN intersect the least when comparing those methods that use photometric data at different wavelengths. These results can be used to better constrain the active fraction in dwarf galaxies, which is in turn an important constraint for black hole seed formation models. In a follow-up paper, we will explore links between the effectiveness of each selection technique and host galaxy properties.

这篇文章探讨了在 z = 7.3 时发现的一个星系，其光学发射线不明显以及蓝色紫外光到光学连续谱比例的意外情况。作者提出了两种可能的解释：一是恒星形成历史的随机变化，二是空间上变化的尘埃衰减对测量的发射线和连续光谱性质的影响。他们指出，这两种情况可能同时发生并放大效应。研究还表明，快速变化的恒星形成模型可以产生类似的观测特性，而蓝色紫外光谱和缺乏发射线可以通过蓝+红组合光谱来解释。未来进一步的远红外观测将有助于阐明后一种情况。 
<br /><br />总结: 提出了在早期宇宙中发现的星系可能存在的两种物理解释，即恒星形成历史的随机变化和空间上变化的尘埃衰减对测量的发射线和连续光谱性质的影响。并指出进一步的观测将有助于阐明这两种可能性。 <div>
The recent discovery of a galaxy at z = 7.3 with undetected optical emission lines and a blue UV-to-optical continuum ratio in JWST spectroscopy is surprising and needs to be explained physically. Here, we explore two possibilities that could cause such a seemingly quiescent ∼5 × 108M⊙ galaxy in the early Universe: (i) stochastic variations in the star formation history (SFH) and (ii) the effect of spatially varying dust attenuation on the measured line and continuum emission properties. Both scenarios can play out at the same time to amplify the effect. A stochastic star formation model (similar to realistic SFHs from hydrodynamical simulations of similar-mass galaxies) can create such observed properties if star formation is fast-varying with a correlation time of <150 Myr given a reasonable burst amplitude of ∼0.6 dex. The total time spent in this state is less than 20 Myr, and the likelihood of such a state to occur over 500 Myr at z = 7 is ∼50% (consistent with current observations). On the other hand, we show that a spectrum with blue UV continuum and lack of emission lines can be reproduced by a blue+red composite spectrum. The UV continuum is emitted from dust-free density-bounded H ii regions (blue component), while the red component is a dust-obscured starburst with weakened emission lines due to strong differential dust attenuation between stellar and nebular emission. Future resolving far-infrared observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array will shed light on the latter scenario.

总结:<br />
本研究通过磁流体动力学模拟发现，高速氢气碰撞可以形成具有大质量和足够致密度的气体团块，这些团块经受离子化反馈后仍能保持足够的逃逸速度，促进内部高效星团形成，并最终演化为年轻巨大星团。此外，研究还发现低速气体碰撞并不会导致分子云的形成，而需要较长的时间尺度来形成年轻巨大星团，这表明了宇宙间相互作用驱动的气体碰撞可能更有利于年轻巨大星团的形成。 <div>
Young massive clusters (YMCs) are dense aggregates of young stars and are often speculated as potential precursors to globular clusters. However, the formation mechanism of massive and compact gas clumps that precede YMCs remains unknown. In this paper, we study the formation of such massive clumps via fast H i gas collisions (∼100 km s−1) as suggested by recent observations and their subsequent evolution into YMCs by using three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics simulations involving self-gravity and detailed thermal/chemical processes. In particular, the impact of ionization feedback from stellar radiation is included in an approximate fashion where the temperature within the H ii regions is elevated to 10,000 K, while supernova feedback is not included. We examine whether the resulting massive clumps can survive this ionization feedback and evolve into YMCs. Our simulations reveal the emergence of gas clumps that not only possess substantial mass (∼105M⊙) but also sufficient compactness (∼5 pc). Notably, these clumps exhibit significantly higher escape velocities compared to the sound speed of the H ii region, indicating effective gravitational retention of gas against feedback-induced evaporation. Consequently, these conditions foster efficient star formation within the massive gas clumps, ultimately leading to their evolution into YMCs. We also perform simulations involving lower-velocity gas collisions, approximately 15 km s−1, typical shock velocities induced by galactic superbubbles. In contrast to the high-velocity collisions, we find that molecular cloud formation does not occur in the case of 1 cm−3 gas collision, while YMC formation is observed in the presence of denser gas of 10 cm−3. However, the formation of YMCs requires compression periods exceeding 10 Myr in these cases, indicating a potential preference for gas collisions driven by intergalactic interactions rather than galactic superbubbles for YMC formation.

<div> Magnetohydrodynamic Turbulence, Stokes Parameters, Synchrotron Polarization Analysis, Plasma Modes, Statistical Properties
<br /><br />总结:
本文提出了一种通过系统性分析Stokes参数的统计特性来识别等离子体模式的方法。研究在理论上从MHD湍流的基本统计出发，通过对MHD模式的投影来识别在合成的同步辐射偏振观测中占主导能量分数的模式。通过3D理想MHD模拟获得合成同步辐射偏振观测，提出了一种修改后的模式识别方法，并建立了一种基于新的SPA+拟合过程的分类标准来区分Alfvén模式和可压缩/慢模式主导的湍流。还提出了一种通过分析SPA+特征的不对称性来识别快模式的方法，并建立了一种新的不对称参数来检测快模式湍流的存在。另外，通过数值测试证实了对可压缩和快模式的识别不受前景和发射等离子体中法拉第旋转的影响。 <div>
One of the biggest challenges in understanding magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence is identifying the plasma mode components from observational data. Previous studies on synchrotron polarization from the interstellar medium (ISM) suggest that the dominant MHD modes can be identified via statistics of Stokes parameters, which would be crucial for studying various ISM processes such as the scattering and acceleration of cosmic rays, star formation, and dynamo. In this paper, we present a numerical study of the synchrotron polarization analysis (SPA) method through systematic investigation of the statistical properties of the Stokes parameters. We derive the theoretical basis for our method from the fundamental statistics of MHD turbulence, recognizing that the projection of the MHD modes allows us to identify the modes dominating the energy fraction from synchrotron observations. Based on the discovery, we revise the SPA method using synthetic synchrotron polarization observations obtained from 3D ideal MHD simulations with a wide range of plasma parameters and driving mechanisms, and present a modified recipe for mode identification. We propose a classification criterion based on a new SPA+ fitting procedure, which allows us to distinguish between Alfvén mode and compressible/slow mode dominated turbulence. We further propose a new method to identify fast modes by analyzing the asymmetry of the SPA+ signature and establish a new asymmetry parameter to detect the presence of fast mode turbulence. Additionally, we confirm through numerical tests that the identification of the compressible and fast modes is not affected by Faraday rotation in both the emitting plasma and the foreground.

<div> Sgr A*, multiwavelength campaign, flaring events, periodicity feature, synchrotron hotspot, adiabatically expanding

总结:
Sgr A*在2019年7月的多波段观测中表现出多个耀斑事件，包括在Spitzer光度曲线中检测到的瞬态35分钟周期性特征，以及Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array光度曲线中检测到的时滞辐射。这暗示了一个在稳定轨道上的热点。同时，还观察到了X射线耀斑导致亚毫米光度曲线的通量减少，以及通过模拟表明这个特征是由绕着一个半径为0.55RS的等离子体产生的，这个等离子体通过130高斯的磁场扩张速度为光速的0.6%。最后，在红外、亚毫米和射电波段观察到了一个明显的耀斑，证实了这种变化与这些波段的辐射是内在相关的。在射电和亚毫米光度曲线拟合中发现，这是由具有电子谱p=0.59、187高斯磁场和半径0.47RS的等离子体齐次膨胀的系切辐射热点产生，扩张速度为0.029c。这些结果表明，辐射的变化演化在亚毫米和红外波长中涉及了辐射和绝热冷却过程。 <div>
We report on the final two days of a multiwavelength campaign of Sgr A* observing in the radio, submillimeter, infrared (IR), and X-ray bands in 2019 July. Sgr A* was remarkably active, showing multiple flaring events across the electromagnetic spectrum. We detect a transient ∼35 minute periodicity feature in Spitzer light curves on 2019 July 21. Time-delayed emission was detected in Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array light curves, suggesting a hotspot within the accretion flow on a stable orbit. On the same night, we observe a decreased flux in the submillimeter light curve following an X-ray flare detected by Chandra, and we model the feature with an adiabatically expanding synchrotron hotspot occulting the accretion flow. The event is produced by a plasma 0.55 RS in radius with an electron spectrum p = 2.84. It is threaded by a ∼130 Gauss magnetic field and expands at 0.6% the speed of light. Finally, we reveal an unambiguous flare in the IR, submillimeter, and radio, demonstrating that the variable emission is intrinsically linked. We jointly fit the radio and submillimeter light curves using an adiabatically expanding synchrotron hotspot and find it is produced by a plasma with an electron spectrum p = 0.59, 187 Gauss magnetic field, and radius 0.47 RS that expands at 0.029c. In both cases, the uncertainty in the appropriate lower and upper electron energy bounds may inflate the derived equipartition field strengths by a factor of 2 or more. Our results confirm that both synchrotron- and adiabatic-cooling processes are involved in the variable emission’s evolution at submillimeter and IR wavelengths.

The Cassini spacecraft detected a soup of organics in the plume of Saturn’s moon Enceladus. Those compounds could provide building blocks for the potential emergence or sustenance of microbial life in Enceladus’ subsurface ocean. However, the sources and stabilities of organics in Enceladus’ ocean are still poorly understood. Here, we perform nonequilibrium thermodynamic calculations to assess the energetics of abiotic synthesis for a broad spectrum of small organic molecules under both cold oceanic and hydrothermal conditions on Enceladus. Most of the organics that we studied are thermodynamically favorable to synthesize at micromolal dissolved concentrations over wide ranges of pH (8.5–11) and redox conditions. This suggests that many of the organic compounds detected by Cassini may be derived from reactions of CO2 and H2. However, some widely assumed precursors of biomolecules, such as formaldehyde, hydrogen cyanide, and acetylene, are found to be unstable and therefore unfavorable to be synthesized. We found that higher temperatures also seem to favor the synthesis of organic species under Enceladus hydrothermal conditions. Detection of thermodynamically unstable species in the plume might reflect artifacts introduced during high-speed spacecraft flybys and/or active synthesis via degradation of primordial chondritic organics, or biological activities.

In the context of modeling spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for blazars, we extend the method that uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to include external inverse Compton processes. The model assumes that relativistic electrons within the emitting region can interact with and up-scatter external photons originating from the accretion disk, the broad-line region, and the torus, to produce the observed high-energy emission. We trained the CNN on a numerical model that accounts for the injection of electrons, their self-consistent cooling, and pair creation-annihilation processes, considering both internal and all external photon fields. Despite the larger number of parameters compared to the synchrotron self-Compton model and the greater diversity in spectral shapes, the CNN enables an accurate computation of the SED for a specified set of parameters. The performance of the CNN is demonstrated by fitting the SED of two flat-spectrum radio quasars, namely 3C 454.3 and CTA 102, and obtaining their parameter posterior distributions. For the first source, the available data in the low-energy band allowed us to constrain the minimum Lorentz factor of the electrons, , while for the second source, due to the lack of these data, was set. We used the obtained parameters to investigate the energetics of the system. The model developed here, along with one from Bégué et al., enables self-consistent, in-depth modeling of blazar broadband emissions within a leptonic scenario.

The spin of dark halos has been shown to significantly affect bar formation and evolution in disk galaxies. To understand the physical role of halo spin in bar formation, we run N-body simulations of isolated, Milky Way–sized galaxies by varying the halo spin parameter in the range −0.16 ≤ λ ≤ 0.16 and the bulge mass. We find that our adopted halo alone is subject to swing amplification of an m = 2 nonaxisymmetric mode rotating in the same sense as the halo, which assists or inhibits the bar formation in a disk depending on its sense of rotation. The m = 2 mode in the disk, growing via swing amplification, interacts constructively (destructively) with the m = 2 mode in the prograde (retrograde) halo, promoting (delaying) bar formation. A bar grows by losing its angular momentum primarily to a halo. Since the halo particles inside (outside) the corotation resonance with the bar can emit (absorb) angular momentum to (from) the bar, the bar pattern speed decays more slowly for larger λ > 0, while it decreases relatively fast almost independent of λ ≤ 0. Models with a strong bar develop a boxy peanut-shaped bulge. In models without a bulge, this occurs rapidly via buckling instability, while bars with a bulge thicken gradually without undergoing buckling instability. Among the models considered in the present work, the bar in the λ = 0.06 model with a bulge of 10% of the disk mass best describes the Milky Way in terms of its length and pattern speed.

<div> 冷水排放，原行星盘模型，Herschel Space Observatory 数据，氧气丰度，光解吸附作用
总结：<br /><br />研究重新审视了Herschel Space Observatory数据提供的限制条件，关于原行星盘中的冷水排放。以往的盘模型根据观测到的水排放得出结论，如果假设盘采用标准的星际气尘质量比，氧气就至少减少了两个数量级。在这项研究中，我们使用了最近的盘参数调查中的模型结果，并展示了对冷水的Herschel约束大多可以通过采用类似于星际介质的氧元素丰度（即O/H = 3.2×10^-4）和规范的气尘质量比100的盘模型来解释。我们发现，冷水蒸气主要是通过在分子层和中面之间的界面处水冰的光解吸附形成的，其排放与盘的主要性质如盘气体质量和气尘质量比相对独立。我们发现外盘区域中水蒸气的丰度是由光过程决定的，并且取决于需要减弱远紫外线光子通量的水冰的（恒定）垂直柱密度，结果导致了我们调查中变化的参数（气体质量，尘埃质量，盘半径）产生了大致恒定的排放。重要的是，水线排放发现是光学浓密的，因此对温度的敏感性高于丰度，可能推动了先前对大规模氧减少的推断。 <div>
We reexamine the constraints provided by Herschel Space Observatory data regarding cold water emission from protoplanetary disks. Previous disk models that were used to interpret observed water emission concluded that oxygen (O/H) is depleted by at least 2 orders of magnitude if a standard, interstellar gas/dust mass ratio is assumed in the disk. In this work, we use model results from a recent disk parameter survey and show that most of the Herschel constraints obtained for cold water (i.e., for transitions with an upper energy level Eup < 200 K, where the bulk of the disk water lies) can be explained with disk models adopting interstellar medium-like oxygen elemental abundance (i.e., O/H = 3.2 × 10−4) and the canonical gas/dust mass ratio of 100. We show that cold water vapor is mainly formed by photodesorption of water ice at the interface between the molecular layer and the midplane, and that its emission is relatively independent of the main disk properties like the disk gas mass and gas/dust mass ratio. We find that the abundance of water vapor in the outer disk is set by photoprocesses and depends on the (constant) vertical column density of water ice needed to attenuate the far-ultraviolet photon flux, resulting in roughly constant emission for the parameters (gas mass, dust mass, disk radius) varied in our survey. Importantly, water line emission is found to be optically thick and hence sensitive to temperature more than abundance, possibly driving previous inferences of large-scale oxygen depletion.

Globular clusters contain vast repositories of metal-poor stars that represent some of the oldest stellar generations in the Universe. The archaeological footprint of early Galactic evolution may be retained in the measurable properties of globular clusters, such as their ages, mass functions, and chemical abundances. Until recently, all photometric studies of globular clusters were restricted to stellar members. Now, the sensitivity of JWST can extend this analysis to the substellar regime. If detected in sufficient numbers, brown dwarf members can provide tight constraints on the properties of their parent population. We present SANDee—a new grid of stellar models that accurately represent the color–magnitude diagrams of globular clusters across the hydrogen-burning limit at a wide range of metallicities. Using JWST NIRCam photometry and the new models, we identify three brown dwarfs in the globular cluster NGC 6397 with Teff = 1300–1800 K, confirmed by both proper motion and model fitting. We use the observed luminosities of discovered brown dwarfs to obtain the first age estimate of a globular cluster from its substellar cooling sequence: 13.4 ± 3.3 Gyr. We also derive the local mass function of the cluster across the hydrogen-burning limit and find it to be top heavy, suggesting extensive dynamical evolution. We expect that the constraints on both age and mass function of NGC 6397 derived in this work can be greatly improved by a second epoch of NIRCam imaging in the same field.

<div> gravitational-wave, multimessenger astrophysics, neutron star mergers, accretion disk, numerical relativity/MHD simulation

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章介绍了GW170817/AT2017gfo的探测开创了多信使天体物理学的时代，其中引力波和多波段光子观测相互补充，为我们提供了对天体系统独特的见解。文章探讨了中子星合并所产生的光子现象，重点是残留的黑洞或大质量中子星周围的少量物质对这一现象的影响。研究使用了数值相对论/MHD模拟的数据，展示了非轴对称动态时空中产生的引力力量如何在形成束缚碎片盘的初始结构中起到作用。在新星它反常塌缩成黑洞的过程中，由流体力学产生的工作量大约是由于时间相关引力产生的10倍。同时发现碎片盘的初始角动量分布在合并中子星外层的角动量附近呈现出尖锐的峰值，这一现象的调控机制也得到了确认。 <div>
The detection of GW170817/AT2017gfo inaugurated an era of multimessenger astrophysics, in which gravitational-wave and multiwavelength photon observations complement one another to provide unique insight into astrophysical systems. A broad theoretical consensus exists, in which the photon phenomenology of neutron star mergers largely rests upon the evolution of the small amount of matter left on bound orbits around the black hole or massive neutron star remaining after the merger. Because this accretion disk is far from inflow equilibrium, its subsequent evolution depends very strongly on its initial state, yet very little is known about how this state is determined. Using both snapshot and tracer particle data from a numerical relativity/MHD simulation of an equal-mass neutron star merger that collapses to a black hole, we show how gravitational forces arising in a nonaxisymmetric, dynamical spacetime supplement hydrodynamical effects in shaping the initial structure of the bound debris disk. The work done by hydrodynamical forces is ∼10 times greater than that due to time-dependent gravity. Although gravitational torques prior to remnant relaxation are an order of magnitude larger than hydrodynamical torques, their intrinsic sign symmetry leads to strong cancellation; as a result, hydrodynamical and gravitational torques have a comparable effect. We also show that the debris disk’s initial specific angular momentum distribution is sharply peaked at roughly the specific angular momentum of the merged neutron star’s outer layers, a few rgc, and identify the regulating mechanism.

<div> 二进制系统、质量流失速率、质量传输、大气层结构、三维性质
总结:
本文提出了一种获取双星系统中质量传输（MT）开始阶段快速质量流失速率的方法。该方法统一了大气层（下溢）和L1流（溢出）的质量速率，利用了双星系统的平均三维属性，例如有效双星势和有效双星加速度，来使赠体演化并获取L1平面上的物质性质。对于下溢情况，我们获得了大气层结构。我们的方法适用于质量比0.01≤q≤100范围广泛的双星系统，并且也适用于热赠体。考虑到的例子表明，用这种修正的形式主义获得的质量传输速率总是不同于在计算双星演化过程中广泛使用的光学薄和光学厚质量传输速率。 <div>
We present a method to obtain rapid mass-loss rates in binary systems, specifically at the onset of mass transfer (MT) episodes. The method unifies atmospheric (underflow) and L1 stream (overflow) mass rates in a single continuous procedure. The method uses averaged 3D properties of the binaries, such as effective binary potential and effective binary acceleration, to both evolve the donor and obtain properties of the matter at the L1 plane. In the case of underflow, we obtain atmospheric stratification. Our method can be used for binaries with an extensive range of mass ratios, 0.01 ≤ q ≤ 100, and can also be applied to hot donors. The considered examples show that the MT rates obtained with this revised formalism always differ from the optically thin and optically thick MT rates widely used during the computations of binary evolution.

这篇文章研究了在大量的潮汐撕裂事件中发现的晚期（几百到一千天后）射电闪耀。研究人员提出，如果在邦迪半径外部密度分布呈平坦趋势，则这些晚期射电闪耀是一种自然结果。在邦迪半径处，流出是对准自吸收而光学薄的（在几GHz以上）。随着更多物质的被带走，射电辐射上升呈asymptotically ∝ t3，直到流出开始减速。检测到这种上升并且晚期达到最大值，则可以限制黑洞质量、射电流出质量和能量。研究人员表明，这种模型可以合理拟合一些观测到的光变曲线，从而得出黑洞和流出质量的合理估计。他们还发现邦迪半径内的密度剖面斜率决定了是否存在早期（约102天）的射电峰值。 <br /><br />总结:  这项研究发现在大量的潮汐撕裂事件中，晚期射电闪耀现象并不罕见，提出了与周围密度分布及黑洞质量相关的模型，以合理估计射电流出的质量和能量。 <div>
Radio monitoring unveiled late (hundreds to a thousand days) radio flares in a significant fraction of tidal disruption events. We propose that these late-time radio flares are a natural outcome if the surrounding density profile flattens outside the Bondi radius. At the Bondi radius, the outflow is optically thin (above a few GHz) to synchrotron self-absorption. As more and more material is swept up, the radio emission rises asymptotically as ∝ t3 until the outflow begins to decelerate. A detection of such a rise and a late-time maximum constrains the black hole mass and the mass and energy of the radio-emitting outflow. We show that this model can give reasonable fits to some observed light curves, leading to reasonable estimates of the black hole and outflow masses. We also find that the slope of the density profile within the Bondi radius determines whether an early-time (∼102 days) radio peak exists.

We present Keck Cosmic Web Imager integral field observations of extended Lyα emission in the circumgalactic medium of 27 typical star-forming galaxies at z ∼ 2, drawn from the Multi-Object Spectrometer for Infra-Red Exploration (MOSFIRE) Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) survey. Using composite spectra in two bins of star formation rate (SFR), star formation rate surface density (ΣSFR), and other galactic properties, we measure spatial variations in the Lyα profile across three regions in the Lyα halo. We find single-peaked, redshifted profiles are ubiquitous within a central 7 kpc radius region. Further out in the halo (7–14 and 14–21 kpc), the Lyα profile of the resonantly scattered emission exhibits more diversity, either transitioning to a double-peaked profile or remaining single peaked across the halo. We find a shorter scale length of the Lyα halo surface brightness profile for composite halos with faster winds. The composites have a similar average inclination, suggesting those with faster winds clear channels in the interstellar medium (ISM), reducing the fraction of Lyα photons resonantly scattered to large radii. A uniform expanding shell radiative transfer model reproduces the shape but not the normalization of the observed double-peaked Lyα profiles. Models that adopt a more realistic, clumpy ISM are likely needed to reproduce both the shape and normalization of the Lyα profiles.

<title>Photometry of Saturated Stars with Neural Networks</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We use a multilevel perceptron (MLP) neural network to obtain photometry of saturated stars in the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN). The MLP can obtain fairly unbiased photometry for stars from g ≃ 4 to 14 mag, particularly compared to the dispersion (15%–85% 1σ range around the median) of 0.12 mag for saturated (g < 11.5 mag) stars. More importantly, the light curve of a nonvariable saturated star has a median dispersion of only 0.037 mag. The MLP light curves are, in many cases, spectacularly better than those provided by the standard ASAS-SN pipelines. While the network was trained on g-band data from only one of ASAS-SN’s 20 cameras, initial experiments suggest that it can be used for any camera and the older ASAS-SN V-band data as well. The dominant problems seem to be associated with correctable issues in the ASAS-SN data reduction pipeline for saturated stars more than the MLP itself. The method is publicly available as a light-curve option on ASAS-SN Sky Patrol v1.0.

<title>A Surprising Excess of Radio Emission in Extremely Stable Quasars: A Unique Clue to Jet Launching?</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad5a0c</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Quasars are generally divided into jetted radio-loud and nonjetted radio-quiet ones, but why only 10% of quasars are radio-loud has been puzzling for decades. Other than jet-induced phenomena, black hole mass, or Eddington ratio, a prominent difference between jetted and nonjetted quasars has scarcely been detected. Here we show a unique distinction between them, and the mystery of jet launching could be disclosed by a prominent excess of radio emission in extremely stable quasars (ESQs; i.e., type 1 quasars with extremely weak variability in UV/optical over 10 yr). Specifically, we find that >25% of the ESQs are detected by the FIRST/VLASS radio survey, while only ∼6%–8% of the control sample, matched in redshift, luminosity, and Eddington ratio, are radio-detected. The excess of radio detection in ESQs has a significance of 4.4σ (99.9995%) and predominantly occurs at intermediate radio loudness with R ∼ 10–60. The radio detection fraction of ESQs also tends to increase in the ESQ samples selected with more stringent thresholds. Our results are in contrast to the common view that radio-loud quasars are likely more variable in UV/optical due to jet contribution. New clues/challenges posed by our findings highlight the importance of extensive follow-up observations to probe the nature of jets in ESQs and theoretical studies on the link between jet launching and ESQs. Moreover, our results make ESQs, an essential population that has never been explored, unique targets in the burgeoning era of time domain astronomy, like their opposite counterparts of quasars exhibiting extreme variability or changing-look features.

<title>The Relation between Variances of 3D Density and Its 2D Column Density Revisited</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We revisit the relation between the variance of three-dimensional (3D) density ( ) and that of the projected two-dimensional (2D) column density ( ) in turbulent media, which is of great importance in obtaining turbulence properties from observations. Earlier studies showed that , where Σ/Σ0 and ρ/ρ0 are 2D column and 3D volume densities normalized by their mean values, respectively. The factor depends only on the density spectrum for isotropic turbulence in a cloud that has similar dimensions along and perpendicular to the line of sight. Our major findings in this paper are as follows. First, we show that the factor can be expressed in terms of N, the number of independent eddies along the line of sight. To be specific, is proportional to ∼1/N due to the averaging effect arising from independent eddies along the line of sight. Second, we show that the factor needs to be modified if the dimension of the cloud in the line-of-sight direction is different from that in the perpendicular direction. However, if we express in terms of N, the expression remains same even in the case the cloud has different dimensions along and perpendicular to the line of sight. Third, when we plot against , two quantities roughly lie on a single curve regardless of the sonic Mach number, which implies that we can directly obtain the latter from the former. We discuss observational implications of our findings.

<title>Modeling Transition Region Hot Loops on the Sun: The Necessity of Rapid, Complex Spatiotemporal Heating and Nonequilibrium Ionization</title>

The study examines the heating profile of hot solar transition region loops, particularly focusing on transient brightenings observed in IRIS 1400 Å slit-jaw images. The findings challenge the adequacy of simplistic, singular heating mechanisms, revealing that the heating is temporally impulsive and requires a spatially complex profile with multiple heating scales. A forward-modeling code is utilized to generate synthetic Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) emission spectra of these loops based on HYDRAD model output, confirming that emitting ions are out of equilibrium. The modeling further indicates that density-dependent dielectronic recombination rates must be included to reproduce the observed line ratios. Collectively, this evidence substantiates that the loops are subject to impulsive heating and that the components of the transiently brightened plasma are driven far from thermal equilibrium. Heating events such as these are ubiquitous in the transition region, and the analysis described above provides a robust observational diagnostic tool for characterizing the plasma.

<title>An Alternative Channel to Black Hole Low-mass X-Ray Binaries: Dynamical Friction of Dark Matter?</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad5be0</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Both the anomalous magnetic braking of Ap/Bp stars and the surrounding circumbinary disk models can account for the formation of black hole (BH) low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), while the simulated effective temperatures of the donor stars are significantly higher than the observed values. Therefore, the formation of BH LMXBs is still not completely understood. In this work, we diagnose whether the dynamical friction between dark matter and the companion stars can drive BH binaries to evolve toward the observed BH LMXBs and alleviate the effective temperature problem. Assuming that there exists a density spike of dark matter around BH, the dynamical friction can produce an efficient angular momentum loss, driving BH binaries with an intermediate-mass companion star to evolve into BH LMXBs for a spike index higher than γ = 1.58. Our detailed stellar evolution models show that the calculated effective temperatures can match the observed value of most BH LMXBs for a spike index range of γ = 1.7–2.1. However, the simulated mass-transfer rates when γ = 2.0 and 2.1 are too high to be consistent with the observed properties showing that BH LMXBs appear as soft X-ray transients. Therefore, the dynamical friction of dark matter can only alleviate the effective temperature problem of those BH LMXBs with a relatively short orbital period.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present optical photometry for the afterglow of GRB 221009A, in some respects the most extraordinary gamma-ray burst (GRB) ever observed. Good quality in the R-band light curve is obtained, covering 0.32–19.57 days since the Fermi-Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor trigger. We find that a weak bump emerges from the declining afterglow at t ≈ 11 days; a supernova (SN) may be responsible. We use a smooth broken power-law and 56Ni model to fit the light curve. The best-fitting results reveal that the SN ejected a total mass of Mej = 3.70 M⊙, a 56Ni mass of MNi = 0.23 M⊙, and a kinetic energy of . We also compare GRB 221009A with other GRB–SN events based on a GRB-associated SN sample and find that only SN 2003lw and SN 2011kl can be obviously revealed in the afterglow of GRB 221009A by setting these objects at its distance. This suggests that a supernova (SN 2022xiw) is possibly obscured by the brighter afterglow emission from GRB 221009A.

<title>Spectra of GRB 221009A at Low Energies Derived from Ground-based Very Low-frequency Measurements</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The gamma-ray burst (GRB) event GRB 221009A was the brightest event that has ever been detected to date. Owing to its unexpected brightness, the temporal and/or spectral information of the prompt emission cannot be accurately measured by many satellites (with the only exception of GECAM-C), since they suffered from significant pulse pileup and data saturation effects. Similarly, the X45 solar flare event occurring on 2003 November 4 saturated space-borne X-ray detectors, and it was through ground-based measurements of very low-frequency (VLF) signals that the magnitude of this event was determined, since VLF signals are particularly sensitive to the disturbance on the D-region ionosphere caused by low-energy photons. Therefore, in this study, we first report measurements of VLF signals from the JJI and VTX transmitter as recorded in Shiyan, China, when GRB 221009A occurred. The amplitude change was ∼1.25 and ∼2.31 dB for the JJI and VTX transmitter, respectively. Using a suite of well-validated models, we have further simulated the influence on the D-region ionosphere induced by low-energy photons (<100 keV) of GRB 221009A. Compared with the pre-GRB condition, the electron density was enhanced by 39.75% and 626.61% at 60 and 70 km altitude for the VTX-SYS path and 39.73% and 621.11% at 60 and 70 km altitude for the JJI-SYS path, respectively, with the altitude of notable electron density change being as low as ∼30 km. Moreover, we have compared modeling results of VLF signal change with our measurements during GRB 221009A. The good agreements obtained in terms of amplitude change and overall trend validate the fluxes and spectra of GRB 221009A at low energies (<20 keV) as measured by GECAM-C.

<title>On the Magnetic Braking Law in Black Hole Low-mass X-Ray Binaries</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Magnetic braking (MB) plays an important role in the evolution of close low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). It is also essential to the formation of ultracompact X-ray binaries (UCXBs). There have been lively investigations on the MB mechanism(s) in both single stars and close binaries including cataclysmic variables and neutron star (NS) LMXBs but with diverse conclusions. In this paper we explore the effect of MB on the black hole (BH) LMXB evolution. We combine binary population synthesis with detailed binary evolution to obtain the expected properties of the Galactic BH LMXB population. The simulated results are compared with the observational data including the BH mass, companion mass, companion temperature, orbital period, and mean accretion rate. Our results reveal that the MB laws with relatively low efficiency (i.e., RM12 and RVJ83) exhibit better agreement with observations, contrary to what was found for NS LMXBs. This raises the interesting question about whether MB really follows the same unified law in different types of binaries. We also predict that only a very small fraction (≲2.5%) of BH LMXBs can evolve to be UCXBs. This explains why no BH UCXB has been discovered so far.

We performed an analysis of the extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) wave event on 2022 March 31. The event originated from active region (AR) 12975 located at N13W52 in the field of view of the Atmospheric imaging Assembly (AIA) and exactly at the west limb viewed by the EUV Imager (EUVI) of the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory-Ahead (STEREO-A) satellite. The EUV wave was associated with an M9.6 class flare. The event was also well observed by Mauna Loa Solar Observatory and COR1 coronagraphs. We revealed here evident coexistence of two components of EUV waves in AIA as well as in EUVI images, i.e., a fast-mode wave and a nonwave, which was predicted by the EUV wave hybrid model. The speeds of the fast-mode and nonwave EUV wave components in AIA vary from ∼430 to 658 km s−1 and ∼157 to 205 km s−1, respectively. The computed speeds in STEREO-A for the fast-mode wave and nonwave components are ∼520 and ∼152 km s−1, respectively. Another wave emanated from the source AR and interacted with ambient coronal loops, showing evident reflection in the EUV images above the solar limb. The speed of the reflected wave in the plane of the sky is ∼175 km s−1. With the precise alignments, we found that the fast-mode EUV wave is just ahead of the coronal mass ejection (CME), and the nonwave component is cospatial with the frontal loop of the accompanied CME. The event also showed stationary fronts.

总结: 
本研究利用高分辨率的Jansky Very Large Array (VLA)观测和存档的射电调查，研究了28个椭球形后并合星系的射电特性。在样本中检测到18个射电源，发现了射电发射的普遍缺乏(sub)kiloparsec尺度的延伸辐射，表明这些后并合星系中存在大量紧凑的核心射电发射，其中大多数(16/18; 89%)呈现为低亮度。通过多波段数据，确定了射电发射的来源，发现了15个新的射电AGNs和三个射电源可能与星形(SF)过程相关。几乎所有的射电AGNs都是低亮度的(13/15; 87%)，与相对论喷流起源不符。研究了一个新的双重AGN(DAGN)候选者J1511+0417，并调查了DAGN候选者J0843+3549的射电特性。其中五个射电AGNs寄主于SF或SF-AGN复合发射线星系，表明射电AGN活动可能存在于后并合星系中的SF活动期间。这些射电AGNs的低功率喷流和紧凑形态也指向了一个情景，即AGN反馈可能在这些后并合星系中是高效的。最后，我们提出对这15个射电AGNs进行模拟多频率观测，利用Very Long Baseline Array和Next-Generation VLA的非常长基线干涉能力，以评估这些仪器在寻找超大质量黑洞双星方面的可行性。 <div>
Post-merger galaxies are unique laboratories to study the triggering and interplay of star formation and active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity. Combining new, high-resolution Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observations with archival radio surveys, we have examined the radio properties of 28 spheroidal post-merger galaxies. We detect 18 radio sources in our post-merger sample and find a general lack of extended emission at (sub)kiloparsec scales, indicating the prevalence of compact, nuclear radio emission in these post-merger galaxies, with the majority (16/18; 89%) characterized as low luminosity. Using multiwavelength data, we determine the origin of the radio emission, discovering 15 new radio AGNs and three radio sources likely associated with star-forming (SF) processes. Among the radio AGNs, almost all are low luminosity (13/15; 87%), inconsistent with a relativistic jet origin. We discover a new dual AGN (DAGN) candidate, J1511+0417, and investigate the radio properties of the DAGN candidate J0843+3549. Five of these radio AGNs are hosted by a SF or SF-AGN composite emission-line galaxy, suggesting that radio AGN activity may be present during periods of SF activity in post-mergers. The low-power jets and compact morphologies of these radio AGNs also point to a scenario in which AGN feedback may be efficient in this sample of post-mergers. Lastly, we present simulated, multifrequency observations of the 15 radio AGNs with the Very Long Baseline Array and the very-long-baseline interferometry capabilities of the Next-Generation VLA to assess the feasibility of these instruments in searches for supermassive black hole binaries.

<div> JWST, NIRSpec, MACS J1149.5+2223, redshift, metallicity<br />
在这篇文章中，研究人员使用JWST NIRSpec对MACS J1149.5+2223的视线进行了深入观测，并报告了在3 < z < 9.1范围内28个源的光谱红移，其中包括检测到9个源的辐射线。他们观察到恒星质量与金属丰度之间存在正相关关系，但存在着大约0.5 dex的偏离。此外，他们还发现金属丰度存在大约0.3 dex的散布，这一散布随着红移增加而增加。他们认为这可能是由于金属丰度的富集过程具有更高的随机性导致的，可能是由于较浅的潜在井、更强烈的反馈过程和更高的星系并合率。研究人员还就JWST的Micro-Shutter Assembly观测的局限性进行了调查，并提醒在目标超出狭缝尺寸时需要谨慎，因为这种情况可能导致对全局金属丰度的过高估计，尤其是在存在强烈负金属丰度梯度的情况下。 <br /><br />总结: 本研究报道了JWST NIRSpec对MACS J1149.5+2223进行的深入观测，发现在3 < z < 9.1范围内28个源的光谱红移，并探讨了恒星质量与金属丰度之间的相关性以及金属丰度的散布情况，还对JWST观测的局限性进行了调查。 <div>
We present deep JWST NIRSpec observations in the sight line of MACS J1149.5+2223, a massive cluster of galaxies at z = 0.54. We report the spectroscopic redshift of 28 sources at 3 < z < 9.1, including nine sources with the detection of the auroral line. Combining these with 16 -detected sources from publicly available JWST data, our sample consists of 25 galaxies with robust gas-phase metallicity measurements via the direct method. We observe a positive correlation between stellar mass and metallicity, with an ∼0.5 dex offset down below the local relation. Interestingly, we find a larger-than-expected scatter of ∼0.3 dex around the relation, which cannot be explained by redshift evolution among our sample or other third parameters. The scatter increases at higher redshift, and we tentatively attribute this to the enrichment process having higher stochasticity, due to shallower potential wells, more intense feedback processes, and a higher galaxy merger rate. Despite reaching a considerably low-mass regime ( ), our samples have metallicity of +12 ≳ 7, i.e., comparable to the most metal-poor galaxies in the local Universe. The search for primordial galaxies may be accomplished by extending toward a lower mass and/or by investigating inhomogeneities at smaller spatial scales. Lastly, we investigate potential systematics caused by the limitation of JWST’s Micro-Shutter Assembly observations. Caution is warranted when the target exceeds the slit size, as this situation could allow an overestimation of global metallicity, especially under the presence of a strong negative metallicity gradient.

这项研究通过在谐波域中加权平均联合利用CLASS 40 GHz和WMAP Q波段数据获得了灵敏度改进的40 GHz极化图。通过从WMAP Q波段获取精确的大尺度测量和CLASS 40 GHz波段在中间尺度上的高灵敏度信息，将在地图空间中的噪声水平在ℓ ∈ [30, 100]范围内降低了2-3倍。利用WMAP K波段和合并地图的像素域分析极化同步辐射谱指数(βs)，显示出比使用WMAP K和Ka波段进行的结果更强的空间变化偏好(对于均匀βs假设的超过概率小于0.001)。合并地图的交叉功率谱与其他低频数据表现出相同的趋势，并通过模拟验证表明合并方法引入的偏差可忽略不计(在功率谱中的百分比级别)。这项工作的成果已经在LAMBDA上公开提供(https://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/class/class_prod_table.html)。<br /><br />总结: 通过合并CLASS 40 GHz和WMAP Q波段数据，得到了灵敏度改进的40 GHz极化图，大大降低了在中等尺度上的噪声水平。同时，利用像素域分析展示了更强的空间变化偏好，合并地图的交叉功率谱与其他低频数据表现出相同的趋势，并且通过模拟验证了合并方法的可靠性。 <div>
Improved polarization measurements at frequencies below 70 GHz with degree-level angular resolution are crucial for advancing our understanding of the Galactic synchrotron radiation and the potential polarized anomalous microwave emission and ultimately benefiting the detection of primordial B modes. In this study, we present sensitivity-improved 40 GHz polarization maps obtained by combining the CLASS 40 GHz and Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Q-band data through a weighted average in the harmonic domain. The decision to include WMAP Q-band data stems from similarities in the bandpasses. Leveraging the accurate large-scale measurements from the WMAP Q band and the high-sensitivity information from the CLASS 40 GHz band at intermediate scales, the noise level at ℓ ∈ [30, 100] is reduced by a factor of 2–3 in the map space. A pixel domain analysis of the polarized synchrotron spectral index (βs) using the WMAP K band and the combined maps (mean and 16th/84th percentiles across the βs map: ) reveals a stronger preference for spatial variation (probability to exceed for a uniform βs hypothesis smaller than 0.001) than the results obtained using WMAP K and Ka bands ( ). The cross-power spectra of the combined maps follow the same trend as other low-frequency data, and validation through simulations indicates negligible bias introduced by the combination method (subpercent level in the power spectra). The products of this work are publicly available on LAMBDA (https://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/class/class_prod_table.html).

<title>Star Formation, Nebulae, and Active Galactic Nuclei in CLASH Brightest Cluster Galaxies. I. Dependence on Core Entropy of Intracluster Medium</title>

<div> 星系聚集、亮度最高星系、星形成、发射线星云、活跃星系核<br />
总结:<br />
这篇文章主要是关于对于星系聚集中心的亮度最高星系（BCGs）的星系形成、发射线星云和活跃星系核（AGN）与星系聚集介质（ICM）的热力学关系的重新评估。作者在CLASH计划中对25个星系聚集进行了观测，并且研究了它们的BCGs的属性以及ICM的热力学特性。他们发现，BCGs的星系形成和星云的存在与ICM的“过剩核熵”K0有关，而不是与熵值地板有关。并且发现ICM熵越低，BCGs越有可能显示星系形成、星云和更具辐射亮的AGNs。几乎所有的BCGs都有检测到的AGNs，这表明它们的供能路径有多种。 <div>
We set the stage for reassessing how star formation, emission-line nebulae, and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) depend on the thermodynamics of the intracluster medium (ICM). Our work is based on the 25 clusters observed in the CLASH program for which the aforementioned attributes in their BCGs can be well scrutinized, as has the thermodynamics of their ICM. Nine of these BCGs display complex UV morphologies tracing recent star formation, whereas the remaining 16 are characterized by a relatively compact central UV enhancement. Here, we show definitively that three of the latter BCGs also display star formation, whereas the diffuse UV of the remaining 13 is entirely consistent with old low-mass stars. The overall results support the previously established dependence of star formation and nebulae in BCGs on an “excess core entropy,” K0, for the ICM: all 11 clusters with K0 ≤ 24 keV cm2 (but only one of 14 clusters with K0 ≥ 42 keV cm2) host star-forming BCGs that almost if not always possess nebulae. Instead of an entropy floor, we show that K0 reflects the degree to which the radial entropy profile decreases inward within ∼100 kpc rather than (except perhaps at large K0) actually flattening: clusters with lower ICM entropies and hence shorter cooling times at their cores preferentially host BCGs displaying star formation, nebulae, and more radio-luminous AGNs. Nearly all BCGs possess detectable AGNs, however, indicating multiple pathways for fuelling their AGNs.

A plethora of coronal models, from empirical to more complex magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) ones, are being used for reconstructing the coronal magnetic field topology and estimating the open magnetic flux. However, no individual solution fully agrees with coronal hole observations and in situ measurements of open flux at 1 au, as there is a strong deficit between the model and observations contributing to the known problem of the missing open flux. In this paper, we investigate the possible origin of the discrepancy between modeled and observed magnetic field topology by assessing the effect on the simulation output by the choice of the input boundary conditions and the simulation setup, including the choice of numerical schemes and the parameter initialization. In the frame of this work, we considered four potential field source surface-based models and one fully MHD model, different types of global magnetic field maps, and model initiation parameters. After assessing the model outputs using a variety of metrics, we conclude that they are highly comparable regardless of the differences set at initiation. When comparing all models to coronal hole boundaries extracted by extreme-ultraviolet filtergrams, we find that they do not compare well. This mismatch between observed and modeled regions of the open field is a candidate contributing to the open flux problem.

We analyze the structure and dynamics of the plasma atmospheres and Coulomb-liquid oceans on neutron stars. Salient dynamical parameters are identified and their values estimated for the governing set of magnetohydrodynamics equations. Neutron star atmospheres and oceans are strongly stratified and, depending on the rotation period, contain a multitude of long-lived vortices (spots) and/or narrow zonal jets (free-shear zones) in the large plasma-beta regime—i.e., βp ≫ 1 (hydrodynamic regime). In contrast, when βp ≲ 1 (magnetohydrodynamic regime), the flow is dominated by a global lattice of effectively fixed magnetic islands (plasmoids) without any jets. Understanding the spatiotemporal variability of dynamic atmospheres and oceans on neutron stars is crucial for interpreting observations of their X-ray emissions.

We present a comprehensive analysis of the post-outburst evolution of the FU Ori object HBC 722 in optical/near-infrared (NIR) photometry and spectroscopy. Using a modified viscous accretion disk model, we fit the outburst epoch spectral energy distribution to determine the physical parameters of the disk, including yr−1, Rinner = 3.65 R⊙, i = 79°, and a maximum disk temperature of K. We then use a decade of optical/NIR spectra to demonstrate a changing accretion rate drives the visible-range photometric variation, while the NIR shows the outer radius of the active accretion disk expands outward as the outburst progresses. We also identify the major components of the disk system: a plane-parallel disk atmosphere in Keplerian rotation and a two-part warm disk wind that is collimated near the star and wide-angle at larger radii. The wind is traced by classic wind lines, and appears as a narrow, low-velocity, deep absorption component in several atomic lines spanning the visible spectrum and in the CO 2.29 μm band. We compare the wind lines to those computed from wind models for other FU Ori systems and rapidly accreting young stellar disks and find a 4000–6000 K wind can explain the observed line profiles. Fitting the progenitor spectrum, we find M* = 0.2 M⊙ and . Finally, we discuss HBC 722 relative to V960 Mon, another FU Ori object we have previously studied in detail.

热尘埋藏星系（Hot DOGs）是一种罕见的高红移超大红外星系，它们中活跃星系核（AGN）被尘埃显著遮挡，但通常观察到明显的宽广蓝移发射线。此前的研究表明，有八个热尘埋藏星系，被称为蓝色过量热尘埋藏星系（BHDs），在其紫外-光学光谱能量分布中呈现出一种与1型类星体发射一致的蓝色过量，其来源是被遮挡的中心发动机的光被散射到视线中。我们通过UV-中红外光谱能量分布建模和光谱细节的分析来对172个热尘埋藏星系进行分析，特别关注BHDs的识别。我们发现，虽然热尘埋藏星系中观察到的光学发射在大多数情况下是由年轻恒星族群主导的，但有26%的热尘埋藏星系显示出足够显著的蓝色过量发射，可以被分类为BHDs。基于其宽C iv和Mg ii线，我们发现BHDs中黑洞质量MBH的范围从10^8.7到10^10M⊙不等。当使用相同的发射线在普通热尘埋藏星系中，我们发现MBH的估计涵盖了BHDs所发现的整个范围，同时也延伸到相对较低的值。这一一致可能表明，普通热尘埋藏星系中的宽线也源自中心发动机的散射光，就像BHDs一样，尽管需要进行更详细的研究以排除是由流出驱动的特性。与z∼6类星体相似，我们发现热尘埋藏星系位于恒星与黑洞质量之间关系的上方，这表明AGN反馈尚未显著抑制宿主星系的恒星质量增长，或者在达到z=0时它们将成为关系的离群值。 <br /><br />总结: 热尘埋藏星系（Hot DOGs）是一类罕见的高红移超大红外星系，其中的蓝色过量热尘埋藏星系（BHDs）显示出与1型类星体相似的蓝色过量发射，这源自被遮挡的中心发动机的光被散射出来。在172个研究对象中，26%被分类为BHDs。这些星系中的光学发射主要由年轻恒星族群主导。黑洞质量的估计范围在BHDs和普通热尘埋藏星系中是一致的，这表明宽线可能也源自中心发动机的散射光。热尘埋藏星系位于恒星与黑洞质量之间关系的上方，表明AGN反馈可能尚未显著抑制宿主星系的恒星质量增长。 <div>
Hot dust-obscured galaxies (Hot DOGs) are a rare population of hyperluminous infrared galaxies discovered by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer mission. Despite the significant obscuration of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) by dust in these systems, pronounced broad and blueshifted emission lines are often observed. Previous work has shown that eight Hot DOGs, referred to as blue-excess Hot DOGs (BHDs), present a blue excess consistent with type 1 quasar emission in their UV–optical spectral energy distributions (SEDs), which has been shown to originate from the light of the obscured central engine scattered into the line of sight. We present an analysis of the rest-frame optical emission characteristics for 172 Hot DOGs through UV–mid-IR SED modeling and spectroscopic details, with a particular focus on the identification of BHDs. We find that while the optical emission observed in Hot DOGs is in most cases dominated by a young stellar population, 26% of Hot DOGs show a significant enough blue excess emission to be classified as BHDs. Based on their broad C iv and Mg ii lines, we find that the mass of the black hole MBH in a BHD ranges from 108.7 to 1010M⊙. When using the same emission lines in regular Hot DOGs, we find the MBH estimates cover the entire range found for BHDs while also extending to somewhat lower values. This agreement may imply that the broad lines in regular Hot DOGs also originate from scattered light from the central engine, just as in BHDs, although a more detailed study would be needed to rule out an outflow-driven nature. Similar to z ∼ 6 quasars, we find that Hot DOGs sit above the local relation between stellar and black hole masses, suggesting either that AGN feedback has not yet significantly suppressed the stellar mass growth in the host galaxies or that they will be outliers of the relation when reaching z = 0.

总结:<br /><br />本研究通过模拟升级后的巨型米波射电望远镜（uGMRT）数据，系统地研究了不同信噪比条件下各种频谱指数估算方法的可靠性。研究发现，在低于S/N ≲ 100的情况下，MT-MFS成像算法得到的在频内的频谱指数误差≳0.2，不可靠；而子频带分裂方法在类似S/N条件下得到的误差≲0.2，更准确且无偏。宽带频谱指数在S/N ≳ 15时得到的误差≲0.2，因此在没有频谱指数的高阶变化时最为可靠。这些结果可用于改进uGMRT观测和数据分析策略，取决于目标源的亮度。 <div>
Low-radio-frequency spectral index measurements are a powerful tool for distinguishing between different emission mechanisms and, in turn, understanding the nature of the sources. Besides the standard method of estimating the “broadband” spectral index of sources from observations in two different frequency “bands,” if the observations were made with large instantaneous bandwidth, the “in-band” spectral index can be determined, either using images of emission at multiple frequency ranges within a band or using the novel Multi Term-Multi Frequency Synthesis (MT-MFS) imaging algorithm. Here, using simulated upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) data, we have systematically studied the reliability of various methods of spectral index estimation for sources with a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios (S/Ns). It is found that for synthetic uGMRT point-source data, the MT-MFS imaging algorithm produces in-band spectral indices for S/N ≲ 100 that have errors ≳0.2, making them unreliable. However, at a similar S/N, the sub-band splitting method produces errors ≲0.2, which are more accurate and unbiased than the in-band spectral indices. The broadband spectral indices produce errors ≲0.2 even for S/N ≳ 15, and hence they are most reliable if there are no higher-order variations in the spectral index. These results may be used to improve the uGMRT observation and data analysis strategies, depending on the brightness of the target source.

<div> 关键词: 超大质量黑洞二进制，辐射+流体动力学模拟，活跃星系核反馈，环绕双星盘，辐射反馈效应

总结:<br />
本研究使用RAMSES代码进行了次差量级分辨率的辐射+流体动力学自适应网格细化模拟，研究了嵌入气态核双星盘中超大质量黑洞（SMBH）二进制的动力学，探讨了活跃星系核反馈对SMBH二进制的迁移行为和盘结构的影响。模拟中采用了注入与气体相互作用的光子的辐射反馈效应，并通过采用一组BH发射谱的网格来建模这一效应。研究发现，对于形成间隙的双星系统，辐射反馈不会改变轨道演化，但电离辐射会蒸发位于低密度区域外缘的气体。对于未形成间隙的系统，引入反馈会导致环绕双星盘的强烈初期扰动，随后介质逐渐稳定，并可能重新进入快速二进制迁移状态。这些发现是因为我们的模拟捕捉了核盘区域的电离状态，以及这如何影响与辐射反馈效率的耦合效率下降。 <div>
Using subparsec-scale-resolution radiation+hydrodynamical adaptive mesh refinement simulations deployed with the RAMSES code, we study the dynamics of supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries embedded in gaseous nuclear circumbinary disks, where we investigate the effects of active galactic nucleus feedback on the SMBH binaries' migration behavior and disk structure. The radiative feedback effects are modeled by injecting photons that interact with the gas, through the adoption of a grid of BH emission spectra. We run simulations with initial conditions that lead by pure gravity plus hydrodynamics both to the formation of a low-density tidal cavity and to systems where gas–viscous diffusion is efficient enough to maintain a sizable gas reservoir surrounding the binary. For gap-forming binaries we find that orbital evolution is unchanged with the inclusion of feedback, but ionizing radiation photoevaporates gas that is at the outer edge of the low-density region. For non-gap-forming systems we find that when feedback is included a strong initial disruption of the circumbinary disk is followed by an eventual stabilization of the medium that can usher a return to a fast binary migration regime. All of this is possible as a result of how our simulations capture the ionization states of the nuclear disk region and how this affects the coupling efficiency decrease with respect to the radiative feedback.

In the denser and colder regions of the interstellar medium (ISM), gas-phase sulfur is depleted by 2 or 3 orders of magnitude with respect to its cosmic abundance. Thus, which species are the main carriers of sulfur is an open question. Recent studies have proposed Sn species as potential sulfur reservoirs. Among the various sulfur allotropes, the most stable one is the S8 ring, detected in the asteroid Ryugu and Orgueil meteorite. Shorter species, namely S3 and S4, have been found in the comet 67P/C-G, but their presence in the ISM remains elusive. In this study, we compute the binding energies (BEs) of Sn (n = 1–8) species on an amorphous water-ice surface model and analyze their infrared (IR) and Raman spectral features to provide data for their identification in the ISM. Our computations reveal that these species exhibit lower BEs than previously assumed and that their spectral features experience minimal shifts when adsorbed on water ice, because of the weak and nonspecific Sn–ice interactions. Furthermore, these species display very low IR band intensities and, therefore, very accurate instruments operating in the mid-IR range are required for detecting the presence of these species in dense interstellar environments.

<div> 关键词: 星际化学异常, 行星宿主恒星, 化学丰度, 银河系, 行星形成过程
总结: 
本文使用APOGEE DR17选择银河系薄盘星，并与开普勒输入目录进行交叉匹配，筛选出227颗具有六种难揣物质元素化学丰度数据的已确认行星宿主恒星。通过对比恒星和行星影响下的星系化学演化效应，得出行星宿主恒星与无行星信号的恒星在难揣元素化学丰度上没有明显差异。但是当考察行星宿主恒星的难揣元素倾向时发现，与岩石行星相比，行星宿主恒星中具有巨行星的恒星在难揣元素方面更为贫乏。在众多岩石行星宿主恒星中，难揣元素倾向可能与类地行星的半径和多重性有关。而对于具有巨行星的行星宿主恒星而言，次木星行星宿主恒星表现出比环绕木星质量行星宿主恒星更为贫乏的难揣趋势，提出了关于类海王星和类木星行星形成过程的不同疑问。 <div>
Chemical anomalies in planet-hosting stars (PHSs) are studied in order to assess how the planetary nature and multiplicity affect the atmospheric chemical abundances of their host stars. We employ APOGEE DR17 to select thin-disk stars of the Milky Way, and crossmatch them with the Kepler Input Catalog to identify confirmed PHSs, which results in 227 PHSs with available chemical abundance ratios for six refractory elements. We also examine an ensemble of stars without planet signals, which are equivalent to the selected PHSs in terms of evolutionary stage and stellar parameters, to correct for Galactic chemical evolution effects, and derive the abundance gradient of refractory elements over the condensation temperature for the PHSs. Using the Galactic chemical evolution corrected abundances, we find that our PHSs do not show a significant difference in abundance slope from the stars without planets. However, when we examine the trends of the refractory elements of PHSs, based on the total number of their planets and their planet types, we find that the PHSs with giant planets are more depleted in refractory elements than those with rocky planets. Among the PHSs with rocky planets, the refractory depletion trends are potentially correlated with the terrestrial planets’ radii and multiplicity. In the cases of PHSs with giant planets, sub-Jovian PHSs demonstrate more depleted refractory trends than stars hosting Jovian-mass planets, raising questions on different planetary formation processes for Neptune-like and Jupiter-like planets.

<div> 关键词: 强弓震，湍流，自相似，解析可求解，星际介质
总结: 
本研究表明，强弓震在头部附近是湍流的，并且不是普遍的，但在下游趋于一个稳定的、自相似的、可以解析求解的流动。湍流是基本上是三维的，并且已经通过三维模拟得到了证实。渐近行为已经通过高分辨率的二维和三维模拟得到了证实，这些模拟模拟了冷的均匀风遇到固体球状障碍物和恒星风的情况。这个解决方案在观测到的高速紧凑天体——例如，逃逸星和/或超新星喷射物块—穿越星际介质的运动属性的探测和某些准周期性喷发模型中所引发的恒星弓形冲击亮度的限制方面是相关的。 <br /><br /> <div>
We show that strong bow shocks are turbulent and nonuniversal near the head but asymptote to a universal, steady, self-similar, and analytically solvable flow in the downstream. The turbulence is essentially 3D and has been confirmed by a 3D simulation. The asymptotic behavior is confirmed with high-resolution 2D and 3D simulations of a cold uniform wind encountering both a solid spherical obstacle and stellar wind. This solution is relevant in the context of (i) probing the kinematic properties of observed high-velocity compact bodies—e.g., runaway stars and/or supernova ejecta blobs—flying through the interstellar medium; and (ii) constraining stellar bow shock luminosities invoked by some quasiperiodic eruption models.

<div> 黑洞、磁流体力学、伽马射线暴、激波、GRMHD方程
总结:
本研究通过自洽求解GRMHD方程，得到了关于Kerr黑洞周围含有激波的磁流体力学吸积流的全局结构。首次得到了关于一组基本流参数的弱旋转和快速旋转黑洞的激波诱导的全局GRMHD吸积解。研究发现激波性质与能量、角动量、径向磁通和等转参数等流参数密切相关。激波范围的变化随着磁通和黑洞自旋的增加而向低角动量值的方向移动。最后计算了在GRMHD流中允许激波的临界径向磁通，并确定了临界值随着黑洞自旋的增加而增加。 <div>
We investigate the global structure of the general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) accretion flows around Kerr black holes containing shock waves, where the disk is threaded by radial and toroidal magnetic fields. We self-consistently solve the GRMHD equations that govern the flow motion inside the disk and for the first time, to our knowledge, we obtain the shock-induced global GRMHD accretion solutions around weakly as well as rapidly rotating black holes for a set of fundamental flow parameters, such as energy ( ), angular momentum ( ), radial magnetic flux (Φ), and isorotation parameter (F). We show that shock properties—namely, the shock radius (rsh), compression ratio (R), and shock strength (Ψ)—strongly depend on , , Φ, and F. We observe that the shock in the GRMHD flow continues to exist for a wide range of the flow parameters, which allows us to identify the effective domain of the parameter space in the plane where shock solutions are feasible. Moreover, we examine the modification of the shock parameter space and find that it shifts towards the lower-angular-momentum values with increasing Φ and black hole spin (ak). Finally, we compute the critical radial magnetic flux (Φcri) that admits shocks in GRMHD flows and ascertain that Φcri is higher (lower) for a black hole of spin ak = 0.99 (0.0) and vice versa.

热发射光谱分析，估算大气金属丰度、碳氧比、昼夜热量重新分配的影响，19个行星的观测数据，发现大气金属丰度和碳氧比存在大量分散，不呈现趋势，揭示了热木星和超热木星群体中形成路径的变化或需要更准确的成分测量来识别趋势。同时发现日侧温度值也分散较大，并没有与平衡温度呈现出一致的趋势，这表明群体中气候驱动因素的显著变异或需要更精确的日侧温度测量来识别趋势。预计在JWST时代，1D-RCTE模型将继续为我们提供有关外行星大气的宝贵见解。
<br /><br />总结: 该研究利用Hubble WFC3和Spitzer IRAC观测数据，结合1D-RCTE模型和贝叶斯推断框架，对19个行星的大气进行了分析。结果显示大气金属丰度和碳氧比存在大量分散，无法呈现出明显趋势。同时，日侧温度值也分散较大，没有与平衡温度呈现出一致的趋势。这表明外行星大气的形成和气候驱动因素存在巨大的变异性，或者需要更精确的观测来识别趋势。该研究预计1D-RCTE模型将在JWST时代继续为我们提供有关外行星大气的宝贵见解。 <div>
We present a population-level analysis of the dayside thermal emission spectra of 19 planets observed with Hubble WFC3 and Spitzer IRAC 3.6 and 4.5 μm, spanning equilibrium temperatures 1200–2700 K and 0.7–10.5 Jupiter masses. We use grids of planet-specific 1D, cloud-free, radiative–convective–thermochemical equilibrium models (1D-RCTE) combined with a Bayesian inference framework to estimate atmospheric metallicity, the carbon-to-oxygen ratio, and day-to-night heat redistribution. In general, we find that the secondary eclipse data cannot reject the physics encapsulated within the 1D-RCTE assumption parameterized with these three variables. We find a large degree of scatter in atmospheric metallicities, with no apparent trend, and carbon-to-oxygen ratios that are mainly consistent with solar or subsolar values but do not exhibit population agreement. Together, these indicate either (1) formation pathways vary over the hot and ultra-hot Jupiter population and/or (2) more accurate composition measurements are needed to identify trends. We also find a broad scatter in derived dayside temperatures that do not demonstrate a trend with equilibrium temperature. Like with composition estimates, this suggests either significant variability in climate drivers over the population and/or more precise dayside temperature measurements are needed to identify a trend. We anticipate that 1D-RCTE models will continue to provide valuable insights into the nature of exoplanet atmospheres in the era of JWST.

总结:<br />
本研究使用JWST NIRCam和MIRI观测了NGC 628中年轻恒星团的出现阶段。通过对氢复合线和多环芳烃（PAH）发射的空间分辨率图像进行分析，提取了953个紧凑的H ii区，并在相关的光解区域内对3.3和7.7μm PAH发射进行了分析。文章定义了三种PAH形态类别，并观察到PAH发射随着星团年龄的增长而减少。在H ii区附近，中性PAH和带电PAH的破坏速率相似，与文献中的参考模型预期不符。 <div>
We investigate the emergence phase of young star clusters in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 628. We use JWST NIRCam and MIRI observations to create spatially resolved maps of the Paα 1.87 μm and Brα 4.05 μm hydrogen recombination lines, as well as 3.3 and 7.7 μm emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). We extract 953 compact H ii regions and analyze the PAH emission and morphology at ∼10 pc scales in the associated photodissociation regions. While H ii regions remain compact, radial profiles help us to define three PAH morphological classes: compact (∼42%), extended (∼34%), and open (∼24%). The majority of compact and extended PAH morphologies are associated with very young star clusters (<5 Myr), while open PAH morphologies are mainly associated with star clusters older than 3 Myr. We observe a general decrease in the 3.3 and 7.7 μm PAH band emission as a function of cluster age, while their ratio remains constant with age out to 10 Myr and morphological class. The recovered PAH3.3μm/PAH7.7μm ratio is lower than values reported in the literature for reference models that consider neutral and ionized PAH populations and analyses conducted at galactic physical scales. The 3.3 and 7.7 μm bands are typically associated with neutral and ionized PAHs, respectively. While we expected neutral PAHs to be suppressed in proximity to an ionizing source, the constant PAH3.3μm/PAH7.7μm ratio would indicate that both families of molecules disrupt at similar rates in proximity to H ii regions.

<div> 双星系统, Hyades星团, 动力学质量, 恒星演化模型, TESS光变曲线
<br />
这项研究报道了使用CHARA阵列进行的长基线干涉观测，解析了Hyades星团中六个先前已知的双线谱二进制系统，它们的轨道周期从3到358天不等：HD 27483，HD 283882，HD 26874，HD 27149，HD 30676和HD 28545。结合这些观测和新旧的径向速度测量，推断了组分的动力学质量和轨道视差。对大多数恒星来说，质量的确定度优于1%。这项工作显著增加了星团中具有质量测定的系统数量。研究结果发现，尽管Hyades的年龄和金属丰度的当前恒星演化模型能够重现经验质量-光度关系的整体形状，但在0.5至1.4 M⊙范围内V-band光度被高估了约0.1等。在H波段，这种差异较小，在K波段附近为零，并且在一定程度上取决于模型。研究还利用了TESS光变曲线来估计目标的自转周期，并在其中一个目标（HD 283882）中检测到了大量耀斑活动，估计平均耀斑率为0.44次/天。 
<br /><br />总结: 双星系统动力学质量测定、恒星演化模型的不足、TESS光变曲线的利用及耀斑活动检测。 <div>
We report long-baseline interferometric observations with the CHARA Array that resolve six previously known double-lined spectroscopic binary systems in the Hyades cluster, with orbital periods ranging from 3 to 358 days: HD 27483, HD 283882, HD 26874, HD 27149, HD 30676, and HD 28545. We combine those observations with new and existing radial-velocity measurements, to infer the dynamical masses for the components as well as the orbital parallaxes. For most stars, the masses are determined to be better than 1%. Our work significantly increases the number of systems with mass determinations in the cluster. We find that, while current models of stellar evolution for the age and metallicity of the Hyades are able to reproduce the overall shape of the empirical mass–luminosity relation, they overestimate the V-band fluxes by about 0.1 mag between 0.5 and 1.4 M⊙. The disagreement is smaller in H, and near zero in K, and depends somewhat on the model. We also make use of the TESS light curves to estimate rotation periods for our targets, and detect numerous flares in one of them (HD 283882), estimating an average flaring rate of 0.44 events per day.

该研究通过对活跃区的Hα和Ca ii 8662 Å线进行同时观测发现，太阳黑子呈现多种结构，包括光桥和Ca ii 8662 Å线核心处的发射区域。在发射区域，Hα线核心图像显示出明亮的发射区域，光谱轮廓显示出升高的线核心。研究利用Ca ii 8662 Å线的非局部热动力学平衡多线反演和Hα线的弱场近似推断出视线磁场的分层结构。研究发现，Hα线核心推断的磁场强度始终小于 = −4.5处反演推断的磁场强度。然而，研究发现Hα线核心处的弱场近似和 = −4.5处反演推断之间没有相关性。在表现出发射特征的区域， = −4.5处推断的磁场形态类似于 = −1处，磁场强度略高或者相当。在光桥区域， = −1处推断的磁场强度小于周围黑子区域，并且在 = −4.5处相当。同样，Hα线的弱场近似所推断的光桥区域的磁场强度较周围黑子区域为低。 <br /><br />总结: 该研究通过观测Hα和Ca ii 8662 Å线同时观测到活跃区的多种结构，利用不同方法推断了磁场形态和强度，结果表明在发射区域和光桥区域的磁场特征有所不同，为太阳活动区的研究提供了重要的观测和分析结果。 <div>
We present spectropolarimetric observations of an active region recorded simultaneously in the Hα and the Ca ii 8662 Å lines. The sunspot exhibits multiple structures, including a light bridge and a region where the Ca ii 8662 Å line core is in emission. Correspondingly, the Hα line core image displays brightening in the emission region, with the spectral profiles showing elevated line cores. The stratification of the line-of-sight magnetic field is inferred through nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium multiline inversions of the Ca ii 8662 Å line and the weak field approximation (WFA) over the Hα line. The field strength inferred from the Hα line core is consistently smaller than that inferred from inversions at = −4.5. However, the study finds no correlation between the WFA over the core of the Hα line and that inferred from inversions at = −4.5. In regions exhibiting emission features, the morphology of the magnetic field at = −4.5 resembles that at = −1, with slightly higher or comparable field strengths. The magnetic field morphology inferred from the core of the Hα line is also similar to that inferred from the full spectral range of the Hα line in the emission region. The field strength inferred in the light bridge at = −1 is smaller than the surrounding umbral regions and comparable at = −4.5. Similarly, the field strength inferred in the light bridge from the WFA over the Hα line appears lower compared to the surrounding umbral regions.

研究了Fermi/GBM在高采样频率下观测到的太阳耀斑数据，发现并分析了X射线能量范围内短周期准周期脉动（QPPs）的普遍性。通过对合成太阳耀斑光变曲线的分析，了解了在实际数据中可能出现的假警报率和真阳率。研究结果表明，在Fermi/GBM数据中，普遍存在短周期QPPs的证据不强，可能是因为这种信号的基本发生率较低，或者它们的典型信噪比要低于1。最后，提出了在GBM太阳X射线数据中识别出的最有趣的潜在QPP事件的选择。 <br /><br />总结: 太阳耀斑的准周期脉动研究了Fermi/GBM数据中的X射线能量，通过合成光变曲线分析了短周期QPPs的普遍性，得出了在实际数据中可能出现的假警报率和真阳率的结论，并呈现了识别出的有趣的潜在QPP事件。 <div>
Most studies of quasiperiodic pulsations (QPPs) in solar flares have identified characteristic periods in the 5–300 s range. Due to observational limitations, there have been few attempts to probe the <5 s period regime and understand the prevalence of such short-period QPPs. However, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) has observed approximately 1500 solar flares to date in high-cadence 16 Hz burst mode, providing us with an opportunity to study short-period QPPs at X-ray energies. We systematically analyze every solar flare observed by Fermi/GBM in burst mode, estimating the prevalence of QPPs in multiple X-ray energy bands. To better understand these results, we complement this with an analysis of synthetic solar flare lightcurves, both with and without oscillatory signals present. Using these synthetic lightcurves, we can understand the likely false-alarm and true-positive rates in the real solar GBM data. We do not find strong evidence for widespread short-period QPPs, indicating either a low base occurrence rate of such signatures or that their typical signal-to-noise ratios must be low—less than 1—in Fermi/GBM data. Finally, we present a selection of the most interesting potential QPP events that were identified in the GBM solar X-ray data.

总结:<br /><br />本研究探讨了Ne viii 770 Å在探测太阳冕磁场方面的诊断潜力。通过模拟极端紫外线下的Ne viii线的偏振信号，结合Hanle效应，研究了不同太阳活动周期下的线偏振信号变化，发现随着太阳活动的增强，线偏振信号的检测性能显著提高，与磁场强度和太阳亮度的增加一致。最后讨论了考虑了实际仪器设计的信噪比要求。 <div>
Magnetic fields are the primary driver of the plasma thermodynamics in the upper solar atmosphere, especially in the corona. However, magnetic field measurements in the solar corona are sporadic, thereby limiting us from the complete understanding of physical processes occurring in the coronal plasma. In this paper, we explore the diagnostic potential of a coronal emission line in the extreme-ultraviolet, i.e., Ne viii 770 Å, to probe the coronal magnetic fields. We utilize 3D “Magnetohydrodynamic Algorithm outside a Sphere” models as input to the FORWARD code to model polarization in the Ne viii line produced as a result of resonance scattering, and we interpret its modification due to collisions and the magnetic fields through the Hanle effect. The polarization maps are synthesized both on the disk and off the limb. The variation of this polarization signal through the different phases of Solar Cycle 24 and the beginning phase of Solar Cycle 25 is studied in order to understand the magnetic diagnostic properties of this line owing to different physical conditions in the solar atmosphere. The detectability of the linear polarization signatures of the Hanle effect significantly improves with increasing solar activity, consistent with the increase in the magnetic field strength and the intensity of the mean solar brightness at these wavelengths. We finally discuss the signal-to-noise ratio requirements by considering realistic instrument designs.

<div> 高斯过程方法, 光变曲线, X射线爆发, 快速射电暴和哈哈镜振荡器

总结:<br /><br />文章介绍了利用高斯过程方法分析了2020年至2022年间Insight-HXMT、NICER和SGR 1935+2154探测到的X射线爆发的光变曲线。研究发现，需要使用随机驱动的阻尼简谐振荡器来捕捉X射线爆发的特征。X射线爆发的可变时间尺度通过简谐振荡器功率谱密度中的临界频率得到。特别是，与快速射电暴200428相关的HXMT-HE爆发限制了一个高达35赫兹的临界频率，其中简谐振荡器功率谱密度的指数从-4变为-2。研究指出，对应的时间尺度为0.03秒，可能是系统受到某种能量释放的阻滞时间尺度，同时高能光子的产生应该几乎与系统的响应同时发生。另一个特殊事件是NICER爆发，其阻滞时间尺度为1/(39赫兹)≈0.02秒。在正常的X射线爆发中，没有限制阻滞时间尺度；而获得了一个较长的松弛/平衡时间尺度（相应简谐振荡器功率谱密度中的临界频率为1-10赫兹，指数从-4/-2变为0）。研究结果表明，与快速射电暴相关的HXMT-HE X射线爆发可能是在系统对能量干扰做出响应时立即产生的，远在达到平衡状态之前。 <div>
The Gaussian process method is employed to analyze the light curves of bursts detected by Insight-HXMT, Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER), and Gravitational Wave High-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor from SGR 1935+2154 between 2020 and 2022. It is found that a stochastically driven damped simple harmonic oscillator (SHO) is necessary to capture the characteristics of the X-ray bursts (XRBs). A variability timescale of the XRBs, corresponding to the broken frequencies in the SHO power spectral densities (PSDs), is extracted. In particular, a high broken frequency of 35 Hz where the index of the SHO PSD changes from −4 to −2 is constrained by the HXMT-HE burst associated with fast radio burst (FRB) 200428. It is suggested that the corresponding timescale of 0.03 s could be the retarding timescale of the system driven by some energy release, and the production of the HE photon should be quasi-simultaneous with the response. The other special event is a NICER burst with a retarding timescale of 1/(39 Hz) ≈ 0.02 s. In the normal XRBs, no retarding timescale is constrained; a long relax/equilibrium timescale (corresponding to a broken frequency of 1–10 Hz, where the index of the SHO PSD changes from −4/−2 to 0 in the SHO PSD) is obtained. The results indicate that the FRB-associated HXMT-HE XRB could be produced immediately when the system is responding to the energy disturbance, far before the equilibrium state.

Nonlinear electrostatic solitary waves (ESWs) are routinely detected at various regions of Earth’s magnetosphere using the Wideband Data plasma wave receivers mounted on board the Cluster satellite(s). This mission has facilitated the observation and analysis of ESW characteristics, such as amplitude and temporal duration within the magnetosheath, while concurrently determining the density and temperature profiles of energetic electrons. These electron parameters, in conjunction with data from ion experiments, have served as input for the ion-acoustic solitary wave model developed in this article, with the ambition to contribute to the understanding of ESW generation mechanisms. Assuming as the starting point a plasma system comprising inertial ion fluid and kappa-distributed electron populations of different temperatures (i.e., “cold” and “hot” electrons), a nonperturbative approach has been adopted to investigate the existence and properties of solitary waves. A thorough parametric investigation has scrutinized the existence conditions for such localized structures in terms of the plasma configuration parameters. An interesting aspect emerges from the analysis, namely, the possibility for the coexistence of positive and negative polarity structures associated with ion-acoustic modes, in fact, manifested as simultaneously occurring positive polarity supersolitary waves and negative polarity regular solitary waves. Furthermore, our study has investigated the combined effect of the magnetic field strength, electron density, and suprathermal electron statistics on wave dynamics. The outcomes of this research are in agreement with observed electrostatic wave phenomena in the magnetosheath region, thus underscoring the intrinsic relevance of electrostatic supersolitary structures in data obtained by Cluster and other satellite missions.

<title>Rotation and Abundances of the Benchmark Brown Dwarf HD 33632 Ab from Keck/KPIC High-resolution Spectroscopy</title>

<div> 关键词: HD 33632 Ab, KPIC, projected rotational velocity, molecular abundances, L–T transition
总结:
通过使用Keck行星成像仪和特性分析仪（KPIC）高分辨率光谱技术，研究了HD 33632 Ab的旋转速度和分子丰度。根据对太阳系外行星HD 33632 Ab的自洽的次恒星大气和检索模型，获得了53 ± 3 km s−1的投影旋转速度以及CO和H2O的质量分数。得出的碳-氧比（C/O = 0.58 ± 0.14）、分子丰度和金属丰度与其恒星宿主一致。然而，在KPIC光谱中没有检测到甲烷，部分原因是高的v sin i和我们敏感的压力下的失衡化学。将HD 33632 Ab与文献中的>200个极低质量物体（M≲ 0.1 M⊙）进行了比较，发现孤立的低质量场物体与质量之间没有明显的趋势，但在低质量伴星和直接成像的外行星中发现了一个初步的趋势，与以前的研究结果相似。大规模的近距离气态巨行星和棕矮星样本将通过旋转和化学丰度测量对它们的形成和演化理解进行重要的考验。<br /><br /> <div>
We present the projected rotational velocity and molecular abundances for HD 33632 Ab obtained via Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC) high-resolution spectroscopy. HD 33632 Ab is a nearby benchmark brown dwarf companion at a separation of ∼20 au that straddles the L–T transition. Using a forward-modeling framework with on-axis host star spectra, which provides self-consistent substellar atmospheric and retrieval models for HD 33632 Ab, we derive a projected rotational velocity of 53 ± 3 km s−1 and carbon monoxide and water mass fractions of logCO = −2.3 ± 0.3 and logH2O = −2.7 ± 0.2, respectively. The inferred carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O = 0.58 ± 0.14), molecular abundances, and metallicity ([C/H] = 0.0 ± 0.2 dex) of HD 33632 Ab are consistent with its host star. Although detectable methane opacities are expected in L–T transition objects, we did not recover methane in our KPIC spectra, partly due to the high v sin i and to disequilibrium chemistry at the pressures to which we are sensitive. We parameterize the spin as the ratio of rotation to the breakup velocity, and compare HD 33632 Ab to a compilation of >200 very low-mass objects (M ≲ 0.1 M⊙) that have spin measurements in the literature. There appears to be no clear trend for the isolated low-mass field objects versus mass, but a tentative trend is identified for low-mass companions and directly imaged exoplanets, similar to previous findings. A larger sample of close-in gas giant exoplanets and brown dwarfs will critically examine our understanding of their formation and evolution through rotation and chemical abundance measurements.

总结:
本研究利用存档的AstroSat Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT)成像数据首次在M31提供了一份紫外光天文学对新星的目录。通过两种图像减法技术，我们发现了M31中部深处的物体。在UVIT图像中共发现了42颗新星，其中15颗在远紫外光和近紫外光的多个滤波器中被检测到。在静止期间检测到的新星显示出紫外光能谱中吸积盘的特征，而在爆发阶段的新星则显示出伪光球的特征。还有一些新星在多个时期被检测到。一些在静止期间显示出接近恒定的远紫外光亮度，而其他在爆发附近的新星则显示出光变曲线中的爆发前暗淡。最后，我们讨论了紫外光调查对阐明新星系统理论预测的重要性，包括探测难以捕捉到的早期紫外光闪烁。 <div>
Extensive multiwavelength studies of novae have been carried out in our galaxy and in M31 for decades. However, UV studies of extragalactic novae are limited, especially those in quiescence. For the first time, we present a UV catalog of novae in M31 using the archival AstroSat Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) imaging data. We used two image subtraction techniques to retrieve objects located deep into the M31 central region. We have found 42 novae in total in the UVIT images, 15 of which have been detected in multiple filters in the far-ultraviolet (FUV) and near-ultraviolet. The novae detected at quiescence show signatures of accretion disk from their UV spectral energy distributions, whereas those in the outburst phase show signatures of a pseudo-photosphere. A few novae were also detected in multiple epochs. Some show a near-constant FUV magnitude at quiescence, while others caught near the outburst reveal pre-eruption dips in their light curves. We conclude with a discussion on the significance of UV surveys in illuminating theoretical predictions for novae systems, including detecting the elusive early UV flash.

总结:

Templates modeling just the dominant mode of gravitational radiation are generally sufficient for the unbiased parameter inference of near-equal-mass compact binary mergers. However, neglecting the subdominant modes can bias the inference if the binary is significantly asymmetric, very massive, or has misaligned spins. In this work, we explore if neglecting these subdominant modes in the parameter estimation of nonspinning binary black hole mergers can bias the inference of their population-level properties such as mass and merger redshift distributions. Assuming the design sensitivity of the advanced LIGO-Virgo detector network, we find that neglecting subdominant modes will not cause a significant bias in the population inference, although including them will provide more precise estimates. This is primarily because asymmetric binaries are expected to be rarer in our detected sample, due to their intrinsic rareness and the observational selection effects. The increased precision in the measurement of the maximum black hole mass can help in better constraining the upper mass gap in the mass spectrum.

<title>Late Pebble Accretion of Comet 81P/Wild 2 Nucleus: Evidence from a Plagioclase-bearing Chondrule Fragment, Pyxie</title>

<div> 关键词: 彗星 81P/Wild 2, 26Al–26Mg同位素, 彗星形成机制, 碎屑矿物, 碎片分析
总结: 彗星81P/Wild 2是一种几乎未经内部加热26Al衰变的4.5公里大小的原始天体，其核可能是通过颗粒云的分层聚集或重力坍缩形成的。对野2号碎片Pyxie进行了26Al–26Mg同位素系统学的重新分析，结果显示其初期(26Al/27Al)0的上限≤1.5 × 10−6，比其他野2号碎片估计的值小2倍。Pyxie的最小结晶年龄估计为钙铝富集体之后的3.6Ma以上，表明它是在富含中度挥发元素的盘环境中形成的球粒碎屑，并在彗星野2号之前沉积。这些结果与早期和持续沉积的分层聚集模型不符合。相反，结果更符合在26Al丰度极低(26Al/27Al ≤ 1.5 × 10−6)且气体扩散之前，通过颗粒轻柔的重力坍缩形成彗星的观点。 <br /><br /> <div>
Comet 81P/Wild 2 is a ∼4.5 km-sized primordial object that almost has not been modified by internal heating by 26Al decay. Its nucleus could have been formed by hierarchical agglomeration or gravitational collapse of pebble swarms concentrated by streaming instability. To shed light on the cometesimal formation mechanism from laboratory sample analysis, we reexamined the 26Al–26Mg isotope systematics of the plagioclase-bearing fragment, Pyxie (from Wild 2 track 81), with significantly improved analytical precision. The revised upper limit of the initial (26Al/27Al)0 of Pyxie is ≤1.5 × 10−6, 2 times smaller than those estimated from other Wild 2 fragments. Assuming homogenous distribution of 26Al in the early solar system, the minimum crystallization age of Pyxie is estimated to be >3.6 Ma after calcium–aluminum-rich inclusions. Additional petrologic examination demonstrated that it is a chondrule fragment formed in disk environments enriched in moderately volatile elements comparable to the Si-rich rim of CR chondrules before accreting by comet Wild 2. The late accretion of the Wild 2 nucleus with most silicates likely from a common source are not favored by the hierarchical agglomeration model that considers early and continuous accretion. Instead, the results are more in line with comet formation by gentle gravitational collapse of pebbles when the 26Al abundance is extremely low (26Al/27Al ≤ 1.5 × 10−6) before gas dispersal.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章描述了对猎户座星云簇（ONC）进行的长达2.1 Ms的Chandra HETGS观测，提取和清洁了36个高分辨率光谱，包括θ1 Ori C星的X射线光谱。观测显示所有恒星都具有高度变化性，包括大质量恒星。通过热等离子体辐射线模型拟合发现，大多数恒星显示高达几次1022 cm−2的柱密度和10–90 MK的高等离子温度。观测还发现了高温成分的分叉，表明有重大的耀斑活动。这组数据代表着迄今最大的关于年轻的主序前恒星的HETGS高分辨率X射线光谱的收集。 <div>
The Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) is the closest site of very young (∼1 Myr) massive star formation The ONC hosts more than 1600 young and X-ray bright stars with masses ranging from ∼0.1–35 M⊙. The Chandra HETGS Orion Legacy Project observed the ONC with the Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer (HETGS) for 2.1 Ms. We describe the spectral extraction and cleaning processes necessary to separate overlapping spectra. We obtained 36 high-resolution spectra, which include a high-brilliance X-ray spectrum of θ1 Ori C with over 100 highly significant X-ray lines. The lines show Doppler broadening between 300 and 400 km s−1. Higher spectral diffraction orders allow us to resolve line components of high Z He-like triplets in θ1 Ori C with unprecedented spectral resolution. Long-term light curves spanning ∼20 yr show all stars to be highly variable, including the massive stars. Spectral fitting with thermal coronal emission line models reveals that most sources show column densities of up to a few times 1022 cm−2 and high coronal temperatures of 10–90 MK. We observe a bifurcation of the high-temperature component where some stars show a high component of 40 MK, while others show above 60 MK, indicating heavy flaring activity. Some lines are resolved with Doppler broadening above our threshold of ∼200 km s−1, up to 500 km s−1. This data set represents the largest collection of HETGS high-resolution X-ray spectra from young pre-main-sequence stars in a single star-forming region to date.

总结: 该研究通过对M矮星进行多波段观测，发现了24颗近邻M矮星上213次NUV耀斑，并发现所有光学耀斑都有NUV对应。研究发现NUV和光学能量之比随NUV能量增加而略有减少，这一趋势与先前针对更高能量G-K星的耀斑研究结果一致。通过对M0-M3和M4-M6矮星的分析，得出了NUV耀斑时间的平均比例分别为2.1%和5%。此外，对NUV和光学耀斑的频率分布进行比较后发现，在所有光谱亚型中，NUV和光学耀斑的频率分布均具有相似的斜率。研究结果表明，M矮星的NUV耀斑会影响大气化学、辐射环境，并可能对其携带的外行星的生命潜力产生影响。最终得出结论，早期和中期M矮星具有引发生命起源的NUV耀斑的潜力。 <br /><br /> <div>
We present a comprehensive multiwavelength investigation into flares and activity in nearby M dwarf stars. We leverage the most extensive contemporaneous data set obtained through the Transiting Exoplanet Sky Survey, Kepler/K2, the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, and the Hubble Space Telescope, spanning the optical and near-ultraviolet (NUV) regimes. In total, we observed 213 NUV flares on 24 nearby M dwarfs, with ∼27% of them having detected optical counterparts, and found that all optical flares had NUV counterparts. We explore NUV/optical energy fractionation in M dwarf flares. Our findings reveal a slight decrease in the ratio of optical to NUV energies with increasing NUV energies, a trend in agreement with prior investigations on G–K stars’ flares at higher energies. Our analysis yields an average NUV fraction of flaring time for M0–M3 dwarfs of 2.1%, while for M4–M6 dwarfs it is 5%. We present an empirical relationship between NUV and optical flare energies and compare to predictions from radiative hydrodynamic and blackbody models. We conducted a comparison of the flare frequency distribution (FFDs) of NUV and optical flares, revealing that the FFDs of both NUV and optical flares exhibit comparable slopes across all spectral subtypes. NUV flares on stars affect the atmospheric chemistry, the radiation environment, and the overall potential to sustain life on any exoplanets they host. We find that early and mid-M dwarfs (M0–M5) have the potential to generate NUV flares capable of initiating abiogenesis.

<div> X-ray, Seyfert 1, absorption, emission, AGN
总结:
本文针对Mrk 1239进行了深入的X射线观测和分析。观测发现AGN在4-30keV范围内出现了5倍的强烈闪烁，主要由主要连续体的增强引起。然而，在3keV以下的范围内没有任何变化，表明AGN连续体被大约10^23.5cm^-2的中性介质完全吸收。时序和谱学特性与主要发射的模糊反射解释一致。中性吸收介质的存在排除了部分电离遮挡的可能性。如果中性吸收介质是一种流出物质，可能会与周围介质和星际介质相碰撞，产生低能连续体和碰撞电离发射。内部环的散射辐射可能产生光电离发射。数据要求的复杂环境突显了AGN和宿主星系环境之间的界面复杂性。Mrk 1239等物体是揭示AGN和宿主星系环境界面的重要来源。 <div>
Previous X-ray works on Mrk 1239 have revealed a complex narrow-line Seyfert 1 that exhibits substantial absorption and strong emission from both collisionally ionized and photoionized plasmas. Here, we report on deep-pointed observations with XMM-Newton and NuSTAR, along with Swift monitoring, to understand the 0.3–30 keV continuum emission and the central engine geometry. A strong X-ray flare, where the AGN brightens by a factor of 5 in ∼30 ks, is captured between 4 and 30 keV and can be attributed to a brightening of the primary continuum. However, the lack of any variability below ∼3 keV on long or short timescales requires complete absorption of the AGN continuum with a neutral medium of column density ∼1023.5 cm−2. The timing and spectral properties are consistent with a blurred reflection interpretation for the primary emission. The variability and presence of a Compton hump disfavors ionized partial covering. The neutral absorber, if outflowing, could be crashing into the surrounding medium and interstellar medium to produce the low-energy continuum and collisionally ionized emission. Scattered emission off the inner torus could produce the photoionized emission. The intricate scenario is demanded by the data and highlights the complexity of the environment that is normally invisible when overwhelmed by the AGN continuum. Objects like Mrk 1239 serve as important sources for unveiling the interface between the AGN and host galaxy environments.

<br />总结:
这项研究利用JWST公开数据构建了63个红移在5.6 < z < 9的星系的紫外到光学复合光谱。根据这个复合光谱，研究人员得出了平均尘埃衰减、电子密度、电子温度、电离参数和氧含量等参数。结果显示，再电离时代的星系可能正在快速积累高特定星形成率的星体，而紫外诊断显示星系主要是由星形成所导致的电离。另外，复合光谱的一些比率暗示，样本中的一些星系可能是再电离辐射的强烈贡献者。 <div>
Ultraviolet (UV; rest-frame ∼1200–2000 Å) spectra provide a wealth of diagnostics to characterize fundamental galaxy properties, such as their chemical enrichment, the nature of their stellar populations, and their amount of Lyman-continuum (LyC) radiation. In this work, we leverage publicly released JWST data to construct the rest-frame UV-to-optical composite spectrum of a sample of 63 galaxies at 5.6 < z < 9, spanning a wavelength range from 1500 to 5200 Å. Based on the composite spectrum, we derive an average dust attenuation from Hβ/Hγ, an electron density cm−3 from the [O ii] doublet ratio, an electron temperature K from the [O iii] λ4363/[O iii] λ5007 ratio, and an ionization parameter from the [O iii]/[O ii] ratio. Using a direct Te method, we calculate an oxygen abundance and a carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) abundance ratio . This C/O ratio is smaller than compared to z = 0 and z = 2–4 star-forming galaxies, albeit with moderate significance. This indicates the reionization-era galaxies might be undergoing a rapid buildup of stellar mass with high specific star formation rates. A UV diagnostic based on the ratios of C iii] λλ1907, 1909/He iiλ1640 versus O iii] λ1666/He iiλ1640 suggests that the star formation is the dominant source of ionization, similar to the local extreme dwarf galaxies and z ∼ 2–4 He ii–detected galaxies. The [O iii]/[O ii] and C iv/C iii] ratios of the composite spectrum are marginally larger than the criteria used to select galaxies as LyC leakers, suggesting that some of the galaxies in our sample are strong contributors to the reionizing radiation.

这篇文章报道了一个红移为z=0.304458±0.000007的新型绿豆星系，其具有大尺度的喷射诱导的射电发射。射电组分的光谱能量分布显示出陡峭的光谱指数，而延伸区域的光谱年龄建模表明其波束已经存在超过6百万年。关于喷流是活跃的还是休眠的问题尚不清楚。此外，测量到几个云区，距离宿主星系最远可达37.8千秒差距，并且它们的电离剖面显示出过去大约0.15百万年内AGN的电离光子产生有所下降。研究还发现一个云区呈现蓝移，与射电喷流路径重合，可能是被光电离AGN照射，也可能是与相对论喷流发生了相互作用。多波段分析表明，RGB1在较低激发的射电星系或者不活跃星系可能是在过去约0.15百万年内的喷流产生阶段过渡到了较高辐射效率的吸积阶段。不清楚RGB1是在过去约0.15百万年内过渡为了低激发射电星系或者不活跃星系，或者是延长的射电和光学发射迹中迹着有序进行的两个吸积阶段。

Jetted active galactic nuclei (AGN) hosting extended photoionized nebulae provide us with a unique view of the timescales associated with AGN activity. Here, we present a new green bean galaxy at z = 0.304458 ± 0.000007 with large-scale jet-induced radio emission. The spectral energy distributions of the radio components show steep spectral indices (α = −0.85 to −0.92 for the extended regions, and α = −1.02 for the faint radio core), and spectral age modeling of the extended radio emission indicates that the lobes are >6 Myr old. It is unclear whether the jet is active, or is a remnant with an off-time of 2–3 Myr. Several detached clouds lie around the host galaxy up to 37.8 kpc away from the nucleus, and their ionization profile indicates a decline (∼2 dex) in the AGN ionizing photon production over the past ∼0.15 Myr. Furthermore, we measure a blueshift for one of the clouds that is spatially coincident with the path of the radio jet. The cloud is likely illuminated by the photoionizing AGN, and potentially underwent an interaction with the relativistic jet. Our multiwavelength analysis suggests that RGB1 was in a phase of jet production prior to the radiatively efficient accretion phase traced by the detached cloud emission. It is unclear whether RGB1 transitioned into a low-excitation radio galaxy or an inactive galaxy over the past ∼0.15 Myr, or whether the extended radio and optical emission trace distinct accretion phases that occurred in succession.

<div> 关键词: Pantheon+, Type Ia supernova, ΩΛ, 天鹅座, 宇宙微波背景辐射

总结:
本研究分析了天鹅座+型Ia超新星样本中的宇宙学常数ΩΛ，发现了两个大尺度的不对称性。第一个不对称性与银河北-南方向密切对齐，第二个大致指向R.A.约217.°5，decl.约-26.°4，距宇宙微波背景辐射偶极子顶点约50.°9。这暗示了一个与天鹅座+超新星在天空中的分布以及银河红化校正相关的系统效应。第二个不对称性表明，在相反方向上测量的ΩΛ存在2.8σ的张力，这对我们对ΩΛ的暗能量解释具有重要影响。这可能意味着ΩΛ并不是一个真正的暗能量，而是与相对论参考系转换相关的表观效应。 <br /><br /> <div>
An analysis of the cosmological constant ΩΛ fitted to subsamples of the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernova sample spanning 2π steradians for a grid of 432 pole positions covering the whole sky reveals two large-scale asymmetries. One of them is closely aligned with the Galactic north–south direction and the other points approximately toward R.A. ∼ 217.°5, decl. ∼ −26.°4, ∼50.°9 from the cosmic microwave background dipole Apex. The signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the multiple ΩΛ measurements in these directions is 3.2 ≲ S/N ≲ 8.4. The first asymmetry is puzzling, and would indicate a systematic effect related with the distribution of Pantheon+ supernovae on the sky and, probably, how the correction for reddening in the Galaxy is calculated. The second one, which entails a 2.8-σ tension between ΩΛ measured in opposite directions, bears strong implications on our interpretation of ΩΛ as dark energy: it is consistent with the prediction for tilted observers located in a Friedmann–Robertson–Walker universe who could measure an acceleration or a deceleration with a dipolar asymmetry, irrespective of what the universe as a whole is doing. In this case, ΩΛ would not be a physical entity, a real dark energy, but an apparent effect associated with the relativistic frame of reference transformation.

Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations have shown that relativistic collisionless shocks mediated by the Weibel instability accelerate ∼1% of incoming particles, while the majority are transmitted through the shock and become thermalized. The microphysical processes that determine whether an incoming particle will be transmitted or reflected are poorly understood. We study the microphysics of particle reflection in Weibel-mediated shocks by tracking a shell of test particles in a PIC simulation of a shock in pair plasma. We find that electrons in positron-dominated filaments and positrons in electron-dominated filaments efficiently reflect off of strong magnetic structures at the shock. To participate in diffusive shock acceleration, however, these reflected particles headed toward the upstream must avoid getting advected downstream. This is enabled by incoming filaments, which trap reflected particles carrying the same sign of current as the filaments. The final injection efficiency on the order of ∼1% thus results from the effectiveness of the initial reflection at the shock and the reflected particles’ probability of survival in the upstream postreflection. We develop a model that predicts the fraction of high-energy particles as a function of the properties of Weibel filamentation.

<br />
这项研究利用哈勃空间望远镜、Apache Point Observatory 和 Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array的观测结果，对塞弗特1星系NGC 3227中的离子化、中性和温暖分子气体的运动学进行了表征。研究人员使用多个高斯函数拟合了长狭缝和积分场光谱观测的多个空间分辨发射线，并根据明显的旋转和流出运动分离了这些运动学。他们利用这些运动学数据确定了一个双锥形结构的方向，沿着这个方向发生了流出。发现双锥结构的倾斜角度为°，半张角的内外边界分别为°和°。他们观察到离子化物质以每秒500公里的速度从超大质量黑洞（SMBH）处向外流动，距离可以达到7″（800 pc），并且在距离15″（1.7 kpc）的地方观察到扰动的离子化气体。他们的分析揭示了离子化流从距离SMBH不到20 pc的地方发射，与Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array CO(2–1)观测中探测到的核心周围冷气体的桥相同位置。研究人员还测量了气体开始减速的半径，距离活动星系核心26 ± 6 pc。他们确认，与来自辐射加速模型的31-63 pc范围内的转换半径相比，辐射加速机制是NGC 3227的窄线区流的主要加速机制。  
<br /><br />总结: <br />该研究利用多种天文观测手段对NGC 3227星系中的气体运动学进行了详细表征，确定了双锥结构的方向和相关参数，观察到离子化物质的流出以及加速和减速的过程，最终确认了辐射加速机制对于星系中窄线区流的主导作用。 <div>
We have characterized the ionized, neutral, and warm molecular gas kinematics in the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 3227 using observations from the Hubble Space Telescope Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph, Apache Point Observatory’s Kitt Peak Ohio State Multi-Object Spectrograph, Gemini-North’s Near-Infrared Integral Field Spectrometer, and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. We fit multiple Gaussians to several spatially resolved emission lines observed with long-slit and integral-field spectroscopy and isolate the kinematics based on apparent rotational and outflowing motions. We use the kinematics to determine an orientation for the bicone along which the outflows travel and find that the biconical structure has an inclination of ° from our line of sight and a half-opening angle with an inner and outer boundary of ° and °, respectively. We observe ionized outflows traveling 500 km s−1 at distances up to 7″ (800 pc) from the supermassive black hole (SMBH) and disturbed ionized gas up to a distance of 15″ (1.7 kpc). Our analysis reveals that the ionized outflows are launched from within 20 pc of the SMBH, at the same location as a bridge of cold gas across the nucleus detected in Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array CO(2–1) observations. We measure a turnover radius where the gas starts decelerating at a distance of 26 ± 6 pc from the active galactic nucleus. Compared to a turnover radius in the range of 31−63 pc from a radiative driving model, we confirm that radiative driving is the dominant acceleration mechanism for the narrow-line region outflows in NGC 3227.

<div> 中性氢，再电离时期，DOM，干涉测量视宁，功率谱

总结:
中性氢再电离时期（EoR）的探测关键在于将宇宙信号与主导的前景辐射分离开来。作者开发了直接最优映射（DOM）来映射干涉视宁，其中只包含了线性运算，并且完全了解了从视宁到图像的点扩散函数。通过对DOM图像计算基于快速傅里叶变换的图像功率谱及其窗函数，我们使用基于重离子时期阵列第I阶段配置的无噪声模拟来研究图像功率谱的性质。窗函数显示前景主导区域中泄漏出来的综合功率小于10^-11进入EoR窗口；2D和1D功率谱也验证了前景和EoR之间的分离。 <div>
The key to detecting neutral hydrogen during the epoch of reionization (EoR) is to separate the cosmological signal from the dominating foreground radiation. We developed direct optimal mapping (DOM) to map interferometric visibilities; it contains only linear operations, with full knowledge of point spread functions from visibilities to images. Here, we demonstrate a fast Fourier transform-based image power spectrum and its window functions computed from the DOM images. We use noiseless simulation, based on the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array Phase I configuration, to study the image power spectrum properties. The window functions show <10−11 of the integrated power leaks from the foreground-dominated region into the EoR window; the 2D and 1D power spectra also verify the separation between the foregrounds and the EoR.

总结:
电离激波可以通过上游离子反射引起湍流，本研究阐明了静电和电磁不稳定性的特性，探讨了它们在超相对论范围内的作用。特别是发现斜向布尼曼波和先前忽视的次级小尺度离子-电子不稳定性在相对论范围内得到了促进。此外，在任何冷却、重载的先导区域中，大尺度电磁模式的生长会遇到严重限制。文章认为，在静电模式中电子预加热可能缓解这些限制，有利于超相对论激波先导区中大尺度细丝状模式的进一步生长。 <div>
Collisionless shocks are known to induce turbulence via upstream ion reflection within the precursor region. This study elucidates the properties of electrostatic and electromagnetic instabilities, exploring their role over the transrelativistic range. Notably, the growth of oblique Buneman waves and previously overlooked, secondary, small-scale ion–electron instabilities is observed to be particularly promoted in the relativistic regime. Furthermore, the growth of large-scale electromagnetic modes encounters severe limitations in any cold, baryon-loaded precursor. It is argued that electron preheating in electrostatic modes may alleviate these constraints, facilitating the subsequent growth of large-scale filamentation modes in the precursors of transrelativistic shocks.

<br />
这项工作介绍了银河系成像卷轴绘画项目针对Maddalena巨型分子云（GMC）的数据。我们使用修改后的树状图算法将观测区域的13CO发射数据立方体分解为分级次结构。我们研究了这些分级结构的统计特性，并探讨了自身重力在不同空间尺度上的作用。我们呈现了这些分级结构的质量（M）、半径（R）、速度离散度（σv）、维里参数（αvir）和声速马赫数的统计数据。分级结构的半径和质量分布以及σv-R比例关系与以往使用非分级算法识别实体的研究结果相似。我们发现，对于分级结构，随着其半径或质量的增加，αvir会减小。Maddalena GMC的安静区域中，大多数分级结构不受重力束缚（αvir > 2），而在形成星系的区域中，大多数分级结构是受重力束缚的（αvir < 2）。此外，我们发现在IRAS 06453形成星系区域的0.8-4 pc尺度上，自身重力起着重要作用，而在非形成星系区域的5 pc以下尺度上则不是重要因素。 <br /><br />总结: 这项工作使用13CO发射数据对Maddalena GMC进行了分级结构分解，研究了这些结构的统计特性并探讨了自身重力的作用。研究表明，在星系形成区域，大部分结构受到重力影响，而在非形成星系区域，自身重力影响较小。 <div>
In this work, we present data from the Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting project for the Maddalena giant molecular cloud (GMC). We decompose the 13CO emission datacube of the observed region into hierarchical substructures using a modified dendrogram algorithm. We investigate the statistical properties of these substructures and examine the role that self-gravity plays on various spatial scales. The statistics of the mass (M), radius (R), velocity dispersion (σv), virial parameter (αvir), and sonic Mach number of the substructures are presented. The radius and mass distributions and the σv–R scaling relationship of the substructures resemble those reported in previous studies that use nonhierarchical algorithms to identify the entities. We find that for the hierarchical substructures αvir decreases as the radius or mass of the substructures increases. The majority of the substructures in the quiescent region of the Maddalena GMC are not gravitationally bound (αvir > 2), while most of the substructures in the star-forming regions are gravitationally bound (αvir < 2). Furthermore, we find that self-gravity plays an important role on scales of 0.8–4 pc in the IRAS 06453 star-forming region, while it is not an important factor on scales below 5 pc in the non-star-forming region.

We perform the numerical simulations of axisymmetric, relativistic, optically thin jets under the influence of the radiation field of an accretion disk. We show that starting from a very low injection velocity at the base, jets can be accelerated to relativistic terminal speeds when traveling through the radiation field. The jet gains momentum through the interaction with the radiation field. We use a relativistic equation of state for multispecies plasma, which self-consistently calculates the adiabatic index for the jet material. All the jet solutions obtained are transonic in nature. In addition to the acceleration of the jet to relativistic speeds, our results show that the radiation field also acts as a collimating agent. The jets remain well collimated under the effect of radiation pressure. We also show that if the jet starts with a rotational velocity, the radiation field will reduce the angular momentum of the jet beam.

To investigate gravity in the nonlinear regime of cosmic structure using measurements from stage IV surveys, it is imperative to accurately compute large-scale structure observables, such as nonlinear matter power spectra, for gravity models that extend beyond general relativity. However, the theoretical predictions of nonlinear observables are typically derived from N-body simulations, which demand substantial computational resources. In this study, we introduce a novel public emulator, termed FREmu, designed to provide rapid and precise forecasts of nonlinear power spectra specifically for the Hu–Sawicki f(R) gravity model across scales 0.0089h Mpc−1 < k < 0.5h Mpc−1 and redshifts 0 < z < 3. FREmu leverages principal component analysis and artificial neural networks to establish a mapping from parameters to power spectra, utilizing training data derived from the Quijote-MG simulation suite. With a parameter space encompassing seven dimensions, including Ωm, Ωb, h, ns, σ8, Mν, and , the emulator achieves an accuracy exceeding 95% for the majority of cases, thus proving to be highly efficient for constraining parameters.

<title>The Incompressible Magnetohydrodynamic Energy Cascade Rate Upstream of Mars: Effects of the Total Energy and the Cross-helicity on Solar Wind Turbulence</title>

Solar wind turbulence is a dynamical phenomenon that evolves with heliocentric distance. Orbiting Mars since 2014 September, Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN offers a unique opportunity to explore some of its main properties beyond ∼1.38 au. Here, we analyze solar wind turbulence upstream of Mars' bow shock, utilizing more than 5 years of magnetic field and plasma measurements. This analysis is based on two complementary methodologies: (1) the computation of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) invariants characterizing incompressible fluctuations; (2) the estimation of the incompressible energy cascade rate at MHD scales (i.e., 〈εT〉MHD). Our results show the solar wind incompressible fluctuations are primarily in a magnetically dominated regime, with the component traveling away from the Sun having a higher median pseudoenergy. Moreover, turbulent fluctuations have a total energy per mass of up to ∼ 300 km2 s−2, a range smaller than reported at 1 au. For these conditions, we determine the probability distribution function of 〈εT〉MHD ranges mainly between ∼ −1 × 10−16 and ∼1 × 10−16 J m−3 s −1, with a median equal to −1.8 × 10−18 J m−3 s −1, suggesting back transfer of energy. Our results also suggest that ∣〈εT〉MHD∣ is correlated with the total energy per mass of fluctuations and that the median of 〈εT〉MHD does not vary significantly with the cross-helicity. We find, however, that the medians of the inward and outward pseudoenergy cascade rates vary with the solar wind cross-helicity. Finally, we discuss these results and their implications for future studies that can provide further insight into the factors affecting the solar wind energy transfer rate.

<title>On the Origin of Solar Hemispheric Helicity Rules: Rise of 3D Magnetic Flux Concentrations through a Background Magnetic Field</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Sunspots and active regions observed on the solar surface are widely believed to be manifestations of compact predominantly toroidal magnetic field structures (“flux tubes”) that emerge by magnetic buoyancy from the deeper interior of the Sun. Much work has examined the evolution of such magnetic structures, typically considering them as idealized isolated magnetic entities and not as more realistic magnetic concentrations in a volume-filling background magnetic field. Here, we report results that explore the buoyant rise dynamics of magnetic concentrations in a volume-filling field in the full three dimensions. Earlier 2.5D work in this series established the remarkable fact that the twist orientation of a flux concentration relative to the background field affected its likelihood to rise and emerge, regardless of whether the buoyant rise took place in the absence or presence of convection. The contrasting dynamics between structures with differing orientations lead to a selection mechanism that reproduces characteristics of the “solar hemispheric helicity rule(s)” observations strikingly well. Here, we show that this two-dimensional selection mechanism persists in the face of the added complexity of three-dimensional dynamics. Arching of the magnetic structure in the third dimension, as might be expected in the solar application, is introduced. The role of tension force leading to this selection mechanism is elucidated and subtle differences that arise due to the three-dimensional geometry are discussed.

<title>Insights from Optical Fe ii Emission in Quasars</title>

The complexity of the energy levels in Fe ii has made it difficult to theoretically interpret its observational emission spectrum. However, addressing this challenge could provide valuable insights into the main sequence of QSOs using “eigenvector 1” and the chemical evolution of the Universe. Although the templates based on I Zw 1 are widely used, their universality remains unexplained. To address this, we utilized the CLOUDY spectral synthesis code to generate theoretical blends of Fe ii optical emission near the Hβ region. Our results indicate that the optimal cloud density and photon flux align with previous studies at gas density 1011 cm−3 and photon flux 1020.5 cm−2 s−1. We discovered a broad parameter region that fits the data well, encompassing a diverse range of densities and photon fluxes. This helps to explain the general applicability of optical templates. Additionally, we investigated the effects of different spectral energy distributions (SEDs), Eddington ratios, turbulence, and cloud column densities and found that they provided a sufficiently broad range for typical emitting clouds. We found different SEDs had a negligible impact on the template shape, further expanding the usability of empirical templates. However, they significantly affected the absolute intensity of Fe ii emission, consistent with previous research. Furthermore, we determined that a turbulence of approximately 100 km s−1 is necessary to produce sufficiently strong optical Fe ii, and either a column density greater than 1024 cm−2, which is typical for Fe ii UV emission, or an abundance higher than solar is preferred.

本研究使用Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager/Solar Dynamics Observatory数据，对2010年5月至2015年5月的62个太阳活动区进行分析。研究表明，磁螺度与磁螺度通量和磁扭曲存在关系，但与动力学螺度无关。这表明太阳活动区上空的磁螺度主要来源于磁扭曲，而在光球以下区域的流体动力学并非太阳活动区磁螺度的主要来源。 <div>
Using Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager/Solar Dynamics Observatory data, we search for a relationship between kinetic helicity and magnetic helicity in solar active regions (ARs) using a sample of 62 ARs from 2010 May to 2015 May. The sample includes 32 mature ARs and 30 emerging ARs. We calculate kinetic helicity in the interior in the depth range from 0.6 to 11.6 Mm, magnetic helicity in the corona, helicity flux across the photosphere, and the magnetic twist and magnetic writhe of the ARs at the photosphere. From these data, relationships are found between magnetic helicity, helicity flux, and magnetic twist. However, magnetic writhe appears not to be related to the other magnetic quantities. No relationship is found between the kinetic helicity and any magnetic quantity. In particular, no relationship is found between the kinetic helicity and any of the following: magnetic helicity, magnetic helicity flux, magnetic twist, or magnetic writhe. These results suggest that (1) the magnetic helicity in the corona above ARs is mainly derived from the magnetic twist, and (2) the flow dynamics in the region from 0.6 to 11.6 Mm below the photosphere is not the primary source for the generation of magnetic helicity in ARs.

The Kepler mission reveals a peculiar trough-peak feature in the orbital spacing of close-in planets near mean-motion resonances: a deficit and an excess that are, respectively, a couple of percent interior to and wide of the resonances. This feature has received two main classes of explanations: one involving eccentricity damping and the other scattering with small bodies. Here, we point out a few issues with the damping scenario and study the scattering scenario in more detail. We elucidate why scattering small bodies tends to repel two planets. As the small bodies random-walk in energy and angular momentum space, they tend to absorb fractionally more energy than angular momentum. This, which we call “ping-pong repulsion,” transports angular momentum from the inner to the outer planet and pushes the two planets apart. Such a process, even if ubiquitous, leaves identifiable marks only near first-order resonances: diverging pairs jump across the resonance quickly and produce the mean-motion resonance asymmetry. To explain the observed positions of the trough-peaks, a total scattering mass of order a few percent of the planet masses is required. Moreover, if this mass is dominated by a handful of Mercury-sized bodies, one can also explain the planet eccentricities as inferred from transit-time variations. Last, we suggest how these conditions may have naturally arisen during the late stages of planet formation.

本文研究了银河系中铋的来源问题，通过在恒星天体物理实验模块中模拟新星的演化过程，发现元素扩散可以显著增加新星中的7Be丰度，从而解释了观测到的几乎所有新星。通过群体合成方法计算了银河中铋的产量，发现大约73%的铋是由新星产生的，这表明新星是银河系中铋的重要来源。 <div>
The source of the Galactic lithium (Li) has long been a puzzle. With the discovery of Li in novae, extensive research has been conducted. However, there still exists a significant disparity between the observed abundance of Li in novae and the existing theoretical predictions. Using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics, we simulate the evolution of novae with element diffusion and appropriately increase the amount of 3He in the mixtures. Element diffusion enhances the transport efficiency between the nuclear reaction zone and the convective region on the surface of the white dwarf (WD) during nova eruptions, which results in more 7Be being transmitted to the WD surface and ultimately ejected. Compared to the previous predictions, the abundance of 7Be in novae simulated in our model significantly increases. The result is able to explain almost all observed novae. Using the method of population synthesis, we calculate Li yield in the Galaxy. We find that the Galactic occurrence rate of novae is about 130 yr−1, and about 110 M⊙ Li produced by nova eruption is ejected into the interstellar medium (ISM). About 73% of Li in the Galactic ISM originates from novae and approximately 15%–20% of the entire Galaxy. This means that novae are the important source of Li in the Galaxy.

总结: 
本研究探讨了在相对论性高温未磁化电子-正电子等离子体中传播的无碰撞激波。我们估计了相对论热等离子体中激波的耗散比例，表明即使激波不是高度相对论性，耗散也足够大，可以解释伽马射线暴的观测结果。通过二维粒子在格模拟表明，与冷上游等离子体不同，在模拟时间内激波前面的韦贝尔不稳定性产生了磁场，然而没有粒子被加速。在热等离子体情况下，下游区域中磁场的衰减速度与激波速度较慢。基于下游磁场的缓慢衰减，我们提出了一个模型，用于在大范围下游区域生成磁场，这是伽马射线暴余辉的标准模型所要求的。 <div>
In this work, we investigate collisionless shocks propagating in a relativistically hot unmagnetized electron–positron plasma. We estimate the dissipation fraction at shocks in the relativistically hot plasma, showing that it is sufficiently large to explain the observation of gamma-ray bursts even when the shock is not highly relativistic. It is shown by two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations that magnetic fields are generated around the shock front by the Weibel instability, as in the cold upstream plasma. However, in contrast to the cold upstream plasma, no particles are accelerated at the shock in the simulation time of . The decay of the magnetic field in the downstream region is slower for slower shock velocities in the hot plasma cases. Applying the slow decay of the downstream magnetic field, we propose a model that generates magnetic fields in the large downstream region, which is required from the standard model of the gamma-ray burst afterglow.

这项研究使用国际间边界探测器（IBEX）测量的能量中性原子（ENA）强度来研究太阳圈层的边界区域。研究发现在100到500电子伏特能量范围内，模型预测的ENA强度普遍低估了实际测量值。通过将观测到的ENA强度转换为不同天空方向的等离子体压力，并考虑这对我们对太阳圈层和观察到的ENA来源的理解的影响。这表明我们对太阳圈层的理解还存在一些不足，需要进一步研究来解决这些问题。 <br /><br />总结: 能量中性原子（ENAs）的观测强度比模型预测低，需要重新考虑太阳圈层的边界和ENA来源的问题。 <div>
Energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) from the heliosphere are a unique means to remotely image the boundary regions of our heliosphere. The Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) has been very successful in measuring these ENAs since 2008 at energies from tens of eV to 6 keV. The main question raised by one solar cycle of IBEX-Lo observations at 0.05–2 keV is the strong and ubiquitous underestimation of several model predictions compared with actually measured ENA intensities at energies between 100 and 500 eV. This study converts the observed ENA intensities into plasma pressures for different sky directions and considers the implications for our understanding of the heliosheath and the source of the observed ENAs.

<div> 观测, 模拟, 星等, 衰变时间, 质量流失率
总结:<br /><br />本研究对具有IIn特征的39颗II型超新星进行了紫外/光学/近红外观测和建模，以及35颗无IIn特征的“比较”II型超新星进行了比较。观测结果表明，早期IIn特征与峰值紫外光亮度、上升时间及质量流失率有显著相关性，并且具有IIn特征的II型超新星呈现出增强的峰值亮度。通过辐射流体力学和非局部热动力学辐射传输模拟，我们对样本中的质量流失率和CSM密度进行了定量分析，发现电子散射增宽的线型与推测的质量流失率之间存在趋势。 <div>
We present ultraviolet/optical/near-infrared observations and modeling of Type II supernovae (SNe II) whose early time (δt < 2 days) spectra show transient, narrow emission lines from shock ionization of confined (r < 1015 cm) circumstellar material (CSM). The observed electron-scattering broadened line profiles (i.e., IIn-like) of H i, He i/ii, C iv, and N iii/iv/v from the CSM persist on a characteristic timescale (tIIn) that marks a transition to a lower-density CSM and the emergence of Doppler-broadened features from the fast-moving SN ejecta. Our sample, the largest to date, consists of 39 SNe with early time IIn-like features in addition to 35 “comparison” SNe with no evidence of early time IIn-like features, all with ultraviolet observations. The total sample includes 50 unpublished objects with a total of 474 previously unpublished spectra and 50 multiband light curves, collected primarily through the Young Supernova Experiment and Global Supernova Project collaborations. For all sample objects, we find a significant correlation between peak ultraviolet brightness and both tIIn and the rise time, as well as evidence for enhanced peak luminosities in SNe II with IIn-like features. We quantify mass-loss rates and CSM density for the sample through the matching of peak multiband absolute magnitudes, rise times, tIIn, and optical SN spectra with a grid of radiation hydrodynamics and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium radiative-transfer simulations. For our grid of models, all with the same underlying explosion, there is a trend between the duration of the electron-scattering broadened line profiles and inferred mass-loss rate: (0.01 M⊙ yr−1)] days.

<div> 暗物质，测量星系的旋转速度，静态流体，不稳定性，引力场<br />
总结:<br />
本研究利用低表面亮度星系作为实验室，研究暗物质的方程状态以及自引力结构的特性。结果发现，用于解释观察到的旋转速度的配置是不稳定的，由此得出结论：暗物质晕不处于静力平衡状态，不具有球对称性，或者不是静态的。 <div>
Low-surface-brightness galaxies are excellent laboratories, where stars and baryonic matter act as tracers of the gravitational potential of the dark matter halo. If dark matter is modeled as a perfect fluid, then spherically symmetric and static dark matter halos in hydrostatic equilibrium demand that dark matter should have an intrinsic pressure that counteracts the gravitational attraction that the dark matter halo exerts on itself. This static fluid (a dark-matter-dominated system, where the presence of baryons is negligible) has a specific equation of state for each rotational velocity profile of the stars in galaxies. In this work, we study the dark matter equation of state needed for the self-gravitating object to produce a gravitational potential such that the tracers follow the universal rotational velocity profile for stars of spiral galaxies proposed by Persic et al. and analyze the properties of the self-gravitating structures that emerge from this equation of state. The resulting configurations explaining the observed rotational speeds are found to be unstable. We conclude that the halo is not in hydrostatic equilibrium, it is nonspherically symmetric, or it is not static if the universal velocity profile should be valid for fitting the rotational velocity curve of the galaxies.

总结: 
本研究对发表文章中的表1进行了数值修正，同时更新了红巨星分支和比辉距离的比较图。在文章中的主要结论是，比辉距离与金属丰度之间并没有统计显著的相关性。通过更新后的回归分析，发现“统计平坦”的回归方程为Δμo(Cepheid − TRGB) = −0.028 (±0.019) × ([O/H] − 8.50) − 0.014 (±0.042)。<br /><br />总结: 本研究对比辉距离与红巨星分支的关系进行了修正和更新，确认了它们与金属丰度之间的相关性不显著的结论。 <div>
Updates and corrections are made to a number of numerical entries and their references in Table 1 of the published article. Updated plots of the final run of the comparison of the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) and Cepheid distances with metallicity, as seen in the lower panels of Figures 1 and 2 in the published article, are shown in the composite figure given here (Figure 1). The main conclusion of the published article, that there is no statistically significant correlation of the zero-point of the Cepheid period–luminosity relation with metallicity, is unchanged. The updated “statistically flat” regression is now found to be Δμo(Cepheid − TRGB) = −0.028 (±0.019) × ([O/H] − 8.50) − 0.014 (±0.042).

Omega Centauri (ω Cen) is the most massive globular cluster of the Milky Way. It is thought to be the nucleus of an accreted dwarf galaxy because of its high mass and its complex stellar populations. To decipher its formation history and study its dynamics, we created the most comprehensive kinematic catalog for its inner region, by analyzing both archival and new Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data. Our catalog contains 1,395,781 proper-motion measurements out to the half-light radius of the cluster ( ) and down to mF625W ≈ 25 mag. The typical baseline for our proper-motion measurements is 20 yr, leading to a median 1D proper motion precision of ∼11 μas yr−1 for stars with mF625W ≈ 18 mag, with even better precision (∼6.6 μas yr−1) achieved in the extensively observed centermost ( ) region. In addition to our astrometric measurements, we also obtained precise HST photometry in seven filters spanning from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared. This allows detailed color–magnitude diagram studies and separation of the multiple stellar populations of the cluster. In this work, we describe the data reduction used to obtain both the photometric and the proper-motion measurements. We also illustrate the creation and the content of our catalog, which is made publicly available. Finally, we present measurements of the plane-of-sky rotation of ω Cen in the previously unprobed inner few arcminutes and a precise measurement of the inclination, i = 43.°9 ± 1.°3.

<div> NGC 7789, M67, blue straggler stars, barium abundances, asymptotic-giant-branch mass transfer
<br />
这项研究调查了NGC 7789（年龄1.6亿年）和M67（年龄4亿年）两个开放星团中蓝跳巨星中钡（Ba）的丰度，作为巨星分支的质量转移的标志。研究结合了之前对NGC 6819（年龄2.5亿年）和NGC 188（年龄7亿年）的钡丰度分析。在研究的35颗BSSs中，43% ± 11%的星体富集了钡，而NGC 188中的BSSs没有富集钡。富集了钡的BSSs的丰度与星团的年龄呈反相关，从NGC 7789中的钡富集约为[Ba/Fe]∼+1.5 dex到M67中的约为[Ba/Fe]∼+1.0 dex。富集了钡的BSSs都位于H-R图的相同区域，而与星团的年龄或距离主序转折点的距离无关。数据表明了AGB捐赠者质量和BSSs质量转移效率之间的关联，较小质量的AGB捐赠者倾向于进行更保守的质量转移。40% ± 16%的富集了钡的BSSs是具有小于5000天轨道周期的长周期光谱双星。那些表现出径向速度变化的富集了钡的BSSs表明通过风质量转移或风罗奇波溢出在宽双星中进行AGB质量转移。考虑到M67和NGC 188中BSSs的长轨道周期的普遍性以及在NGC 7789、NGC 6819和M67中富集了钡的频率，AGB质量转移可能是1亿年以上的开放星团中BSS形成的主要机制。 
<br />
总结: NGC 7789和M67中发现43%的蓝跳巨星富集了钡，这与星团年龄呈反相关。AGB捐赠者的质量与BSSs质量转移的效率呈关联，而40%的富集了钡的BSSs是长周期光谱双星。AGB质量转移可能是1亿年以上开放星团中BSS形成的主要机制。 <div>
We investigate barium (Ba) abundances in blue straggler stars (BSSs) in two open clusters, NGC 7789 (1.6 Gyr) and M67 (4 Gyr), as signatures of asymptotic-giant-branch (AGB) mass transfer. We combine our findings with previous Ba abundance analyses of NGC 6819 (2.5 Gyr) and NGC 188 (7 Gyr). Out of 35 BSSs studied in NGC 7789, NGC 6819, and M67, 15 (43% ± 11%) are Ba enriched; no BSSs in NGC 188 are Ba enriched. The Ba abundances of enriched BSSs show an anticorrelation with cluster age, ranging from an enrichment of [Ba/Fe] ∼ +1.5 dex in NGC 7789 to [Ba/Fe] ∼ +1.0 dex in M67. The Ba-enriched BSSs all lie in the same region of the H-R diagram, irrespective of cluster age or distance from the main-sequence turnoff. Our data suggest a link between AGB donor mass and mass-transfer efficiency in BSSs, in that less massive AGB donors tend to undergo more conservative mass transfer. We find that 40% ± 16% of the Ba-enriched BSSs are in longer-period spectroscopic binaries with orbital periods less than 5000 days. Those Ba-enriched BSSs that do not exhibit radial-velocity variability suggest AGB mass transfer in wide binaries by either wind mass transfer or wind Roche-lobe overflow. Given the preponderance of long orbital periods in the BSSs of M67 and NGC 188 and the frequency of Ba enrichment in NGC 7789, NGC 6819, and M67, it may be that AGB mass transfer is the dominant mechanism of BSS formation in open clusters older than 1 Gyr.

这篇论文介绍了利用机器学习技术来增加具有多种金属元素的白矮星的数量。研究使用了来自Gaia DR3 BP/RP (XP)光谱的96,134颗白矮星，通过应用一种名为均匀流形近似和投影（UMAP）的无监督机器学习技术，将这些白矮星组织成可识别的光谱区域的2D地图。污染的白矮星是在地图中被识别出来的一个明显的光谱群体。研究表明，这种选择方法有潜力将已知白矮星大气中五种或更多金属物质的数量增加一个数量级。这些系统对于表征外行星的多样性和地质学是至关重要的。 
<br /><br />总结：本文介绍了利用机器学习技术增加白矮星的数量，通过分析96,134颗白矮星的光谱，并使用UMAP技术得出一个2D地图，将污染的白矮星从其他光谱区域中区分开来，这种选择方法有望将已知白矮星大气中五种或更多金属物质的数量增加一个数量级。 <div>
White dwarfs (WDs) polluted by exoplanetary material provide the unprecedented opportunity to directly observe the interiors of exoplanets. However, spectroscopic surveys are often limited by brightness constraints, and WDs tend to be very faint, making detections of large populations of polluted WDs difficult. In this paper, we aim to increase considerably the number of WDs with multiple metals in their atmospheres. Using 96,134 WDs with Gaia DR3 BP/RP (XP) spectra, we constructed a 2D map using an unsupervised machine-learning technique called Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) to organize the WDs into identifiable spectral regions. The polluted WDs are among the distinct spectral groups identified in our map. We have shown that this selection method could potentially increase the number of known WDs with five or more metal species in their atmospheres by an order of magnitude. Such systems are essential for characterizing exoplanet diversity and geology.

Gravitational lensing by massive objects along the line of sight to the source causes distortions to gravitational wave (GW) signals; such distortions may reveal information about fundamental physics, cosmology, and astrophysics. In this work, we have extended the search for lensing signatures to all binary black hole events from the third observing run of the LIGO-Virgo network. We search for repeated signals from strong lensing by (1) performing targeted searches for subthreshold signals, (2) calculating the degree of overlap among the intrinsic parameters and sky location of pairs of signals, (3) comparing the similarities of the spectrograms among pairs of signals, and (4) performing dual-signal Bayesian analysis that takes into account selection effects and astrophysical knowledge. We also search for distortions to the gravitational waveform caused by (1) frequency-independent phase shifts in strongly lensed images, and (2) frequency-dependent modulation of the amplitude and phase due to point masses. None of these searches yields significant evidence for lensing. Finally, we use the nondetection of GW lensing to constrain the lensing rate based on the latest merger-rate estimates and the fraction of dark matter composed of compact objects.

在这项研究中，研究人员利用UVCANDELS对0.5≤z≤3范围内约16,000个类似盘状星系的半光半径进行了测量。他们发现，在整个红移范围内，盘状星系的恒星质量-大小关系在紫外光学和光学区域的斜率不同，主要受到质量较大的星系（≳1010M⊙）的影响，这些星系也隶属于最富含尘埃的星系之一。研究结果与已有的文献一致，一般被解释为星系内部的先内后外增长。然而，他们还指出这可能是因为质量较大的星系中心区域的遮挡作用更强。通过对VELA模拟组中z=2的星系进行建模和选择，研究人员表明，仅仅是尘埃的影响就能解释在z=2时所测得的大小差异。这表明在不同波长下，大小差异和恒星质量-大小关系的不同斜率并不构成星系内部先内后外增长的证据。<br /><br />总结: 这项研究利用UVCANDELS对类似盘状星系的大小进行测量，发现在不同波长下的大小差异以及恒星质量-大小关系的不同斜率并不构成星系内部先内后外增长的证据。这些差异可能仅仅是由尘埃的影响造成的。 <div>
We use the Ultraviolet Imaging of the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey fields (UVCANDELS) to measure half-light radii in the rest-frame far-UV for ∼16,000 disk-like galaxies over 0.5 ≤ z ≤ 3. We compare these results to rest-frame optical sizes that we measure in a self-consistent way and find that the stellar mass–size relation of disk galaxies is steeper in the rest-frame UV than in the optical across our entire redshift range. We show that this is mainly driven by massive galaxies (≳1010M⊙), which we find to also be among the most dusty. Our results are consistent with the literature and have commonly been interpreted as evidence of inside-out growth wherein galaxies form their central structures first. However, they could also suggest that the centers of massive galaxies are more heavily attenuated than their outskirts. We distinguish between these scenarios by modeling and selecting galaxies at z = 2 from the VELA simulation suite in a way that is consistent with UVCANDELS. We show that the effects of dust alone can account for the size differences we measure at z = 2. This indicates that, at different wavelengths, size differences and the different slopes of the stellar mass–size relation do not constitute evidence for inside-out growth.

High-redshift (z > 3) γ-ray blazars are rare, but they are crucial for our understanding of jet evolution, γ-ray production and propagation, and the growth of supermassive black holes in the early Universe. A new analysis of Fermi-LAT data reveals a significant (5σ), spectrally soft (Γ ≃ 3.0) γ-ray source in a specific 4 month epoch, cospatial with PKS 0201+113 (z = 3.64). Monitoring of PKS 0201+113 at 15 GHz by the Owens Valley Radio Observatory 40 m telescope from 2008 to 2023 shows a prominent flare that dominates the radio light curve. The maximum of the radio flare coincides with the γ-ray flare, strongly suggesting an association (p-value = 0.023) between the γ-ray and the radio sources. PKS 0201+113 is only the third γ-ray blazar to be identified with z > 3.5, and it is the first such object to be identified by the detection of quasi-simultaneous γ-ray and radio flares. The jet properties of this peculiar blazar have been investigated. A detailed study of a two-zone leptonic model is presented that fits the broadband spectral energy distribution. An alternative scenario is also briefly discussed.

We estimate the absolute age of the globular cluster NGC 3201 using 10,000 sets of theoretical isochrones constructed through Monte Carlo simulation using the Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Program. These isochrones take into consideration the uncertainty introduced by the choice of stellar evolution parameters. We fit isochrones with three detached eclipsing binaries and obtained an age independent of distance. We also fit isochrones with differential reddening corrected Hubble Space Telescope photometry data utilizing two different Hess diagram-based fitting methods. Results from three different methods analyzing two different types of data agree to within 1σ, and we find the absolute age of NGC 3201 = 11.85 ± 0.74 Gyr. We also perform a variable importance analysis to study the uncertainty contribution from individual parameters, and we find the distance is the dominant source of uncertainty in photometry-based analysis, while total metallicity, helium abundance, α-element abundance, mixing length, and treatment of helium diffusion are an important source of uncertainties for all three methods.

太阳极区的经向流动对太阳的磁场结构和强度以及太阳活动周期起着重要作用。然而，关于太阳极区的经向流动仍不清楚。Hinode观测显示，极区的磁通量密度从较低的纬度向极点减小。使用表面磁通输运模型，我们模拟了全球径向磁场，以探索导致观测到的极区磁分布模式的物理过程。首次使用Hinode直接观测到的极区磁场高分辨率数据来约束模拟结果。我们的模拟重现了观测到的极区磁场的特性，表明太阳极区存在一个反向的经向流，其最大振幅约为3 m/s。 <div>

However, the meridional flow near the solar poles is still unclear. The Hinode observations show that the magnetic flux density in polar caps decreases from the lower latitudes to the poles. Using a surface flux transport model, we simulate the global radial magnetic field to explore the physical process leading to the observed polar magnetic distribution pattern. For the first time, the high-resolution observations of the polar magnetic fields observed by Hinode are used to directly constrain the simulation. Our simulation reproduces the observed properties of the polar magnetic fields, suggesting the existence of a counter-cell meridional flow in the solar polar caps with a maximum amplitude of about 3 m s−1.

We report the first time-dependent spectral atlas of a coronal mass ejection (CME) observed by the Hinode/Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS). EIS observed the Cartwheel CME on 2008 April 9 at 09:30–10:00 UT in its full wavelength range and captured the bright core containing prominence material as it passed across the slit field of view. The measurement of the differential emission measure (DEM) showed that the observation captured two plasma components, a coronal component at Log T ≈ 6.05 K and a cold component at Log T ≈ 5.30 K, which we interpret as the prominence material in the CME core. We used this DEM to develop a spectral atlas for the four EIS spectra containing the CME material and the pre- and postevent spectra. These observations provide the basis for studying CME plasma evolution in the low solar corona, as well as guide observations from the current and upcoming spectrometers, including Solar Orbiter/SPICE, Solar-C/EUVST, and MUSE, which will advance our understanding of CME plasma evolution.

<div> 关键词: ΛCDM, subhalo populations, Symfind, Rockstar, dark matter simulation

总结: 
ΛCDM理论意味着对亚星团种群特性的实际预测存在着困难，新的Symfind粒子跟踪亚星团发现者可以追踪亚星团到数量级较低的质量。相比常用的Rockstar和consistent-trees方法，Symfind可以发现更多的亚星团并且在分辨率提高时亚星团数量也增加。实验结果显示Rockstar在小亚星团计数上似乎已经收敛。此外，研究还发现Rockstar对于亚星团质量函数、径向分布和破裂质量存在假解。Symfind可以追踪已解决的亚星团直至典型星系破裂点，而无需后期孤儿模型。作者还公开发布了Symfind在Symphony模拟套件中的目录和粒子数据。  <div>
A major question in ΛCDM is what this theory actually predicts for the properties of subhalo populations. Subhalos are difficult to accurately simulate and to find within simulations, and this propagates into uncertainty in theoretical predictions for satellite galaxies. We present Symfind, a new particle-tracking-based subhalo finder, and demonstrate that it can track subhalos to orders-of-magnitude lower masses than commonly used halo-finding tools, with a focus on Rockstar and consistent-trees. These longer survival times mean that at a fixed peak subhalo mass, we find ≈ 15%–40% more subhalos within the virial radius, Rvir, and ≈35%–120% more subhalos within Rvir/4 in the Symphony dark-matter-only simulation suite. More subhalos are found as the resolution is increased, in contrast to the Rockstar halo finder, which appears to be converged at smaller subhalo counts. We perform extensive numerical testing. In agreement with idealized simulations, we show that the , the maximum circular velocity, is systematically biased low until high resolutions (npeak ≳ 3 × 104) are achieved, but that mass loss itself can be resolved at much more modest resolutions (npeak ≳ 4 × 103). We show that Rockstar converges to false solutions for the mass function, radial distribution, and disruption masses of subhalos. We argue that our new method can trace resolved subhalos until the point of typical galaxy disruption without invoking post hoc orphan modeling. We outline a concrete set of steps for determining whether other subhalo finders meet the same criteria. We publicly release Symfind catalogs and particle data for the Symphony simulation suite at http://web.stanford.edu/group/gfc/symphony.

<div> 关键词: spicules, space-time plots, multithermal nature, chromosphere, transition region<br />
总结: 研究发现太阳辐射中存在薄的细胞样结构spicules，通过多波段观测证实着这些spicules是多温性质，一些向上流动的spicules温度达到对应的过渡区和日冕温度，而向下流动的spicules显示日冕到色球温度的等离子运动。同时还观察到了轨迹呈抛物线状的序列上流和下流运动，以及相同空间位置上同时存在上行和下行运动。此外，利用协调的接口区成像光谱仪(IRIS)观测结果表明，在过渡区和色球存在红移/下流的时空分布，暗示观测到的一部分强红移/下流是由于日球上空流的等离子体的返回。<br /> <div>
Spicules are the thin hair/grass-like structures that are prominently observed at the chromospheric solar limb. It is believed that fibrils and rapid blueshifted and redshifted excursions (RBEs and RREs; collectively referred to as REs) correspond to on-disk counterparts of type I spicules and type II spicules, respectively. Our investigation focuses on observing the response of these REs alongside similar spectral features in the chromosphere, transition region (TR), and corona, utilizing space–time plots derived from coordinated observations from the Swedish 1 m Solar Telescope/Hα, Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS), and Solar Dynamics Observatory. Our analysis reveals upflowing REs, promptly reaching temperatures characteristic of the TR and corona, indicating a multithermal nature. Similarly, downflowing features exhibiting similar spectral signatures over the disk display plasma motion from the corona to chromospheric temperatures, demonstrating a multithermal nature. In addition to distinct upflows and downflows, we observe sequential upflow and downflow along the same path, depicting a distinctive parabolic trajectory in space–time plots of observations sampling TR and various coronal passbands. Similar to isolated upflows and downflows, these REs also exhibit a multithermal nature throughout their trajectory. Furthermore, our results reveal a more intricate motion of the REs in which both upflow and downflow coexist at the same spatial location. On a different note, our analysis, utilizing coordinated IRIS spectral observations, shows spatiotemporal redshifts/downflows in both the TR and chromosphere, suggesting that at least subsets of the strong redshifts/downflows observed in TR temperature spectra result from the return from the upper atmosphere flow of plasma in the form of bundles of spicules or features exhibiting similar spectra.

新方法识别宇宙网状结构，使用Monte Carlo Physarum Machine密度场估计，优于Delaunay tessellation方法。90%的星系位于纤维轴附近，而且星系的形成与周围的纤维密度有关。质量较小的星系更容易受到纤维的影响。总结:<br /><br /> <div>
We present a novel approach for identifying cosmic web filaments within the DisPerSE structure identification framework, using cosmic density field estimates from the Monte Carlo Physarum Machine (MCPM), inspired by the slime mold organism. We apply our method to the IllustrisTNG (TNG100) cosmological simulations and investigate the impact of filaments on galaxies. The MCPM density field is superior to the Delaunay tessellation field estimator in tracing the true underlying matter distribution and allows filaments to be identified with higher fidelity, finding more low-prominence/diffuse filaments. Using our new filament catalogs, we find that ≳90% of galaxies are located within ∼1.5 Mpc of a filamentary spine, with little change in the median star formation activity with distance to the nearest filament. Instead, we uncover a differential effect of the local filament line density, Σfil (MCPM)—the total MCPM overdensity per unit length along a filament segment—on galaxy formation: most galaxies are quenched and gas-poor near high-line density filaments at z ≤ 1. At earlier times, the filamentary environment appears to have no effect on galactic gas supply and quenching. At z = 0, quenching in galaxies is mainly driven by mass, while lower-mass galaxies are significantly affected by the filament line density. Satellites are far more susceptible to filaments than centrals. The local environments of massive halos are not sufficient to account for the effect of filament line density on gas removal and quenching. Our new approach holds great promise for observationally identifying filaments from galaxy surveys such as SDSS and DESI.

<br /><br />总结:
这项研究调查了火星大气和挥发性进化航天器上的Langmuir探测和波仪器所检测到的短脉冲。研究旨在通过对2015年记录的36万个中频爆发电场波形的统计分析，确定和分析这些瞬态脉冲的特征。研究使用自动例行程序检测电场数据中的快速波动波形，包括偶极和单极配置中的超过12000个事件。研究发现，单极配置中大多数脉冲很可能是干扰而非尘埃冲击所致。研究主要集中在偶极观测上，这些观测主要包括通常与尘埃冲击相关的双极事件。在火星电离层中检测到了这些事件，航天器带负电时检测到的事件较少，最大高度为1200公里。在电离层之外，灰尘冲击信号的低检测率表明该行星最有可能是这些尘埃颗粒的来源。然而，从行星表面抬升尘埃颗粒至高空的物理过程尚不清楚，因此需要进一步调查以确定所观察到的信号可能不是由尘埃冲击产生的可能性。 <div>
This study investigates short (millisecond) pulses detected by the Langmuir Probe and Waves instrument on board the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution spacecraft. We present a statistical analysis of 360,000 medium-frequency burst electric field waveforms recorded in 2015; the study aims to identify and analyze the characteristics of these transient pulses. An automatic routine is used to detect waveforms with rapid fluctuations in the electric field data; this comprises over 12,000 events in the dipole and nearly 5000 in the monopole configurations. Our findings reveal that most of the pulses in monopole configuration are likely the result of interference rather than dust impacts. Our analysis mainly focuses on dipole observations, which predominantly consist of bipolar events typically associated with dust impacts. These events are mainly detected in the Martian ionosphere, where the spacecraft is negatively charged. Fewer events are recorded when the spacecraft is positively charged, with a maximum at an altitude of 1200 km. The low detection rate of dust impact signals outside the ionosphere suggests that the planet is the most probable source of these dust particles. However, the physical processes by which dust grains are lifted from the surface of the planet to high altitudes are not clear, and thus a possibility that the signals observed might not be generated by dust impacts remains for further investigation.

Galaxies are biased tracers of the underlying cosmic web, which is dominated by dark matter (DM) components that cannot be directly observed. Galaxy formation simulations can be used to study the relationship between DM density fields and galaxy distributions. However, this relationship can be sensitive to assumptions in cosmology and astrophysical processes embedded in galaxy formation models, which remain uncertain in many aspects. In this work, we develop a diffusion generative model to reconstruct DM fields from galaxies. The diffusion model is trained on the CAMELS simulation suite that contains thousands of state-of-the-art galaxy formation simulations with varying cosmological parameters and subgrid astrophysics. We demonstrate that the diffusion model can predict the unbiased posterior distribution of the underlying DM fields from the given stellar density fields while being able to marginalize over uncertainties in cosmological and astrophysical models. Interestingly, the model generalizes to simulation volumes ≈500 times larger than those it was trained on and across different galaxy formation models. The code for reproducing these results can be found at https://github.com/victoriaono/variational-diffusion-cdm✎.

We present wave and turbulence observations from the DSCOVR spacecraft during the 2017 September solar flare and coronal mass ejection (CME) events. On September 4–12, the spectral index within the magnetic field power spectral density inertial range was consistent with Kolmogorov −5/3. This is despite the 9 days being composed of a complex mix of different features, including solar flares, solar energetic particle events, and CMEs. When analyzing shorter time periods, the spectral index varies. For two days where there were consecutive CMEs, the index follows Kraichnan–Iroshinikov −3/2, while on two quiet days, it was a mixture of −1, −3/2, and −2. The inertial range spectral index taken over the entire 9 days hides or averages out spectral features that occur over shorter time periods. We use a more realistic estimate of the amount of Doppler shifting into the spacecraft frame a show that the break frequencies on most days were located close to the H+ cyclotron frequency. We present evidence of wave–wave modulation and suggest that lower-frequency waves in the solar wind can modulate the growth rates/propagation of ion cyclotron waves, providing a method to transfer energy in the solar wind to smaller scales. Furthermore, we suggest that the indices in the inertial range can be explained by combining containment due to wave generation/propagation and stochastic Brownian motion in the solar wind. When these two phenomena are equal, they combine to create a −3/2 index.

Any astrophysical object can, in principle, serve as a probe of the interaction between dark matter (DM) and regular baryonic matter. This method is based on the potential observable consequences annihilations of captured DM have on the surface temperature of the object itself. In a series of previous papers we developed and validated simple analytic approximations for the total capture rates of DM valid in four distinct regions of the DM–nucleon scattering cross section (σ) versus DM particle mass (mX) parameter space. In this work, we summarize those previous results and extend them significantly by deriving a completely general closed-form solution for the total capture rate of DM in the multiscatter regime. Moreover, we demonstrate the existence of a region in the σ versus mX parameter space where the constraining power of any astrophysical object heated by annihilations of captured DM is lost. This corresponds to a maximal temperature (Tcrit) any astrophysical object can have, such that it can still serve as a DM probe. Any object with observed temperature Tobs > Tcrit loses its DM constraining power. We provide analytic formulae that can be used to estimate Tcrit for any object.

JWST observations demonstrate that supermassive black holes (SMBHs) exist by redshifts z ≳ 10, providing further evidence for “direct collapse” black hole (BH) formation, whereby massive (∼103–5M⊙) SMBH seeds are generated within a few million years as a byproduct of the rapid inflow of gas into the centers of protogalaxies. Here we analyze the intermediate “quasi-star” phase that accompanies some direct-collapse models, during which a natal BH accretes mass from and energetically sustains (through accretion) an overlying gaseous envelope. We argue that previous estimates of the maximum BH mass that can be reached during this stage, ∼1% of the total quasi-star mass, are unphysical, and arise from underestimating the efficiency with which energy can be transported outward from regions close to the BH. We construct new quasi-star models that consist of an inner, “saturated convection” region (which conforms to a convection-dominated accretion flow near the BH) matched to an outer, adiabatic envelope. These solutions exist up to a BH mass of ∼60% of the total quasi-star mass, at which point the adiabatic envelope contains only 2% of the mass (with the remaining ∼38% in the saturated-convection region), and this upper limit is reached within a time of 20–40 Myr. We conclude that quasi-stars remain a viable route for producing SMBHs at large redshifts, which is consistent with recent JWST observations.

研究发现Sgr A*的闪耀可能是由磁重联和冲击波导致的。模拟结果表明磁场线的重联会产生慢激波，加热等等。这些结果有助于解释星系黑洞吸积盘的瞬时亮度变化。 <div>
Sgr A* often shows bright, episodic flares observationally, but the mechanism of the flares' intermittent brightening is not very clear. Many people believe the flares may be formed by the nonthermal particles, which can be a consequence of the magnetic reconnection and shock waves. In this work, we use the larger magnetic loop in the presence of pseudo-Newtonian potential, which mimics general relativistic effects. The simulation results show that the reconnection of magnetic field lines passes through a current sheet, which bifurcates into two pairs of slow shocks. We also find the shock waves heat the plasma, especially when the plasma density is low. The shock wave heating effect by the magnetic reconnection is confirmed by the simulation results, and thus the process of instantaneous brightening of the flares on the accretion disk can be explained.

Stellar abundance measurements are subject to systematic errors that induce extra scatter and artificial correlations in elemental abundance patterns. We derive empirical calibration offsets to remove systematic trends with surface gravity in 17 elemental abundances of 288,789 evolved stars from the SDSS APOGEE survey. We fit these corrected abundances as the sum of a prompt process tracing core-collapse supernovae and a delayed process tracing Type Ia supernovae, thus recasting each star’s measurements into the amplitudes Acc and AIa and the element-by-element residuals from this two-parameter fit. As a first application of this catalog, which is 8× larger than that of previous analyses that used a restricted range, we examine the median residual abundances of 14 open clusters, nine globular clusters, and four dwarf satellite galaxies. Relative to field Milky Way disk stars, the open clusters younger than 2 Gyr show ≈0.1−0.2 dex enhancements of the neutron-capture element Ce, and the two clusters younger than 0.5 Gyr also show elevated levels of C+N, Na, S, and Cu. Globular clusters show elevated median abundances of C+N, Na, Al, and Ce, and correlated abundance residuals that follow previously known trends. The four dwarf satellites show similar residual abundance patterns despite their different star formation histories, with ≈0.2–0.3 dex depletions in C+N, Na, and Al and ≈0.1 dex depletions in Ni, V, Mn, and Co. We provide our catalog of corrected APOGEE abundances, two-process amplitudes, and residual abundances, which will be valuable for future studies of abundance patterns in different stellar populations and of additional enrichment processes that affect galactic chemical evolution.

<title>Evolution of the Termination Region of the Parsec-scale Jet of 3C 84 Over the Past 20 yr</title>

<div> 关键词: parsec-scale jet, 3C 84, VLBA, C3 component, apparent velocity<br />
总结:
本研究使用VLBA对3C 84的parsec尺度喷流进行观测，发现自2003年以来，C3成分的视向速度基本保持在0.259 ± 0.003c。此外，还观测到从C3中出现了四个新的次成分，每个都表现出比C3更高的视向速度，其中最快的成分表现出超光速运动。研究表明，仅仅是观测角度的改变无法解释新次成分的快速视向速度，这表明它们本质上比C3更快。可能的物理机制包括喷流进动（或重定向）、喷流与云的碰撞以及磁重新连接。<br /><br /> <div>
We present the kinematics of the parsec-scale jet in 3C 84 from 2003 November to 2022 June observed with the Very Long Baseline Array at 43 GHz. We find that the C3 component, a bright feature at the termination region of the jet component ejected from the core in 2003, has maintained a nearly constant apparent velocity of 0.259 ± 0.003c over the period covered by observations. We observe the emergence of four new subcomponents from C3, each exhibiting apparent speeds higher than that of C3. Notably, the last two subcomponents exhibit apparent superluminal motion, with the fastest component showing an apparent speed of 1.22 ± 0.14c. Our analysis suggests that a change in viewing angle alone cannot account for the fast apparent speeds of the new subcomponents, indicating that they are intrinsically faster than C3. We identify jet precession (or reorientation), a jet–cloud collision, and magnetic reconnection as possible physical mechanisms responsible for the ejection of the new subcomponents.

在模拟重元素核合成过程中，对尚未测量的核性质需要进行输入。这些偏移稳定性核性质数值的不确定性会传播到元素和同位素丰度的预测中。针对任何给定的天体物理爆炸，都会有许多不同的轨迹，即，流出物质所经历的温度和密度历史，因此不同的核性质可能会发挥作用。研究来自黑洞吸积盘的46万条轨迹的复合核合成结果，发现仅由于未知核性质而导致的元素预测的差异性因素为几。分析核变化引起的模型预测相对差异，得出结论，这些不确定性可以归因于丰度模式中给定区域的性质组合。我们计算了质量变化和丰度变化之间的交叉相关性，展示了参与核的性质变化可能会如何被探索。我们的结果进一步推动了在现代实验设施上对个别短寿命中子丰富同位素的多个数量进行测量。
<br /><br />总结: 重元素核合成模拟需要未知核性质的输入，这导致了元素和同位素丰度预测上的不确定性。天体物理爆炸有许多不同的轨迹，核性质也会有所不同。通过分析大量核合成结果的差异，得出了核变化引起模型预测相对差异的结论，并指出了多个数量测量的必要性。 <div>
The simulation of heavy element nucleosynthesis requires input from yet-to-be-measured nuclear properties. The uncertainty in the values of these off-stability nuclear properties propagates to uncertainties in the predictions of elemental and isotopic abundances. However, for any given astrophysical explosion, there are many different trajectories, i.e., temperature and density histories, experienced by outflowing material, and thus different nuclear properties can come into play. We consider combined nucleosynthesis results from 460,000 trajectories from a black hole accretion disk and find the spread in elemental predictions due solely to unknown nuclear properties to be a factor of a few. We analyze this relative spread in model predictions due to nuclear variations and conclude that the uncertainties can be attributed to a combination of properties in a given region of the abundance pattern. We calculate a cross-correlation between mass changes and abundance changes to show how variations among the properties of participating nuclei may be explored. Our results provide further impetus for measurements of multiple quantities on individual short-lived neutron-rich isotopes at modern experimental facilities.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章讨论了由于事件视界望远镜首次检测到M 87*和Sgr A*超大质量黑洞的地平线尺度图像，引发了对增加物理的重要性。作者重新审视了Fishbone and Moncrief (FM)环的流体力学平衡解决方案，并通过广义相对论流体力学模拟检查了FM环在非Kerr时空中的稳定性。他们发现FM环在非Kerr时空中的确是稳定的，并得出结论，广义FM环解决方案将对在扩展Kerr黑洞中创建新的GRMHD库非常有用。 <div>
Accretion physics has become more important recently due to the detection of the first horizon-scale images of the supermassive black holes of M 87* and Sgr A* by the Event Horizon Telescope. General relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of magnetized accretion flows onto a Kerr black hole have been used to interpret them. However, further testing the theory of gravity by using horizon-scale images requires performing consistent GRMHD simulations in non-Kerr spacetime. In this paper, we revisited the hydrodynamical equilibrium solution of the Fishbone and Moncrief (FM) torus that can be used to study any stationary, axisymmetric, vacuum, or nonvacuum spacetime. Further, we check the stability of the FM torus in non-Kerr spacetime by general relativistic hydrodynamic simulations. We find that FM torus in non-Kerr spacetime is indeed stable under long-term evolution. We conclude that the generalized FM torus solution would be very useful for creating new GRMHD libraries in extended Kerr black holes.

这项研究发现，流动的宇宙射线（CRs）会产生电阻电场，可以加速CR电离产生的次级电子。研究通过数值求解一维玻尔兹曼方程和欧姆定律，研究了次级电子能谱的演变。结果显示，加速的次级电子进一步电离气体，产生电子雪崩，导致气体的电离和激发增加。虽然电阻电场比CR放电前要弱，但仍会微弱地加速次级电子。准稳态状态几乎不依赖于初始电阻电场，但取决于气体中的电子分数。在准稳态状态下，电子分数越高，电阻电场越大，能够电离气体的次级电子数量越多，导致更高的电离率。CR放电可以解释一些分子云中观察到的高电离率。 
<br /><br />总结: 这项研究发现了宇宙射线引起的电离现象，并通过数值模拟进行了深入研究。研究发现，加速的次级电子会导致气体的电离和激发增加，表现为电子雪崩现象。同时，准稳态状态下的电阻电场大小取决于气体中的电子分数，进而影响气体的电离率。这对于解释一些分子云中观察到的高电离率具有重要意义。 <div>
We recently found that streaming cosmic rays (CRs) induce a resistive electric field that can accelerate secondary electrons produced by CR ionization. In this work, we study the evolution of the energy spectrum of secondary electrons by numerically solving the one-dimensional Boltzmann equation and Ohm’s law. We show that the accelerated secondary electrons further ionize a gas, that is, an electron avalanche occurs, resulting in increased ionization and excitation of the gas. Although the resistive electric field becomes weaker than the one before the CR discharge, the weak resistive electric field weakly accelerates the secondary electrons. The quasi-steady state is almost independent of the initial resistive electric field but depends on the electron fraction in the gas. The resistive electric field in the quasi-steady state is larger for the higher electron fraction, which makes the number of secondary electrons that can ionize the gas larger, resulting in a higher ionization rate. The CR discharge could explain the high ionization rate that is observed in some molecular clouds.

总结: 
本文介绍了使用同步辐射自康普顿冷却（SSC）以及Klein-Nishina（KN）修正进行伽马射线暴（GRB）余辉建模的方法。通过提供一个公开可用的Python代码来计算康普顿Y参数并计算出KN修正后的余辉光谱和光变曲线，我们展示了新的光谱形态和其观测意义。此外，还讨论了KN修正如何解释一些GRB X射线余辉中观测到的硬谱和衰减速率较缓的现象。这一框架的目标是简化将SSC+KN修正引入相对论性爆发的多波段建模。 <div>
Multiwavelength modeling of the synchrotron radiation from relativistic transients such as gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows is a powerful means of exploring the physics of relativistic shocks and of deriving properties of the explosion, such as the kinetic energy of the associated relativistic outflows. Capturing the location and evolution of the synchrotron cooling break is critical to break parameter degeneracies associated with such modeling. However, the shape of the spectrum above the cooling break, as well as the location and evolution of the break itself can be significantly altered by synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) cooling. We present an observer’s guide to applying SSC cooling with and without Klein–Nishina (KN) corrections to GRB afterglow modeling. We provide a publicly available Python code to calculate the Compton Y-parameter as a function of electron Lorentz factor, from which we compute changes to the electron distribution, along with KN-corrected afterglow spectra and light curves. In this framework, the canonical synchrotron spectral shapes split into multiple subregimes. We summarize each new spectral shape and describe its observational significance. We discuss how KN corrections can account for harder spectra and shallower decline rates observed in some GRB X-ray afterglows. Our overall aim is to provide an easy application of SSC+KN corrections into analytical multiwavelength modeling frameworks for relativistic transients.

Primordial black holes (PBHs), theorized to have originated in the early Universe, are speculated to be a viable form of dark matter. If they exist, they should be detectable through photometric and astrometric signals resulting from gravitational microlensing of stars in the Milky Way. Population Synthesis for Compact-object Lensing Events, or PopSyCLE, is a simulation code that enables users to simulate microlensing surveys, and is the first of its kind to include both photometric and astrometric microlensing effects, which are important for potential PBH detection and characterization. To estimate the number of observable PBH microlensing events, we modify PopSyCLE to include a dark matter halo consisting of PBHs. We detail our PBH population model, and demonstrate our PopSyCLE + PBH results through simulations of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment-IV (OGLE-IV) and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman) microlensing surveys. We provide a proof-of-concept analysis for adding PBHs into PopSyCLE, and thus include many simplifying assumptions, such as fDM, the fraction of dark matter composed of PBHs, and , mean PBH mass. Assuming M⊙, we find ∼3.6fDM times as many PBH microlensing events than stellar evolved black hole events, a PBH average peak Einstein crossing time of ∼91.5 days, estimate on order of 102fDM PBH events within the 8 yr OGLE-IV results, and estimate Roman to detect ∼1000fDM PBH microlensing events throughout its planned microlensing survey.

总结: 
太阳光球的磁力线磁图是太阳物理研究的重要基础，本文介绍了一种名为SuperSynthIA的学习方法，该方法利用SDO/HMI的Stokes偏振图像作为输入，模拟Hinode/SOT-SP管道的反演和消歧输出。与之前的方法相比，SuperSynthIA提供了物理上可用的矢量磁图，并减轻了不合理的角度喜好和SynthIA中的带状伪影。SuperSynthIA数据在低信号区域噪声更少，并且显示出与SDO/HMI记录的磁场演变一致。文章还讨论了SuperSynthIA的局限性和已知伪影，并展示了一系列评估来测试SuperSynthIA，表明其输出已经可以供社区使用，同时学习方法适用于物理上可用的磁图。 <div>
Vector magnetograms of the Sun’s photosphere are cornerstones for much of solar physics research. These data are often produced by data-analysis pipelines combining per-pixel Stokes polarization vector inversion with a disambiguation that resolves an intrinsic 180° ambiguity. We introduce a learning-based method, SuperSynthIA, that produces full-disk vector magnetograms from Stokes vector observations. As input, SuperSynthIA uses Stokes polarization images from Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI). As output, SuperSynthIA simultaneously emulates the inversion and disambiguation outputs from the Hinode/Solar Optical Telescope-Spectro-Polarimeter (SOT-SP) pipeline. Our method extends our previous approach SynthIA with heliographic outputs as well as using an improved data set and inference method. SuperSynthIA provides a new tool for improved magnetic fields from full-disk SDO/HMI observations using information derived from the enhanced capabilities of Hinode/SOT-SP. Compared to our previous SynthIA, SuperSynthIA provides physics-ready vector magnetograms and mitigates unphysical angle preferences and banding artifacts in SynthIA. SuperSynthIA data are substantially more temporally consistent than those from the SDO/HMI pipeline, most notably seen in, e.g., evolving active regions. SuperSynthIA substantially reduces noise in low-signal areas, resulting in less center-to-limb bias outside of strong-signal areas. We show that outputs from SuperSynthIA track the SDO/HMI-recorded evolution of the magnetic field. We discuss the limitations of SuperSynthIA that the user must understand, and we demonstrate a broad set of evaluations to test SuperSynthIA and discuss remaining known artifacts. Our tests provide both methodology and evidence that SuperSynthIA outputs are ready for use by the community, and that learning-based approaches are suitable for physics-ready magnetograms.

<br /><br />总结:
使用NuSTAR进行硬X射线（E > 10 keV）观测，可以区分M31中X射线双星系统中的黑洞和中子星的星体类型。在M31盘的10次中等深度（20-50ks）观测中，检测到20个源，其中14个被认为是X射线双星系统。通过色-强度和色-色图分离出9个源，确定其中3个为黑洞，6个为中子星。此外，创建了X射线光度函数，并发现和之前的模型存在一致性。总体而言，这项研究提供了对M31中X射线双星系统的深入了解，显示出了它们的光度函数和星体类型之间的差异。 <div>
Using hard (E > 10 keV) X-ray observations with NuSTAR, we are able to differentiate between the accretion states, and thus compact object types, of neutron stars (NSs) and black holes (BHs) in X-ray binaries (XRBs) in M31, our nearest Milky Way–type neighbor. Using 10 moderate-depth (20–50 ks) observations of the disk of M31 covering a total of ∼0.45 deg2, we detect 20 sources at 2σ in the 4–25 keV bandpass, 14 of which we consider to be XRB candidates. This complements an existing, deeper (100–400 ks) survey covering ∼0.2 deg2 of the bulge and the northeastern disk. We make tentative classifications of nine of these sources with the use of diagnostic color–intensity and color–color diagrams, which separate sources into various NS and BH regimes, identifying three BHs and six NSs. In addition, we create X-ray luminosity functions (XLFs) for both the full (4–25 keV) and hard (12–25 keV) bands, as well as subpopulations of the full band based on compact object type and association with globular clusters. Our best-fit globular cluster XLF is shallower than the field XLF, and preliminary BH and NS XLFs suggest a difference in shape based on compact object type. We find that the cumulative disk XLFs in the full and hard band are best fit by power laws with indices of 1.32 and 1.28, respectively. This is consistent with models of the Milky Way XLF from Grimm et al., Voss & Ajello, and Doroshenko et al.

Stellar spin down is a critical yet poorly understood component of stellar evolution. In particular, results from the Kepler Mission imply that mature age, solar-type stars have inefficient magnetic braking, resulting in a stalled spin-down rate. However, a large number of precise asteroseismic ages are needed for mature (≥3 Gyr) stars in order to probe the regime where traditional and stalled spin-down models differ. In this paper, we present a new asteroseismic benchmark star for gyrochronology discovered using reprocessed Kepler short cadence data. KIC 11029516 (Papayu) is a bright (Kp = 9.6 mag) solar-type star with a well-measured rotation period (21.1 ± 0.8 days) from spot modulation using 4 yr of Kepler long-cadence data. We combine asteroseismology and spectroscopy to obtain Teff = 5888 ± 100 K, [Fe/H] = 0.30 ± 0.06 dex, M = 1.24 ± 0.05 M⊙, R = 1.34 ± 0.02 R⊙, and age of 4.0 ± 0.4 Gyr, making Papayu one of the most similar stars to the Sun in terms of temperature and radius with an asteroseismic age and a rotation period measured from spot modulation. We find that Papayu sits at the transition of where traditional and weakened spin-down models diverge. A comparison with stars of similar zero-age main-sequence temperatures supports previous findings that weakened spin-down models are required to explain the ages and rotation periods of old solar-type stars.

During cluster assembly, a cluster’s virialization process leaves behind signatures that can provide information on its dynamical state. However, no clear consensus yet exists on the best way to achieve this. Therefore, we attempt to derive improved recipes for classifying the dynamical states of clusters in observations using cosmological simulations. The cluster halo mass and their subhalos’ mass are used to 1014 M⊙ h−1 and 1010 M⊙ h−1 to calculate five independent dynamical state indicators. We experiment with recipes by combining two to four indicators for detecting specific merger stages, like recent and ancient mergers. These recipes are made by plotting merging clusters and a control sample of relaxed clusters in multiple-indicator parameter space, then applying a rotation matrix method to derive the best way to separate mergers from the control sample. The success of the recipe is quantified using the success rate and overlap percentage of the merger and control histograms along the newly rotated x-axis. This provides us with recipes using different numbers of combined indicators and for different merger stages. Among the recipes, the stellar mass gap and center offset are the first and second most dominant of the indicators, and using more indicators improves the effectiveness of the recipe. When applied to observations, our results show good agreement with literature values of cluster dynamical states.

During our spectroscopic survey of central stars of faint planetary nebulae (PNe), we found that the nucleus of Abell 57 exhibits strong nebular emission lines. Using synthetic narrowband images, we show that the emission arises from an unresolved compact emission knot (CEK) coinciding with the hot (90,000 K) central star. Thus Abell 57 belongs to the rare class of “EGB 6-type” PNe, characterized by dense emission cores. Photometric data show that the nucleus exhibits a near-infrared excess, due to a dusty companion body with the luminosity of an M0 dwarf but a temperature of ∼1800 K. Emission-line analysis reveals that the CEK is remarkably dense (electron density ∼ 1.6 × 107 cm−3), and has a radius of only ∼4.5 au. The CEK suffers considerably more reddening than the central star, which itself is more reddened than the surrounding PN. These puzzles may suggest an interaction between the knot and central star; however, Hubble Space Telescope imaging of EGB 6 itself shows that its CEK lies more than ∼125 au from the PN nucleus. We discuss a scenario in which a portion of the asymptotic giant branch wind that created the PN was captured into a dust cloud around a distant stellar companion; this cloud has survived to the present epoch, and has an atmosphere photoionized by radiation from the hot central star. However, in this picture EGB 6-type nuclei should be relatively common, yet they are actually extremely rare; thus they may arise from a different transitory phenomenon. We suggest future observations of Abell 57 that may help unravel its mysteries.

总结: 
核心坍缩超新星是大质量恒星的终结爆炸现象。其中，电子俘获超新星是略小质量恒星的爆炸现象，对于恒星演化理论的完善具有重要意义。研究发现，基于合适的爆发能量和星周介质分布，电子俘获超新星的合成光变曲线在图像上比铁核坍缩超新星更短、更亮、更蓝。通过采用多色观测方法，可以确定电子俘获超新星的特征。研究人员基于这一方法确定了SN 2018zd为电子俘获超新星，这被认为是利用现代观测技术发现的第一个电子俘获超新星。 <br /><br /> <div>
Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are the terminal explosions of massive stars. While most massive stars explode as iron-core-collapse supernovae (FeCCSNe), slightly less massive stars explode as electron-capture supernovae (ECSNe), shaping the low-mass end of CCSNe. ECSNe were proposed ∼40 yr ago and first-principles simulations also predict their successful explosions. Observational identification and investigation of ECSNe are important for the completion of stellar evolution theory. To date, only one promising candidate has been proposed, SN 2018zd, other than the historical progenitor of the Crab Nebula, SN 1054. We present representative synthetic light curves of low-mass FeCCSNe and ECSNe, i.e., with theoretically or observationally plausible explosion energies and distributions of circumstellar media (CSM). The ECSNe have shorter, brighter, and bluer plateaus than the FeCCSNe. To investigate the robustness of their intrinsic differences, we also calculated light curves of ECSNe and low-mass FeCCSNe adopting various explosion energies and CSM. Although they may have similar bolometric light-curve plateaus, ECSNe are bluer than FeCCSNe in the absence of strong CSM interaction, illustrating that multicolor observations are essential to identify ECSNe. This provides a robust indicator of ECSNe because the bluer plateaus stem from the low-density envelopes of their super-asymptotic-giant-branch progenitors. We propose a distance-independent method to identify ECSNe: , i.e., blue g – r at the middle of the plateau , where tPT is the transition epoch from plateau to tail. Using this method, we identified SN 2018zd as an ECSN, which we believe to be the first ECSN identified with modern observing techniques.

<div> 磁通量、太阳活跃区、电流演化、磁极性、自动侦测算法
<br />总结:
该研究分析了59个太阳活跃区的磁极性倒转线上未中和电流的总量，并观察到总未中和电流INN,tot的时间序列呈现出明显的峰谷结构。与垂直电流Iz的时间序列相比，INN,tot呈现出更为复杂的结构。具有δ-斑的活跃区表现出更高的磁通量出现速率和INN,tot增加率。开发了自动检测算法来确定非中和电流的注入事件，发现随着活跃区复杂度的增加，注入速率和持续时间均增加，δ-斑的活跃区表现出最强和最长的事件。这些事件并不一定与磁通量的增加同时发生，尽管它们存在适度的相关性。研究得出结论，电流在磁通量出现过程中被注入，但也受到活跃区演化的极大影响。 <div>
We study the evolution of electric currents during the emergence of magnetic flux in the solar photosphere and the differences exhibited between solar active regions of different Hale complexity classes. A sample of 59 active regions was analyzed using a method based on image segmentation and error analysis to determine the total amount of nonneutralized electric current along their magnetic polarity inversion lines. The time series of the total unsigned nonneutralized electric current, INN,tot, exhibit intricate structure in the form of distinct peaks and valleys. This information is largely missing in the respective time series of the total unsigned vertical electric current Iz. Active regions with δ-spots stand out, exhibiting a 1.9 times higher flux emergence rate and 2.6 times higher INN,tot increase. The median value of their peak INN,tot is equal to 3.6 × 1012 A, which is more than three times higher than that of the other regions of the sample. An automated detection algorithm was also developed to pinpoint the injection events of nonneutralized electric current. The injection rates and duration of these events were higher with increasing complexity of active regions, with regions containing δ-spots exhibiting the strongest and longest events. These events do not necessarily coincide with increasing magnetic flux, although they exhibit moderate correlation. We conclude that net electric currents are injected during flux emergence but are also shaped drastically by the incurred photospheric evolution as active regions grow and evolve.

<div> Abell 1758, galaxy cluster, N-body hydrodynamical simulations, orbital configuration, bridge connection
总结:<br /><br />Abell 1758是一个由两个结构A1758N和A1758S组成的星系团，它们之间存在一个未被发现的桥梁。文章通过N体流体动力学模拟探讨了不同的轨道探测方式，并发现了轨道接近的模拟方案与观测数据相吻合。其中，切向接近的方案表现出最佳匹配。模拟结果在X射线图像中显示出可检测的桥梁，但过估了X射线过量。这项研究的结论对理解星系团之间的相互作用具有重要意义。 <div>
Abell 1758 (z ∼ 0.278) is a galaxy cluster composed of two structures, A1758N and A1758S, separated by ∼2.2 Mpc. The northern cluster is itself a dissociative merging cluster that has already been modeled by dedicated simulations. Recent radio observations revealed the existence of a previously undetected bridge connecting A1758N and A1758S. New simulations are now needed to take into account the presence of A1758S. We wish to evaluate which orbital configuration would be compatible with a bridge between the clusters. Using N-body hydrodynamical simulations that build upon the previous model, we explore different scenarios that could have led to the current observed configuration. Five types of orbital approaches were tested: radial, tangential, vertical, postapocentric, and outgoing. We found that the incoming simulated scenarios are generally consistent with mild enhancements of gas density between the approaching clusters. The mock X-ray images exhibit a detectable bridge in all cases. Compared to measurements of Chandra data, the amplitude of the X-ray excess is overestimated by a factor of ∼2–3 in the best simulations. The scenario of tangential approach proved to be the one that best matches the properties of the profiles of X-ray surface brightness. The scenarios of radial approach of vertical approach are also marginally compatible.

We study the impact of warm dark matter (WDM) mass on the internal properties of individual galaxies using a large suite of 1024 state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamic simulations from the DREAMS project. We take individual galaxies’ properties from the simulations, which have different cosmologies, astrophysics, and WDM masses, and train normalizing flows to learn the posterior of the parameters. We find that our models cannot infer the value of the WDM mass, even when the values of the cosmological and astrophysical parameters are given explicitly. This result holds for galaxies with stellar mass larger than 2 × 108M⊙h−1 at both low and high redshifts. We calculate the mutual information and find no significant dependence between the WDM mass and galaxy properties. On the other hand, our models can infer the value of Ωm with a ∼10% accuracy from the properties of individual galaxies while marginalizing astrophysics and WDM masses.

<div> 数值计算，二进制交互，气体盘，数值方法，收敛解<br />
总结：<br />
这项研究的目标是确定是否所有代码在数值上都能达成一致的解，并确定收敛所需的分辨率以及必须计算的二进制轨道数，以达到二进制-盘系统的一致放松状态。研究发现，多数代码在二进制组件附近需要大约二进制间距的1%才能达到对盘对二进制施加的力矩的收敛测量。对于我们的盘模型达到放松状态，代码必须至少运行200个二进制轨道，这相当于我们参数的一个粘性时间，即0.2(a^2ΩB/ν)个二进制轨道，其中ν为动力粘度。代码之间出现的最大差异来自设置的维度（3D与2D盘）。研究发现，在代码之间总扭矩上存在较好的一致性，尽管这种扭矩在引力扭矩、轨道吸积扭矩和自旋吸积扭矩之间的分配取决于采用的sink处方。与先前的研究相一致，我们发现2D和3D盘模型之间的扭矩和吸积变化方面存在适度差异。我们发现凹陷进动速率在3D中比在2D中明显更快。 <div>
We have performed numerical calculations of a binary interacting with a gas disk, using 11 different numerical methods and a standard binary−disk setup. The goal of this study is to determine whether all codes agree on a numerically converged solution and to determine the necessary resolution for convergence and the number of binary orbits that must be computed to reach an agreed-upon relaxed state of the binary−disk system. We find that all codes can agree on a converged solution (depending on the diagnostic being measured). The zone spacing required for most codes to reach a converged measurement of the torques applied to the binary by the disk is roughly 1% of the binary separation in the vicinity of the binary components. For our disk model to reach a relaxed state, codes must be run for at least 200 binary orbits, corresponding to about a viscous time for our parameters, 0.2(a2ΩB/ν) binary orbits, where ν is the kinematic viscosity. The largest discrepancies between codes resulted from the dimensionality of the setup (3D vs. 2D disks). We find good agreement in the total torque on the binary between codes, although the partition of this torque between the gravitational torque, orbital accretion torque, and spin accretion torque depends sensitively on the sink prescriptions employed. In agreement with previous studies, we find a modest difference in torques and accretion variability between 2D and 3D disk models. We find cavity precession rates to be appreciably faster in 3D than in 2D.

Strong gravitational lensing offers a powerful probe of the detailed distribution of matter in lenses, while magnifying and bringing faint background sources into view. Observed strong lensing by massive galaxy clusters, which are often in complex dynamical states, has also been used to map their dark matter (DM) substructures on smaller scales. Deep high-resolution imaging has revealed the presence of strong lensing events associated with these substructures, namely galaxy-scale sub-halos. However, an inventory of these observed galaxy–galaxy strong lensing (GGSL) events is noted to be discrepant with state-of-the-art ΛCDM simulations. Cluster sub-halos appear to be over-concentrated compared to their simulated counterparts yielding an order-of-magnitude higher value of GGSL. In this paper, we explore the possibility of resolving this observed discrepancy by redistributing the mass within observed cluster sub-halos in ways that are consistent within the ΛCDM paradigm of structure formation. Lensing mass reconstructions from data provide constraints on the mass enclosed within apertures and are agnostic to the detailed mass profile within them. Therefore, as the detailed density profile within cluster sub-halos currently remains unconstrained by data, we are afforded the freedom to redistribute the enclosed mass. We investigate if rearranging the mass to a more centrally concentrated density profile helps alleviate the GGSL discrepancy. We report that refitting cluster sub-halos to the ubiquitous ΛCDM-motivated Navarro–Frenk–White profile, and further modifying them to include significant baryonic components, does not resolve this tension. A resolution to this persisting GGSL discrepancy may require more careful exploration of alternative DM models.

Using controlled injection and recovery experiments, we devised an analysis prescription to assess the quality of dynamical measurements of protoplanetary disk gas masses based on resolved (CO) spectral line data, given observational limitations (resolution, sampling, noise), measurement bias, and ambiguities in the geometry and physical conditions. With sufficient data quality, this approach performed well for massive disks (Md/M* = 0.1): we inferred Md posteriors that recovered the true values with little bias (≲20%) and uncertainties within a factor of two (2σ). The gas surface density profiles for such cases are recovered with remarkable fidelity. Some experimentation indicates that this approach becomes insensitive when Md/M* ≲ 5%, due primarily to degeneracies in the surface density profile parameters. Including multiple lines that probe different vertical layers, along with some improvements in the associated tools, might push that practical boundary down by another factor of ∼two in ideal scenarios. We also demonstrated this analysis approach using archival Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array observations of the MWC 480 disk: we measured (corresponding to Md/M* = 7% ± 1%) and identified kinematic substructures consistent with surface density gaps around 65 and 135 au. Overall, this (and similar work) suggests that these dynamical measurements offer powerful new constraints with sufficient accuracy and precision to quantify gas masses and surface densities at the high end of the Md/M* distribution, and therefore can serve as key benchmarks for detailed thermo-chemical modeling. We address some prospects for improvements, and discuss various caveats and limitations to guide future work.

总结:
ω Centauri是银河系中最大质量的球状星团，被怀疑是一颗侵入银河系的矮星系的剥离核心。研究使用了新的Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer光谱和哈勃空间望远镜光度目录来调查该星团内部金属丰度分布及其空间变化。文章基于11,050颗成员星，发现[M/H]分布的中位数为(−1.614 ± 0.003) dex，分布范围约为1.37 dex，最金属丰富为−0.67 dex，最金属贫为−2.04 dex。此外，文章展示了该星团的染色体图，将红巨星分支星分为不同亚群，并分析了金属贫最组分的亚群。最后，文章发现在半光半径内没有金属丰度梯度，不同亚群混合程度较高。<br /><br /> <div>
ω Centauri, the most massive globular cluster in the Milky Way, has long been suspected to be the stripped nucleus of a dwarf galaxy that fell into the Galaxy a long time ago. There is considerable evidence for this scenario including a large spread in metallicity and an unusually large number of distinct subpopulations seen in photometric studies. In this work, we use new Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer spectroscopic and Hubble Space Telescope photometric catalogs to investigate the underlying metallicity distributions as well as the spatial variations of the populations within the cluster up to its half-light radius. Based on 11,050 member stars, the [M/H] distribution has a median of (−1.614 ± 0.003) dex and a large spread of ∼1.37 dex, reaching from −0.67 to −2.04 dex for 99.7% of the stars. In addition, we show the chromosome map of the cluster, which separates the red giant branch stars into different subpopulations, and analyze the subpopulations of the most metal-poor component. Finally, we do not find any metallicity gradient within the half-light radius, and the different subpopulations are well mixed.

Empirical correlations connecting starlight to galaxy dynamics (e.g., the fundamental plane (FP) of elliptical/quiescent (Q) galaxies and the Tully–Fisher relation of spiral/star-forming (SF) galaxies) provide cosmology-independent distance estimation and are central to local Universe cosmology. In this work, we introduce the mass hyperplane (MH), which is the stellar-to-dynamical mass relation (M⋆/Mdyn) recast as a linear distance indicator. Building on recent FP studies, we show that both SF and Q galaxies follow the same empirical MH, then use this to measure the peculiar velocities (PVs) for a sample of 2496 galaxies at z < 0.12 from GAMA. The limiting precision of MH-derived distance/PV estimates is set by the intrinsic scatter in size, which we find to be ≈0.1 dex for both Q and SF galaxies (when modeled independently) and ≈0.11 dex when all galaxies are modeled together, showing that the MH is as good as the FP. To empirically validate our framework and distance/PV estimates, we compare the inferred distances to groups as derived using either Q or SF galaxies. A good agreement is obtained with no discernible bias or offset, having a scatter of ≈0.05 dex ≈12% in distance. Further, we compare our PV measurements for the Q galaxies to the previous PV measurements of the galaxies in common between GAMA and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, which shows similarly good agreement. Finally, we provide comparisons of PV measurements made with the FP and the MH, then discuss possible improvements in the context of upcoming surveys such as the 4MOST Hemisphere Survey.

Drifts due to the gradients in, and curvatures of, the heliospheric magnetic field (HMF) play a significant role in the transport of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) in the heliosphere. Although this has been well studied for the Parker HMF, the influence of Fisk-type fields, with their unique geometry, has hitherto received less attention. Here, drift velocity profiles computed for a Schwadron–Parker hybrid field are compared with those for a purely Parkerian field. Furthermore, the influence of this field on GCR modulation, as computed with a 3D, ab initio, modulation model, is investigated. Globally, the differences between the computed intensities are small. Nevertheless, local measures, such as azimuthal variations in the GCR intensities, show a significant influence of the Schwadron–Parker hybrid field on GCR transport.

总结:
盘风模型用于研究活动星系核的外流，其中高能辐射会导致离子化问题。研究发现，辐射场属性依赖于位置，但不同场量的依赖性并不相同。平均强度的位置依赖性影响了气体的光学厚度，从而减轻了过度离子化问题。另外，对于垂直加速流动，由于辐射力的几何加权和平均强度的位置依赖性，导致辐射力不与辐射通量平行。这些发现为理解活动星系核的能量传输和气体动力学提供了重要线索。 <div>
In disk-wind models for active galactic nuclei outflows, high-energy radiation poses a significant problem wherein the gas can become overionized, effectively disabling what is often inferred to be the largest force acting on the gas: the radiation force due to spectral line opacity. Calculations of this radiation force depend on the magnitude of ionizing radiation, which can strongly depend on the position above a disk where the radiation is anisotropic. As our first step to quantify the position and direction dependence of the radiation field, we assumed free streaming of photons and computed energy distributions of the mean intensity and components of flux as well as energy-integrated quantities such as mean photon energy. We find a significant dependence of radiation-field properties on position, but this dependence is not necessarily the same for different field quantities. A key example is that the mean intensity is much softer than the radial flux at many points near the disk. Because the mean intensity largely controls ionization, this softening decreases the severity of the overionization problem. The position dependence of mean intensity implies the position dependence of gas opacity, which we illustrate by computing the radiation force a fluid element feels in an accelerating wind. We find that in a vertical accelerating flow, the force due to radiation is not parallel to the radiation flux. This misalignment is due to the force’s geometric weighting by both the velocity field’s directionality and the position dependence of the mean intensity.

总结: 
本文讨论了围绕M矮星运转的外行星大气透射光谱学面临的挑战，特别是来自恒星磁特征（如斑和光斑）的污染。作者指出，在红外波长下进行观测可以部分减轻恒星污染的影响，因为在这些波长下，温度对光强度的敏感度减弱，从而减少了斑和光斑对光谱的影响。此外，作者还指出，在红外波长下，恒星的光谱特征会减弱，这是由于普朗克函数随温度呈线性变化的结果。外行星大气透射光谱特征的深度则主要由行星大气垂直尺度决定，并不会随波长基本变化。因此，在中红外波长下，恒星污染会减弱几倍，但是否足以规避恒星污染最终取决于斑点覆盖区域的大小。尽管如此，红外波长下热发射光谱特征的平坦化是普遍存在的。 <br /><br /> <div>
Exoplanet atmosphere transmission spectroscopy for planets orbiting M dwarf stars faces significant challenges due to contamination from stellar magnetic features, i.e., spots and faculae. These features make the stellar surface inhomogeneous and introduce wavelength-dependent signals in the transmission spectrum that complicate its analysis. We identify and explain why using observations at infrared wavelengths greater than a few microns partially mitigates stellar contamination. At these wavelengths the intensity sensitivity to temperature weakens, with two significant consequences. First, the contribution of spots and faculae has a diminished effect because their flux contrast to the quiet-star regions lessens. Second, the star’s spectral features compress in magnitude, an outcome of spectral features being shaped by the star’s photospheric vertical temperature gradient. Both factors are due to the Planck function moving from exponential to linear in temperature toward mid-infrared (mid-IR) wavelengths (the “Rayleigh–Jeans tail”). In contrast to stellar spectra, the depth of the transmission spectroscopy features does not fundamentally vary with wavelength as it is primarily determined by the planet’s atmospheric scale height. The magnitude of reduction in stellar contamination is a factor of a few to several at mid-IR versus near-IR wavelengths, but whether or not this is enough to bypass stellar contamination ultimately depends on the spot coverage area. Nonetheless, the flattening of thermal emission spectral features at IR wavelengths is universal.

Chew-Goldberger-Low系统描述了磁场中的双Maxwell等离子体，在太阳圈层和地球空间环境中经常观察到呈各向异性状态，具有明显不同的平行和垂直压力分量。CGL系统代表了对常见各向同性MHD模型的最简单的一阶修正，该模型仍允许融合后者的最理想特性。然而，CGL系统存在一些数值挑战：系统不是守恒形式，源项僵硬，并且与MHD不同，如果平行和垂直压力变得过于不同，它容易失去双曲性。通常的方法是使平行和垂直压力彼此靠近，但这通常是以一种临时的方式完成的。文章提出了一种基于偏角散射思想的压力松弛的物理资讯方法，该方法保持了数值系统的双曲性，并在等离子体β非常大的极限下自然地导致各向同性。因此，基于CGL方程的数值代码可以在任何磁场强度下牢固地运行，包括磁场接近零的极限。我们使用了几个严格的测试问题来演示我们的新算法的功能，这些问题提供了在弱碰撞和强碰撞极限下CGL方程的比较。这包括一个模拟冲击波与2D磁层环境相互作用的测试问题。<br /><br />总结: Chew-Goldberger-Low系统描述了具有各向异性的等离子体，该系统引入了一种基于偏角散射的物理资讯方法来解决数值挑战，保持系统的双曲性，并在等离子体β非常大的极限下自然地导致各向同性。作者使用了几个严格的测试问题来演示新算法的功能。 <div>
We present a new numerical model for solving the Chew–Goldberger–Low system of equations describing a bi-Maxwellian plasma in a magnetic field. Heliospheric and geospace environments are often observed to be in an anisotropic state with distinctly different parallel and perpendicular pressure components. The Chew–Goldberger–Low (CGL) system represents the simplest leading order correction to the common isotropic MHD model that still allows the incorporation of the latter’s most desirable features. However, the CGL system presents several numerical challenges: the system is not in conservation form, the source terms are stiff, and unlike MHD, it is prone to a loss of hyperbolicity if the parallel and perpendicular pressures become too different. The usual cure is to bring the parallel and perpendicular pressures closer to one another, but that has usually been done in an ad hoc manner. We present a physics-informed method of pressure relaxation based on the idea of pitch-angle scattering that keeps the numerical system hyperbolic and naturally leads to zero anisotropy in the limit of very large plasma beta. Numerical codes based on the CGL equations can, therefore, be made to function robustly for any magnetic field strength, including the limit where the magnetic field approaches zero. The capabilities of our new algorithm are demonstrated using several stringent test problems that provide a comparison of the CGL equations in the weakly and strongly collisional limits. This includes a test problem that mimics the interaction of a shock with a magnetospheric environment in 2D.

这篇文章使用一维恒星演化代码MESA，对SNe IIP和它们的原恒星进行了全面研究。他们发现更大质量的恒星展现出更长的平顶期，而更高的金属丰度导致了更高的不透明度和原恒星的质量损失。高速旋转影响了内部恒星结构，增强了对流混合和质量损失，潜在地影响了平顶期的亮度和持续时间。更高的爆发能量导致更明亮但持续时间更短的平顶期，而56Ni的质量影响着后期的亮度和持续时间。由此，他们得出了SNe IIP和其原恒星参数之间的关系。这些研究成果有助于更好地理解SNe IIP的起源和演化过程。<br /><br />总结: 这篇文章使用MESA代码对SNe IIP和其原恒星进行了研究。通过比较光变曲线，发现了恒星质量、金属丰度、旋转速率、爆发能量和56Ni质量对SNe IIP的影响。研究结果有助于更好地理解SNe IIP的起源和演化过程。 <div>
Type IIP supernovae (SNe IIP) are thought to originate from the explosion of massive stars >10 M⊙. Their luminosity is primarily powered by the explosion energy and the radioactive decay energy of 56Co, with the photosphere location regulated by hydrogen recombination. However, the physical connections between SNe IIP and their progenitor stars remain unclear. This paper presents a comprehensive study of SNe IIP and their progenitor stars by using the one-dimensional stellar evolution code, MESA. Our model grids consider the effects of stellar metallicity, mass, and rotation in the evolution of massive stars, as well as the explosion energy and 56Ni production in modeling supernovae. To elucidate the observed SNe IIP and their origins, we compare their light curves (LCs) with our models. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of stellar parameters on LCs by considering stellar mass, metallicity, rotation, explosion energy, and 56Ni production. We find that more massive stars exhibit longer plateaus due to increased photon diffusion time caused by massive ejecta. Higher metallicity leads to increased opacity and mass loss of progenitor stars. Rapid rotation affects internal stellar structures, enhancing convective mixing and mass loss, potentially affecting the plateau’s brightness and duration. Higher explosion energy results in brighter but shorter plateaus due to faster-moving ejecta. 56Ni mass affects late-time luminosity and plateau duration, with larger masses leading to slower declines.

<div> Cairns distribution, nonthermal attributes, space plasmas, kinetic Alfvén waves, solar corona
<br /><br />总结:
本文介绍了在太空等离子体中利用Cairns分布对非热属性进行表征的重要性。文章提到，传统上非热波动被认为是在Maxwellian分布等离子体中的回旋半径修正项，但作者介绍了一种基于动力学理论和Cairns分布的创新视角。研究重点是在太阳冠中基于Cairns分布函数的动能阿尔夫文波的扰动电磁场比和Poynting流的比率。此外，文章还探讨了垂直分量和平行归一化Poynting流的功率率的细微评估。研究发现，相比于Maxwellian分布，大值的Λ表现出更有利的属性，特别是在沿环境磁场线延伸的距离上对等离子体的充能过程有显著影响。这些分析结果在理解太阳大气中的现象、尤其是在观测到的加热过程中非热粒子所起的重要作用上具有实际应用意义。 <div>
The utilization of the Cairns distribution serves as a vital tool for characterizing the nonthermal attributes commonly observed in space plasmas. In these intricate plasma environments, extensive measurements have been conducted to monitor the fluctuations inherent in the perturbed electromagnetic (EM) field and the associated Poynting flux, specifically concerning kinetic Alfvén waves (KAWs). Traditionally, these fluctuations have been attributed to gyroradius correction terms within the framework of Maxwellian distributed plasmas. However, our study introduces an innovative perspective grounded in kinetic theory coupled with the Cairns distribution, adept at encapsulating the nonthermal nuances characterized by the index parameter Λ. Within the domain of the solar corona, our investigation centers on the perturbed EM field ratios and the Poynting flux of KAWs, with a foundation in the Cairns distribution function. It is noteworthy that the perpendicular components, although deemed less significant due to the dominance of k⊥ over k∥, remain unquantified regarding their relative insignificance. Similarly, the exploration of the imaginary part of the normalized EM field ratio has been a relatively understudied domain. Furthermore, we delve into the nuanced assessment of the power rate Ix/Iz characterizing the perpendicular and parallel normalized Poynting fluxes (Sx and Sz). Intriguingly, we discern that large values of Λ, compared to their Maxwellian counterparts, manifest advantageous attributes, particularly concerning the energization of the plasma over extended distances along the ambient magnetic field lines. The analytical insights gleaned from this study find practical application in understanding phenomena within the solar atmosphere, particularly shedding light on the significant role played by nonthermal particles in the observed heating processes.

这项研究使用了FourStar Galaxy Evolution Survey目录中的200个V形光谱能量分布非活动星系的数据，通过对它们的SED进行拟合，得出了它们的平均年龄。研究发现，在红移较高的星系中，它们的平均年龄较年轻，但在红移大于2.5的星系中，平均年龄并没有显著的变化，大多数星系的平均年龄在1到2亿年之间。此外，研究还发现，大质量星系的年龄较大，通常在10亿年以上，并且比较小质量星系的形成时间更早。这些发现有助于对标准宇宙学中的星系形成模型进行讨论。 <br /><br />总结: 这项研究利用星系的SED数据，发现高红移星系的平均年龄较年轻，但随着红移的增加，星系的平均年龄并没有显著变化，大质量星系的年龄较大且形成较早。这些发现对于讨论标准宇宙学中的星系形成模型具有重要意义。 <div>
Observations of large amounts of massive galaxies with relatively old populations found at high redshifts are challenging galaxy formation scenarios within the standard cosmology. Precise determinations of the average age of these galaxies would be useful for the discussion of this problem. Here we carry out a better constraint of the age of 200 V-shaped spectral energy distribution (SED) nonactive galactic nucleus galaxies at redshifts 2 < z < 4 of the catalog of the FourStar Galaxy Evolution Survey, identified by the V shape in their SED with a Lyman and a Balmer break. The SED fitting includes a main stellar population in addition to a residual younger population and extinction. The galaxies are younger at a higher redshift on average. However, for the galaxies with z > 2.5, we do not see a significant evolution of their average age, with all average ages of the galaxies mostly remaining between 1 and 2 Gyr. Our research finds that most massive galaxies (∼1010M⊙) are older (typically > ∼1 Gyr old) and formed earlier than less massive galaxies in our sample.

总结:
850μm线偏振和C18O (3 − 2)以及13CO (3 − 2)分子线观测表明，Cocoon星云(IC 5146)中的F13和F13S丝状结构是热过临界的，其中有识别出沿其顶部的密集核心。磁场向量在核心尺度上倾向于与丝状结构平行，但在高密度区域会受到扰动。通过Davis–Chandrasekhar–Fermi方法测量的磁场强度为58 ± 31μG和40 ± 9μG，表明这些丝状结构是次临界的和次Alfvén速度的，强调了磁场在Cocoon星云中的重要性。此外，通过观测到的C18O (3 − 2)速度和密度分布以及13CO (3 − 2)数据的大尺度速度场，我们提出了F13和F13S的形成和演化情景。辐射冲击波产生于大约1.4百万年前与类B星发生碰撞，丝状结构成为热过临界，随后通过重力分割形成了密集核心，同时伴随着磁场的扰动。 <div>
We present 850 μm linear polarization and C18O (3 − 2) and 13CO (3 − 2) molecular line observations toward the filaments (F13 and F13S) in the Cocoon Nebula (IC 5146) using the JCMT POL-2 and Heterodyne Array Receiver Program instruments. F13 and F13S are found to be thermally supercritical with identified dense cores along their crests. Our findings include that the polarization fraction decreases in denser regions, indicating reduced dust grain alignment efficiency. The magnetic field vectors at core scales tend to be parallel to the filaments, but disturbed at the high density regions. Magnetic field strengths measured using the Davis–Chandrasekhar–Fermi method are 58 ± 31 and 40 ± 9 μG for F13 and F13S, respectively, and it reveals subcritical and sub-Alfvénic filaments, emphasizing the importance of magnetic fields in the Cocoon region. Sinusoidal C18O (3 − 2) velocity and density distributions are observed along the filaments’ skeletons, and their variations are mostly displaced by ∼1/4 × the wavelength of the sinusoid, indicating core formation occurred through the fragmentation of a gravitationally unstable filament, but with shorter core spacings than predicted. Large-scale velocity fields of F13 and F13S, studied using 13CO (3 − 2) data, present a V-shape transverse velocity structure. We propose a scenario for the formation and evolution of F13 and F13S, along with the dense cores within them. A radiation shock front generated by a B-type star collided with a sheet-like cloud about 1.4 Myr ago. The filaments became thermally critical due to mass infall through self-gravity ∼1 Myr ago, and subsequently, dense cores formed through gravitational fragmentation, accompanied by the disturbance of the magnetic field.

<div> kappa distributions, plasma, electromagnetic fluctuations, magnetized plasma, electron cyclotron whistler mode fluctuations
<br />总结:
本文研究了在内太阳圈中的kappa分布等离子体，在这种分布中，等离子体会自发地发出电磁波动。 当超热电子参与其中时，这些自发辐射会得到增强。此外，文章还通过比较磁谱对电子回旋骚扰模式波动进行了系统的定量比较。结果表明，磁场波动的能量水平随着β值的增加和κ值的减小而增加。另外，对于kappa分布而言，当κ值减小时，磁场波动的总能量会减少。 <div>
In the inner heliosphere, space measurements have revealed that plasma is well described by the kappa distributions, which are characterized by the value of the κ parameter. This parameter indicates how far plasma is from the ideal Maxwell–Boltzmann equilibrium distribution and gives the distribution a typical high-energy power-law tail. In these quasi-equilibrium conditions, the plasma spontaneously emits electromagnetic fluctuations. When suprathermal electrons are involved, these spontaneous emissions get enhanced, and the kappa distributions improve the description of the related nonthermal effects by taking into account the contribution of these high-energy electrons. Nevertheless, the kappa distributions describe different scenarios in which the velocity distribution may obey a power-law decay. Here, we present a systematic and quantitative comparison of kappa-distributed magnetized plasma through a comparison of magnetic spectra for electron cyclotron whistler mode fluctuations. Our results show that for a kappa distribution with a thermal speed equal to the one obtained in thermal equilibrium, the magnetic field fluctuations exhibit higher energy levels that scale with increasing values of β and decreasing values of κ, even though the same thermal speed is considered for all studied cases. Conversely, for a kappa distribution with a kappa-dependent thermal speed, the magnetic field fluctuations tend to exhibit less total energy with lower kappa values, even when compared to the Maxwellian distribution equilibrium results in the same range of parameters.

这项研究对886颗脉冲星的光谱特性进行了广泛分析，发现大多数脉冲星的光谱呈现幂律行为。研究采用了五种不同的光谱模型，其中发现简单幂律模型的平均谱指数为-1.64 ± 0.80。此外，在毫秒脉冲星中观察到了光谱指数与特征参数之间的显著相关性，同时在正常脉冲星中并没有观察到强相关性。各种模型显示出与光谱指数相关的最显著特征参数的变化，表明毫秒脉冲星中存在多种主导辐射机制。最后，基于Akaike信息准则，该研究首次确定了22颗呈现千兆赫峰谱类型的脉冲星。 <div>
This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the spectral properties of 886 pulsars across a wide frequency range from 20 MHz–343.5 GHz, including a total of 86 millisecond pulsars (MSPs). The majority of the pulsars exhibit power-law behavior in their spectra, although some exceptions are observed. Five different spectral models, namely, simple power law, broken power law, low-frequency turnover, high-frequency cutoff, and double turnover, were employed to explore the spectral behaviors. The average spectral index for pulsars modeled with a simple power law is found to be −1.64 ± 0.80, consistent with previous studies. Additionally, significant correlations between the spectral index and characteristic parameters are observed, particularly in MSPs, while no strong correlation is observed in normal pulsars. Different models show variations in the most influential characteristic parameters associated with the spectral index, indicating diverse dominant radiation mechanisms in MSPs. Finally, this study identifies 22 pulsars of the gigahertz-peaked spectra type for the first time based on the Akaike information criterion.

总结: 
这篇文章研究了太阳活动层的加热机制，通过对GREGOR望远镜获取的数据进行分析，作者发现光球和上层色球中的微小极性磁场对日冕的加热没有显著影响，未能支持假设。进一步的物理论证表明，任何未解决的少数极性通量也不能到达相邻于上色球的冠层脚点，并且即使如此，由此产生的色球重连释放的能量也不足以解释日冕的能量损失。作者得出结论，明亮的色球、过渡区和冠层环等等必须通过涉及单极性场的机制进行加热。 <div>
We examine the hypothesis that multipolar magnetic fields advected by photospheric granules can contribute to heating the active chromosphere and corona. On 2020 September 28 the Gregor Infrared Spectrograph (GRIS) and HiFI+ instruments at the GREGOR telescope obtained data of NOAA 12773. We analyze Stokes profiles of spectral lines of Si i and He i, to study magnetic fields from the photosphere to the upper chromosphere. Magnetogram and EUV data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager and Atmospheric Imaging Assembly instruments on the Solar Dynamics Observatory spacecraft are coaligned and studied in relation to the GRIS data. At coronal loop footpoints, minor polarity fields comprise just 0.2% and 0.02% of the flux measured over the 40″ × 60″ area observed in the photosphere and upper chromosphere, centered 320″ from the disk center. Significantly, the minority fields are situated ≳12″ from bright footpoints. We use physical arguments to show that any unresolved minority flux cannot reach coronal footpoints adjacent to the upper chromosphere. Even if it did, the most optimistic estimate of the energy released through chromospheric reconnection is barely sufficient to account for the coronal energy losses. Further, dynamical changes accompanying reconnection between uni- and multipolar fields are seen neither in the He i data nor in narrowband movies of the Hα line core. We conclude that the hypothesis must be rejected. Bright chromospheric, transition region, and coronal loop plasmas must be heated by mechanisms involving unipolar fields.

<div> Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope, Galactic bubbles, AGN jets, relativistic hydrodynamic simulations, cosmic rays 

总结:
通过三维相对论流体动力学模拟，研究表明银河盘内密集的气体会破坏射流的整理，形成热气泡。这些气泡受到银河大气层的浮力作用，使它们垂直排列成对称的Fermi和eROSITA气泡。研究还发现，假设一个轻子模型，可以通过CR的动力谱指数为2.4来复制观测到的伽马射线气泡和微波暗区。这些模拟与观测到的多波长特征的一致性表明，通过斜向AGN失败的射流形成银河气泡是一种合理的情景。 <div>
The Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope reveals two large bubbles in the Galaxy, extending nearly symmetrically ∼50° above and below the Galactic center (GC). Previous simulations of bubble formation invoking active galactic nucleus (AGN) jets have assumed that the jets are vertical to the Galactic disk; however, in general, the jet orientation does not necessarily correlate with the rotational axis of the Galactic disk. Using three-dimensional special relativistic hydrodynamic simulations including cosmic rays (CRs) and thermal gas, we show that the dense clumpy gas within the Galactic disk disrupts jet collimation (“failed jets” hereafter), which causes the failed jets to form hot bubbles. Subsequent buoyancy in the stratified atmosphere renders them vertical to form the symmetric Fermi and eROSITA bubbles (collectively, Galactic bubbles). We find that (1) despite the relativistic jets emanating from the GC at various angles ≤45° with respect to the rotational axis of the Galaxy, the Galactic bubbles nonetheless appear aligned with the axis; (2) the edge of the eROSITA bubbles corresponds to a forward shock driven by the hot bubbles; (3) followed by the forward shock is a tangling contact discontinuity corresponding to the edge of the Fermi bubbles; (4) assuming a leptonic model we find that the observed gamma-ray bubbles and microwave haze can be reproduced with a best-fit CR power-law spectral index of 2.4; The agreements between the simulated and the observed multiwavelength features suggest that forming the Galactic bubbles by oblique AGN failed jets is a plausible scenario.

The polarized images of the supermassive black hole Messier 87* (M87*) produced by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) provide a direct view of the near-horizon emission from a black hole accretion and jet system. The EHT theoretical analysis of the polarized M87* images compared thousands of snapshots from numerical models with a variety of spins, magnetization states, viewing inclinations, and electron energy distributions, and found a small subset consistent with the observed image. In this article, we examine two models favored by EHT analyses: a magnetically arrested disk with moderate retrograde spin and a magnetically arrested disk with high prograde spin. Both have electron distribution functions that lead to strong depolarization by cold electrons. We ray trace five snapshots from each model at 22, 43, 86, 230, 345, and 690 GHz to forecast future very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations and examine limitations in numerical models. We find that even at low frequencies where optical and Faraday rotation depths are large, approximately rotationally symmetric polarization persists, suggesting that shallow depths dominate the polarization signal. However, morphology and spectra suggest that the assumed thermal electron distribution is not adequate to describe emission from the jet. We find 86 GHz images show a ringlike shape determined by a combination of plasma and spacetime imprints, smaller in diameter than recent results from the Global mm-VLBI Array. We find that the photon ring becomes more apparent with increasing frequency, and is more apparent in the retrograde model, leading to large differences between models in asymmetry and polarization structure.

We simulate the emission in the shallow decay phase of gamma-ray burst afterglows using a time-dependent code. We test four models: the energy injection model, evolving the injection efficiency of nonthermal electrons, evolving the amplification of the magnetic field, and the wind model with a relatively low bulk Lorentz factor. All of the four models can reproduce the typical X-ray afterglow lightcurve. The spectral shape depends on not only the parameter values at the time corresponding to the observer time but also the past evolution of the parameters. The model differences appear in the evolution of the broadband spectrum, especially in the inverse Compton component. Future gamma-ray observations with imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array will reveal the mechanism of the shallow decay phase.

总结: 
该研究介绍了一个名为Empirical and Radiative Transfer Hybrid (EaRTH) Disk Model的混合模型，将原行星盘的矿物学特征与射电传输模型相结合，以生成中红外光谱能量分布。通过对MP Mus附近T Tauri星的原行星盘进行模型拟合，发现了该盘中微米级橄榄石和微米级方镁铁矿的主导情况。EaRTH Disk方法提供了盘组成和结构的同时洞察，并直接适用于詹姆斯·韦伯空间望远镜产生的原行星盘中红外光谱的解释。 <br /><br /> <div>
Our understanding of how exoplanets form and evolve relies on analyses of both the mineralogy of protoplanetary disks and their detailed structures; however, these key complementary aspects of disks are usually studied separately. We present initial results from a hybrid model that combines the empirical characterization of the mineralogy of a disk, as determined from its mid-infrared spectral features, with the MCFOST radiative transfer disk model, a combination we call the Empirical and Radiative Transfer Hybrid (EaRTH) Disk Model. With the results of the mineralogy detection serving as input to the radiative transfer model, we generate mid-infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) that reflect both the mineralogical and structural parameters of the corresponding disk. Initial fits of the SED output by the resulting integrated model of Spitzer Space Telescope mid-infrared spectra of the protoplanetary disk orbiting the nearby T Tauri star MP Mus demonstrate the potential advantages of this approach by revealing details like the dominance of micron-sized olivine and micron-sized forsterite in this dusty disk. The simultaneous insight into disk composition and structure provided by the EaRTH Disk methodology should be directly applicable to the interpretation of mid-infrared spectra of protoplanetary disks that will be produced by the James Webb Space Telescope.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章讨论了太阳磁场模型的问题，提出了三个评估参数来量化评估磁场模型，并通过真实观测约束太阳冠状磁场和行星际磁场中的自由参数。研究发现，采用特定模型和观测数据可以减少开放通量问题，对于太阳极小期的Carrington旋转2231，建议使用PFSS+PFCS模型的最佳参数为Rss = 2.2–2.5 R☉和Rscs = 10.5–14.0 R☉。然而，通过人工增加极地磁场，虽然行星际磁场与观测数据一致，但太阳附近的磁场仍然被低估。研究指出，改进对微弱磁场和极地磁场的精确度以及考虑行星际物理过程产生的磁活动可能有助于解决开放通量问题。 <div>
Solar magnetic fields are closely related to various physical phenomena on the Sun, which can be extrapolated with different models from photospheric magnetograms. However, the open flux problem (OFP), the underestimation of the magnetic field derived from the extrapolated model, is still unsolved. To minimize the impact of the OFP, we propose three evaluation parameters to quantitatively evaluate magnetic field models and determine the optimal free parameters in the models by constraining the coronal magnetic fields and the interplanetary magnetic fields (IMFs) with real observations. Although the OFP still exists, we find that magnetic field lines traced from the coronal models effectively capture the intricate topological configurations observed in the corona, including streamers and plumes. The OFP is lessened by using the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager synoptic map instead of the Global Oscillation Network Group daily synoptic maps, and the potential field source surface + potential field current sheet (PFSS+PFCS) model instead of the current sheet source surface (CSSS) model. For Carrington Rotation 2231 at the solar minimum, we suggest that the optimal parameters for the PFSS+PFCS model are Rss = 2.2–2.5 R☉ and Rscs = 10.5–14.0 R☉, as well as for the CSSS model, are Rcs = 2.0–2.4 R☉, Rss = 11.0–14.7 R☉, and a = 1.0 R☉. Despite the IMFs at 1 au being consistent with the measurements by artificially increasing the polar magnetic fields, the IMFs near the Sun are still underestimated. The OFP might be advanced by improving the accuracy of both the weak magnetic fields and polar magnetic fields, especially considering magnetic activities arising from interplanetary physical processes.

<div> Poynting flux, plasma loops, solar corona, chromospheric, observational constraints

总结:
该研究分析了太阳冕层等离子体环的加热不仅取决于Poynting流量，而且还取决于尚未确定的过程。这一发现反映并细化了早期提出的问题，即为什么和如何整个磁流体结构只间歇性地加载了明亮的冕层等离子体。研究者通过分析更多的色球和冕层数据，以找到对冕层加热机制的可重复性观测约束。他们研究了六次独立的色球活动区磁场扫描，并将其与上方热等离子体环联系起来。首次，他们将超过30个明亮等离子体环的足点与从上色球测量的Poynting流量的标量代理相关联。尽管不完美，这些代理均表明足点Poynting流量和环亮度之间普遍缺乏相关性。研究结果巩固了未观测到的物理过程正在发挥作用，这些过程控制着长寿命的冕层环的加热。 <br /><br /> <div>
A recent analysis has suggested that the heating of plasma loops in the solar corona depends not just on the Poynting flux but also on processes yet to be identified. This discovery reflects and refines earlier questions such as, Why and how are entire hydromagnetic structures only intermittently loaded with bright coronal plasma? The present work scrutinizes more chromospheric and coronal data, with the aim of finding reproducible observational constraints on coronal heating mechanisms. Six independent scans of chromospheric active-region magnetic fields are investigated and correlated to overlying hot plasma loops. For the first time, the footpoints of over 30 bright plasma loops are thus related to scalar proxies for the Poynting fluxes measured from the upper chromosphere. Although imperfect, the proxies all indicate a general lack of correlation between footpoint Poynting flux and loop brightness. Our findings consolidate the claim that unobserved physical processes are at work, which govern the heating of long-lived coronal loops.

研究了磁化中子星（NS）被超Eddington吸积盘包围的吸积过程。通过构建吸积盘结构的自相似解，详细研究了NS磁屏蔽和吸积盘内部区域之间的相互作用，并揭示了这种相互作用发生在一个薄边界层内。发现磁屏蔽半径大约与阿尔文半径成正比，系数在0.34-0.71之间，受磁场的对流和扭曲、NS自转以及NS吸积柱发射的辐射的影响。在超Eddington吸积条件下，NS可以很容易地加速成为一个快速旋转体。提出的模型可以用来探索不同天体物理背景下NS的吸积和演化，如超亮X射线双星或活跃星系核盘。<br /><br />总结: 研究了磁化中子星被超Eddington吸积盘包围的吸积过程，通过构建吸积盘结构的自相似解，揭示了磁屏蔽半径与阿尔文半径的关系，以及NS在超Eddington吸积条件下可能的自旋加速。该模型可用于探究不同天体物理背景下NS的吸积和演化。 <div>
The properties of super-Eddington accretion disks exhibit substantial distinctions from the sub-Eddington ones. In this paper, we investigate the accretion process of a magnetized neutron star (NS) surrounded by a super-Eddington disk. By constructing self-similar solutions for the disk structure, we study in detail an interaction between the NS magnetosphere and the inner region of the disk, revealing that this interaction takes place within a thin boundary layer. The magnetosphere truncation radius is found to be approximately proportional to the Alfvén radius, with a coefficient ranging between 0.34–0.71, influenced by the advection and twisting of a magnetic field, NS rotation, and radiation emitted from an NS accretion column. Under super-Eddington accretion, the NS can readily spin up to become a rapid rotator. The proposed model can be employed to explore the accretion and evolution of NSs in diverse astrophysical contexts, such as ultraluminous X-ray binaries or active galactic nucleus disks.

<div> 低质量X射线双星，Ser X-1，软谱状态，射电发射，长期变化

总结:
Ser X-1是一颗低质量中子星X射线双星，自上世纪60年代发现以来一直持续吸积，并且一直处于软谱状态，从未显示出实质性的长期X射线变化。研究人员最近对其进行了10次射电观测，发现8次未探测到射电发射，而2次探测到了射电发射。在对这两次探测到的射电发射进行分析后，发现其并未检测到偏振，排除了极高的偏振水平。这与黑洞X射线双星的行为相矛盾，因此对于Ser X-1其长期变化的射电行为令人困惑。 <div>
Ser X–1 is a low-mass neutron star X-ray binary and has been persistently accreting since its discovery in the 1960s. It has always been observed to be in a soft spectral state and has never showed substantial long-term X-ray variability. Ser X–1 has one previous radio observation in the literature in which radio emission was detected during this soft state, which is contrary to the behavior of black hole X-ray binaries. We have recently obtained 10 randomly sampled radio epochs of Ser X–1 in order to further investigate its anomalous soft-state radio emission. Out of 10 epochs, we find 8 nondetections and 2 detections at 10 GHz flux densities of 19.9 ± 4.2 μJy and 32.2 ± 3.6 μJy, respectively. We do not detect polarization in either epoch, ruling out very high polarization levels (≲63% and 34%). We compare these Ser X–1 results to other X-ray binaries and consider explanations for its long-term variable radio behavior.

<div> SNR, RCW 103, Fermi-LAT, γ-ray emission, hadronic scenario
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章分析了费米伽马射线空间望远镜在RCW 103年轻超新星遗迹区域获得的超过15年的γ射线数据。研究表明，4FGL J1616.2−5054e，即HESS J1616−518的对应源，距离SNR约13′，并且被确定为最近的费米-LAT源目录中的延伸源。研究还发现，具有幂律（PL）光谱的点源（PS）最能描述检测到的γ射线发射，而这一点源位于SNR的南边缘。PL发射的光子指数为Γ≈2.31（或者在对数抛物线模型中为α≈2.4），比之前报道的考虑HESS J1616−518对应源为PS时的Γ≈2.0要软（这可能导致了对RCW 103的延伸发射的误认）。为了在强子场景中产生γ射线发射，估计需要具有指数约为2.4的PL能量分布的质子。这些结果与多波段观测的结果相吻合，后者指出南缘的遗迹正在与分子云相互作用。 <div>
We analyze more than 15 yr of γ-ray data obtained with the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi) for the region of the young supernova remnant (SNR) RCW 103, since the nearby source 4FGL J1616.2−5054e, counterpart to HESS J1616−518 and ≃13′ away from the SNR, is determined to be extended in the more recent Fermi-LAT source catalog. Different templates for 4FGL J1616.2−5054e and RCW 103 are tested, and we find that a point source (PS) with a power-law (PL) spectrum at the southern limb of the SNR best describes the detected γ-ray emission. The photon index of the PL emission is Γ ≃ 2.31 (or α ≃ 2.4 in a log-parabola model), softer than the previously reported Γ ≃ 2.0 when the counterpart to HESS J1616−518 was considered to be a PS (which likely caused misidentification of extended emission at RCW 103). In order to produce the γ-ray emission in a hadronic scenario, we estimate that protons with an index ∼2.4 PL energy distribution are needed. These results fit with those from multiwavelength observations that have indicated the remnant at the southern limb is interacting with a molecular cloud.

While high-resolution Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations reveal a wealth of substructure in protoplanetary disks, they remain incapable of resolving the types of small-scale dust structures predicted, for example, by numerical simulations of the streaming instability. In this article, we propose a method to find evidence for unresolved, optically thick dusty rings in protoplanetary disks. We demonstrate that, in presence of unresolved rings, the brightness of an inclined disk exhibits a distinctive emission peak at the minor axis. Furthermore, the azimuthal brightness depends on both the geometry of the rings and the dust optical properties; we can therefore use the azimuthal brightness variations to both detect unresolved rings and probe their properties. By analyzing the azimuthal brightness in the test case of ringlike substructures formed by streaming instability, we show that the resulting peak is likely detectable by ALMA for typical disk parameters. Moreover, we present an analytic model that not only qualitatively but also quantitatively reproduces the peak found in the simulations, validating its applicability to infer the presence of unresolved rings in observations and characterize their optical properties and shape. This will contribute to the identification of disk regions where streaming instability (and thus planet formation) is occurring.

发现射电余辉，确定为短时宇宙射线暴210726A的射电余辉，红移约为z∼2.4的星系。在爆发后开始射电观测不到1天内，并没有探测到射电辐射，直到约11天后才出现。余辉随后在一周内明显增加约3倍，随后迅速衰减（“射电耀斑”）。研究人员发现，前向冲击余辉模型不能自洽地描述多波段X射线和射电数据，并且低估了射电耀斑的流量约5倍。他们发现，注入大量能量，增加射束动能，使爆发的各向同性动能增加约4倍，或者来自壳层碰撞的逆向冲击是匹配宽带行为的有效解决方案。在z∼2.4，GRB 210726A是迄今发现的最高红移的短时宇宙射线暴之一，也是射电和X射线中最亮的。结合和比较所有先前的短时宇宙射线暴射电余辉观测，研究人员发现，大多数已发表的射电搜索在爆发后≲10天内结束，有可能错过这些后期出现、明亮的射电余辉。<br /><br />总结: 高红移的短时宇宙射线暴210726A的射电余辉显示出异常的特征，迅速的增亮和快速衰减。标准的前向冲击余辉模型无法解释观测数据，而能量注入或壳层碰撞对解释这一特征提供了可行的解释。这表明现有的射电观测可能需要更长时间，以捕获这些特殊情况下射电余辉的演变。 <div>
We present the discovery of the radio afterglow of the short gamma-ray burst (GRB) 210726A, localized to a galaxy at a photometric redshift of z ∼ 2.4. While radio observations commenced ≲1 day after the burst, no radio emission was detected until ∼11 days. The radio afterglow subsequently brightened by a factor of ∼3 in the span of a week, followed by a rapid decay (a “radio flare”). We find that a forward shock afterglow model cannot self-consistently describe the multiwavelength X-ray and radio data, and underpredicts the flux of the radio flare by a factor of ≈5. We find that the addition of substantial energy injection, which increases the isotropic kinetic energy of the burst by a factor of ≈4, or a reverse shock from a shell collision are viable solutions to match the broadband behavior. At z ∼ 2.4, GRB 210726A is among the highest-redshift short GRBs discovered to date, as well as the most luminous in radio and X-rays. Combining and comparing all previous radio afterglow observations of short GRBs, we find that the majority of published radio searches conclude by ≲10 days after the burst, potentially missing these late-rising, luminous radio afterglows.

<div> 关键词: 碳含量，热解物质，星际微粒，低质量原恒星，热气体

总结:
本文研究了地球和原始流星与太阳和星际微粒的低碳含量差异，表明碳质颗粒在年轻太阳系的内部几个天文单位内被破坏。研究发现在七个低质量和一个中等质量原恒星（Lbol∼2-300L⊙）的观测结果中，所有源都存在>300 K的热气体，暗示热气体可能是普遍存在的。此外，通过相同观测获得的CH3OH的激发温度始终较低（∼135-250 K），表明CH3CN和CH3OH有不同的空间分布。1mm和3mm处的柱密度比较显示，CH3CN在3mm处的增加幅度比CH3OH更大，这表明CH3CN在热气体中增加超过了CH3OH。如果这种CH3CN增加是碳颗粒热解的结果，这些结果表明地球的初始形成条件可能并不罕见。 <div>
The low carbon content of Earth and primitive meteorites compared to the Sun and interstellar grains suggests that carbon-rich grains were destroyed in the inner few astronomical units of the young solar system. A promising mechanism to selectively destroy carbonaceous grains is thermal sublimation within the soot line at ≳300 K. To address whether such hot conditions are common among low-mass protostars, we observe CH3CN transitions at 1, 2, and 3 mm with the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array toward seven low-mass and one intermediate-mass protostar (Lbol ∼ 2–300L⊙), as CH3CN is an excellent temperature tracer. We find >300 K gas toward all sources, indicating that hot gas may be prevalent. Moreover, the excitation temperature for CH3OH obtained with the same observations is always lower (∼135–250 K), suggesting that CH3CN and CH3OH have a different spatial distribution. A comparison of the column densities at 1 and 3 mm shows a stronger increase at 3 mm for CH3CN than for CH3OH. Since the dust opacity is lower at longer wavelengths, this indicates that CH3CN is enhanced in the hot gas compared to CH3OH. If this CH3CN enhancement is the result of carbon-grain sublimation, these results suggest that Earth’s initial formation conditions may not be rare.

研究表明，星爆条件下存在偏向大质量恒星的恒星初始质量函数（IMF），与银河系不同。我们利用ALMA对4个高红移主序星系进行了观测，发现其中的SDSS J0901+1814存在13CO和C18O的清晰信号，首次在高红移主序星系中检测到CO同位素。观测结果显示，13C/18O比值明显低于本地主序星系。化学演化模型估计，这些星系的IMF更偏向于银河系IMF的大质量恒星。因此，高红移宇宙中的主序星系和星爆星系相似，存在更多大质量恒星。 <br /><br />总结: 近期观测和理论挑战了恒星初始质量函数在极端环境中的普遍性。高红移主序星系中检测到的CO同位素信号表明，这些星系的IMF更偏向于大质量恒星，类似于星爆星系，与银河系的IMF存在差异。 <div>
Recent observations and theories have presented a strong challenge to the universality of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) in extreme environments. A notable example has been found for starburst conditions, where evidence favors a top-heavy IMF, i.e., there is a bias toward massive stars compared to the IMF that is responsible for the stellar mass function and elemental abundances observed in the Milky Way. Local starburst galaxies have star formation rates similar to those in high-redshift main-sequence galaxies, which appear to dominate the stellar mass budget at early epochs. However, the IMF of high-redshift main-sequence galaxies is yet to be probed. Since 13CO and C18O isotopologues are sensitive to the IMF, we have observed these lines toward four strongly lensed high-redshift main-sequence galaxies using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. Of our four targets, SDSS J0901+1814, at z ≈ 2.26, is seen clearly in 13CO and C18O, the first detection of CO isotopologues in the high-redshift main-sequence galaxy population. The observed 13C/18O ratio, 2.4 ± 0.8, is significantly lower than that of local main-sequence galaxies. We estimate the isotope ratio, oxygen abundance, and stellar mass using a series of chemical evolution models with varying star formation histories and IMFs. All models favor an IMF that is more top-heavy than that of the Milky Way. Thus, as with starburst galaxies, main-sequence galaxies in the high-redshift Universe have a greater fraction of massive stars than a Milky Way IMF would imply.

该研究利用西藏ASγ实验中收集到的4TeV宇宙射线数据，通过非线性插值模型回归来提取标准化因子，从而得到真实的相对强度天空图。研究采用各种测试统计量表明，非线性拟合在模拟宇宙射线各向异性方面的表现明显优于直接线性拟合。研究还通过该程序生成标准化常数，以追踪实验响应宇宙射线强度的纬度变化。在对西藏ASγ数据进行纬度响应函数修正后，研究生成了真实相对强度的天空图。结果表明，测量和修正后的天空图在强度和角谱功率上存在显著差异。最终的全向异性真实相对强度天空图反驳了经纬度平均通量变化可忽略不计的假设。结果进一步证实了TeV宇宙射线各向异性由与星际磁场方向一致的偶极子（ℓ = 1）主导，并确认了在ℓ = 2和ℓ = 13之间存在着更弱的中尺度星际各向异性。 <br /><br />总结: 西藏ASγ实验的4TeV宇宙射线观测数据经过非线性插值模型回归，得到了真实的相对强度天空图，结果显示宇宙射线各向异性受星际磁场方向影响显著，并证实了中尺度星际各向异性的存在。 <div>
We use data from the Tibet ASγ experiment for 4 teraelectronvolt (TeV) cosmic rays as an example to perform a nonlinear interstellar distribution model regression according to the way the observed anisotropy is typically presented, from which we extract normalization factors that allow us to obtain a true relative intensity sky map from the measurements. By using various test statistics, we show that the nonlinear fit significantly outperforms the direct linear fit in its ability to model cosmic-ray anisotropy. The procedure also allows us to produce normalization constants that can trace minute latitudinal variations of experimental response to cosmic-ray intensity. Applying the correction of the latitudinal response function to the Tibet ASγ data, we generate a sky map of true relative intensity. As a result, we observe that the measured and corrected sky maps show significant differences in intensity and angular spectral power. Our full anisotropy sky map of true relative intensity contradicts the assumption that the latitudinal variation in longitudinally averaged flux is negligible. The result further confirms that TeV cosmic-ray anisotropy is dominated by a dipole (ℓ = 1) aligned with the interstellar magnetic field’s direction. Our results also confirm the existence of much weaker middle-scale interstellar anisotropy between ℓ = 2 and ℓ = 13.

<div> 关键词: preliminary interplanetary disturbance index, spectral whitening method, solar wind measurements, geomagnetic disturbance index, space weather monitoring

总结:
通过对太阳风测量数据的能量耦合函数进行频谱白化处理，我们得到了初步的行星间扰动指数（J），该指数可作为近地太阳风扰动的指标。我们对167次地磁风暴进行了详细分析，发现J和地磁扰动指数（J ）之间存在明显的时间延迟，J相对于J有不同的变化。对147次选定事件进行的统计分析显示，J的较大值和J的较小幅度通常伴随着增强的向南磁场，这意味着更多的太阳风能量进入磁层，从而引发强烈的地磁风暴。此外，对两个指数进行线性拟合表明，可以根据J预测J的发展约2小时，这表明J可以提供可能的地磁场扰动的及时警告，对太空天气监测和操作预报至关重要。 <br /><br /> <div>
We develop a preliminary interplanetary disturbance index (J ) by applying the spectral whitening method to an energy coupling function with solar wind measurements during the years 1998–2014 as the input, which can be used as an indicator of perturbations in the near-Earth solar wind. The correlation and temporal variation between J and the geomagnetic disturbance index (J ) constructed from the same method have been analyzed in detail for 167 geomagnetic storms with the minimum Dst index less than or equal to −50 nT. The time delay between J and J is clearly observable and varies for different events, according to which J is shifted backward with respect to J . We obtain a fairly good negative correlation between the shifted J and the J indices for the majority of events, and the significance level for 88% of the events (i.e., 147 events) does not exceed 0.05. A statistical analysis of the shifted J and the J indices for 147 selected events reveals that larger values of J and smaller magnitudes of J are commonly accompanied by enhanced southward magnetic fields, which implies that more solar wind energy is entering the magnetosphere and thus causing strong geomagnetic storms. Furthermore, a linear fit of the two indices suggests that the evolution of J can be predicted about 2 hr in advance based on J , indicating that J can provide early warnings of possible disturbances in the geomagnetic fields, which is crucial for space weather monitoring and operational forecasting.

<div> LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA, BBH mergers, stellar progenitors, metallicity-dependent efficiency, delay times
<br /><br />总结:
LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA观测到的二进制黑洞（BBH）合并与它们的恒星祖体之间的联系还不确定。研究模拟合并率，结合宇宙恒星形成，金属丰度相关效率 ϵ 和延迟时间分布 τ，并从第三次引力波瞬变目录的数据中推断这些参数。结果表明，合并的BBH祖体在低金属丰度环境中形成的机会更高，对应的效率为低金属高，高金属低，延迟时间偏好较短。模型还允许我们对BBH质量密度进行高红移的外推。今天，BBH合并仅占所形成的>10 M⊙祖体的总星质量密度的 ∼0.01%，但由于大质量恒星寿命短，合并的BBH质量可能在早于 ∼2.5 Gyr 时就超过活跃的大质量恒星的总质量。同时，与超大质量黑洞的质量相比，它们在 ∼12.5 Gyr 时的密度相当，但到了 z ∼ 1 时，超大质量黑洞的密度快速增加至合并恒星质量 BBH 的 ∼75 倍。 <div>
The connection between the binary black hole (BBH) mergers observed by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA and their stellar progenitors remains uncertain. Specifically, the fraction ϵ of stellar mass that ends up in BBH mergers and the delay time τ between star formation and merger carry information about the astrophysical processes that produce merging BBHs. We model the merger rate in terms of cosmic star formation, coupled with a metallicity-dependent efficiency ϵ and a distribution of delay times τ, and infer these parameters with data from the Third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog. The progenitors to merging BBHs preferentially form in low-metallicity environments with a low-metallicity efficiency of and a high-metallicity efficiency of at 90% credibility. The data also prefer short delay times. For a power-law distribution p(τ) ∝ τα, we find and α < −1.32 at 90% credibility. Our model allows us to extrapolate the mass density in BBHs to high redshifts. We cumulatively integrate our density rate over time to get the total density of merging stellar-mass BBHs as a function of redshift. Today, BBH mergers are only ∼0.01% of the total stellar-mass density created by >10 M⊙ progenitors. However, because massive stars are short lived, there may be more mass in merging BBHs than in living massive stars as early as ∼2.5 Gyr ago. We also compare to the mass in supermassive black holes, finding that the densities were comparable ∼12.5 Gyr ago, but their densities quickly increased to ∼75 times the density in merging stellar-mass BBHs by z ∼ 1.

总结:<br />
这项研究探讨了活跃星系核中合并黑洞风驱动的冲击波的复杂演化。他们计算了中微子的产生以及单个事件的预期检测数量，还发现了合并黑洞风对扩散中微子背景的影响较小。他们提出了一种可能的中微子和电磁爆发现象，可以作为引力波事件的补充观测。这种系统成为了联合观测中微子、引力波和电磁信号的有前景的候选者。 <div>
Merging of stellar-mass binary black holes (BBHs) could take place within the accretion disks of active galactic nuclei (AGN). The resulting BH remnant is likely to accrete the disk gas at a super-Eddington rate, launching a fast, quasi-spherical outflow (wind). Particles will be accelerated by shocks driven by the wind, subsequently interacting with the shocked disk gas or radiation field through hadronic processes and resulting in the production of high-energy neutrinos and potential electromagnetic (EM) emission. This study delves into the intricate evolution of the shock driven by a merged BH wind within an AGN disk. Subsequently, we calculated the production of neutrinos and the expected detection numbers for a single event, along with their contributions to the overall diffuse neutrino background. Our analysis, which considers various scenarios, reveals considerable neutrino production and possible detection by IceCube for nearby events. The contribution of merged BH winds on the diffuse neutrino background is minor due to the low event rate density, but it can be improved to some extent for some optimistic parameters. We also propose that there could be two neutrino/EM bursts, one originating from the premerger BBH wind and the other from the merged BH wind, with the latter typically having a delay to the gravitational wave (GW) event of around tens of days. When combined with the anticipated GWs emitted during the BBH merger, such a system emerges as a promising candidate for joint observations involving neutrinos, GWs, and EM signals.

<div> NGIMS, Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN mission, ionosphere, altitude, model output

总结: NGIMS是火星大气和挥发性物质演化任务上的中性气体和离子质谱仪，用于测量火星上层大气中中性和离子物种的浓度。许多模型可以在关键离子物种的垂直密度剖面上实现几倍的精度，但在多个离子物种在广泛高度范围内达到几十个百分点的一致性方面却面临挑战。研究探索了在保持简化化学模型的情况下，利用光化学平衡的假设和NGIMS数据没有测量误差的假设的手段来克服这个问题。研究考虑了一个想法，即电荷转移反应的速率系数可能会随着高度的变化而变化，这是由于受压力控制的能量分布的结果。 <div>
Measurements of concentrations of neutral and ion species in the upper atmosphere of Mars by the Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer (NGIMS) on board the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN mission have served as model input and/or for comparison with model output in numerous earlier studies of the Martian dayside ionosphere. While many models reproduce the altitudinal density profiles of key ion species within a factor of a few, it has proven challenging to achieve a level of agreement within tens of percent for multiple ion species over a wide range of altitudes. We explore means to overcome this issue while keeping with a reduced chemical model and utilizing the assumptions of photochemical equilibrium and that the NGIMS data are devoid of any measurement errors. We entertain, for instance, the idea that the rate coefficient for the charge-transfer reaction between and O may vary with altitude as a result of a pressure-controlled internal energy distribution of the population.

总结: 
X射线源产生的短脉冲辐射被银河系中的尘埃云散射而形成扩张的X射线环。研究了亮度最高的伽玛射线暴GRB 221009A的X射线环，发现了五个主要的扩张环，模拟显示它们是散射自距离观测者0.4-13 kpc处的五个尘埃云。根据GRB的X射线辐射量，这些环的通量表明这些尘埃云的尘埃粒子柱密度约为10^7-8 cm^-2。通过时间相关的光谱分析发现，这些环都经历了光谱软化，即随着扩张变得更软，光谱指数范围从2.2到5，与尘埃散射模型的预测一致。<br /><br /> <div>
An expanding X-ray halo or rings appear when short pulses of X-ray radiation from a background source are scattered by clouds of dust in the Milky Way. We study the X-ray rings of the brightest gamma-ray burst (GRB) 221009A, detected by the Swift X-Ray Telescope. The rings center on the GRB position, and their angular radii increase with time. We identify five major expanding rings, and our modeling of their expansion history suggests that they are scattered off from five dusty clouds at distances of 0.4–13 kpc from the observer. Given an assumed prompt X-ray fluence of this GRB, the fluxes of those rings suggest that these clouds have dust grain column densities of 107∼8 cm−2. More interestingly, our time-dependent spectral analysis of these rings shows that they all experience spectral softening, i.e., getting softer as they expand, with spectral indices ranging from 2.2 to 5, consistent with what the dust-scattering model predicts.

Vapor pressure is a relevant quantity that is necessary in order to improve the study of the atmosphere dynamics that take place within astrophysical scenarios. The aim of this study was to obtain the vapor pressure values of the following molecules: C2H4, C2H6, CH3OH, CH4, CO, CO2, H2O, and N2 through experimentation, as well as to determine their empirical relationship with the temperature, applying the results to the persistence of volatiles in trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) and Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs). The experimental determination was performed by measuring the sublimation rate for each molecule at different temperatures. The Hertz–Knudsen equation was used to obtain the vapor pressures for the aforementioned molecules, taking the necessary considerations into account, and the sublimation rate was measured using a quartz crystal microbalance. In order to check the validity of the methods used, the results obtained for water ice were compared with those of previous studies from the literature. The values obtained for CO, N2, and CH4 are of particular interest in the study of the TNOs' and KBOs' atmosphere composition. The results of this study improve the understanding of the surface and atmospheric composition of objects in the cold scenarios of the solar system, in particular, in KBOs and TNOs.

We present Augustus, a catalog of distance, extinction, and stellar parameter estimates for 170 million stars from 14 mag < r < 20 mag and with ∣b∣ > 10° drawing on a combination of optical to near-infrared photometry from Pan-STARRS, 2MASS, UKIDSS, and unWISE along with parallax measurements from Gaia DR2 and 3D dust extinction maps. After applying quality cuts, we find 125 million objects have “high-quality” posteriors with statistical distance uncertainties of ≲10% for objects with well-constrained stellar types. This is a substantial improvement over the distance estimates derived from Gaia parallaxes alone and in line with the recent results from Anders et al. We find the fits are able to reproduce the dereddened Gaia color–magnitude diagram accurately, which serves as a useful consistency check of our results. We show that we are able to detect large, kinematically coherent substructures in our data clearly relative to the input priors, including the Monoceros Ring and the Sagittarius Stream, attesting to the quality of the catalog. Our results are publicly available at doi:10.7910/DVN/WYMSXV. An accompanying interactive visualization can be found at http://allsky.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com.

China has six observing stations, providing over 52,000 handwritten sunspot drawings from 1947–2016. The observing stations are the Purple Mountain Astronomical Observatory (PMO), Yunnan Astronomical Observatory (YNAO), Qingdao Observatory Station (QDOS), Sheshan Observatory Station (SSOS), Beijing Planetarium (BJP), and Nanjing University (NJU). In this paper, we propose a new cotraining semisupervised learning method combining a semantic segmentation method named dynamic mutual training (DMT) boundary-guided semantic segmentation (BGSeg), i.e., DMT_BGSeg, which makes full use of the labeled data from PMO and the unlabeled data from the other five stations to detect and segment sunspot components in all sunspot drawings of the six Chinese stations. The sunspot is detected and segmented. Additionally, each sunspot is split into four types of components: pore, spot, umbra, and hole. The testing results show the mIoU values of PMO, YNAO, BJP, NJU, QDOS and SSOS are 85.29, 72.65, 73.82, 64.28, 62.26, and 60.07, respectively. The results of the comparison also show that DMT_BGSeg is effective in detecting and segmenting sunspots in Chinese sunspot drawings. The numbers and areas of sunspot components are measured separately. All of the detailed data are publicly shared on China-VO, which will advance the comprehensive augmentation of the global historical sunspot database and further the understanding of the long-term solar activity cycle and solar dynamo.

Light echoes give us a unique perspective on the nature of supernovae and nonterminal stellar explosions. Spectroscopy of light echoes can reveal details on the kinematics of the ejecta, probe asymmetry, and reveal details of ejecta interaction with circumstellar matter, thus expanding our understanding of these transient events. However, the spectral features arise from a complex interplay between the source photons, the reflecting dust geometry, and the instrumental setup and observing conditions. In this work, we present an improved method for modeling these effects in light echo spectra, one that relaxes the simplifying assumption of a light-curve-weighted sum, and instead estimates the true relative contribution of each phase of a transient event to the observed spectrum. We discuss our logic, the gains we obtain over light echo analysis methods used in the past, and prospects for further improvements. Lastly, we show how the new method improves our analysis of echoes from Tycho’s supernova (SN 1572) as an example.

The classical T Tauri star (CTTS) stage is a critical phase of the star and planet formation process. In an effort to better understand the mass accretion processes, which can dictate future stellar evolution and planet formation, a multiepoch, multiwavelength photometric and spectroscopic monitoring campaign of four CTTSs (TW Hya, RU Lup, BP Tau, and GM Aur) was carried out in 2021 and 2022/2023 as part of the Outflows and Disks around Young Stars: Synergies for the Exploration of ULLYSES Spectra program. Here we focus on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) UV spectra obtained by the HST Director’s Discretionary Time UV Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential Standards (ULLYSES) program. Using accretion shock modeling, we find that all targets exhibit accretion variability, varying from short increases in accretion rate by up to a factor of 3 within 48 hr to longer decreases in accretion rate by a factor of 2.5 over the course of 1 yr. This is despite the generally consistent accretion morphology within each target. Additionally, we test empirical relationships between accretion rate and UV luminosity and find stark differences, showing that these relationships should not be used to estimate the accretion rate for an individual target. Our work reinforces that future multiepoch and simultaneous multiwavelength studies are critical in our understanding of the accretion process in low-mass star formation.

TDE AT2018fyk被解释为与质量黑洞双星相关的一次性TDE。X射线，紫外线和光学光谱显示出不同于一般的特点，且在约600天后衰减，之后再次增强，并在1200天左右再次衰减。这种行为发生在一个黑洞中断了碎片再次回落到另一个黑洞时，自然地呈现出了t-5/3幂律的陡峭下降。黑洞质量M•从X射线光谱拟合和早期紫外/光学光谱拟合中得出，比从M•-σ*宿主星系关系预测的M•要小两个数量级，这表明碎片被吸积到了辅助黑洞上，而主黑洞则停止了回落。再者，如果增亮是与主黑洞相关的话，它应该在5000天左右而不是观察到的1200天左右发生。次要的质量和无量纲自旋都表明了一个中等质量的次要黑洞，这与观察到的紫外/光学光谱衰减一致，即次要黑洞的外部吸积盘过于微弱而无法产生可检测的辐射底线。第一次吸积中断的时间限制了二进制系统的间隔为(6.7±1.2)×10−3 pc。X射线光谱拟合和时间分析表明，硬X射线来自于次要黑洞盘上方的辐射区域。早期的紫外/光学辐射，暗示次要黑洞的超Eddington阶段，可能起源于碎片轨道化产生的激波。 <br /><br />总结: AT2018fyk是一次与大质量黑洞双星相关的潮撕裂事件。其X射线，紫外线和光学光谱显示出特殊的特点，这被解释为主黑洞中断了碎片再次回落到辅助黑洞所致。辅助黑洞的质量和维度自旋表明其为中等质量黑洞。X射线和早期紫外/光学辐射的分析显示了黑洞之间的二进制系统间隔。同时，X射线来自于次要黑洞盘上方的辐射区域，而早期的紫外/光学辐射可能源自于碎片轨道化产生的激波。 <div>
The tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2018fyk has unusual X-ray, UV, and optical light curves that decay over the first ∼600 days, rebrighten, and decay again around 1200 days. We explain this behavior as a one-off TDE associated with a massive black hole (BH) binary. The sharp drop-offs from t−5/3 power laws at around 600 days naturally arise when one BH interrupts the debris fallback onto the other BH. The BH mass M• derived from fitting X-ray spectra with a slim disk accretion model and, independently, from fitting the early UV/optical light curves, is smaller by 2 orders of magnitude than predicted from the M•–σ* host galaxy relation, suggesting that the debris is accreted onto the secondary, with the fallback cut off by the primary. Furthermore, if the rebrightening were associated with the primary, it should occur around 5000 days, not the observed 1200 days. The secondary’s mass and dimensionless spin is and a•,s > 0.3 (X-ray spectral fitting), while the primary’s mass is M•,p = 107.7±0.4M⊙ (M•–σ* relation). An intermediate mass BH secondary is consistent with the observed UV/optical light-curve decay, i.e., the secondary’s outer accretion disk is too faint to produce a detectable emission floor. The time of the first accretion cutoff constrains the binary separation to be (6.7 ± 1.2) × 10−3 pc. X-ray spectral fitting and timing analyses indicate that the hard X-rays arise from a corona above the secondary’s disk. The early UV/optical emission, suggesting a super-Eddington phase for the secondary, possibly originates from shocks arising from debris circularization.

对Hubble Space Telescope进行的COS/G160M观测研究了8个红移为z∼0、光度约为L⋆的星系的内部环星系介质（CGM）中的C IV，并与紫外明亮的类星体配对，它们的冲击参数（Rproj）在25到130千秒差距之间。这些星系的质量控制样本（log10M⋆/M⊙∼10.2–10.9 M⊙）中的恒星黑洞的质量经过动力学测量，范围在log10MBH/M⊙∼6.8–8.4之间；这使得我们能够将结果与模型进行比较，这些模型中，恒星黑洞的综合反馈历史改变了长时间尺度上的CGM。我们发现C IV柱密度测量（NC IV;平均log10NC IV,CH=13.94±0.09 cm−2）在很大程度上与其他调查中CGM中NC IV的现有测量（平均log10NC IV,Lit=13.90±0.08 cm−2）一致，但不会因为SMBH质量的函数而明显变化。相比之下，特定星形成率（sSFR）与CGM中的电离物质含量高度相关。对于具有log10MBH/M⊙>7.0的星系，我们发现sSFR存在较大的分散，其中CGM的C IV含量与星系的sSFR明显相关，但与MBH无关。我们的结果不表明CGM中C IV与星系SMBH质量存在明显的因果关系；然而，通过与EAGLE、Romulus25和IllustrisTNG模拟的比较，我们发现我们的样本可能太小，无法限制这样的因果关系。<br /><br />总结:该研究利用Hubble Space Telescope对C IV进行了研究，发现星系的C IV含量与SMBH质量无明显因果关系，但与特定星形成率相关。然而，研究也指出样本可能太小，无法排除因果关系。 <div>
We present an analysis of Hubble Space Telescope COS/G160M observations of C IV in the inner circumgalactic medium (CGM) of a novel sample of eight z ∼ 0, L ≈ L⋆ galaxies, paired with UV-bright QSOs at impact parameters (Rproj) between 25 and 130 kpc. The galaxies in this stellar-mass-controlled sample (log10M⋆/M⊙ ∼ 10.2–10.9 M⊙) host supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with dynamically measured masses spanning log10MBH/M⊙ ∼ 6.8–8.4; this allows us to compare our results with models of galaxy formation where the integrated feedback history from the SMBH alters the CGM over long timescales. We find that the C IV column density measurements (NC IV; average log10NC IV,CH = 13.94 ± 0.09 cm−2) are largely consistent with existing measurements from other surveys of NC IV in the CGM (average log10NC IV,Lit = 13.90 ± 0.08 cm−2), but do not show obvious variation as a function of the SMBH mass. By contrast, specific star formation rate (sSFR) is highly correlated with the ionized content of the CGM. We find a large spread in sSFR for galaxies with log10MBH/M⊙ > 7.0, where the CGM C IV content shows a clear dependence on galaxy sSFR but not MBH. Our results do not indicate an obvious causal link between CGM C IV and the mass of the galaxy’s SMBH; however, through comparisons to the EAGLE, Romulus25, and IllustrisTNG simulations, we find that our sample is likely too small to constrain such causality.

<title>Evidence of Grain Alignment by Magnetically Enhanced Radiative Torques from Multiwavelength Dust Polarization Modeling of HL Tau</title>

<div> Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array, dust polarization, protoplanetary disks, grain alignment, POLARIS code, iron inclusions<br /><br />总结:<br />该研究利用更新的POLARIS代码，对HL Tau在0.87、1.3和3.1毫米三个波长的观测进行了数值建模，结果表明只有当大颗粒内嵌含铁并且具有错误的内部排列时（即颗粒的长轴平行于其角动量），才能复现观测到的多波段偏振现象。铁的丰度被限制为≳16%，每个团簇中的铁原子数为Ncl∼9×102。在波长为λ=0.87、1.3和3.1毫米时，探测到的最大颗粒尺寸分别被限制为∼60、80和90μm。 <div>
The Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array has revolutionized the field of dust polarization in protoplanetary disks across multiple wavelengths. Previous observations and empirical modeling have suggested multiple mechanisms of dust polarization toward HL Tau, including grain alignment and dust scattering. However, a detailed modeling of dust polarization based on grain alignment physics is not yet available. Here, using an updated POLARIS code, we perform numerical modeling of dust polarization arising from both grain alignment by the magnetically enhanced radiative torque mechanism and self-scattering to reproduce the HL Tau polarization observed at three wavelengths of 0.87, 1.3, and 3.1 mm. Our modeling results show that the observed multiwavelength polarization could be reproduced only when large grains contain embedded iron inclusions and those with slow internal relaxation must have wrong internal alignment (i.e., the grain’s major axis parallel to its angular momentum). The abundance of iron embedded inside grains in the form of clusters is constrained to be ≳16%, and the number of iron atoms per cluster is Ncl ∼ 9 × 102. Maximum grain sizes probed at wavelengths of λ = 0.87, 1.3, and 3.1 mm are constrained at ∼60, 80, and 90 μm, respectively.

<title>On the Origin of Fast-rotating Stars. I. Photometric Calibration and Results of AO-assisted BVRI+Hα Imaging of NGC 330 with SAMI/SOAR</title>

<div> 关键词: Hα emission, Be stars, NGC 330, Magellanic Clouds, stellar population
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章介绍了利用Hα发射来评估年轻开放星团中经典Be星(CBe)的种群。通过使用SAMI进行多波段成像，研究了NGC 330的恒星种群。研究发现，在NGC 330中Hα发射体的总比例为4.4%，而在较高质量星体中高达32.8%。此外，发现了质量分层结构，表明NGC 330内存在明显的质量分层。这些发现突出了当前观察对于在NGC 330提供CBe星群的完整图片的重要性。 <div>
Hα emission is a clear indicator of circumstellar activity in Be stars, historically employed to assess the classical Be star (CBe) population in young open clusters (YOCs). The YOC NGC 330 in the Small Magellanic Cloud exhibits a large known fraction of CBe stars and was selected for a pilot study to establish a comprehensive methodology for identifying Hα emitters in the Magellanic Clouds, encompassing the entire B-type spectral range. Using the SOAR Adaptive Module Imager (SAMI), we investigated the stellar population of NGC 330 using multiband BVRI+Hα imaging. We identified Hα emitters within the entire V-band range covered by SAMI/SOAR observations (V ≲ 22), comprising the complete B-type stellar population and offering a unique opportunity to explore the Be phenomenon across all spectral subclasses. The stellar radial distribution shows a clear bimodal pattern between the most massive (B5 or earlier) and the lower mass main-sequence objects (later than B6) within the cluster. The former is concentrated toward the cluster center (showing a dispersion of σ = 4.26 ± 0.20 pc), whereas the latter extends across larger radii (σ = 10.83 ± 0.65 pc), indicating mass stratification within NGC 330. The total fraction of emitters is 4.4% ± 0.5%, notably smaller than previous estimates from flux- or seeing-limited observations. However, a higher fraction of Hα emitters is observed among higher mass stars (32.8% ± 3.4%) than within lower mass (4.4% ± 0.9%). Consequently, the putative CBe population exhibits distinct dynamical characteristics compared to the bulk of the stellar population in NGC 330. These findings highlight the significance of the current observations in providing a complete picture of the CBe population in NGC 330.

<div> gravitational scattering, three-body binary formation, unequal masses, wide-binary formation, energy dissipation<br />
总结:<br />
本研究探讨了三体双星形成问题，考虑了质量不相等、有限大小和后牛顿效应等因素。研究发现，三体双星形成多通过非共振相互作用实现，并且偏好形成宽双星。在宽双星中，三体双星形成时偏心率较高，这或许有助于解释天文观测中观测到的偏心率较高的宽双星。相比之下，硬双星形成相对较少，且具有热力学偏心率分布。能量耗散通过引力辐射导致从三个最初无关联体系中形成绑定的分级三体系统的概率较小。总的来说，本研究揭示了三体双星形成的一些重要特征和概率分布。 <div>
We explore three-body binary formation (3BBF), the formation of a bound system via gravitational scattering of three initially unbound bodies (3UB), using direct numerical integrations. For the first time, we consider systems with unequal masses, as well as finite-size and post-Newtonian effects. Our analytically derived encounter rates and numerical scattering results reproduce the 3BBF rate predicted by Goodman & Hut for hard binaries in dense star clusters. We find that 3BBF occurs overwhelmingly through nonresonant encounters and that the two most-massive bodies are never the most likely to bind. Instead, 3BBF favors pairing the two least-massive bodies (for wide binaries) or the most- plus least-massive bodies (for hard binaries). 3BBF overwhelmingly favors wide-binary formation with superthermal eccentricities, perhaps helping to explain the eccentric wide binaries observed by Gaia. Hard-binary formation is far rarer, but with a thermal eccentricity distribution. The semimajor axis distribution scales cumulatively as a3 for hard and slightly wider binaries. Although mergers are rare between black holes when including relativistic effects, direct collisions occur frequently between main-sequence stars—more often than hard 3BBF. Yet, these collisions do not significantly suppress hard 3BBF at the low-velocity dispersions typical of open or globular clusters. Energy dissipation through gravitational radiation leads to a small probability of a bound, hierarchical triple system forming directly from 3UB.

<br />这篇文章研究了附近非均匀性对观测者对哈勃常数推断的影响。大尺度结构引起了宇宙学参数对观察者位置的依赖性，以及这些参数在观察者视野中的各向异性方差。作者使用数值相对论模拟的大尺度结构和光线追踪相结合，生成了合成目录，模仿低红移Pantheon超新星数据集。数据包含模拟中测地线上距离和红移的广义相对论贡献。他们使用这些合成观测来约束一组随机位置的观察者的H0。研究了观察者位置的依赖性以及旋转SNe样本对观察者的天空的影响。他们发现当观察者使用各向同性样本时，H0在不同观察者之间有1%–2%的变化。然而，他们发现当观察者简单地在天空上旋转他们的Pantheon数据集时，推断的H0值可能会变化高达3%–6%。尽管我们发现的方差低于“哈勃张力”的水平，但我们的结果可能表明，如果能够正确考虑扩张的各向异性，张力的重要性可能会减少。<br /><br />总结: 本文研究了大尺度结构对观测者哈勃常数推断的影响，发现观察者位置和超新星样本旋转会对H0的推断产生1%–6%的变化。这可能暗示着在正确考虑扩张的各向异性情况下，哈勃张力的重要性可能会减少。 <div>
We study the impact of nearby inhomogeneities on an observer’s inference of the Hubble constant. Large-scale structures induce a dependence of cosmological parameters on observer position as well as an anisotropic variance of those parameters across an observer’s sky. While the former has been explored quite thoroughly, the latter has not. Incomplete sampling of an anisotropic sky could introduce a bias in our cosmological inference if we assume an isotropic expansion law. In this work, we use numerical relativity simulations of large-scale structure combined with ray tracing to produce synthetic catalogs mimicking the low-redshift Pantheon supernova (SN) data set. Our data contain all general-relativistic contributions to fluctuations in the distances and redshifts along geodesics in the simulation. We use these synthetic observations to constrain H0 for a set of randomly positioned observers. We study both the dependence on observer position as well as the impact of rotating the sample of SNe on the observer’s sky. We find a 1%–2% variance in H0 between observers when they use an isotropic sample of objects. However, we find the inferred value of H0 can change by up to 3%–6% when observers simply rotate their Pantheon data set on the sky. While the variances we find are below the level of the “Hubble tension,” our results may suggest a reduction in the significance of the tension if anisotropy of expansion can be correctly accounted for.

Prominence bubbles, the dark arch-shaped voids below quiescent prominences, are generally believed to be caused by the interaction between the prominences and the slowly emerging or quasi-stable underlying magnetic loops. However, this scenario could not explain some short-lived bubbles with extremely dynamic properties of evolution. Based on high-resolution Hα observations, here we propose that bubbles should be classified into two categories according to their dynamic properties: quasi-steady Type-I bubbles and transient Type-II bubbles. Type-I bubbles could remain relatively stable and last for several hours, indicating the existence of a quasi-stable magnetic topology, while Type-II bubbles grow and collapse quickly within 1 hr without stability duration, which are usually associated with erupting minifilaments. Analysis of several typical Type-II bubbles from different views, especially including an on-disk event, reveals that Type-II bubbles quickly appear and expand at a velocity of ∼5–25 km s−1 accompanied by an erupting minifilament below. The minifilament’s rising velocity is slightly larger than that of the Type-II bubbles’ boundary, which will lead to the collision with each other in a short time, subsequent collapse of Type-II bubbles, and formation of a large plume into the above prominence. We also speculate that only if the angle between the axis of the erupting minifilament and the line of sight is large enough, the interaction between the erupting minifilament and the overlying prominence could trigger a Type-II bubble with a typical arch-shaped but quickly expanding bright boundary.

红外光谱观测表明星际介质和太阳系冰中存在固体甲醇(CH3OH)，但冰中CH3OH的丰度需要准确的带强度、光学常数和参考光谱来推导。本文识别了文献中关于甲醇冰红外强度的分歧、遗漏和空白，包括几十年来未解决的问题。我们呈现了新的光谱，并通过固体CH3OH的折射率和密度的新数据来辅助强度测量。结果是不同实验室组的大量不一致结果现在可以得到解决。多种冰用于确定已知成分的H2O + CH3OH混合物的红外强度，可用于对星际冰的观测。也是首次，用不同厚度的CH3OH冰进行了测量，报告了行星科学家使用的两个近红外特征的带强度和光学常数。我们利用新的红外结果确定了固体CH3OH的蒸气压，并将其与石英晶体微天平测量进行了比较。对甲醇冰进行了热退火，并研究了固态中的相变。在可能的情况下将我们的结果与以前的工作进行了比较，并提供了我们新结果的电子版本。<br /><br />总结: 本文通过红外光谱观测确定了固体甲醇的存在，并消除了不同实验室组的不一致结果。还首次测量了H2O + CH3OH混合物和不同厚度的CH3OH冰的红外强度和光学常数。同时，还对固态甲醇的蒸气压和相变进行了研究。 <div>
Infrared spectroscopic observations have established the presence of solid methanol (CH3OH) in the interstellar medium and in solar system ices, but the abundance of frozen CH3OH cannot be deduced without accurate band strengths, optical constants, and reference spectra. In this paper we identify disagreements, omissions, and gaps in the literature on infrared (IR) intensities of methanol ices, including unaddressed concerns that reach back several decades. New spectra are presented with intensity measurements aided by new data on the index of refraction and density of solid CH3OH. The result is that the large discordant results from different laboratory groups can now be reconciled. Multiple ices have been used to determine, apparently for the first time, IR intensities of H2O + CH3OH mixtures of accurately known composition for use with observations of interstellar ices. Also for the first time, measurements on CH3OH ices with different thicknesses have allowed us to report both near-IR band strengths and optical constants for two near-IR features used by planetary scientists. We have used our new IR results to determine vapor pressures of solid CH3OH and have compared them to measurements made with a quartz-crystal microbalance. Thermal annealings of methanol ices have been carried out and phase changes in the solid state examined. Comparisons of our results to earlier work are presented where possible, and electronic versions of our new results are made available.

总结:<br />
本研究针对嵌入在活动星系核盘中的双黑洞系统进行了三维模拟，发现逆行双黑洞会比顺行双黑洞收缩得更快，并且其轨道离心率增长速度随着离心率呈单调递增趋势。结果表明，逆行双黑洞可能经历离心率快速增长，导致它们在近日点距离足够接近，从而被引力波辐射驱使合并。而顺行双黑洞收缩速度远快于其轨道离心率减小速度，因此它们在合并过程中可能保持适度的离心率。此外，由活动星系核盘驱动的双黑洞进动可能会主导，取决于双黑洞的吸积率和其在盘中的位置，这可能抑制了时间晕共振和von Ziepel–Lidov–Kozai循环效应。 <div>
Binary black holes (BBHs) embedded within the accretion disks that fuel active galactic nuclei (AGN) are promising progenitors for the source of gravitational wave (GW) events detected by LIGO/VIRGO. Several recent studies have shown that when these binaries form, they are likely to be highly eccentric and retrograde. However, many uncertainties remain concerning the orbital evolution of these binaries as they either inspiral toward merger or disassociate. Previous hydrodynamical simulations exploring their orbital evolution have been predominantly two-dimensional or have been restricted to binaries on nearly circular orbits. We present the first high-resolution, three-dimensional local shearing-box simulations of both prograde and retrograde eccentric BBHs embedded in AGN disks. We find that retrograde binaries shrink several times faster than their prograde counterparts and exhibit significant orbital eccentricity growth, the rate of which monotonically increases with binary eccentricity. Our results suggest that retrograde binaries may experience runaway orbital eccentricity growth, which may bring them close enough together at pericenter for GW emission to drive them to coalescence. Although their eccentricity is damped, prograde binaries shrink much faster than their orbital eccentricity decays, suggesting they should remain modestly eccentric as they contract toward merger. Finally, binary precession driven by the AGN disk may dominate over precession induced by the supermassive black hole depending on the binary accretion rate and its location in the AGN disk, which can subdue the evection resonance and von Ziepel–Lidov–Kozai cycles.

总结:<br />
这篇文章主要研究了太阳耀斑期间的两种重要现象，即色球蒸发（CE）和日冕雨（CR），并且使用了IRIS和AIA进行观测和比较。研究发现CE标志着热量流入耀斑环的开始，而CR标志着以冷、致密凝结的形式流出的末端。CE的观测结果显示，其上升平均速度为138 ± 35 km/s，温度为9.03 ± 3.28 × 106 K。此外，CR在耀斑过程中的变化也得到了观测，其质量和密度增加约4.4和6倍，速度增加约1.4倍，而团块宽度变化不明显。研究结果还发现，CE的位置和形态与CR的位置和形态非常相似，说明它们在质量和能量传输方面起着关键作用。此外，研究还得出CR的能量相当于CE能量的一半，表明CR在耀斑的质量-能量循环中起着重要作用。 <div>
Chromospheric evaporation (CE) and coronal rain (CR) represent two crucial phenomena encompassing the circulation of mass and energy during solar flares. While CE marks the start of the hot inflow into the flaring loop, CR marks the end, indicating the outflow in the form of cool and dense condensations. With the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on the Solar Dynamics Observatory, we examine and compare the evolution, dynamics, morphology, and energetics of the CR and CE during a C2.1 flare. The CE is directly observed in imaging and spectra in the Fe xxi line with IRIS and in the Fe xviii line of AIA, with upward average total speeds of 138 ± 35 km s−1 and a temperature of 9.03 ± 3.28 × 106 K. An explosive-to-gentle CE transition is observed, with an apparent reduction in turbulence. From quiescent to gradual flare phase, the amount and density of CR increase by a factor of ≈4.4 and 6, respectively. The rain’s velocity increases by a factor of 1.4, in agreement with gas pressure drag. In contrast, the clump width variation is negligible. The location and morphology of CE match closely those of the rain showers, with similar CE substructure to the rain strands, reflecting fundamental scales of mass and energy transport. We obtain a CR outflow mass three times larger than the CE inflow mass, suggesting the presence of unresolved CE, perhaps at higher temperatures. The CR energy corresponds to half that of the CE. These results suggest an essential role of CR in the mass−energy cycle of a flare.

The chemical abundances of Milky Way’s (MW's) satellites reflect their star formation histories (SFHs), yet, due to the difficulty of determining the ages of old stars, the SFHs of most satellites are poorly measured. Ongoing and upcoming surveys will obtain around 10 times more medium-resolution spectra for stars in satellites than are currently available. To correctly extract SFHs from large samples of chemical abundances, the relationship between chemical abundances and SFHs needs to be clarified. Here, we perform a high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulation of a MW-like galaxy with detailed models of star formation, supernova (SN) feedback, and metal diffusion. We quantify SFHs, metallicity distribution functions, and the α-element (Mg, Ca, and Si) abundances in satellites of the host galaxy. We find that star formation in most simulated satellites is quenched before infalling to their host. Star formation episodes in simulated satellites are separated by a few hundred Myr owing to SN feedback; each star formation event produces groups of stars with similar [α/Fe] and [Fe/H]. We then perform a mock observation of the upcoming Subaru Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) observations. We find that Subaru PFS will be able to detect distinct groups of stars in [α/Fe] versus [Fe/H] space, produced by episodic star formation. This result means that episodic SFHs can be estimated from the chemical abundances of ≳1000 stars determined with medium-resolution spectroscopy.

总结: 
内部重力波可能会在恒星内部引起混合。研究表明，这些波造成的混合会随着年龄和质量的变化而发生显著改变。本文通过考虑零龄主序和中期主序时的7太阳质量模型，来研究旋转对这种波混合的影响。我们比较了一系列旋转速率（1 × 10^-5, 2 × 10^-5, 3 × 10^-5, 4 × 10^-5, 和 1 × 10^-4 rad s^-1）时的混合剖面，观察到随着罗斯贝数的减小，混合减少。这可以归因于旋转对对流的影响，它影响了在对流-辐射界面附近激发波的振幅。 <br /><br /> <div>
Internal gravity waves are likely to cause mixing in stellar interiors. Studies show that the mixing by these waves changes drastically across age and mass. Here, we study the effect of rotation on this wave mixing by considering a 7 M⊙ model at zero-age main sequence and mid-main sequence. We compare the mixing profiles at a range of rotation rates (1 × 10−5, 2 × 10−5, 3 × 10−5, 4 × 10−5, and 1 × 10−4 rad s−1) and observe that the mixing decreases with decreasing Rossby number. This can be attributed to the effect of rotation on convection, which influences the amplitude with which the waves are excited near the convective–radiative interface.

SN 2019tua是一颗IIb型超新星，其光谱和光度观测显示出复杂的亮度演化，呈现出多个峰值和下降。在观测的50到60天之间，光曲线出现波动。然而，目前流行的能源模型无法很好地解释其复杂的亮度变化，因此提出了一个基于周围介质相互作用和铀核衰变的混合模型。根据拟合结果，推断出了SN 2019tua的喷射物质量、环绕介质质量和铀核质量，同时推测爆炸前约6-44年有多次质量抛射的发生。<br /><br />总结: <br />SN 2019tua的光度和光谱观测显示其复杂的亮度演化，与当前流行的能源模型不符。研究人员提出了基于周围介质相互作用和铀核衰变的混合模型，拟合结果推断出了相关物理参数，并推测爆炸前有多次质量抛射发生。 <div>
We present photometric and spectroscopic observations and analysis of the Type IIb supernova (SN) SN 2019tua, which exhibits multiple bumps in its declining light curves between 40 and 65 days after discovery. SN 2019tua shows a time to peak of about 25 days, similar to other Type IIb SNe. Our observations indicate a decrease in its brightness of about 1 mag in the 60 days after the peak. At about days 50 and 60, its multiband light curves exhibit bumpy behavior. The complex luminosity evolution of SN 2019tua could not be well modeled with a single currently popular energy source model, e.g., radioactive decay of 56Ni, magnetar, interaction between the ejecta and a circumstellar shell. Even though the magnetar model has a smaller χ2/dof value, the complex changes in SN 2019tua’s brightness suggest that more than one physical process might be involved. We propose a hybrid circumstellar medium (CSM) interaction plus 56Ni model to explain the bolometric light curve of SN 2019tua. The fitting results show that the ejecta mass Mej ≈ 2.4 M⊙, the total CSM mass MCSM ≈ 1.0 M⊙, and the 56Ni mass MNi ≈ 0.4 M⊙. The total kinetic energy of the ejecta is Ek ≈ 0.5 × 1051 erg. Preexisting multiple shells suggest that the progenitor of SN 2019tua experienced mass ejections within approximately ∼6–44 yr prior to the explosion.

<title>JWST Spectroscopy of SN H0pe: Classification and Time Delays of a Triply Imaged Type Ia Supernova at z = 1.78</title>

<div> 关键词: SN H0pe, James Webb Space Telescope, Type Ia SN, NIRSpec, 时间延迟<br />
总结:<br />
SN H0pe是在红移z=1.78处使用James Webb太空望远镜发现的一个三重成像超新星。通过NIRSpec的跟进光谱，首先确定了SN的分类为Ia型，并测量了三个影像的相对时间延迟。利用Hsiao07 SN模板，确定了三个影像的绝对相位，并得出了它们之间的时间延迟。通过SALT3-NIR模型验证了这些值的一致性。研究还发现，在使用Hsiao07模板光谱进行模拟时，对推断出的影像延迟有一些影响，但是这种影响在统计上并不显著。 <div>
SN H0pe is a triply imaged supernova (SN) at redshift z = 1.78 discovered using the James Webb Space Telescope. In order to classify the SN spectroscopically and measure the relative time delays of its three images (designated A, B, and C), we acquired NIRSpec follow-up spectroscopy spanning 0.6–5 μm. From the high signal-to-noise spectra of the two bright images B and C, we first classify the SN, whose spectra most closely match those of SN 1994D and SN 2013dy, as a Type Ia SN. We identify prominent blueshifted absorption features corresponding to Si iiλ6355 and Ca ii H λ3970 and K λ3935. We next measure the absolute phases of the three images from our spectra, which allow us to constrain their relative time delays. The absolute phases of the three images, determined by fitting the three spectra to Hsiao07 SN templates, are days, days, and days for the brightest to faintest images. These correspond to relative time delays between Image A and Image B and between Image B and Image C of days and days, respectively. The SALT3-NIR model yields phases and time delays consistent with these values. After unblinding, we additionally explored the effect of using Hsiao07 template spectra for simulations through 80 days instead of 60 days past maximum, and found a small (11.5 and 1.0 days, respectively) yet statistically insignificant (∼0.25σ and ∼0.1σ) effect on the inferred image delays.

该研究通过观察彗星Leonard（C/2021 A1）的尾巴与太阳风的相互作用，采用太阳风模型和新的数据同化技术进行对比分析。结果表明，尾巴的脱离是由于穿越日地电流片和进入SIR（流相互作用区）导致的。这一结果更加符合数据同化模型的预测，表明了这种方法的价值。这些案例研究扩展了我们对彗星与太阳风相互作用的理解，同时也展示了数据同化在太阳风建模中的实用性。研究还指出，彗星可以作为添加的太阳风条件的实时测量方式，特别是在没有现有实时探测器的区域，这有望进一步改进未来的太阳风数据同化。 <br /><br />总结: <div>
Cometary tails display dynamic behavior attributed to interactions with solar wind structures. Consequently, comet-tail observations can serve as in situ solar wind monitors. During 2021 December, Comet Leonard (C/2021 A1) was observed by the STEREO-A heliospheric imager. The comet tail exhibited various signatures of interactions with the solar wind including bending, kink formation, and finally complete disconnection. In this study, we compare the timing of these events with solar wind structures predicted by the Heliospheric Upwind eXtrapolation model with a time-dependency (or HUXt) solar wind model using new solar wind data assimilation (DA) techniques. This serves both to provide the most accurate solar wind context to interpret the cometary processes, but also as a test of the DA and an example of how comet observations can be used in model validation studies. Coronal mass ejections, stream interaction regions (SIRs), and heliospheric current sheet (HCS) crossings were all considered as potential causes of the tail disconnection. The results suggest the tail disconnection at Comet Leonard was the result of it crossing the HCS and into an SIR. The timing of these features agree better with the DA model results than the non-DA model, showing the value of this approach. Case studies such as this expand our understanding of comet–solar wind interactions, and in demonstrating the utility of DA for solar wind modeling. We note that this could lead to comets acting as additional in situ measures for solar wind conditions for regions where no in situ spacecraft are available, potentially improving solar wind DA in the future.

<div> 关键词: 太阳大气结构, 小型丝状结构, 耀斑, 磁场模型, 等离子体爆发 

总结:

这篇文章研究了太阳大气中的小型丝状结构的形成和爆发机制。观察到的变化包括丝状结构从弓形线转变为两个J形弧，并最终形成S形。同时，在丝状结构的南部发生了两次等离子体耀斑。爆发起始于南部，然后与上方的大型丝状结构相互作用并失败。观测到的磁场异常与观测结果相一致。研究结果表明，爆发是由于丝状结构核心磁场与外部磁场由于磁通消除而引起的磁重连。这项研究揭示了丝状结构爆发的新触发机制，以及丝状结构爆发和等离子体耀斑之间的新关系。 <div>
Minifilaments are widespread small-scale structures in the solar atmosphere. To better understand their formation and eruption mechanisms, we investigate the entire life of a sigmoidal minifilament located below a large quiescent filament observed by Big Bear Solar Observatory/Goode Solar Telescope on 2015 August 3. The Hα structure initially appears as a group of arched threads, then transforms into two J-shaped arcades, and finally forms a sigmoidal shape. Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly observations in 171 Å show that two coronal jets occur around the southern footpoint of the minifilament before the minifilament eruption. The minifilament eruption starts from the southern footpoint, then interacts with the overlying filament and fails. The aforementioned observational changes correspond to three episodes of flux cancellations observed by SDO/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager. Unlike previous studies, the flux cancellation occurs between the polarity where the southern footpoint of the minifilament is rooted and an external polarity. We construct two magnetic field models before the eruption using the flux rope insertion method and find a hyperbolic flux tube above the flux cancellation site. The observation and modeling results suggest that the eruption is triggered by the external magnetic reconnection between the core field of the minifilament and the external fields due to flux cancellations. This study reveals a new triggering mechanism for minifilament eruptions and a new relationship between minifilament eruptions and coronal jets.

<br /><br />总结: 通过新参数函数描述了银河磁场的全局结构，研究了多种参数和模型的组合，确定了磁场的各项参数，并提出了一套八个模型来帮助量化现有的不确定性。 <div>
We present a suite of models of the coherent magnetic field of the Galaxy based on new divergence-free parametric functions describing the global structure of the field. The model parameters are fit to the latest full-sky Faraday rotation measures (RMs) of extragalactic sources and polarized synchrotron intensity (PI) maps from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe and Planck. We employ multiple models for the density of thermal and cosmic-ray electrons in the Galaxy, needed to predict the sky maps of RMs and PI for a given Galactic magnetic field (GMF) model. The robustness of the inferred properties of the GMF is gauged by studying many combinations of parametric field models and electron density models. We determine the pitch angle of the local magnetic field (11° ± 1°), explore the evidence for a grand-design spiral coherent magnetic field (inconclusive), determine the strength of the toroidal and poloidal magnetic halo fields below and above the disk (magnitudes the same for both hemispheres within ≈10%), set constraints on the half-height of the cosmic-ray diffusion volume (≥2.9 kpc), investigate the compatibility of RM- and PI-derived magnetic field strengths (compatible under certain assumptions), and check if the toroidal halo field could be created by the shear of the poloidal halo field due to the differential rotation of the Galaxy (possibly). A set of eight models is identified to help quantify the present uncertainties in the coherent GMF spanning different functional forms, data products, and auxiliary input. We present the corresponding sky maps of rates for axion–photon conversion in the Galaxy and deflections of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章通过对34个正常类型II超新星（SNe II）的样本进行研究，提供了多波段的UV光曲线以及X射线观测数据。研究表明，早期UV-光学颜色和黑体的演变与冲击冷却（SC）一致，即使存在“闪烁电离”特征。此外，文章提出了一个适合SC模型的框架，可以复现多组模拟的参数。通过X射线数据，得出大多数SN II的母体恒星在爆炸前几年失去了。研究还发现，红超巨星（RSGs）爆炸成为SNe II的半径符合观测到的RSGs半径分布，但尾部延伸至更大的半径，这可能是由于周围存在星周物质的存在。 <div>
We present a sample of 34 normal Type II supernovae (SNe II) detected with the Zwicky Transient Facility, with multiband UV light curves starting at t ≤ 4 days after explosion, and X-ray observations. We characterize the early UV-optical color, provide empirical host-extinction corrections, and show that the t > 2 day UV-optical colors and the blackbody evolution of the sample are consistent with shock cooling (SC) regardless of the presence of “flash ionization” features. We present a framework for fitting SC models that can reproduce the parameters of a set of multigroup simulations up to 20% in radius and velocity. Observations of 15 SNe II are well fit by models with breakout radii <1014 cm. Eighteen SNe are typically more luminous, with observations at t ≥ 1 day that are better fit by a model with a large >1014 cm breakout radius. However, these fits predict an early rise during the first day that is too slow. We suggest that these large-breakout events are explosions of stars with an inflated envelope or with confined circumstellar material (CSM). Using the X-ray data, we derive constraints on the extended (∼1015 cm) CSM density independent of spectral modeling and find that most SN II progenitors lose up to a few years before explosion. We show that the overall observed breakout radius distribution is skewed to higher radii due to a luminosity bias. We argue that the of red supergiants (RSGs) explode as SNe II with breakout radii consistent with the observed distribution of RSGs, with a tail extending to large radii, likely due to the presence of CSM.

总结: 
TNJ1338-1942星系是一个具有强大离子化气体流出的高红移星系，通过JWST的近红外光谱仪(NIRSpec)观测到了15千秒巨大的流出，并测量了流出速率。观测显示出流出的气体速度超过900 km/s，宽度超过1200 km/s，空间上与最亮的无线电叶重叠。这表明无线电射流对流出动力学负责。总质量流出率约为500 M⊙年，动能远大于流出离子化气体的能量。这意味着动能从射流转移到气体的效率不高。由此推测大部分的能量可能以热X射线为形式。
<br /><br /> <div>
We report observations of a powerful ionized gas outflow in the z = 4.1 luminous radio galaxy TNJ1338-1942 hosting an obscured quasar using the Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) on board JWST. We spatially resolve a large-scale (∼15 kpc) outflow and measure outflow rates. The outflowing gas shows velocities exceeding 900 km s−1 and broad line profiles with widths exceeding 1200 km s−1 located at an ∼10 kpc projected distance from the central nucleus. The outflowing nebula spatially overlaps with the brightest radio lobe, indicating that the powerful radio jets are responsible for the outflow kinematics. The gas is possibly ionized by the obscured quasar with a contribution from shocks induced by the jets. The mass outflow rate map shows that the region with the broadest line profiles exhibits the strongest outflow rates. The total mass outflow rate is ∼500 M⊙ yr−1, and the mass loading factor is ∼1, indicating that a significant part of the gas is displaced outwards by the outflow. Our hypothesis is that the overpressured shocked jet fluid expands laterally to create an expanding ellipsoidal “cocoon” that causes the surrounding gas to accelerate outwards. The total kinetic energy injected by the radio jet is about 3 orders of magnitude larger than the energy in the outflowing ionized gas. This implies that kinetic energy must be transferred inefficiently from the jets to the gas. The bulk of the deposited energy possibly lies in the form of hot X-ray-emitting gas.

Among multimessenger observations of the next Galactic core-collapse supernova, Super-Kamiokande (SK) plays a critical role in detecting the emitted supernova neutrinos, determining the direction to the supernova (SN), and notifying the astronomical community of these observations in advance of the optical signal. In 2022, SK has increased the gadolinium dissolved in its water target (SK-Gd) and has achieved a Gd concentration of 0.033%, resulting in enhanced neutron detection capability, which in turn enables more accurate determination of the supernova direction. Accordingly, SK-Gd’s real-time supernova monitoring system has been upgraded. SK_SN Notice, a warning system that works together with this monitoring system, was released on 2021 December 13, and is available through GCN Notices. When the monitoring system detects an SN-like burst of events, SK_SN Notice will automatically distribute an alarm with the reconstructed direction to the supernova candidate within a few minutes. In this paper, we present a systematic study of SK-Gd’s response to a simulated Galactic SN. Assuming a supernova situated at 10 kpc, neutrino fluxes from six supernova models are used to characterize SK-Gd’s pointing accuracy using the same tools as the online monitoring system. The pointing accuracy is found to vary from 3° to 7° depending on the models. However, if the supernova is closer than 10 kpc, SK_SN Notice can issue an alarm with three-degree accuracy, which will benefit follow-up observations by optical telescopes with large fields of view.

总结:
帕克太阳探测器在0.2天文单位观察到了一个事件，该事件显示了成像和原位测量的一致性，证实了冠状物质抛射（CME）的磁流体结构内存在磁力线圈。在CME的边缘结构中，存在孤立的磁通管、湍流护层以及CME本身。湍流护层和CME区间的分布更均匀，谱线更软，Fe/O和He/H的丰度比低于孤立的磁通管，但高于典型的等离子体和太阳高能粒子丰度。这表明了来自耀斑和等离子体的加速粒子增强。孤立的磁通管显示了大的流动、硬谱线和较大的Fe/O和He/H比值，表明有耀斑源。在CME区间，从超热到高能粒子能量范围内，能量粒子通量增强，表明有粒子加速和在封闭磁结构内的约束。CME的磁力线圈形态有助于局部调制和困留高能粒子，特别是沿着螺旋度通道和其他等离子体边界。因此，CME有助于积聚高能粒子群，使它们在内部太阳圈层内被输送到后续的高能粒子加速。 <div>
We present an event observed by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) at ∼0.2 au on 2022 March 2 in which imaging and in situ measurements coincide. During this event, PSP passed through structures on the flank of a streamer blowout coronal mass ejection (CME) including an isolated flux tube in front of the CME, a turbulent sheath, and the CME itself. Imaging observations and in situ helicity and principal variance signatures consistently show the presence of flux ropes internal to the CME. In both the sheath and the CME interval, the distributions are more isotropic, the spectra are softer, and the abundance ratios of Fe/O and He/H are lower than those in the isolated flux tube, and yet elevated relative to typical plasma and solar energetic particle abundances. These signatures in the sheath and the CME indicate that both flare populations and those from the plasma are accelerated to form the observed energetic particle enhancements. In contrast, the isolated flux tube shows large streaming, hard spectra, and large Fe/O and He/H ratios, indicating flare sources. Energetic particle fluxes are most enhanced within the CME interval from suprathermal through energetic particle energies (∼keV to >10 MeV), indicating particle acceleration, as well as confinement local to the closed magnetic structure. The flux-rope morphology of the CME helps to enable local modulation and trapping of energetic particles, in particular along helicity channels and other plasma boundaries. Thus, the CME acts to build up energetic particle populations, allowing them to be fed into subsequent higher-energy particle acceleration throughout the inner heliosphere where a compression or shock forms on the CME front.

总结:
本文通过对四个开放星团的研究发现，星团的潮汐尾巴中的星星数量存在对称性偏差，明显偏向于前导尾巴。研究表明，在牛顿引力下，星团的演化速度比Milgromian 动力学下更慢，COIN-Gaia 13星团已经几乎完全解散。这一发现对牛顿引力的正确性提出了质疑。由此引出了对广义相对论的相关测试和银河系的旋转曲线的讨论。 <div>
Stars that evaporate from their star cluster by the energy equipartition process end up in either a leading or a trailing tidal tail. In Newtonian gravitation and for open star clusters in the solar vicinity, the tidal threshold, or práh, for escape is symmetrical, such that the leading and trailing tails are equally populated. The data from six independent teams that applied the convergent point method to map out the tidal tails of four open clusters (the Hyades, Praesepe, Coma Berenices, and COIN-Gaia 13) using Gaia DR2 and DR3 are here applied to test for the expected symmetry. All tidal tails contain more stars in the leading tail. The combined confidence amounts to an 8σ falsification of the práh symmetry. The same test using Milgromian dynamics leads to consistency with the data. More effort needs to be exerted on this matter, but the data indicate with high confidence that the tidal práh of an open star cluster is asymmetrical, with the corresponding confidence that Newtonian gravitation is falsified. Open star clusters depopulate more rapidly in Milgromian than in Newtonian dynamics, and the COIN-Gaia 13 cluster is here found to be nearly completely dissolved. In view of these results, the wide-binary star test and the finding of a Keplerian Galactic rotation curve are briefly discussed.

In star clusters, close stellar encounters can strongly impact the architecture of a planetary system or even destroy it. We present a systematic study of the effects of stellar flybys on two-planet systems. When such a system experiences flybys, one or both planets can be ejected, forming free-floating planets (FFPs), captured planets (CPs) around the flyby star, and free-floating binary planets (BPs); the remaining single-surviving planets (SSPs) can have their orbital radii and eccentricities greatly changed. Through numerical experiments, we calculate the formation fractions (or branching ratios) of FFPs, SSPs, CPs, and BPs as a function of the pericenter distance of the flyby, and use them to derive analytical expressions for the formation rates of FFPs, SSPs, CPs and BPs in general cluster environments. We find that the production rates of FFPs and SSPs are similar (for the initial planet semimajor axis ratio a1/a2 = 0.6–0.8), while the rate for CPs is a few times smaller. The formation fraction of BPs depends strongly on a1/a2 and on the planet masses. For Jupiter-mass planets, the formation fraction of BPs is always less than 1% (for a1/a2 = 0.8) and typically much smaller (≲0.2% for a1/a2 ≲ 0.7). The fraction remains less than 1% when considering 4MJ planets. Overall, when averaging over all flybys, the production rate of BPs is less than 0.1% of that of FFPs. We also derive the velocity distribution of FFPs produced by stellar flybys, and the orbital parameter distributions of SSPs, CPs, and BPs. These results can be used in future studies of exotic planets (including FFPs) and planetary systems.

在2020年3月、2020年4月和2021年2月，该源在不同时期被观测到。其中2020年4月11日以20.6 ± 1.1 mJy的通量密度和-3.1 ± 0.2的带内谱指数检测到。同时，在339 MHz处以122.6 ± 20.4 mJy的通量密度被探测到，表明低于1 GHz存在谱线断裂。此外，2020年4月的旋转测量值为63.9 ± 0.3 rad m−2，几乎是Wang等人观测到的可变RM范围的三倍。线性极化为76.7% ± 3.9%，圆极化上限为∣V∣/I < 10.1%。最后，根据数据解释，该源的可能解释是与不断变化的环境相互作用的高声速中子星。

ASKAP J173608.2–321635是一种射电瞬变现象，在2020年的观测中表现出多个特征，包括不同时期的通量密度、带内谱指数、旋转测量值和极化特征。根据数据解释，该源被推测为与不断变化的环境相互作用的高声速中子星。 <div>
The radio transient ASKAP J173608.2–321635, at the position (ℓ, b) = (356.°0872, −0.°0390), was serendipitously observed by The H i/OH/Recombination line survey of the Galactic center at three epochs in 2020 March, 2020 April, and 2021 February. The source was detected only on 2020 April 11 with a flux density of 20.6 ± 1.1 mJy at 1.23 GHz and in-band spectral index of α = −3.1 ± 0.2. The commensal Very Large Array Low-band Ionsophere and Transient Experiment simultaneously detected the source at 339 MHz with a flux density of 122.6 ± 20.4 mJy, indicating a spectral break below 1 GHz. The rotation measure (RM) in 2020 April was 63.9 ± 0.3 rad m−2, which almost triples the range of the variable RM observed by Wang et al. to ∼130 rad m−2. The polarization angle, corrected for Faraday rotation, was 97° ± 6°. The 1.23 GHz linear polarization was 76.7% ± 3.9% with wavelength-dependent depolarization, indicating a Faraday depth dispersion of . We find an upper limit to the circular polarization of ∣V∣/I < 10.1%. Interpretation of the data in terms of diffractive scattering of radio waves by a plasma near the source indicates an electron density and a line-of-sight magnetic field strength within a factor of 3 of ne ∼ 2 cm−3 and B∥ ∼ 2 × 105μG. Combined with causality limits to the size of the source, these parameters are consistent with the low-frequency spectral break resulting from synchrotron self-absorption, not free–free absorption. A possible interpretation of the source is a highly supersonic neutron star interacting with a changing environment.

这篇文章研究了f(R)引力理论下的宇宙大爆炸核合成，并考虑了辐射时代原始黑洞对引力的修改所引入的额外自由度。研究发现，在一定范围的scalaron质量下，锂的丰度降低了3-4倍，这有助于解决宇宙锂问题。同时，氦的丰度符合观测界限。然而，氘的丰度提高了3-6倍，这需要恒星形成和演化过程对原始氘的破坏具有高效率，这在scalaron引力理论中是可能的。文章还提出了scalaron质量与黑洞质量的新关系，并指出了在这一scalaron质量范围内的原始黑洞可作为非重子暗物质的潜在候选者。最后，文章推断了幂律f(R)引力与原始黑洞的大爆炸等效性，并指出这种黑洞可以被即将到来的引力波探测器所探测到。<br /><br />总结: 这篇文章研究了f(R)引力理论下的宇宙大爆炸核合成，发现特定范围的scalaron质量下，锂的丰度降低，氦的丰度符合观测界限，氘的丰度增加。文章还提出了scalaron质量与黑洞质量的关系，并推断了幂律f(R)引力与原始黑洞的大爆炸等效性。 <div>
f(R) gravity is one of the serious alternatives of general relativity with a large range of astronomical consequences. In this work, we study Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) in f(R) gravity theory. We consider a modification to gravity due to the existence of primordial black holes (PBHs) in the radiation era that introduce additional degrees of freedom known as scalarons. We calculate the light element abundances by using the BBN code PArthENoPE. It is found that for a range of scalaron mass (2.2 − 3.5) × 104 eV, the abundance of lithium is lowered by 3−4 times the value predicted by general relativistic BBN, which is a level desired to address the cosmological lithium problem. For the above scalaron mass range, the helium abundance is within the observed bound. However, the deuterium abundance is found to be increased by 3−6 times the observed primordial abundance. It calls for a high efficiency of stellar formation and evolution processes for the destruction of primordial deuterium, which is suggested as possible in scalaron gravity. A novel relation between scalaron mass and black hole mass has been used to show that the above scalaron mass range corresponds to PBHs of subplanetary mass (∼1019 g) serving as one of the potential candidates of nonbaryonic dark matter. We infer Big Bang equivalence of power-law f(R) gravity with PBHs that are detectable with upcoming gravitational wave detectors.

总结: 本文介绍了对AGEL调查中七个星系尺度透镜的透镜模型。利用HST/WFC3-F140W图像和GLEE软件进行建模，测量了折射器星系的总密度分布和γ-z关系。通过比较观测和模型预测的速度离散度，验证了透镜模型；得出平均密度梯度斜率为-1.95±0.09和γ-z关系在z<1时不随红移变化的结论。文章指出观测和模拟之间的冲突可能是由于透镜和动力学模型中的系统误差，观测与模拟之间的比较难度，以及假定总质量分布为简单的幂律。AGEL调查将提供更多zdefl>0.5的透镜，为当前理论模型预测的质量分布随红移演化提供更强的约束。<br /><br /> <div>
Observed evolution of the total mass distribution with redshift is crucial to testing galaxy evolution theories. To measure the total mass distribution, strong gravitational lenses complement the resolved dynamical observations that are currently limited to z ≲ 0.5. Here we present the lens models for a pilot sample of seven galaxy-scale lenses from the ASTRO3D Galaxy Evolution with Lenses (AGEL) survey. The AGEL lenses, modeled using HST/WFC3-F140W images with Gravitational Lens Efficient Explorer (GLEE) software, have deflector redshifts in the range 0.3 < zdefl < 0.9. Assuming a power-law density profile with slope γ, we measure the total density profile for the deflector galaxies via lens modeling. We also measure the stellar velocity dispersions (σobs) for four lenses and obtain σobs from SDSS-BOSS for the remaining lenses to test our lens models by comparing observed and model-predicted velocity dispersions. For the seven AGEL lenses, we measure an average density profile slope of −1.95 ± 0.09 and a γ–z relation that does not evolve with redshift at z < 1. Although our result is consistent with some observations and simulations, it differs from other studies at z < 1 that suggest the γ–z relation evolves with redshift. The apparent conflicts among observations and simulations may be due to a combination of (1) systematics in the lensing and dynamical modeling; (2) challenges in comparing observations with simulations; and (3) assuming a simple power law for the total mass distribution. By providing more lenses at zdefl > 0.5, the AGEL survey will provide stronger constraints on whether the mass profiles evolve with redshift as predicted by current theoretical models.

The small-scale dynamo is typically studied by assuming that the correlation time of the velocity field is zero. Some authors have used a smooth renovating flow model to study how the properties of the dynamo are affected by the correlation time being nonzero. Here, we assume the velocity is an incompressible Gaussian random field (which need not be smooth), and derive the lowest-order corrections to the evolution equation for the two-point correlation of the magnetic field in Fourier space. Using this, we obtain the evolution equation for the longitudinal correlation function of the magnetic field (ML) in nonhelical turbulence, valid for arbitrary Prandtl number. The nonresistive terms of this equation do not contain spatial derivatives of ML of order greater than 2. We further simplify this equation in the limit of high Prandtl number, and find that the growth rate of the magnetic energy is much smaller than previously reported. Nevertheless, the magnetic power spectrum still retains the Kazantsev form at high Prandtl number.

As a classical approach, the dynamics of the Universe, influenced by its dark components, are unveiled through prior modifications of Einstein’s equations. Cosmography, on the other hand, is a highly efficient tool for reconstructing any modified theory in a model-independent manner. By employing kinematic variables, it offers a profound explanation for cosmic expansion. Although the cosmographical approach has been highly successful in several geometric theories in recent years, it has not been extensively explored in coupled gravities. With this in mind, we intend to constrain an extended teleparallel gravity model, , through cosmographic parameters. We utilize Taylor series expansion, assuming a minimally coupled form, to constrain the unknowns involved in the series. To achieve this, we conduct a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis using three different data sets (cosmic chronometers, baryon acoustic oscillations, and Pantheon+SH0ES). The constrained results obtained from MCMC are then compared and verified using various cosmological parameters. Finally, we compare the resulting models with three well-known models.

The mergers of double neutron star (DNS) systems are believed to drive the majority of short γ-ray bursts (SGRBs), while also serving as production sites of heavy r-process elements. Despite being key to (i) confirming the nature of the extragalactic SGRBs, (ii) addressing the poorly understood r-process enrichment in the ultrafaint dwarf galaxies (UFDGs), and (iii) probing the formation process of DNS systems, the space velocity distribution of DNSs is still poorly constrained, due to the small number of DNSs with well-determined astrometry. In this work, we determine new proper motions and parallaxes of two Galactic DNSs, PSR J0509+3801 and PSR J1930−1852, using the Very Long Baseline Array, and we estimate the transverse velocities v⊥ of all 11 isolated Galactic DNSs having proper-motion measurements in a consistent manner. Our correlation analysis reveals that the DNS v⊥ is tentatively correlated with three parameters: spin period, orbital eccentricity, and companion mass. With the preliminary v⊥ distribution, we obtain the following findings. First, the refined v⊥ distribution is confirmed to agree with the observed displacements of the localized SGRBs from their host galaxy birth sites. Second, we estimate that around 11% and 25% of DNSs remain gravitationally bound to UFDGs with escape velocities of 15 and 25 km s−1, respectively. Hence, the retained DNSs might indeed be responsible for the r-process enrichment confirmed so far in a few UFDGs. Finally, we discuss how a future ensemble of astrometrically determined DNSs may probe the multimodality of the v⊥ distribution.

本文研究了2022年3月25日观测到的一个扭曲的、指向地球的日冕物质抛射（CME）。文章采用了三个远程感知与三个原位观测卫星的数据，并发现CME前端在纬度和经度上都出现了扭曲，其中Solar Orbiter观测显示出的地向纬度扭曲低至约6个太阳半径。同时，近地区极紫外观测表明这种扭曲是由于CME与附近赤道日冕孔的更快风速相互作用所致。研究还采用了改进的GCS模型来评估CME扭曲对其传播的影响，并将结果与拖曳模型和WSA-Enlil MHD模型进行比较。结果表明，虽然该事件复杂，但在不同的距离处到达时间的误差要比文献中的典型误差（约8-10小时）低得多（约4小时误差）。 <div>
Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs), drivers of the most severe Space Weather disturbances, are often assumed to evolve self-similarly during their propagation. However, open magnetic field structures in the corona, leading to higher-speed streams in the ambient solar wind, can be source of strong distortions of the CME front. In this paper, we investigate a distorted and Earth-directed CME observed on 2022 March 25 combining three remote sensing with three in situ observatories at different heliocentric distances (from 0.5 to 1 au). Near quadrature observations by Solar Orbiter and the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory revealed a distortion of the CME front in both latitude and longitude, with Solar Orbiter observations showing an Earth-directed latitudinal distortion as low as ≈6 R⊙. Near-Earth extreme-ultraviolet observations indicated the distortion was caused by interaction with faster wind from a nearby equatorial coronal hole. To evaluate the effect of the distortion on the CME's propagation, we adopted a three-point-of-view graduated cylindrical shell (GCS) fitting approach. For the first time, the GCS results are combined with an additional heliospheric single-viewpoint that looks further out in the heliosphere, revealing a deceleration in the CME before reaching ≈100 R⊙. The CME geometry and velocity determined by this enhanced GCS are used to initialize a drag-based model and a WSA-Enlil MHD model. The estimated times of arrival are compared with in situ data at different heliocentric distances and, despite the complexity of the event, the error in the arrival times at each spacecraft results much lower (≈4 hr error) than the typical errors in literature (≈8–10 hr).

The role of metallicity in shaping protoplanetary disk evolution remains poorly comprehended. This study analyzes the disk fraction of 10 young (0.9–2.1 Myr) and low-metallicity (0.34–0.83 Z⊙) clusters located in the outer Milky Way with Galactocentric distances between 10 and 13 kpc. Using JHK data obtained from UKIDSS, the calculated disk fraction values for low-mass stars (0.2–2 M⊙) ranged from 42% to 7%. To enhance the statistical reliability of our analysis, eight additional low-metallicity clusters are sourced from previous studies with metallicity range 0.25–0.85 Z⊙ along with our sample, resulting in a total of 18 regions with low metallicity. We find that low-metallicity clusters exhibit on average a 2.6 ± 0.2 times lower disk fraction compared to solar-metallicity clusters in all the age bins we have. Within the age range we can probe, our study does not find evidence of faster disk decay in subsolar-metallicity regions compared to solar-metallicity regions. Furthermore, we observe a positive correlation between cluster disk fraction and metallicity for two different age groups of 0.3–1.4 and 1.4–2.5 Myr. We emphasize that both cluster age and metallicity significantly affect the fraction of stars with evidence of inner disks.

研究人员在近邻的亮红外塞弗特星系NGC 7469的中心3.3千秒差距范围内，结合JWST/MIRI成像、CO(2-1)数据和22 GHz射电数据，以及1.3mm尘埃连续数据，探索星形成过程。NGC 7469拥有一个主导整体星形成活动的星暴环。通过22 GHz射电数据和CO(2-1)发现全球星形成速率(SFR)约为11.5 M⊙ yr−1，冷分子气体质量M(H2)约为6.4 × 10^9M☉。1.3mm地图显示出与22 GHz和JWST观测到的7.7微米多环芳烃(PAH)发射相似的形态。三种迹象很好地重现了星暴环的形态。研究了PAHs、SFR和冷分子气体之间的相关性，发现PAHs与星形成的相关性比与CO的相关性更强，在星暴环内的相关性比外部地区更陡。推导了SFR和冷分子气体质量面密度之间的相关性，即Kennicutt-Schmidt (K-S)星形成定律。将NGC 7469与其他星暴星系和活动星系核等星系进行比较，突显出NGC 7469在K-S关系中呈现出中间行为。 
<br /><br />总结: 该研究利用多种观测数据和方法探索了NGC 7469星系中心3.3千秒差距范围内的星形成过程，并发现了星暴环的主导作用、PAHs与星形成的相关性以及星形成定律的相关性。与其他星系的比较表明，NGC 7469在星形成方面呈现出中间行为。 <div>
We investigate the star formation process within the central 3.3 kpc region of the nearby luminous infrared Seyfert NGC 7469, probing scales ranging from 88 to 330 pc. We combine JWST/MIRI imaging with the F770W filter, with CO(2 – 1) and the underlying 1.3 mm dust continuum data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, along with Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array radio continuum observations at 22 GHz. NGC 7469 hosts a starburst ring which dominates the overall star formation activity. We estimate the global star formation rate (SFR) ∼ 11.5 M⊙ yr−1 from the radio at 22 GHz, and a cold molecular gas mass M(H2) ∼ 6.4 × 109M☉ from the CO(2 – 1) emission. We find that the 1.3 mm map shows a morphology remarkably similar to those traced by the 22 GHz and the 7.7 μm polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission observed with JWST. The three tracers reproduce the morphology of the starburst ring with good agreement. We further investigate the correlations between the PAHs, the SFR, and the cold molecular gas. We find a stronger correlation of the PAHs with star formation than with CO, with steeper correlations within the starburst ring (n > 2) than in the outer region (n < 1). We derive a correlation between the SFR and the cold molecular gas mass surface densities, the Kennicutt–Schmidt (K-S) star formation law. Comparisons with other galaxy populations, including starburst galaxies and active galactic nuclei, highlighted that NGC 7469 exhibits an intermediate behavior to the K-S relations found for these galaxy populations.

总结:<br />
这篇文章讨论了太阳上的六次丝状物喷发事件，并展示了丝状物遮挡部分太阳盘造成的He ii 304 Å光度曲线的变暗特征。事件具有类似的形态特征，起源于活跃区内的小丝状物，随后迅速扩张遮挡大面积的太阳盘或明亮的耀斑区域。分析结果显示，这些变暗事件的持续时间为0.4-7.0小时，最大变暗深度为6.2%，最大变暗面积占太阳盘面积的5.6%。还发现变暗深度和面积之间存在正相关关系，这有助于在恒星观测中限制丝状物的尺寸。 <div>
Filament eruptions often lead to coronal mass ejections (CMEs) on the Sun and are one of the most energetic eruptive phenomena in the atmospheres of other late-type stars. However, the detection of filament eruptions and CMEs on stars beyond the solar system is challenging. Here, we present six filament eruption cases on the Sun and show that filament material obscuring part of the solar disk can cause detectable dimming signatures in Sun-as-a-star flux curves of He ii 304 Å. Those filament eruptions have similar morphological features, originating from small filaments inside active regions and subsequently strongly expanding to obscure large areas of the solar disk or the bright flare regions. We have tracked the detailed evolution of six obscuration dimmings and estimated the dimming properties, such as dimming depths, dimming areas, and duration. The largest dimming depth among the six events under study is 6.2% accompanied by the largest dimming area of 5.6% of the solar disk area. Other events have maximum dimming depths in a range of around 1%–3%, with maximum areas varying between about 3%–4% of the solar disk area. The duration of the dimming spans from around 0.4–7.0 hr for the six events under study. A positive correlation was found between the dimming depth and area, which may help to set constraints on the filament sizes in stellar observations.

<div> Nuclear Stellar Cluster, Galactic center, IRS 13, S-cluster, star formation history
<br />
这篇文章讨论了银河系核心区域的两个尘埃星体人群，即IRS 13和S-星团。研究人员发现IRS 13和大规模的星体分布可能存在关联，并提出了一个新的具有盘状结构的簇。通过N体模拟和观测结果，他们得出了一个结论，即一个巨大的星团可以从核周盘迁移到内部。此外，他们还发现IRS 13可能分裂成一个稳定的核心残余和一个逐渐消散的部分，并且对其周围存在一个中等质量黑洞提供了初步支持。

研究发现了核星团中不同人群的存在，并提出了它们可能与银河中心的星形成历史有关。他们发现了一个新的盘状结构的星团，并通过N体模拟和观测结果得出了这个星团可能迁移的结论。此外，他们还对IRS 13进行了分析，发现可能存在一个中等质量黑洞以及核心残余和逐渐消散的部分。 <div>
The existence of two distinct and apparently unrelated populations of dusty stellar objects in the Nuclear Stellar Cluster of the Milky Way, namely IRS 13 and the S-cluster, are potentially prone to a general process describing the star formation history in the Galactic center (GC). The former cluster is thought to be entangled in the clockwise and counterclockwise disks, a large-scale stellar distribution revealed by the analysis of stars at different distances from Sgr A*, the supermassive black hole in the GC. Recently, this large-scale distribution was reported to exhibit a multidisk structure with at least four components. Motivated by this finding, we revisit the anisotropic IRS 13 cluster and find strong evidence for a disk-like structure. An examination of about 50 individual stellar orbits reveals a new structure that does not follow any trend known in the literature. Furthermore, we investigate the possibility of an inspiral cluster undergoing star formation processes, as proposed by several authors. Using a simplified N-body simulation to reproduce our observational results, we conclude that, under certain conditions, a massive cluster can migrate from the Circum Nuclear Disk toward the inner parsec. Based on this classification, we revisit the large-scale NACO Very Large Telescope (VLT) observations of IRS 13 and find evidence for a separation of the cluster into a gravitationally stable core remnant and a dissipating part. With the velocity-resolved H30α line and the broadband spectral energy distribution of IRS 13 E3, we provide tentative support for the existence of an intermediate-mass black hole of ∼3 × 104M⊙ surrounded by a hot gaseous stream.

A tidal disruption event (TDE) may occur when a star is torn apart by the tidal force of a black hole (BH). Eventually, an accretion disk is thought to form out of stellar debris falling back toward the BH. If the star’s orbital angular momentum vector prior to disruption is not aligned with the BH spin angular momentum vector, the disk will be tilted with respect to the BH equatorial plane. The disk will eventually be drawn into the BH equatorial plane due to a combination of the Bardeen–Petterson effect and internal torques. Here, we analyze the X-ray and UV observations of the TDE AT2020ocn obtained by Swift, XMM-Newton, and Neutron star Interior Composition ExploreR. The X-ray light curve shows strong flares during the first ≈100 days, while, over the same period, the UV emission decays gradually. We find that the X-ray flares can be explained by a model that also explains the spectral evolution. This model includes a slim disk viewed under a variable inclination plus an inverse-Comptonization component processing the slim disk emission. A scenario where the ongoing Lense–Thirring precession during the disk alignment process is responsible for the observed inclination variations is consistent with the data. In later observations, we find that the X-ray spectrum of AT2020ocn becomes harder, while the mass accretion rate remains at super-Eddington levels, suggesting the formation of a corona in line with accretion onto other compact objects. We constrain the BH mass to be M⊙ at the 1σ (68%) confidence level.

Partially ionized plasmas consist of charged and neutral particles whose mutual collisions modify magnetic reconnection compared with the fully ionized case. The collisions alter the rate and locations of the magnetic dissipation heating and the distribution of energies among the particles accelerated into the nonthermal tail. We examine the collisional regimes for the onset of fast reconnection in two environments: the partially ionized layers of the solar atmosphere, and the protoplanetary disks that are the birthplaces for planets around young stars. In both these environments, magnetic nulls readily develop into resistive current sheets in the regime where the charged and neutral particles are fully coupled by collisions, but the current sheets quickly break down under the ideal tearing instability. The current sheets collapse repeatedly, forming magnetic islands at successively smaller scales, until they enter a collisionally decoupled regime where the magnetic energy is rapidly turned into heat and charged-particle kinetic energy. Small-scale, decoupled fast reconnection in the solar atmosphere may lead to preferential heating and energization of ions and electrons that escape into the corona. In protoplanetary disks such reconnection causes localized heating in the atmospheric layers that produce much of the infrared atomic and molecular line emission observed with the Spitzer and James Webb Space Telescopes.

<div> 超大质量黑洞，变化现象，活跃星系核，特征时间尺度，环核气体供应

研究旨在通过关注涵盖所有已知重复变化现象的活跃星系核样本，阐明“变化现象”现象的起源。通过鉴别“变化现象”的特征时间尺度，观察到较大的超大质量黑洞具有较短的特征时间尺度，而较小的超大质量黑洞表现出较长的时间尺度。这些发现揭示了“变化现象”与传统活跃星系核变化的显着对比，传统变化已被活跃星系核盘不稳定模型充分解释。这一鲜明的差异突出了“变化现象”的独特起源，将其区别于传统的活跃星系核变化。通过正确预测特征时间尺度及其对超大质量黑洞质量的依赖，我们提出“变化现象”很可能是由于在活跃和被动超大质量黑洞供油阶段过渡时，周围环核气体供应的突然变化导致的流量变化。 <br /><br />总结: 本研究通过观察活跃星系核样本，发现超大质量黑洞的变化现象存在特征时间尺度，且与传统变化不同。提出变化现象可能是由于活跃和被动超大质量黑洞供油阶段转换时，环核气体供应突然变化导致的流量变化。 <div>
The origin of the “changing-look” (CL) phenomenon in supermassive black holes (SMBHs) remains an open issue. This study aims to shed light on this phenomenon by focusing on a sample that encompasses all known repeating CL active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Through the identification of a characteristic timescale for the CL phenomenon, it was observed that larger SMBHs possess shorter characteristic timescales, while smaller SMBHs exhibit longer timescales. These findings reveal a significant contrast to the traditional AGN variability that has been adequately explained by the AGN’s disk instability model. This stark discrepancy highlights a distinct origin of the CL phenomenon, distinguishing it from traditional AGN variability. By properly predicting the characteristic timescale and its dependence on SMBH mass, we propose that the CL phenomenon is likely a result of a variation in accretion rate caused by a sudden change in the supply of circumnuclear gas during the transition between active and passive SMBH fueling stages.

<div> tSZ, MUSTANG2, 90 GHz, Galaxy clusters, Source contamination

这篇论文报告了利用热Sunyaev–Zel'dovich效应（tSZ）在243个星系团中进行的盲目调查，使用Green Bank望远镜上的MUSTANG2在90 GHz进行了调查，将5σ检测限定为每个星系团中心的1 mJy。文章发现了24个离散源，其中大多数（18个）对应于已知的射电源，其中有五个显示出明显的变化迹象，要么是随时间变化，要么是频谱指数变化。其余的源在其他波长没有明确的对应物。通过tSZ强烈依赖于90 GHz的观测来搜索星系团，而发现的源可能会对星系团的质量估计产生偏差。文章将结果与Websky模拟进行了比较，发现模拟与观测在星系团中心的匹配良好，但在外围的源分布上不匹配。在距离星系团中心104″以上的源使tSZ信号偏高，部分源的偏差可高达50%。在整个星系团种群中平均后，效应较小，但仍在1%–2%的水平。文章还发现，与先前的测量和模拟不同，他们在星系团外围观察到了源计数的增加，而在tSZ选择的样本的中心观察到的源较少。 <br /><br />总结: tSZ观测在90 GHz进行了Galaxy clusters的盲目调查，发现了24个离散源，其中大多数对应已知的射电源，还比较了观测结果与模拟结果，在星系团的外围发现了源计数的增加并发现了一些源对tSZ信号的偏差。 <div>
In this paper, we present the results of a blind survey for compact sources in 243 Galaxy clusters that were identified using the thermal Sunyaev–Zel'dovich effect (tSZ). The survey was carried out at 90 GHz using MUSTANG2 on the Green Bank Telescope and achieved a 5σ detection limit of 1 mJy in the center of each cluster. We detected 24 discrete sources. The majority (18) of these correspond to known radio sources, and of these, five show signs of significant variability, either with time or in spectral index. The remaining sources have no clear counterparts at other wavelengths. Searches for galaxy clusters via the tSZ strongly rely on observations at 90 GHz, and the sources found have the potential to bias mass estimates of clusters. We compare our results to the Websky simulation that can be used to estimate the source contamination in galaxy cluster catalogs. While the simulation shows a good match to our observations at the clusters’ centers, it does not match our source distribution further out. Sources over 104″ from a cluster’s center bias the tSZ signal high, for some of the sources found, by over 50%. When averaged over the whole cluster population, the effect is smaller but still at a level of 1%–2%. We also discovered that unlike previous measurements and simulations, we see an enhancement of source counts in the outer regions of the clusters and fewer sources than expected in the centers of this tSZ-selected sample.

通过空间分辨光谱学的研究，我们发现了一群罕见的具有星形成特征的椭圆星系。我们利用星际介质综合模型输出、深度学习目录的形态学结果以及MaNGA Pipe3D增值目录的解析和综合特性相结合，识别出了59个星形成椭圆星系。与我们的主要样本SF-E相比，我们还构建了两个控制样本：星形成螺旋星系（SF-Sps；2419个星系）和静止椭圆星系（Q-Es；684个星系）。SF-E的Hα发射线通量与螺旋星系相似，D4000光谱指数表明SF-E具有老年和年轻的恒星群。SF-E的质量加权恒星年龄和金属丰度低于Q-E，67%的主要样本的恒星和气体速度图显示出动力学扰动的迹象。所有这些结果表明，SF-E通过近期的合并或与其他星系的相互作用获得了贫金属气体，并且正在形成新一代的星。此外，我们还将主要样本的SF-E分为四类，根据它们的球状星系/总发光度比（B/T）和自旋参数。这四类具有各自独特的演化历史和形成方式。基于这些结果，我们建议哈勃图不能准确捕捉星系演化过程，我们需要一个修订的形态图，如梳形态图，才能完整地了解星系的演化过程。<br /><br />总结: 通过空间分辨光谱学研究发现了59个星形成的椭圆星系，它们通过合并或与其他星系互动获取了贫金属气体，并产生了新一代的星。此外，作者还根据恒星年龄和金属丰度将这些星系分为四类，具有不同的演化历史和形成方式。作者建议需要一个修订的形态图来更好地理解星系演化过程。 <div>
Using “spatially” resolved spectroscopy, we investigated the characteristics and different modes of formation of stars in elliptical galaxies. We identified an unusual population of 59 star-forming elliptical (SF-E) galaxies in SDSS-MaNGA, our primary sample. To identify these rare star-forming ellipticals, we combined GSWLC-A2 containing outputs of stellar population synthesis models with morphological results from the deep-learning catalog and resolved and integrated properties from the MaNGA Pipe3D value-added catalog. We have also constructed two control samples of star-forming spirals (SF-Sps; 2419 galaxies) and quenched ellipticals (Q-Es; 684 galaxies) to compare with our primary sample of SF-Es. Hα emission line flux of SF-Es is similar to spiral galaxies. The D4000 spectral index indicates that SF-Es have a mixture of old and young stellar populations. Mass-weighted stellar age and metallicity for the SF-Es are lower than the Q-Es and 67% of stellar- and gas-velocity maps of the primary sample show signs of kinematic disturbance. All of these indicate that SF-Es have acquired metal-poor gas through recent mergers or interactions with other galaxies and are forming a new generation of stars. Further, we subdivide our primary sample of SF-Es into four classes based on their bulge to total luminosity ratio (B/T) and spin parameter . These four classes have their distinct evolutionary history and modes of formation. Based on these results, we suggest that the Hubble diagram does not accurately capture galaxy evolution processes, and we need a revised morphology diagram like the comb morphology diagram to get a complete picture of the galaxy evolution processes.

总结: <br /><br />这项研究利用实验室得到的纯非晶和晶态冰的近红外光谱，在80-180K温度范围内进行了研究。研究的目的是提供光谱参考数据，以便远程访问冰的性质，如冰卫星、彗星冰或土星环等冰的物质特性。研究特别识别了评估空间冰三个重要属性的新的光谱标记：(i) 孔隙度/蓬松度，(ii) 非晶冰的体密度，(iii) 结晶冰的立方性。研究分析了OH-伸展泛频（2νOH）和5000cm^{-1}/2μm的组合带，这些是这些属性的有力光谱标记。通过比较蒸发沉积的微孔非晶固态水、无孔低、高和非常高密度非晶冰的光谱，能够在非晶冰的近红外光谱中将(体)密度效应与孔隙度效应分离开来。这一点澄清了一直存在的问题，即詹尼斯肯斯和布莱克首次提出的低温蒸发沉积的非晶冰密度不一致问题。通过将近红外光谱与粉末X射线衍射图进行直接比较，可以将光谱特征与堆叠失序冰Isd中的立方叠层数相关联，范围从完全立方冰Ic到完全六角冰Ih。研究还表明，詹姆斯·韦伯空间望远镜上的仪器曝光时间在小时范围内可区分这些属性，证明了被忽视的近红外光谱范围对于识别空间中的冰是有用的。 <div>
We present laboratory spectra of pure amorphous and crystalline H2O ices in the near-infrared (NIR, 1–2.5 μm/10,000–4000 cm−1) at 80–180 K. The aim of this study is to provide spectroscopic reference data that allow remotely accessing ice properties for icy objects such as icy moons, cometary ice, or Saturn rings. Specifically, we identify new spectral markers for assessing three important properties of ices in space: (i) porosity/fluffiness, (ii) bulk density of amorphous ice, and (iii) cubicity in crystalline ice. The analysis is based on the first OH-stretching overtone (2νOH) and the combinational band at 5000 cm−1/2 μm, which are potent spectral markers for these properties. By comparison of vapor-deposited, microporous amorphous solid water, pore-free low-, high-, and very-high-density amorphous ice, we are able to separate the effect of (bulk) density from the effect of porosity on NIR-spectra of amorphous ices. This allows for clarifying a longstanding inconsistency about the density of amorphous ice vapor-deposited at low temperatures, first brought up by Jenniskens & Blake. Direct comparison of NIR spectra with powder X-ray diffractograms allows us to correlate spectral features with the number of cubic stacking layers in stacking-disordered ice Isd, ranging from fully cubic ice Ic to fully hexagonal ice Ih. We show that exposure times for instruments on the James Webb Space Telescope are in the hour range to distinguish these properties, demonstrating the usefulness of the neglected NIR spectral range for identifying ices in space.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了通过观测的UV连续斜率（β）和红外过剩（IRX）之间的关系，来理解高红移星系的尘埃衰减规律。研究使用了来自AstroSat UV Deep Field北部的83个UV选择的星系数据，估算了52个星系的观测IRX。通过多波段光度数据进行SED建模，发现IRX-β值存在较大散布，表明尘埃衰减存在多样性。研究发现在IRX-β平面上最佳拟合的修正Calzetti关系的幂律斜率（δ）存在明显关联，SMC类似的更陡的衰减规律更偏好较低的δ值。SED模型的IRX-β关系显示偏好于更陡的SMC类似的衰减规律，这与用Hα发射线推导的星形成率和观测的远紫外加重处理的远红外辐射得出的结果吻合。这项研究揭示了IRX和星系的恒星质量之间的强正相关，表明更大质量的星系会产生更多的尘埃。 <div>
The relation between the observed UV continuum slope (β) and the infrared excess (IRX) is used as a powerful probe to understand the nature of dust attenuation law in high-redshift galaxies. We present a study of 83 UV-selected galaxies between a redshift of 0.5 and 0.7 from the AstroSat UV Deep Field north that encloses the GOODS-North field. Using empirical relation, we estimate the observed IRX of 52 galaxies that are detected in either one or both of the Herschel PACS 100 and 160 μm bands. We further utilize the multiband photometric data in 14–18 filters from the Ultra-Violet Imaging Telescope, KPNO, Hubble Space Telescope, Spitzer, and Herschel telescopes to perform spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling. Both the observed and model-derived IRX–β values show a large scatter within the span of previously known relations, signifying diversity in dust attenuation. We found a distinct relation between the best-fit power-law slope of the modified Calzetti relation (δ) in the IRX–β plane, where the steeper SMC-like attenuation law prefers lower δ values. Our SED model-based IRX–β relation shows a preference for steeper SMC-like attenuation, which we further confirm from the agreement between extinction-corrected star formation rates derived using the Hα emission line and the observed far-ultraviolet plus reprocessed far-IR fluxes. The current study reveals a strong positive correlation between IRX and the galaxy's stellar mass between 109.5 and 1011.0M⊙, signifying increased dust production in more massive star-forming galaxies.

<div> Parker Solar Probe, solar encounter, magnetic structure, heliospheric current sheet, streamer blobs
总结:
Parker Solar Probe于2019年3月30日至4月11日期间进行了第二次太阳遭遇，期间观测到了大量大小不一的流量增强体（流星团）在赤道附近流动。WISPR的高分辨率和灵敏度揭示了这些增强体的结构，显示出其中一些流星团具有暗色中心核心，暗示其为磁通绳。通过对四个典型流星团的3D轨迹和大小进行跟踪，确认它们的位置与太阳赤道帽相关联。这些流星团在15 R☉以上的区域被观测到，证实了在HCS附近的慢风中重新连接的过程主导着慢风的形成。 <br /><br /> <div>
Parker Solar Probe's second solar encounter from 2019 March 30 to April 11 occurred during a period when the corona had a simple magnetic structure and relatively flat heliospheric current sheet (HCS), which was in the field of view of the Wide-field Imager for Solar Probe (WISPR) throughout. The images show an almost continual flow of transient density enhancements (streamer blobs) of various sizes near the latitude of the HCS during the entire 11 day encounter period. The high resolution and sensitivity of WISPR reveal the structure of some of the individual blobs not seen in observations from 1 au. Many of the blobs show dark central cores, suggesting that they are magnetic flux ropes. The 3D trajectories and sizes of four representative streamer blobs have been determined using the tracking and fitting technique of Liewer et al. (2020). Comparison of the location of these blobs with synoptic white-light maps for this time period, created using data from the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (Brueckner et al. 1995) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, confirms that the blobs are at the location of the helmet streamer associated with the HCS. The blobs were observed in the region beyond 15 R☉. The continual flow of blobs, the confirmation of their location at the HCS, and their flux-rope-like appearance provide strong evidence that the process of reconnection across the current sheet dominates the slow wind near the HCS.

本文报道了来自南天MWA Rapid Two-meter脉冲星调查的长周期脉冲星PSR J0452−3418的发现。该脉冲星表现出准周期性的闪烁和亚脉冲漂移。文章描述了脉冲星的发现和后续跟踪，包括使用uGMRT进行高分辨率成像的位置测定，使用MWA和uGMRT数据进行初步定时分析，以及在MWA频段（140–170 MHz）内对闪烁和漂移特性的详细表征。研究发现，该脉冲星的闪烁分数为34% ± 6%，闪烁周期为脉冲。此外，文章还对比了观察到的特性与其他表现出亚脉冲漂移和准周期性闪烁现象的脉冲星的特征，并发现大多数这类对象倾向于处于“死亡谷”中。研究还讨论了脉冲星发射物理学的广泛含义以及使用下一代脉冲星调查方法检测类似对象的可行性。 <div>
The phenomenon of pulsar nulling, where pulsars temporarily and stochastically cease their radio emission, is thought to be indicative of a “dying” pulsar, where radio emission ceases entirely. Here we report the discovery of a long-period pulsar, PSR J0452−3418, from the ongoing Southern-sky MWA Rapid Two-meter pulsar survey. The pulsar has a rotation period of ∼1.67 s and a dispersion measure of 19.8 pc cm−3, and it exhibits both quasiperiodic nulling and subpulse drifting. Periodic nulling is uncommon, reported in only <1% of the pulsar population, with even a smaller fraction showing periodic nulling and subpulse drifting. We describe the discovery and follow-up of the pulsar, including a positional determination using high-resolution imaging with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT), initial timing analysis using the combination of Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) and uGMRT data, and detailed characterization of the nulling and drifting properties in the MWA’s frequency band (140–170 MHz). Our analysis suggests a nulling fraction of 34% ± 6% and a nulling periodicity of pulses. We measure the phase (P2) and time modulation (P3) caused by the subpulse drifting, with an average P2 of 7.1 degrees and a P3 of 4.8 pulses. We compare and contrast the observed properties with those of other pulsars that exhibit subpulse drifting and quasiperiodic nulling phenomena, and find that the majority of these objects tend to be in the “death valley” in the period–period derivative (P– ) diagram. We also discuss some broader implications for pulsar emission physics and the detectability of similar objects using next-generation pulsar surveys.

<div> 关键词: 脉冲非定期脉动（QPPs），硬X射线（HXR），微波，Lyα，紫外线（UV）
总结:
脉冲非定期脉动（QPPs）在2024年2月22日（SOL2024-02-22T22:08）的X6.4耀斑的冲击阶段同时在硬X射线（HXR）、微波、Lyα和紫外线（UV）发射波长中观测到。X6.4耀斑在HXR和微波波段显示出三次重复和连续的脉动，并且具有极大的调制深度。耀斑QPPs的发生几乎与正负磁场的磁消除的开始几乎同时发生。小波功率谱表明存在两个中心在∼200和∼95秒左右的双周期。在耀斑区域还可以在Lyα和UV波段检测到长周期QPP，并且它可以在相邻的太阳黑子中观察到。我们的观测表明，耀斑QPPs很可能是由与周期性磁重连接相关的加速电子触发的。∼200秒的长周期可能受到来自邻近太阳黑子的慢磁声波的调制，而∼95秒的短周期可以被视为它的第二谐波模式。 <div>
We report the simultaneous observations of quasiperiodic pulsations (QPPs) in wavelengths of hard X-ray (HXR), microwave, Lyα, and ultraviolet (UV) emissions during the impulsive phase of an X6.4 flare on 2024 February 22 (SOL2024-02-22T22:08). The X6.4 flare shows three repetitive and successive pulsations in HXR and microwave wavebands, and they have an extremely large modulation depth. The onset of flare QPPs is almost simultaneous with the start of magnetic cancellation between positive and negative fields. The wavelet power spectra suggest the presence of double periods, which are centered at ∼200 and ∼95 s, respectively. The long-period QPP can also be detected in Lyα and UV wavebands at the flare area, and it could be observed in the adjacent sunspot. Our observations indicate that the flare QPPs are most likely triggered by accelerated electrons that are associated with periodic magnetic reconnections. The long period at ∼200 s is probably modulated by the slow magnetoacoustic wave originating from the neighboring sunspot, while the short period at ∼95 s could be regarded as its second harmonic mode.

<title>The Sun’s Magnetic Power Spectra over Two Solar Cycles. II. Cycle Dependence of Active Regions, a Magnetic Network, and Their Relation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The multiscaled solar magnetic field consists of two major components: active regions (ARs) and magnetic network. Unraveling the cycle-dependent properties and interrelations of these components is crucial for understanding the evolution of the solar magnetic field. In this study, we investigate these components using magnetic power spectra derived from high-resolution and continuous synoptic magnetograms since cycle 23 onward. Our results show that the size of the magnetic network ranges from 26 to 41 Mm without dependence on the solar cycle. The power of the network field (PNW) accounts for approximately 20% of the total power during any phase of solar cycles. In contrast to the AR power (PAR), PNW displays a weaker cycle dependence, as described by the relationship PNW ≈ 0.6* PAR + 40. The power-law index between AR sizes and magnetic network sizes presents a strong anticorrelation with the activity level. Additionally, our study indicates that in the absence of sunspots on the solar disc, the magnetic power spectra remain time-independent, consistently exhibiting similarity in both shape and power. This study introduces a new method to investigate the properties of the magnetic network and provides magnetic power spectra for high-resolution simulations of the solar magnetic field at the surface at various phases of solar cycles.

<div> SNe Ia, Hubble constant, distance calibrators, near-infrared, systematic errors 

总结: 本研究分析了Ia型超新星（SNe Ia）的数据，利用光学到近红外波段（uBgVriYJH）扩展了哈勃图。利用不同的距离校准器（Cepheids、TRGB和SBFs）计算了哈勃常数H0，得到了B波段的H0 = 71.76 ± 0.58（stat）± 1.19（sys）km s−1 Mpc−1和H波段的H0 = 73.22 ± 0.68（stat）± 1.28（sys）km s−1 Mpc−1。通过将Cepheid、TRGB和SBF校准器赋予相等的权重，得出了距离阶梯的第一层的系统误差约为1.2∼1.3 km s−1 Mpc−1，从而减小了我们的结果与宇宙微波背景提供的早期H0之间的张力。研究发现在Y波段有最高的SNe Ia发光精度（0.12 ± 0.01 mag）。另外，确认了SNe Ia的余辉主机质量相关性在光学和近红外波长间基本没有变化。最后，发现距离宿主中心超过10 kpc爆炸的SNe Ia发光分散较小，这可能是由于在主机外围灰尘的影响减小所导致的。 <div>
We present an analysis of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from the Carnegie Supernova Project I and II and extend the Hubble diagram from optical to near-infrared wavelengths (uBgVriYJH). We calculate the Hubble constant, H0, using various distance calibrators: Cepheids, the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB), and surface brightness fluctuations (SBFs). Combining all methods of calibration, we derive H0 = 71.76 ± 0.58 (stat) ± 1.19 (sys) km s−1 Mpc−1 from the B band and H0 = 73.22 ± 0.68 (stat) ± 1.28 (sys) km s−1 Mpc−1 from the H band. By assigning equal weight to the Cepheid, TRGB, and SBF calibrators, we derive the systematic errors required for consistency in the first rung of the distance ladder, resulting in a systematic error of 1.2 ∼ 1.3 km s−1 Mpc−1 in H0. As a result, relative to the statistics-only uncertainty, the tension between the late-time H0 we derive by combining the various distance calibrators and the early-time H0 from the cosmic microwave background is reduced. The highest precision in SN Ia luminosity is found in the Y band (0.12 ± 0.01 mag), as defined by the intrinsic scatter (σint). We revisit SN Ia Hubble residual-host mass correlations and recover previous results that these correlations do not change significantly between the optical and near-infrared wavelengths. Finally, SNe Ia that explode beyond 10 kpc from their host centers exhibit smaller dispersion in their luminosity, confirming our earlier findings. A reduced effect of dust in the outskirts of hosts may be responsible for this effect.

总结: 
本研究利用表面亮度波动来间接探测星系团介质中的湍流特性，包括湍流速度、注入尺度以及波动功率谱向较小尺度的倾斜。通过南极望远镜对SZ星系团的研究，结合X射线观测，选取了两个典型星系团进行了初步研究。研究结果显示，两个星系团中涡流的注入尺度都超过500千秒差距，其中SPT-CLJ0232-4421的马赫数约为0.5，SPT-CLJ0638-5358的马赫数约为0.6-1.6，并且后者有已知的激波。此外，对于M500，SPT-CLJ0232-4421的静压偏差值小于0.2，而SPT-CLJ0638-5358的静压偏差值小于0.1。这些结果表明，通过多波段的详细观测方法来定量评估数据的重要性，同时也暗示了湍流驱动可能出现在相当大的尺度上。 <br /><br /> <div>
Studies of surface brightness fluctuations in the intracluster medium present an indirect probe of turbulent properties such as the turbulent velocities, injection scales, and the slope of the power spectrum of fluctuations toward smaller scales. With the advancement of Sunyaev–Zel’dovich (SZ) studies and surveys relative to X-ray observations, we seek to investigate surface brightness fluctuations in a sample of South Pole Telescope (SPT)-SZ clusters which also have archival XMM-Newton data. Here we present a pilot study of two typical clusters in that sample: SPT-CLJ0232-4421 and SPT-CLJ0638-5358. We infer injection scales larger than 500 kpc in both clusters and Mach numbers ≈ 0.5 in SPT-CLJ0232-4421 and Mach numbers ≈ 0.6–1.6 in SPT-CLJ0638-5358, which has a known shock. We find hydrostatic bias values for M500 less than 0.2 for SPT-CLJ0232-4421 and less than 0.1 for SPT-CLJ0638-5358. These results show the importance to assess quantitative values via a detailed multiwavelength approach and suggest that the drivers of turbulence may occur at quite large scales.

Using Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer high-resolution (R ∼ 35,000) spectroscopy from 2.29 to 2.49 μm, we present uniform atmospheric retrievals for eight young substellar companions with masses of ∼10–30 MJup, orbital separations spanning ∼50–360 au, and Teff between ∼1500 and 2600 K. We find that all companions have solar C/O ratios and metallicities to within the 1σ–2σ level, with the measurements clustered around solar composition. Stars in the same stellar associations as our systems have near-solar abundances, so these results indicate that this population of companions is consistent with formation via direct gravitational collapse. Alternatively, core accretion outside the CO snowline would be compatible with our measurements, though the high mass ratios of most systems would require rapid core assembly and gas accretion in massive disks. On a population level, our findings can be contrasted with abundance measurements for directly imaged planets with m < 10 MJup, which show tentative atmospheric metal enrichment compared to their host stars. In addition, the atmospheric compositions of our sample of companions are distinct from those of hot Jupiters, which most likely form via core accretion. For two companions with Teff ∼ 1700–2000 K (κ And b and GSC 6214–210 b), our best-fit models prefer a nongray cloud model with >3σ significance. The cloudy models yield 2σ−3σ lower Teff for these companions, though the C/O and [C/H] still agree between cloudy and clear models at the 1σ level. Finally, we constrain 12CO/13CO for three companions with the highest signal-to-noise ratio data (GQ Lup b, HIP 79098b, and DH Tau b) and report and radial velocities for all companions.

总结:<br />
本文使用了高分辨率的宇宙学模拟来研究恒星晕的性质和组成成分，模拟结果表明FOGGIE模拟的恒星晕质量、金属丰度梯度和表面亮度分布与观测一致。恒星晕中有30%-40%的质量来源于原位恒星，这部分恒星更为集中在中心区域，不会使恒星晕外围过亮。剩下的恒星主要来自于10-50个其他星系，其中大部分来自于2-4个星系。预计未来的宽景天文台，如南希·格雷斯·罗曼太空望远镜，将能够观测到银河系附近的恒星晕，甚至可以通过色-星等图来区分矮星系的残骸与恒星晕的区别。 <div>
Over the next decade, the astronomical community will be commissioning multiple wide-field observatories well suited for studying stellar halos in both integrated light and resolved stars. In preparation for this, we use five high-resolution cosmological simulations of Milky Way–like galaxies from the FOGGIE suite to explore the properties and components of stellar halos. These simulations are run with high time (5 Myr) and stellar mass (1000 M⊙) resolution to better model the properties and origins of low-density regions like stellar halos. We find that the FOGGIE stellar halos have masses, metallicity gradients, and surface brightness profiles that are consistent with observations. In agreement with other simulations, the FOGGIE stellar halos receive 30%–40% of their mass from in situ stars. However, this population is more centrally concentrated in the FOGGIE simulations and therefore does not contribute excess light to the halo outskirts. The remaining stars are accreted from ∼10–50 other galaxies, with the majority of the accreted mass originating in two to four galaxies. While the inner halo (r < 50 kpc) of each FOGGIE galaxy has a large number of contributors, the halo outskirts of three of the five galaxies are primarily made up of stars from only a few contributors. We predict that upcoming wide-field observatories, like the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, will probe stellar halos around Milky Way–like galaxies out to ∼100 kpc in integrated light and will be able to distinguish the debris of dwarf galaxies with extended star formation histories from the underlying halo with resolved color–magnitude diagrams.

总结:
本研究提出了一种新的经验性颜色选择技术，旨在利用JWST NIRCam成像数据在3≤z≤6的范围内选择大质量寂静星系。通过使用经验约束的星系光谱能量分布（SED）模板，确定了F277W-F444W与F150W-F277W色彩平面上的一个区域，捕捉了z>3的寂静星系。在CEERS调查中应用这些颜色选择标准，并对该区域内的源进行SED拟合，鉴定出了44个z≳3的寂静星系候选体。其中超过一半的源是新发现的，平均具有后爆发星系的特定星形成率。大多数这些源在传统UVJ图中是无法发现的。我们估算出3<5时的体密度为n∼1-4×10^-5 Mpc^-3，与CEERS领域类似群体的现有报告非常一致。借助NIRCam的波长覆盖范围和灵敏度，这种技术提供了一种高效的工具，可以搜索到大量这种罕见的星系。 <div>
Substantial populations of massive quiescent galaxies at z ≥ 3 challenge our understanding of rapid galaxy growth and quenching over short timescales. In order to piece together this evolutionary puzzle, more statistical samples of these objects are required. Established techniques for identifying massive quiescent galaxies are increasingly inefficient and unconstrained at z > 3. As a result, studies report that as much as 70% of quiescent galaxies at z > 3 may be missed from existing surveys. In this work, we propose a new empirical color selection technique designed to select massive quiescent galaxies at 3 ≲ z ≲ 6 using JWST NIRCam imaging data. We use empirically constrained galaxy spectral energy distribution (SED) templates to define a region in the F277W − F444W versus F150W − F277W color plane that captures quiescent galaxies at z > 3. We apply these color selection criteria to the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) Survey and use SED fitting on sources in the region to identify 44 candidate z ≳ 3 quiescent galaxies. Over half of these sources are newly discovered and, on average, exhibit specific star formation rates of poststarburst galaxies. Most of these sources would not be discovered using canonical UVJ diagrams. We derive volume density estimates of n ∼ 1–4 × 10−5 Mpc−3 at 3 < z < 5, finding excellent agreement with existing reports on similar populations in the CEERS field. Thanks to NIRCam’s wavelength coverage and sensitivity, this technique provides an efficient tool to search for large samples of these rare galaxies.

总结: 
gamma-ray bursts 研究者对21个Fermi GRBs进行了系统的分析，发现几乎所有的precursors和主爆发都表现出热组分，并且它们的能谱指数存在相关演化。此外，他们也发现大部分的情况下precursors和主爆发有着类似的发射特性和光谱特征，并且它们在Amati关系和Yonetoku关系中处于相似的分布区域。因此，研究结论认为主爆发是precursors的延续，可能有着共同的物理起源。 <div>
There is no consensus yet on whether the precursor and the main burst of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have the same origin, and their jet composition is still unclear. In order to further investigate this issue, we systematically search 21 Fermi GRBs with both a precursor and main burst for spectral analysis. We first perform Bayesian time-resolved spectral analysis and find that almost all the precursors and the main bursts (94.4%) exhibit thermal components and that the vast majority of them have a low-energy spectral index (α; 72.2%) that exceeds the limit of synchrotron radiation. We then analyze the evolution and correlation of the spectral parameters and find that approximately half of the α (50%) of the precursors and the main bursts evolve in a similar pattern, while peak energy (Ep; 55.6%) behaves similarly, and their evolution is mainly characterized by flux tracking; for the α−F (the flux) relation, more than half of the precursors and the main bursts (61.1%) exhibit roughly similar patterns; the Ep−F relation in both the precursor and main burst (100%) exhibits a positive correlation of at least moderate strength. Next, we constrain the outflow properties of the precursors and the main bursts and find that most of them exhibit typical properties of photosphere radiation. Finally, we compare the time-integrated spectra of the precursors and the main bursts and find that nearly all of them are located in similar regions of the Amati relation and follow the Yonetoku relation. Therefore, we conclude that main bursts are continuations of precursors and may share a common physical origin.

总结: <br /><br />这篇文章主要介绍了太阳大气中的磁场几何以及投影效应对波的传播路径进行精确映射的困难。研究人员利用Dunn太阳望远镜的干涉双向光谱仪，对一个太阳黑子进行了高分辨率的Hα光谱扫描，并对一个突出的超边暗纤维的横向振荡进行了深入研究。他们发现这个纤维在椭圆偏振下进行传播的扭曲振荡，振荡周期为430秒，相速度为69±4 km/s。随着振荡传播离开太阳黑子，能量逐渐耗散，导致能量流量呈现约460 W m-2/Mm的速率减小。另外，研究还发现Hα线宽随着距离太阳黑子的增加而增加，可能是温度的迹象。虽然研究了不同线性和非线性机制对波能量流的耗散，但它们的简单叠加效果无法解释观察到的耗散长度。研究人员预计，本文展示的重投影方法将有助于未来对纤维结构中横向波的研究。 <div>
The magnetic geometry of the solar atmosphere, combined with projection effects, makes it difficult to accurately map the propagation of ubiquitous waves in fibrillar structures. These waves are of interest due to their ability to carry energy into the chromosphere and deposit it through damping and dissipation mechanisms. To this end, the Interferometric Bidimensional Spectrometer at the Dunn Solar Telescope was employed to capture high-resolution Hα spectral scans of a sunspot, with the transverse oscillations of a prominent superpenumbral fibril examined in depth. The oscillations are reprojected from the helioprojective Cartesian frame to a new frame of reference oriented along the average fibril axis through nonlinear force-free field extrapolations. The fibril was found to be carrying an elliptically polarized, propagating kink oscillation with a period of 430 s and a phase velocity of 69 ± 4 km s−1. The oscillation is damped as it propagates away from the sunspot with a damping length of approximately 9.2 Mm, resulting in the energy flux decreasing at a rate on the order of 460 W m−2/Mm. The Hα line width is examined and found to increase with distance from the sunspot, a potential sign of a temperature increase. Different linear and nonlinear mechanisms are investigated for the damping of the wave energy flux, but a first-order approximation of their combined effects is insufficient to recreate the observed damping length by a factor of at least 3. It is anticipated that the reprojection methodology demonstrated in this study will aid with future studies of transverse waves within fibrillar structures.

<div> NGC 777, 热核, Chandra X射线, 恒星系核, 辐射天体<br />
总结:<br />
NGC 777是一个椭圆星系核的研究对象，其温度分布与辐射天体活动关联紧密。通过深度的Chandra X射线观测和uGMRT 400 MHz的射电成像，研究发现其核区存在热核现象，同时发现周围存在微弱的射电辐射。通过观测结果推测，该热核可能是由于活动星系核喷流作用或者来自老的射电喷流残留的粒子加热导致。同时，通过X射线亮度的减小，可以说明可能存在喷流在10-20kpc范围内的扩展，此喷流可能已经持续至少240百万年，可以平衡辐射冷却效应。 <div>
NGC 777 provides an example of a phenomenon observed in some group-central ellipticals, in which the temperature profile shows a central peak, despite the short central cooling time of the intragroup medium. We use deep Chandra X-ray observations of the galaxy, supported by uGMRT 400 MHz radio imaging, to investigate the origin of this hot core. We confirm the centrally peaked temperature profile and find that the entropy and cooling time both monotonically decline to low values (2.62 keV cm2 and Myr, respectively) in the central ∼700 pc. Faint diffuse radio emission surrounds the nuclear point source, with no clear jets or lobes but extending to ∼10 kpc on the northwest–southeast axis. This alignment and extent agree well with a previously identified filamentary Hα + [N ii] nebula. While cavities are not firmly detected, we see X-ray surface brightness decrements on the same axis at 10–20 kpc radii, which are consistent with the intragroup medium having been pushed aside by expanding radio lobes. Any such outburst must have occurred long enough ago for lobe emission to have faded below detectability. Cavities on this scale would be capable of balancing radiative cooling for at least ∼240 Myr. We consider possible causes of the centrally peaked temperature profile, including gravitational heating of gas as the halo relaxes after a period of active galactic nucleus jet activity, and heating by particles leaking from the remnant relativistic plasma of the old radio jets.

这篇文章分析了最近詹姆斯·韦伯太空望远镜的数据，并发现了红移z≳6时存在大质量红色星系，这与标准宇宙学模型（ΛCDM）难以理解。研究使用恒星群体模型拟合光学和红外光度数据，发现这些星系的平均年龄大约在0.9到2.4亿年之间，与标准宇宙模型的预期不符。结果可能表明需要考虑非标准的宇宙学模型。但需要进一步研究来证实观测到的红移高于ΛCDM宇宙学的星系的存在。 <br /><br />总结: 高红移星系的存在挑战了标准宇宙学模型，可能需要非标准宇宙学模型来解释。必须进行进一步研究以验证这一发现。 <div>
Recent James Webb Space Telescope data analyses have shown that massive red galaxies existed at redshifts z ≳ 6, a discovery that is difficult to understand in the context of standard cosmology (ΛCDM). Here, we analyze these observations more deeply, by fitting a stellar population model to the optical and near-infrared photometric data. These fits include a main stellar population in addition to a residual younger population and with the same extinction for both (a lower extinction for the younger population is unphysical). Extra stellar populations or the inclusion of an active galactic nucleus component do not significantly improve the fits. These galaxies are being viewed at very high redshifts, with an average 〈z〉 ≈ 8.2, when the ΛCDM Universe was only ≈600 Myr old. This result conflicts with the inferred ages of these galaxies, however, which were on average between 0.9 and 2.4 Gyr old within a 95% confidence level. Given the sequence of star formation and galaxy assembly in the standard model, these galaxies should instead be even younger than 290 Myr on average, for which our analysis assigns a probability of only <3 × 10−4 (≳3.6σ tension). This outcome may indicate the need to consider nonstandard cosmologies. Nevertheless, our conclusions result from several approximations in stellar astrophysics and extinction, so they should be taken with a grain of salt. Further research is necessary to corroborate the possible existence of galaxies older than the ΛCDM Universe at their observed redshifts.

<br />总结:<br />这篇文章讨论了在行星质量物体和棕矮星处于L/T过渡阶段时光度的变化情况，研究发现主要是由于大气波动导致的。通过多波段的近红外光度计测量了SIMP0136的光度变化，发现波动模型更适用于所有四个波段。此外，还发现了H − K和J − H颜色时间序列之间存在93.°8 ± 7.°4的相位差，表明SIMP0136的大气结构复杂。通过相关颜色变化的分析和模型验证，得出了波动引起的云的变化和破裂，类似于木星的大气情况。 <div>
Planetary-mass objects and brown dwarfs at the transition (Teff ∼ 1300 K) from relatively red L dwarfs to bluer mid-T dwarfs show enhanced spectrophotometric variability. Multiepoch observations support atmospheric planetary-scale (Kelvin or Rossby) waves as the primary source of this variability; however, large spots associated with the precipitation of silicate and metal clouds have also been theorized and suggested by Doppler imaging. We applied both wave and spotted models to fit near-infrared (NIR), multiband (Y/J/H/K) photometry of SIMP J013656.5+093347 (hereafter SIMP0136) collected at the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope using the Wide-field InfraRed Camera. SIMP0136 is a planetary-mass object (12.7 ± 1.0 MJ) at the L/T transition (T2 ± 0.5) known to exhibit light-curve evolution over multiple rotational periods. We measure the maximum peak-to-peak variability of 6.17% ± 0.46%, 6.45% ± 0.33%, 6.51% ± 0.42%, and 4.33% ± 0.38% in the Y, J, H, and K bands, respectively, and find evidence that wave models are preferred for all four NIR bands. Furthermore, we determine that the spot size necessary to reproduce the observed variations is larger than the Rossby deformation radius and Rhines scale, which is unphysical. Through the correlation between light curves produced by the waves and associated color variability, we find evidence of planetary-scale, wave-induced cloud modulation and breakup, similar to Jupiter’s atmosphere and supported by general circulation models. We also detect a 93.°8 ± 7.°4 (12.7σ) phase shift between the H − K and J − H color time series, providing evidence for complex vertical cloud structure in SIMP0136's atmosphere.

<div> 关键词: UV-derived star formation rates, 7.7 μm polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon luminosities, SED modeling, JWST/MIRI, galaxies at z ∼ 0–2

总结:
本研究测试了恒星形成率（SFRs）与7.7微米多环芳烃发光在z∼0–2星系中的关系。通过利用来自哈勃太空望远镜、CFHT、JWST、Spitzer和Herschel的多波段光度测量数据，对CEERS调查中的星系进行了谱能分布（SED）建模。研究测量了经过尘埃校正的远紫外线（FUV）光度LFUV和UV导出的SFR。然后使用JWST/MIRI 7.7-21微米数据对SED模型进行拟合，得到了其余波段7.7微米光度L770。研究发现L770与LFUV之间存在相关性。对于低金属含量、较低尘埃遮挡和受到演化恒星群体主导的星系，L770与这一关系有所偏离。研究得出了L770的“单波长”SFR校准，其与模型估计的SFRs的离散度（σΔSFR）为0.24 dex。此外，还得出了FUV光度（未经尘埃校正）和余波段7.7微米光度的线性组合的“多波段”校准，其离散度σΔSFR = 0.21 dex。这些结果表明，JWST/MIRI约束的余波段7.7微米发射对于远处星系的SFR是一个可靠的追踪器，其精度为0.21-0.24 dex，前提是星系以中等到高水平的遮挡和金属含量主导星形成。 <div>
We test the relationship between UV-derived star formation rates (SFRs) and the 7.7 μm polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon luminosities from the integrated emission of galaxies at z ∼ 0–2. We utilize multiband photometry covering 0.2–160 μm from the Hubble Space Telescope, CFHT, JWST, Spitzer, and Herschel for galaxies in the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) Survey. We perform spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling of these data to measure dust-corrected far-UV (FUV) luminosities, LFUV, and UV-derived SFRs. We then fit SED models to the JWST/MIRI 7.7–21 μm CEERS data to derive rest-frame 7.7 μm luminosities, L770, using the average flux density in the rest-frame MIRI F770W bandpass. We observe a correlation between L770 and LFUV, where . L770 diverges from this relation for galaxies at lower metallicities, lower dust obscuration, and for galaxies dominated by evolved stellar populations. We derive a “single-wavelength” SFR calibration for L770 that has a scatter from model estimated SFRs (σΔSFR) of 0.24 dex. We derive a “multiwavelength” calibration for the linear combination of the observed FUV luminosity (uncorrected for dust) and the rest-frame 7.7 μm luminosity, which has a scatter of σΔSFR = 0.21 dex. The relatively small decrease in σ suggests this is near the systematic accuracy of the total SFRs using either calibration. These results demonstrate that the rest-frame 7.7 μm emission constrained by JWST/MIRI is a tracer of the SFR for distant galaxies to this accuracy, provided the galaxies are dominated by star formation with moderate-to-high levels of attenuation and metallicity.

<title>A Protocluster of Massive Quiescent Galaxies at z = 4</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report on discovery of a concentration of massive quiescent galaxies located at z = 4. The concentration is first identified using high-quality photometric redshifts based on deep, multiband data in Subaru/XMM-Newton Deep Field. Follow-up near-infrared spectroscopic observations with MOSFIRE on Keck confirm a massive (∼1011M⊙) quiescent galaxy at z = 3.99. Our spectral energy distribution analyses reveal that the galaxy experienced an episode of starburst about 500 Myr prior to the observed epoch, followed by rapid quenching. Since its spectrum is sufficiently good to measure the stellar velocity dispersion, we infer its dynamical mass and find that it is consistent with its stellar mass. The galaxy is surrounded by four massive (>1010M⊙) quiescent galaxies on a ∼1 physical Mpc scale, all of which are consistent with being located at the same redshift based on high-accuracy spectrophotometric redshifts. This is likely a (proto)cluster dominated by quiescent galaxies, the first of the kind reported at such a high redshift as z = 4. Interestingly, it is in a large-scale structure revealed by spectroscopic redshifts from VANDELS. Furthermore, it also exhibits a red sequence, adding further support to the physical concentration of the galaxies. We find no such concentration in the Illustris-TNG300 simulation; it may be that the cluster is such a rare system that the simulation box is not sufficiently large to reproduce it. The total halo mass of the quiescent galaxies is ∼1013M⊙, suggesting that they form a group-sized halo once they collapse together. We discuss the implications of our findings for the quenching physics and conclude with future prospects.

<title>Modeling the Propagation of Slow Magnetoacoustic Waves in a Multistranded Coronal Loop</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We study the propagation properties of slow magnetoacoustic waves in a multithermal coronal loop using a 3D MHD model, for the first time. A bundle of 33 vertical cylinders, each of 100 km radius, randomly distributed over a circular region of radius 1 Mm, is considered to represent the coronal loop. The slow waves are driven by perturbing the vertical velocity (vz) at the base of the loop. We apply forward modeling to the simulation results to generate synthetic images in the coronal channels of the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly. Furthermore, we add appropriate data noise to enable direct comparison with the real observations. It is found that the synthetic images at the instrument resolution show noncospatial features in different temperature channels in agreement with previous observations. Time–distance maps are constructed from the synthetic data to study the propagation properties. The results indicate that the oscillations are only visible in specific channels, depending on the temperature range of the plasma existing within the loop. Additionally, the propagation speed of slow waves is also found to be sensitive to the available temperature range. Overall, we propose that the cross-field thermal properties of coronal structures can be inferred using a combination of numerical simulations and observations of slow magnetoacoustic waves.

<div> UV Ceti, radio spectrum, magnetic field, nonthermal particle acceleration, dynamo processes
总结:
UV Ceti是一个近邻（2.7 pc）的双星系统，其大规模磁场导致其与BL Ceti有非常不同的磁活动特征。文章通过对UV Ceti的射电频谱进行多时期的观测，并展示了类似太阳冕层活动的耀斑辐射、类似行星磁层的极光辐射，以及缓慢变化的持续辐射。射电观测是探究UV Ceti大规模磁场在非热粒子加速中的作用的有效手段。观测结果显示所有波段均存在时间变化，并且在40 GHz以下存在循环偏振度的旋转调制迹象。持续辐射在1到105 GHz范围内基本稳定，排除了来自各向同性螺旋角分布的电子的光厚辐射或光薄吉罗同步辐射机制。文章讨论了类似于木星辐射带的辐射机制可能性。 <div>
BL and UV Ceti are a nearby (2.7 pc) binary system with similar masses, spectral types, and rapid rotation rates, but very different magnetic activity. UV Ceti’s much stronger large-scale magnetic field may cause this difference, highlighting key unanswered questions about dynamo processes in fully convective objects. Here, we present multiepoch characterization of the radio spectrum of UV Ceti spanning 1–105 GHz, exhibiting flared emission similar to coronal activity, auroral-like emission analogous to planetary magnetospheres, and slowly varying persistent emission. Radio observations are a powerful means to probe the role that the large-scale magnetic field of UV Ceti has in nonthermal particle acceleration because radio-frequency phenomena result from both the activity of small-scale field features as well as large-scale auroral current systems. We find temporal variability at all bands observed, and a hint of rotational modulation in the degree of circular polarization up to 40 GHz. The persistent component of the emission is fairly constant from 1 to 105 GHz, making optically thick emission or optically thin gyrosynchrotron from electrons with an isotropic pitch angle distribution unlikely. We discuss the possibility of emission mechanisms analogous to Jupiter’s radiation belts.

该研究对YZ Ret古典新星进行了研究，发现在喷发后77天和115天分别观测到了两个高分辨率的X射线光栅谱。这两个谱中均显示出蓝移速度为-1500 km s-1的发射线，其宽度为500 km s-1。研究结果表明，这两个谱均可以被约70eV的碰撞电离等离子体所描述，并且在两次观测之间减弱了约40倍。此外，谱中还观测到了C+4、C+5和N+5的窄辐射复合连续谱，表明热离子化等离子体与约2eV的冷电子发生相互作用。研究还发现C+4的高n-Rydberg系列异常明亮，可通过连续谱降低来测量电子密度，这与He样N+5的密度诊断结果相吻合。研究认为这些高n能级的高密度是迄今为止在天体物理离子化等离子体中发生带中子氢的最好证据。此外，尽管密度高且通量减少，但令人惊讶的是，在38天后速度和等离子体温度仍然相同，这是持续加热的证据。研究提出这种加热是由于新星喷射物中的反冲冲击产生了一个薄的X射线壳。窄的辐射复合连续谱和带中子氢的反应被归因于与冷气体的直接混合，它们从冲击波前或通过接触不连续面超越了热等离子体。 <br /><br />总结: 该研究对新星YZ Ret进行了X射线谱的观测，发现了碰撞电离等离子体的特征，以及与冷电子和中子氢的互动，揭示了新星喷发后的物理过程。 <div>
The origin of bright X-ray emission lines that appear late in a nova eruption remains largely a puzzle. We present two high-resolution X-ray grating spectra of the classical nova YZ Ret, observed 77 and 115 days post-eruption, using XMM-Newton and Chandra, respectively. Both spectra feature resolved emission lines blueshifted by v = –1500 km s−1 and broadened by σv = 500 km s−1. The two spectra are well described by a collisionally ionized plasma of kT ∼ 70 eV that dimmed by a factor of ∼40 between the two exposures. The spectra also show narrow radiative recombination continua (RRCs) of C+4, C+5, and N+5, indicating the interaction of the hot ionized plasma with cold electrons of kT ∼ 2 eV. The high-n Rydberg series of C+4 is anomalously bright, allowing us to measure the electron density through continuum lowering, which is in agreement with the He-like N+5 density diagnostic of ne = (1.7 ± 0.4) × 1011 cm−3. The high population of these high-n levels constitutes the best evidence to date of charge exchange (CX) with neutral H in an astrophysical ionized plasma. The remarkable fact that the velocity and plasma temperature are the same after 38 days, despite the high density and decreasing flux, is evidence for ongoing heating. We suggest the heating is due to a reverse shock in the nova ejecta, which forms a thin X-ray shell. The narrow RRCs and CX are attributed to direct mixing with cold gas, which overtakes the hot plasma either from the shock front or through the contact discontinuity.

It was recently proposed that the electric field oscillation as a result of self-consistent e± pair production may be the source of coherent radio emission from pulsars. Direct particle-in-cell simulations of this process have shown that the screening of the parallel electric field by this pair cascade manifests as a limit cycle, as the parallel electric field is recurrently induced when pairs produced in the cascade escape from the gap region. In this work, we develop a simplified time-dependent kinetic model of e± pair cascades in pulsar magnetospheres that can reproduce the limit-cycle behavior of pair production and electric field screening. This model includes the effects of a magnetospheric current, the escape of e±, as well as the dynamic dependence of pair production rate on the plasma density and energy. Using this simple theoretical model, we show that the power spectrum of electric field oscillations averaged over many limit cycles is compatible with the observed pulsar radio spectrum.

太阳耀斑中的丝带前缘是耀斑能量沉积到色球层的初始迹象，具有较长的持续时间。研究表明，在注入非热电子能通量很低的情况下，丝带前缘的特性会持续更长时间。在色球层变得足够炽热和密集时，丝带前缘会转变为常规明亮的丝带。因此，丝带前缘的持续时间是衡量相对较低能通量的高能电子在耀斑能通量较大的轰击之前沉积到色球层的持续时间。 <div>
Solar flare ribbon fronts appear ahead of the bright structures that normally characterize solar flares, and can persist for an extended period of time in spatially localized patches before transitioning to “regular” bright ribbons. They likely represent the initial onset of flare energy deposition into the chromosphere. Chromospheric spectra (e.g., He i 10830 Å and the Mg ii near-UV lines) from ribbon fronts exhibit properties rather different to typical flare behavior. In prior numerical modeling efforts we were unable to reproduce the long lifetime of ribbon fronts. Here we present a series of numerical experiments that are rather simple but which have important implications. We inject a very low flux of nonthermal electrons (F = 5 × 108 erg s−1 cm−2) into the chromosphere for 100 s before ramping up to standard flare energy fluxes (F = 1010−11 erg s−1 cm−2). Synthetic spectra not only sustained their ribbon-front-like properties for significantly longer: in the case of harder nonthermal electron spectra, the ribbon front behavior persisted for the entirety of this weak-heating phase. Lengthening or shortening the duration of the weak-heating phase commensurately lengthened or shortened the ribbon front lifetimes. Ribbon fronts transitioned to regular bright ribbons when the upper chromosphere became sufficiently hot and dense, which happened faster for softer nonthermal electron spectra. Thus, the lifetime of flare ribbon fronts are a direct measure of the duration over which a relatively low flux of high-energy electrons precipitates to the chromosphere prior to the bombardment of a much larger energy flux.

Recent high-resolution and sensitivity Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations have unveiled the carbon isotope ratios (12C/13C) of complex organic molecules (COMs) in a low-mass protostellar source. To understand the 12C/13C ratios of COMs, we investigated the carbon isotope fractionation of COMs from prestellar cores to protostellar cores with a gas-grain chemical network model. We confirmed that the 12C/13C ratios of small molecules are bimodal in the prestellar phase: CO and species formed from CO (e.g., CH3OH) are slightly enriched in 13C compared to the local interstellar medium (by ∼10%), while those from C and C+ are depleted in 13C owing to isotope exchange reactions. COMs are mainly formed on the grain surface and in the hot gas (> 100 K) in the protostellar phase. The 12C/13C ratios of COMs depend on which molecules the COMs are formed from. In our base model, some COMs in the hot gas are depleted in 13C compared to the observations. Thus, we additionally incorporate reactions between gaseous atomic C and H2O ice or CO ice on the grain surface to form H2CO ice or C2O ice, as suggested by recent laboratory studies. The direct C-atom addition reactions open pathways to form 13C-enriched COMs from atomic C and CO ice. We find that these direct C-atom addition reactions mitigate 13C-depletion of COMs, and the model with the direct C-atom addition reactions better reproduces the observations than our base model. We also discuss the impact of the cosmic-ray ionization rate on the 12C/13C ratio of COMs.

Effective temperatures, surface gravities, and iron abundances were derived for 109 stars observed by the K2 mission using equivalent width measurements of Fe i and Fe ii lines. Calculations were carried out in local thermodynamic equilibrium using Kurucz model atmospheres. Stellar masses and radii were derived by combining the stellar parameters with Gaia Data Release 3 parallaxes, V magnitudes, and isochrones. The derived stellar and planetary radii have a median internal precision of 1.8% and 2.3%, respectively. The radius gap near Rplanet ∼ 1.9 R⊕ was detected in this K2 sample. Chromospheric activity was measured from the Ca ii H and K lines using the values of , which were investigated as a function of stellar rotational period (Prot), and we found that chromospheric activity decreases with increasing Prot, although there is a large scatter in (∼0.5) for a given Prot. The activity levels in this sample reveal a paucity of F and G dwarfs with intermediate activity levels (the Vaughan–Preston gap). The effect that stellar activity might have on the derivation of stellar parameters was investigated by including magnetically sensitive Fe i lines in the analysis and we find no significant differences between parameters with and without magnetically sensitive lines, although the more active stars ( ) exhibit a larger scatter in the differences in Teff and [Fe/H].

<div> 超新星、宿主星系、光度函数、恒星质量函数、星体形成率<br />
SN主机星系的光度函数和恒星质量函数与普通场星系不同。星体形成星系主导了SN Ia主机质量函数的低质量端，而被动星系主导了高质量端。CC SNe主要由星体形成星系托管。中等质量主机产生的CC SNe具有最高效率，而随着主机质量的增加，产生SNe Ia的效率单调增加。此外，根据质量函数推导出了伪质量归一化SN速率（pSNuM）。结果表明，pSNuMIa的星体形成成分对于质量的变化不太敏感，而CC速率与星体形成速率成正比。 <br /><br />总结: <br />超新星的宿主星系具有不同于普通星系的光度函数和恒星质量函数。星体形成星系托管了大部分CC SNe，并在SN Ia的质量函数中占主导地位。此外，质量函数的研究还揭示了伪质量归一化SN速率的行为。 <div>
We present the luminosity functions and stellar mass functions of supernova (SN) host galaxies and test if they differ from the functions of normal field galaxies. We utilize homogeneous samples consisting of 273 SNe Ia (z ≤ 0.3) and 44 core-collapse (CC) SNe (z ≤ 0.1) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey II Supernova Survey and the high-signal-to-noise-ratio photometry of galaxies from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program. SN hosts are classified into star-forming and passive galaxy groups based on the spectral energy distribution fitting. We find that the SN host luminosity functions and stellar mass functions deviate from those of normal field galaxies. Star-forming galaxies dominate the low-mass end of the SN Ia host mass function, while passive galaxies dominate the high-mass end. CC SNe are predominantly hosted by star-forming galaxies. In addition, intermediate-mass hosts produce CC SNe with the highest efficiency, while the efficiency of producing SNe Ia monotonically increases as the hosts become more massive. Furthermore, we derive the pseudo mass normalized SN rates (pSNuM) based on the mass functions. We find that the star-forming component of pSNuMIa is less sensitive to the changes in stellar mass, in comparison with the total rate. The behavior of pSNuMCC suggests that the CC rate is proportional to the star-forming rate.

<br />
SMC的小麦哲伦星云在紫外光尘埃消光曲线上显示出很大的变化，范围从银河系类似的曲线到明显更陡的曲线，没有可检测到的2175 Å峰。我们通过32条SMC视线的哈勃空间望远镜和IUE光谱的OB星测量了紫外消光曲线，其中8条曲线先前已经发表。我们发现有16条缺少2175 Å峰的视线，4条有可检测到2175 Å峰的视线，2条具有相当平坦的紫外消光和弱/缺失的2175 Å峰，以及由于SMC尘埃柱的低而不可靠的10条曲线。我们的拓展样本显示，具有2175 Å峰和无2175 Å峰的视线分布于整个SMC，而不限于特定区域。缺少2175 Å峰的16条视线的平均消光曲线与以前基于四条视线的平均值非常相似。我们发现尘埃柱和2175 Å峰的强度之间没有相关性。我们检验了2175 Å峰是否源自负责中红外碳质（多环芳烃）发射特征的尘埃颗粒，发现它们相关，证实了最近在银河系的研究结果。总的来说，紫外消光的斜率随着2175 Å峰和远紫外曲线的非线性增加而增加。最后，紫外斜率与N(H i)/A(V)呈正相关，而2175 Å峰和非线性远紫外曲线的振幅与N(H i)/A(V)呈负相关。

The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) shows a large variation in ultraviolet (UV) dust extinction curves, ranging from Milky Way (MW) like to significantly steeper curves with no detectable 2175 Å bump. This result is based on a sample of only nine sight lines. From Hubble Space Telescope Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph and IUE spectra of OB stars, we have measured UV extinction curves along 32 SMC sight lines where eight of these curves were published previously. We find 16 sight lines with steep extinction with no detectable 2175 Å bump, four sight lines with MW-like extinction with a detectable 2175 Å bump, two sight lines with fairly flat UV extinction and weak/absent 2175 Å bumps, and 10 sight lines with unreliable curves due to low SMC dust columns. Our expanded sample shows that the sight lines with and without the 2175 Å bump are located throughout the SMC and not limited to specific regions. The average extinction curve of the 16 bump-less sight lines is very similar to the previous average based on four sight lines. We find no correlation between dust column and the strength of the 2175 Å bump. We test the hypothesis that the 2175 Å bump is due to the same dust grains that are responsible for the mid-infrared carbonaceous (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) emission features and find they are correlated, confirming recent work in the MW. Overall, the slope of the UV extinction increases as the amplitudes of the 2175 Å bump and far-ultraviolet curvature decrease. Finally, the UV slope is correlated with N(H i)/A(V) and the 2175 Å bump and nonlinear far-ultraviolet rise amplitudes are anticorrelated with N(H i)/A(V).

We present the first results from the Web Epoch of Reionization Lyα Survey (WERLS), a spectroscopic survey of Lyα emission using Keck I/MOSFIRE and LRIS. WERLS targets bright (J < 26) galaxy candidates with photometric redshifts of 5.5 ≲ z ≲ 8 selected from pre-JWST imaging embedded in the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) within three JWST deep fields: CEERS, PRIMER, and COSMOS-Web. Here, we report 11 z ∼ 7–8 Lyα emitters (LAEs; three secure and eight tentative candidates) detected in the first five nights of WERLS MOSFIRE data. We estimate our observed LAE yield is ∼13%, which is broadly consistent with expectations assuming some loss from redshift uncertainty, contamination from sky OH lines, and that the Universe is approximately half-ionized at this epoch, whereby observable Lyα emission is unlikely for galaxies embedded in a neutral intergalactic medium. Our targets are selected to be UV-bright, and span a range of absolute UV magnitudes with −23.1 < MUV < −19.8. With two LAEs detected at z = 7.68, we also consider the possibility of an ionized bubble at this redshift. Future synergistic Keck+JWST efforts will provide a powerful tool for pinpointing beacons of reionization and mapping the large-scale distribution of mass relative to the ionization state of the Universe.

本研究通过对中国空间测量望远镜的宇宙剪切和大型同步巡天望远镜的超新星宇宙放大进行自相关和交叉相关的研究，旨在确定通过添加放大数据，能够在多大程度上消除宇宙剪切测量中的系统偏差。通过基于不同层次分析的相关性生成模拟的剪切/放大地图，得到了校正的功率谱。采用马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛技术拟合理论模型，研究了宇宙学和没用参数的限制。研究发现，仅使用宇宙剪切数据时，σ8和固有对齐模型参数存在1σ的偏差。但通过添加放大数据，可以完全消除这些偏差。<br /><br /> <div>
Cosmic shear and cosmic magnification reflect the same gravitational lensing field. Each of these two probes are affected by different systematics. We study the auto- and cross-correlations of cosmic shear from the China Space Survey Telescope and cosmic magnification of supernovae from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope. We want to determine to what extent, by adding the magnification data, we can remove the systematic bias in cosmic shear measurements. We generate mock shear/magnification maps based on the correlation between different tomographic bins. After obtaining the corrected power spectra, we adopt the Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique to fit the theoretical models and investigate the constraints on the cosmological and nuisance parameters. We find that, with only the cosmic shear data, there are 1σ biases in the σ8 and intrinsic alignment model parameters. By adding the magnification data, we are able to remove these biases perfectly.

总结：<br /><br />本文报告了在M81*和NGC 7213两个典型的低光度活动星系核中，探测到了高离化铁发射线的Doppler位移，并进一步确认了软X射线谱中的蓝移H-like O/Ne发射线。这些线被解释为与额外的具有几千千米每秒速度和较低温度的流组件相关联。经过详细的数值模拟，发现新增检测到的蓝移发射线应来自被热风冲击加热的核周气体。热风可以在颗粒状核周气体上提供比中央黑洞引力更大的冲压力，有效阻碍了黑洞对气体的吸积。这些结果为热AGN风的能量和动量反馈提供了强有力的证据。 <div>
Supermassive black holes in galaxies spend the majority of their lifetime in the low-luminosity regime, powered by hot accretion flow. Strong winds launched from the hot accretion flow have the potential to play an important role in active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback. Direct observational evidence for these hot winds with temperatures around 10 keV, has been obtained through the detection of highly ionized iron emission lines with Doppler shifts in two prototypical low-luminosity AGNs, namely M81* and NGC 7213. In this work, we further identify blueshifted H-like O/Ne emission lines in the soft X-ray spectra of these two sources. These lines are interpreted to be associated with additional outflowing components possessing velocity around several 103 km s−1 and lower temperature (∼0.2–0.4 keV). Blueshifted velocity and the X-ray intensity of these additional outflowing components are hard to explain by previously detected hot wind freely propagating to larger radii. Through detailed numerical simulations, we find the newly detected blueshifted emission lines would come from circumnuclear gas shock-heated by the hot wind instead. Hot wind can provide a larger ram pressure force on the clumpy circumnuclear gas than the gravitational force from the central black hole, effectively impeding the black hole accretion of gas. Our results provide strong evidence for the energy and momentum feedback by the hot AGN wind.

超级地球和次海王星是两种亚类的小型外行星。研究发现，大部分超级地球通过热驱动风失去了其原初积聚的氢气大气，并且氢气会被有效地嵌入到内部，氧化铁并产生约0.5%至1.0%的水。由于大气不断被加工和化学平衡，尽管按摩尔比例氢气仍然占主导地位，按质量比例而言却变成了以蒸汽为主导。这可能可以通过JWST观测到具有过渡性质量的行星。有效地将氢气嵌入到内部的一个主要效果是使得整体内部密度低于地球。我们预测1M⊕行星的整体密度约为5.0 g cm−3，这与高精度的质量测量以及大气逸出模型的族群级推断分析是一致的。 
<br /><br />总结: 本文研究了超级地球和次海王星的化学平衡，发现大部分超级地球通过热驱动风失去了氢气大气，并且氢气会被有效地嵌入到内部，导致产生约0.5%至1.0%的水。大气通过加工和化学平衡持续演变，并且氢气逐渐被嵌入到内部。根据预测，这种有效的氢气嵌入会使得超级地球整体内部密度低于地球。 <div>
Small, close-in exoplanets are divided into two subpopulations: super-Earths and sub-Neptunes. Most super-Earths are thought to have lost their primordially accreted hydrogen-dominated atmospheres via thermally driven winds. We consider the global chemical equilibrium of super-Earths and the lasting impacts of their fleeting hydrogen atmospheres. We find that hydrogen is efficiently sequestered into the interior, oxidizing iron and endogenously producing ∼0.5%–1.0% water by mass. As the atmospheres of super-Earths are continuously sculpted by mass loss and chemical equilibration, they remain hydrogen-dominated by mole (number) fraction but become steam-dominated by mass, which may be observable with JWST for planets transitioning across the radius valley. One of the main effects of efficient sequestration of hydrogen into the interior is to produce an underdense bulk interior compared to that of Earth. We predict bulk densities of super-Earths to be ∼5.0 g cm−3 for a 1M⊕ planet, which is consistent with high-precision mass measurements and also population-level inference analyses from atmospheric escape models.

总结: 这项研究强调了暗物质晕的角动量分布对盘状星系中棒状结构的形成和演化具有重要作用。通过N体模拟实验发现，角动量分布连续的暗物质晕会增强棒状结构的强度，而分布不连续的暗物质晕会减弱棒状结构的强度。这一发现有助于解决近期文献中关于高自旋暗物质晕中棒状结构演化的矛盾结果。因此，该研究显示了盘状星系系统初始条件设置的重要性，特别是暗物质晕角动量分布的不连续性，对棒状结构的演化产生了重要影响。 <div>
The dark matter halo properties, for example, mass, spin, and concentration, play a significant role in the formation and evolution of bars in disk galaxies. This study highlights the importance of a new parameter: the dark matter halo angular momentum distribution in the disk’s central region. We experiment with N-body galaxy models having a disk and dark matter similar to Milky Way–type galaxies. In these models, we vary the discontinuity of the angular momentum distribution of the halo (the total spin is the same for all models). Our N-body experiments suggest that bar forms in all models after a few Gyr of disk evolution. However, in the secular evolution of the bar, as we evolve these models until 9.78 Gyr, the bar gains its strength in the model with the most continuous halo angular momentum distribution, and the bar loses strength for the most discontinuous halo angular momentum distribution. The secular evolution of the bar suggests that box/peanut/x-shaped bulges similar to those found in the Milky Way disk should be more pronounced in halos with continuous halo angular momentum distributions. This study demonstrates the importance of the initial condition setup of galaxy systems, namely the discontinuity in the dark matter halo angular momentum distribution for a given density distribution, on the bar secular evolution in the disk galaxy simulations. Further, this study helps reconcile the conflicting results of bar secular evolution in a high-spinning halo of the recent literature.

We present an implementation of a Bayesian mixture model using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo techniques to search for the spatial separation of Galactic dust populations. Utilizing intensity measurements from the Planck High Frequency Instrument, we apply this model to high-latitude Galactic dust emission. Our analysis reveals a strong preference for a spatially varying two-population dust model over a one-population dust model, when the latter must capture the total variance in the sky. Each dust population is well characterized by a single-component spectral energy distribution (SED) and accommodates small variations. These populations could signify two distinct components or may originate from a one-component model with different temperatures resulting in different SED scalings. While no spatial information is built into the likelihood, our investigation unveils large-scale spatially coherent structures with high significance, pointing to a physical origin for the observed spatial variation. These results are robust to our choice of likelihood and input data. Furthermore, this spatially varying two-population model is the most favored from Bayesian evidence calculations. Incorporating IRAS 100 μm to constrain the Wein side of the blackbody function, we find the dust populations differ at the 2.5σ level in the spectral index (βd) versus temperature (Td) plane. The presence of multiple dust populations has implications for component separation techniques frequently employed in the recovery of the cosmic microwave background.

Magnetic fields in the stellar interiors are key candidates to explain observed core rotation rates inside solar-like stars along their evolution. Recently, asteroseismic estimates of radial magnetic field amplitudes near the hydrogen-burning shell (H-shell) inside about 24 red giants (RGs) have been obtained by measuring frequency splittings from their power spectra. Using general Lorentz-stress (magnetic) kernels, we investigated the potential for detectability of near-surface magnetism in a 1.3 M⊙ star of supersolar metallicity as it evolves from a mid subgiant to a late subgiant into an RG. Based on these sensitivity kernels, we decompose an RG into three zones—deep core, H-shell, and near-surface. The subgiants instead required decomposition into an inner core, an outer core, and a near-surface layer. Additionally, we find that for a low-frequency g-dominated dipolar mode in the presence of a typical stable magnetic field, ∼25% of the frequency shift comes from the H-shell and the remaining from deeper layers. The ratio of the subsurface tangential field to the radial field in the H-burning shell decides if subsurface fields may be potentially detectable. For p-dominated dipole modes close to , this ratio is around two orders of magnitude smaller in subgiant phases than the corresponding RG. Further, with the availability of magnetic kernels, we propose lower limits of field strengths in crucial layers in our stellar model during its evolutionary phases. The theoretical prescription outlined here provides the first formal way to devise inverse problems for stellar magnetism and can be seamlessly employed for slow rotators.

研究团队对 z ∼ 6.6 类星体 J0923+0402 的黑洞驱动流进行了多尺度和多相特征化，并评估了这些气流对冷气体储库的影响。他们发现在约210 pc的尺度上存在一个强劲的电离气流，并且ALMA观测发现了高速度的[C ii]发射，可能与主宇宙体内含的冷中性气体有关，以及一个大小约15 kpc的[C ii]光晕。该研究首次准确限制了离子化和原子中性气体相的气流能量学特征，发现这种特征与高效反馈机制相一致，并且可能存在排出和预防性反馈模式。离子化气流和原子气流的尺度和能量特征表明它们可能与不同的类星体吸积事件相关联。该研究结果表明在 z ≳ 6 处的类星体中存在强烈的黑洞反馈作用，很可能塑造了冷气体储库的性质，直至周银河范围。 <div>
Although the mass growth of supermassive black holes during the epoch of reionization is expected to play a role in shaping the concurrent growth of their host galaxies, observational evidence of feedback at z ≳ 6 is still sparse. We perform the first multiscale and multiphase characterization of black-hole-driven outflows in the z ∼ 6.6 quasar J0923+0402 and assess how these winds impact the cold gas reservoir. We employ the SimBAL spectral synthesis to fit broad absorption line features and find a powerful ionized outflow on a ≲210 pc scale, with a kinetic power ∼2%–100% of the quasar luminosity. Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of [C ii] emission allow us to study the morphology and kinematics of the cold gas. We detect high-velocity [C ii] emission, likely associated with a cold neutral outflow at ∼0.5−2 kpc scale in the host galaxy, and a bright extended [C ii] halo with a size of ∼15 kpc. For the first time at such an early epoch, we accurately constrain the outflow energetics in both the ionized and the atomic neutral gas phases. We find such energetics to be consistent with expectations for an efficient feedback mechanism, and both ejective and preventative feedback modes are likely at play. The scales and energetics of the ionized and atomic outflows suggest that they might be associated with different quasar accretion episodes. The results of this work indicate that strong black hole feedback is occurring in quasars at z ≳ 6 and is likely responsible for shaping the properties of the cold gas reservoir up to circumgalactic scales.

Cholla’s MHD module can perform ≈260 million cell updates per GPU-second on an NVIDIA A100 while using the HLLD Riemann solver and second order reconstruction. The inherently parallel nature of GPUs combined with increased memory in new hardware allows Cholla’s MHD module to perform simulations with resolutions ∼5003 cells on a single high-end GPU (e.g., an NVIDIA A100 with 80 GB of memory). We employ GPU direct Message Passing Interface to attain excellent weak scaling on the exascale supercomputer Frontier, while using 74,088 GPUs and simulating a total grid size of over 7.2 trillion cells. A suite of test problems highlights the accuracy of Cholla’s MHD module and demonstrates that zero magnetic divergence in solutions is maintained to round off error. We also present new testing and CI tools using GoogleTest, GitHub Actions, and Jenkins that have made development more robust and accurate and ensure reliability in the future.

<div> 磁流体动力学, 恒星形成, 盘形成, 磁性制动, 螺旋结构

长期模拟研究恒星和盘的形成过程，采用三维非理想磁流体动力学。模拟从原恒星云开始，经过盘的长期演化，最终距离原恒星形成约1.5x10^5年。主要的磁力制动和磁驱动的流出作用导致主要的吸积阶段盘的大小约为50天文单位并且主要没有次级结构。当流出突破云层时，导致包层质量迅速减少，主要吸积阶段结束。流出在质量吸积率减小的同时也减弱。盘的包层吸积结束后，盘逐渐增长并出现瞬时的螺旋结构，这是由于引力不稳定性导致的。当包层吸积结束后，盘变得稳定并且达到约300天文单位大小。此外，约30%的初始云质量被流出排斥。研究的一个重要发现是，包层消散后，流出出现再次活跃，盘表面有质量排出，这种排出（或盘风）是因为此时磁压显著支配了盘的上下方面的动压和热压。利用估计的角动量通量和质量损失率，估算盘消散的时间尺度约为10^6年。 <br /><br />总结: 本研究使用三维非理想磁流体动力学模拟了恒星和盘的形成过程。模拟表明，磁性制动和磁驱动的流出在主要的吸积阶段起到重要作用。当主要吸积阶段结束后，盘逐渐增长并发展出临时的螺旋结构，最终盘变得稳定并且达到较大规模。研究还发现，包层消散后，盘表面出现质量排出，推测盘的消散时间尺度约为10^6年。 <div>
We perform a long-term simulation of star and disk formation using three-dimensional nonideal magnetohydrodynamics. The simulation starts from a prestellar cloud and proceeds through the long-term evolution of the circumstellar disk until ∼1.5 × 105 yr after protostar formation. The disk has size ≲50 au and little substructure in the main accretion phase because of the action of magnetic braking and the magnetically driven outflow to remove angular momentum. The main accretion phase ends when the outflow breaks out of the cloud, causing the envelope mass to decrease rapidly. The outflow subsequently weakens as the mass accretion rate also weakens. While the envelope-to-disk accretion continues, the disk grows gradually and develops transient spiral structures, due to gravitational instability. When the envelope-to-disk accretion ends, the disk becomes stable and reaches a size ≳300 au. In addition, about 30% of the initial cloud mass has been ejected by the outflow. A significant finding of this work is that after the envelope dissipates a revitalization of the wind occurs, and there is mass ejection from the disk surface that lasts until the end of the simulation. This mass ejection (or disk wind) is generated because the magnetic pressure significantly dominates both the ram pressure and thermal pressure above and below the disk at this stage. Using the angular momentum flux and mass-loss rate estimated from the disk wind, the disk dissipation timescale is estimated to be ∼106 yr.

Due to their inability to self-regulate, ultrafaint dwarfs are sensitive to prescriptions in subgrid physics models that converge and regulate at higher masses. We use high-resolution cosmological simulations to compare the effect of bursty star formation histories (SFHs) on dwarf galaxy structure for two different subgrid supernova (SN) feedback models, superbubble and blastwave, in dwarf galaxies with stellar masses from 5000 < M*/M⊙ < 109. We find that in the “MARVEL-ous Dwarfs” suite both feedback models produce cored galaxies and reproduce observed scaling relations for luminosity, mass, and size. Our sample accurately predicts the average stellar metallicity at higher masses, however low-mass dwarfs are metal poor relative to observed galaxies in the Local Group. We show that continuous bursty star formation and the resulting stellar feedback are able to create dark matter (DM) cores in the higher dwarf galaxy mass regime, while the majority of ultrafaint and classical dwarfs retain cuspy central DM density profiles. We find that the effective core formation peaks at M*/Mhalo ≃ 5 × 10−3 for both feedback models. Both subgrid SN models yield bursty SFHs at higher masses; however, galaxies simulated with superbubble feedback reach maximum mean burstiness values at lower stellar mass fractions relative to blastwave feedback. As a result, core formation may be better predicted by stellar mass fraction than the burstiness of SFHs.

总结:
本研究使用Chintzoglou & Zhang的3D可视化技术结合11504太阳活动区星冕中的局部逆FIP效应观测，确定了磁重连的潜在位置以及在太阳大气中可能产生的后果。我们在太阳黑子光桥之间的磁通管内观察到了周期性加热和重连流的微妙迹象。此外，在光桥的两侧，我们观察到了小的反平行水平磁场分量，支持了我们观测到逆FIP等离子体的重连可能发生的地方。当这些微妙迹象与逆FIP效应观测结果结合在一起时，这为太阳色球分层下重连的间接观测证据提供了有力支持，然而直接证据仍然难以获得。 <br /><br /> <div>
Within the coronae of stars, abundances of those elements with low first ionization potential (FIP) often differ from their photospheric values. The coronae of the Sun and solar-type stars mostly show enhancements of low-FIP elements (the FIP effect) while more active stars such as M dwarfs have coronae generally characterized by the inverse-FIP (I-FIP) effect. Highly localized regions of I-FIP effect solar plasma have been observed by Hinode's EUV Imaging Spectrometer in a number of highly complex active regions (ARs), usually around strong light bridges of the umbrae of coalescing/merging sunspots. These observations can be interpreted in the context of the ponderomotive force fractionation model, which predicts that plasma with I-FIP effect composition is created by the refraction of waves coming from below the plasma fractionation region in the chromosphere. A plausible source of these waves is thought to be reconnection in the (high-plasma-β) subchromospheric magnetic field. In this study, we use the 3D visualization technique of Chintzoglou & Zhang combined with observations of localized I-FIP effect in the corona of AR 11504 to identify potential sites of such reconnection and its possible consequences in the solar atmosphere. We found subtle signatures of episodic heating and reconnection outflows in the expected places, in between magnetic flux tubes forming a light bridge, within the photosphere of the AR. Furthermore, on either side of the light bridge, we observed small antiparallel horizontal magnetic field components, supporting the possibility of reconnection occurring where we observe I-FIP plasma. When taken together with the I-FIP effect observations, these subtle signatures provide a compelling case for indirect observational evidence of reconnection below the fractionation layer of the chromosphere, however direct evidence remains elusive.

太阳丰度问题是太阳模型中的持续争论话题。研究人员构建了旋转太阳模型，并分析了不同丰度尺度对模型的影响。他们发现，使用Magg的丰度尺度的模型具有更好的声速和密度轮廓，能够复制观测到的频率分离比例r02和r13，以及与地震推断的表面氦丰度和对流区深度相匹配。此外，模拟的中微子流量与检测到的中微子流量一致。研究人员还发现，核反应会对中微子流量和密度轮廓产生影响，可以用于诊断天体物理S因子。利用更新的中微子流量和地震推断结果所偏爱的S因子可能会显著改善太阳模型。 <br /><br />总结: 太阳丰度问题是太阳模型中的持续争论话题。研究人员发现使用Magg的丰度尺度的模型在多个方面具有优势，并对S因子的研究有所启发。 <div>
The ratio of metal abundance to hydrogen abundance of the solar photosphere, (Z/X)s, has been revised several times. Standard solar models, based on these revised solar abundances, are in disagreement with seismically inferred results. Recently, Magg et al. introduced a new value for (Z/X)s, which is still under debate in the community. The solar abundance problem or solar modeling problem remains a topic of ongoing debate. We constructed rotating solar models in accordance with various abundance scales where the effects of convection overshoot and enhanced diffusion were included. Among these models, those utilizing Magg’s abundance scale exhibit superior sound speed and density profiles compared to models using other abundance scales. Additionally, they reproduce the observed frequency separation ratios r02 and r13. These models also match the seismically inferred surface helium abundance and convection zone depth within the 1σ level. Furthermore, the calculated neutrino fluxes from these models agree with detected ones at the level of 1σ. We found that neutrino fluxes and density profile are influenced by nuclear reactions, allowing us to use the combination of detected neutrino fluxes and seismically inferred density for diagnosing astrophysical S-factors. This diagnostic approach shows that S11 may be underestimated by 2%, while S33 may be overestimated by about 3% in previous determinations. The S-factors favored by updated neutrino fluxes and helioseismic results can lead to significant improvements in solar models.

Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) exhibit a wide range of quasiperiodic variations and are crucial for our understanding of the cyclical evolution of large-scale magnetic fields. However, the mid-term periodicities of different types of CMEs associated with different processes at the source location need to be clearly understood. Based on the CDAW catalog released by the Large Angle and Spectroscopic Coronagraph mission on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, we investigated the period of CMEs based on the speeds and accelerations using the continuous wavelet transformation method. Our results revealed that the distribution of CMEs over time is quite distinctly different for different speeds, and there are Rieger-type periods and quasi-biennial oscillations of the CMEs. The two types of periodic signals show significant differences in solar cycles 23 and 24. Furthermore, the periodicity patterns for the northern hemisphere differ from those in the southern hemisphere. The potential mechanisms and explanations of the results are also discussed.

总结:
观测了局部星系目标的解析星的数据，使用 James Webb Space Telescope NIRCam Exposure Time Calculator (ETC) v3.0 进行了实证评估。对于明亮的恒星，发现ETC和观测之间的纯泊松估计的信噪比一致良好，但非理想效应是目前可以达到的光度精度的限制因素。对于暗淡的恒星，发现ETC的信噪比估计受到光度精度影响的选择，可以影响曝光时间的估计长达5倍。最后，还量化了拥挤对信噪比的影响，并提供了估计ETC预测拥挤效应的指导方针。 <div>
We empirically assess estimates from v3.0 of the James Webb Space Telescope NIRCam Exposure Time Calculator (ETC) using observations of resolved stars in Local Group targets taken as part of the Resolved Stellar Populations Early Release Science (ERS) Program. For bright stars, we find that (i) purely Poissonian estimates of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are in good agreement between the ETC and observations, but nonideal effects (e.g., flat-field uncertainties) are the current limiting factor in the photometric precision that can be achieved; (ii) source position offsets, relative to the detector pixels, have a large impact on the ETC saturation predictions and introducing subpixel dithers in the observation design can improve the saturation limits by up to ∼1 mag. For faint stars, for which the sky dominates the error budget, we find that the choice in the ETC extraction strategy (e.g., aperture size relative to point-spread function size) can affect the exposure time estimates by up to a factor of 5. We provide guidelines for configuring the ETC aperture photometry to produce SNR predictions in line with the ERS data. Finally, we quantify the effects of crowding on the SNRs over a large dynamic range in stellar density and provide guidelines for approximating the effects of crowding on SNRs predicted by the ETC.

The Wang–Sheeley–Arge (WSA) model has been in use for decades and remains a popular, economical approach to modeling the solar coronal magnetic field and forecasting conditions in the inner heliosphere. Given its usefulness, it is unsurprising that a number of WSA implementations have been developed by various groups with different computational approaches. While the WSA magnetic field model has traditionally been calculated using a spherical harmonic expansion of the solar magnetic field, finite-difference potential field solutions can offer speed and/or accuracy advantages. However, the creation of new versions of WSA requires that we ensure the solutions from these new models are consistent with established versions and that we quantify for the user community to what degree and in what ways they differ. In this paper, we present side-by-side comparisons of WSA models produced using the traditional, spherical harmonic–based implementation developed by Wang, Sheeley, and Arge with WSA models produced using a recently open-sourced finite-difference code from the CORHEL modeling suite called POT3D. We present comparisons of the terminal solar wind speed and magnetic field at the outer boundaries of the models, weighing these against the variation of the WSA model in the presence of small perturbations in the computational procedure, parameters, and inputs. We also compare the footpoints of magnetic field lines traced from the outer boundaries and the locations of open field in the models. We find that the traced field-line footpoints show remarkable agreement, with the greatest differences near the magnetic neutral line and in the polar regions.

Both simulations and observations suggest that the disk assembly of galaxies is governed by the interplay between coplanar gas inflow, ex-planar gas outflow, and in situ star formation on the disk, known as the leaky accretion disk. This scenario predicts a strong connection between radial distributions of star formation and chemical abundances. The Milky Way, being the sole Galaxy where we can reliably measure star formation histories and the corresponding temporally resolved chemical abundances with individual stars, provides a unique opportunity to scrutinize this scenario. Based on the recent large spectroscopic and photometric surveys of Milky Way stars, we obtain the radial profiles of magnesium abundance ([Mg/H]) and star formation rate surface density at different lookback times. We find the radial profiles of [Mg/H] can be well-reproduced using the leaky accretion disk model with only two free parameters for stars formed within 4 Gyr, as well as the flattening at large radii of metallicity profiles traced by H ii regions and Cepheids. Furthermore, the constraint effective yield of the Milky Way and nearby galaxies shows broad consistency with the theoretical predictions from the stellar chemical evolution model with a mass-loading factor of 0–2. These results support that the recent assembly of the Milky Way adheres to the leaky accretion disk scenario, bridging the disk formation of our home Galaxy to the big picture of disk formation in the Universe.

We characterize the earliest galaxy population in the JADES Origins Field, the deepest imaging field observed with JWST. We make use of ancillary Hubble Space Telescope optical images (five filters spanning 0.4–0.9 μm) and novel JWST images with 14 filters spanning 0.8−5 μm, including seven medium-band filters, and reaching total exposure times of up to 46 hr per filter. We combine all our data at >2.3 μm to construct an ultradeep image, reaching as deep as ≈31.4 AB mag in the stack and 30.3–31.0 AB mag (5σ, r = 0.″1 circular aperture) in individual filters. We measure photometric redshifts and use robust selection criteria to identify a sample of eight galaxy candidates at redshifts z = 11.5−15. These objects show compact half-light radii of R1/2 ∼ 50−200 pc, stellar masses of M⋆ ∼ 107−108 M☉, and star formation rates ∼ 0.1−1 M☉ yr−1. Our search finds no candidates at 15 < z < 20, placing upper limits at these redshifts. We develop a forward-modeling approach to infer the properties of the evolving luminosity function without binning in redshift or luminosity that marginalizes over the photometric redshift uncertainty of our candidate galaxies and incorporates the impact of nondetections. We find a z = 12 luminosity function in good agreement with prior results, and that the luminosity function normalization and UV luminosity density decline by a factor of ∼2.5 from z = 12 to z = 14. We discuss the possible implications of our results in the context of theoretical models for evolution of the dark matter halo mass function.

We describe the Stagger code for simulations of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) systems. This is a modular code with a variety of physics modules that will let the user run simulations of deep stellar atmospheres, sunspot formation, stellar chromospheres and coronae, proto-stellar disks, star formation from giant molecular clouds, and even galaxy formation. The Stagger code is efficiently and highly parallelizable, enabling such simulations with large ranges of both spatial and temporal scales. We describe the methodology of the code and present the most important of the physics modules, as well as its input and output variables. We show results of a number of standard MHD tests to enable comparison with other, similar codes. In addition, we provide an overview of tests that have been carried out against solar observations, ranging from spectral line shapes, spectral flux distribution, limb darkening, intensity and velocity distributions of granulation, to seismic power spectra and the excitation of p-modes. The Stagger code has proven to be a high-fidelity code with a large range of uses.

总结: 本文对0.8 < z < 1.3的16 μm流量密度限制的星系样本进行了形态学分析。研究发现，在目标红移处，16 μm发射对应于来自强烈恒星形成的多环芳烃特征，或者活跃星系核加热的尘埃。样本中67%为LIRGs，主要分为AGN主导型、星形成主导型、复合型和蓝色紧凑星系。大部分样本（71%）呈盘状形态，少数AGN主导星系比星形成主导型和复合型星系更偏向球状。ULIRGs子样本遵循陡峭的大小-质量关系，与早期星系更为接近。此外，随着4.5 μm亮度过剩（AGN强度的代理）的增加，样本呈现更多的球状特征。根据特定恒星形成率和紧凑性图，大部分LIRG主导的星系样本沿着渐进演化轨迹发展，与任何并合活动无关。样本中的16个ULIRGs中有6个紧凑并且具有强烈AGN贡献，可能沿着更激烈活动的快速轨迹演化。 <div>
We present a morphological analysis of the 16 μm flux-density-limited galaxy sample at 0.8 < z < 1.3 from Huang et al. (2021). At the targeted redshift, the 16 μm emission corresponds to the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon feature from intense star formation, or dust heated by active galactic nuclei (AGN). Our sample of 479 galaxies are dominated by luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs; 67%) in three CANDLES fields (Extended Groth Strip, Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey North and South fields), and are further divided into AGN-dominated, star-forming dominated, composite, and blue compact galaxies by their spectral energy distribution types. The majority of our sample (71%) have disk morphologies, with the few AGN-dominated galaxies being more bulge-dominated than the star-forming-dominated and composite galaxies. The distribution of our sample on the Gini versus M20 plane is consistent with previous studies, where the Sérsic index n shows an increasing trend toward the smaller M20 and higher Gini region below the dividing line for mergers. The subsample of ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) follows a steep size–mass relation that is closer to the early-type galaxies. In addition, as the 4.5 μm luminosity excess ( , proxy for AGN strength) increases, our sample appears to be more bulge dominated (i.e., higher n). Based on the specific star formation rate and compactness ( ) diagram, the majority of our LIRG-dominated galaxy sample follows a secular evolution track, and their distribution can be explained without involving any merging activities. Out of the 16 ULIRGs in our sample, six are compact with strong AGN contributions, likely evolving along the fast track from more violent activities.

<br />
使用IRIS观测的太阳耀斑数据显示，色球凝聚（CCs）的形成与演化时间尺度和速度与之前的理论模型存在较大差异。研究发现，CCs的寿命平均为1分钟，且随最大速度（vmax）的增加而延长。这表明太阳耀斑的大气层和加热场景可能比Fisher最初假设的要复杂。此外，约90%的样本显示存在可观测的加速阶段，这些加速阶段不仅可作为耀斑模型的诊断指标，还可以用来计算其他模型诊断，如初始加速质量。总结: <br /><br /> <div>
Chromospheric condensations (CCs) are a prominent feature of flare footpoint heating in the solar flare standard model, yet their timescales and velocities are not well understood. Fisher derived several important analytical relationships, which have rarely been examined with modern spectral observations. The Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) provides a wealth of flare data with a high enough cadence to sufficiently capture CC evolution. We analyzed Doppler shifts in Mg ii 2791 and Fe ii 2814 from a sample of flare footpoint pixels observed by IRIS to compare with Fisher's analytics and recent flare models. We found a detection lifetime of 1 minute occurs in 50% of the sample, with Mg ii showing several pixels with longer values and Fe ii almost categorically shorter, and both growing with the maximum velocity, vmax. The shifts’ half-life is commonly <40 s and is inversely related to vmax, indicating that the first half of the CC evolution has more efficient kinetic energy loss. The lifetime’s wide range and growth with vmax indicate that the footpoint atmospherics and heating scenarios can vary more widely than first postulated in Fisher. Around 90% of the sample had observable acceleration periods, lasting an average of 38 and 32 s for Mg ii and Fe ii, respectively. These acceleration periods, as well as serving as flare model diagnostics themselves, could potentially be used to calculate other model diagnostics such as the initially accelerated mass.

<div> 关键词: HZ, 气候调节, 硅酸盐风化, 大气CO2分压, 行星

总结:
行星的大气CO2分压对气候稳定有重要影响，特别是在行星太阳辐射较低的外部Habitable Zone范围内。研究表明，在这种情况下，随着大气CO2分压和温度的增加，全球蒸发和降水会减少，导致硅酸盐风化减少，从而可能导致CO2累积或CO2耗尽，进而导致气候失稳和可能的“雪球地球”情况。这暗示着在HZ的外部范围内，硅酸盐风化可能无法维持适宜的气候条件。 <div>
Implicit in the definition of the classical circumstellar habitable zone (HZ) is the hypothesis that the carbonate-silicate cycle can maintain clement climates on exoplanets with land and surface water across a range of instellations by adjusting atmospheric CO2 partial pressure (pCO2). This hypothesis is made by analogy to the Earth system, but it is an open question whether silicate weathering can stabilize climate on planets in the outer reaches of the HZ, where instellations are lower than those received by even the Archean Earth and CO2 is thought likely to dominate atmospheres. Since weathering products are carried from land to ocean by the action of water, silicate weathering is intimately coupled to the hydrologic cycle, which intensifies with hotter temperatures under Earth-like conditions. Here, we use global climate model simulations to demonstrate that the hydrologic cycle responds counterintuitively to changes in climate on planets with CO2-H2O atmospheres at low instellations and high pCO2, with global evaporation and precipitation decreasing as pCO2 and temperatures increase at a given instellation. Within the Maher & Chamberlain (or MAC) weathering formulation, weathering then decreases with increasing pCO2 for a range of instellations and pCO2 typical of the outer reaches of the HZ, resulting in an unstable carbon cycle that may lead to either runaway CO2 accumulation or depletion of CO2 to colder (possibly snowball) conditions. While the behavior of the system has not been completely mapped out, the results suggest that silicate weathering could fail to maintain habitable conditions in the outer reaches of the nominal HZ.

这篇文章报告了MACS J0717_Az9，一个被引力透镜的星系，其分子气体含量和星际介质条件。该星系具有异常高（约80%）的星形成比例，发现了CO（4-3）和[N ii] 205 μm。分子气体质量较低，且PDR条件与本地星系相似。利用3D-Barolo模型拟合了CO（4-3）的运动学特性，发现其中心运动受到旋转的控制。Az9可能代表了一个被现有毫米波调查漏掉的更为普遍的星系群。通过研究这一现象，我们可以更好地理解红移为z∼4的低质量星系的尘埃遮挡情况和分子气体含量。
<br /><br />总结: 挖掘到了一个被引力透镜的星系MACS J0717_Az9，发现其分子气体含量较低，PDR模型表明其条件与本地星系相似，运动受到旋转的控制。这一发现可能代表被现有调查漏掉的更为普遍的星系群。 <div>
We present the molecular gas content and interstellar medium conditions of MACS J0717_Az9, a strong gravitationally lensed z = 4.273, M* ≃ 2 × 109 M⊙ star-forming galaxy with an unusually high (∼80%) obscured star formation fraction. We detect CO (4–3) in two independent lensed images, as well as [N ii] 205 μm, with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array. We derive a molecular gas mass of log , making it moderately deficient in molecular gas compared to the lower-redshift gas fraction scaling relation. Leveraging photodissociation region (PDR) models, we combine our CO (4–3) measurements with existing measurements of the [C ii] 158 μm line and total infrared luminosity to model the PDR conditions. We find PDR conditions similar to those in local star-forming galaxies, with a mean hydrogen density log10[nH cm−3] = 4.80 ± 0.39 and a mean radiation field strength log10[G0 Habing] = 2.83 ± 0.26. Based on Band 3 continuum data, we derive an upper limit on the intrinsic dust mass of log10[Mdust(M⊙)] < 7.73, consistent with existing estimates. We use the 3D tilted-ring model fitting code 3D-Barolo to determine the kinematic properties of the CO (4–3) emitting gas. We find that it is rotationally dominated, with a V/σ = 4.6 ± 1.7, consistent with the kinematics of the [C ii]. With PDR conditions remarkably similar to those in normal dusty star-forming galaxies at z < 0.2 and a stable molecular disk, our observations of Az9 suggest that the dust-obscured phase for a low-mass galaxy at z ∼ 4 is relatively long. Thus, Az9 may be representative of a more widespread population that has been missed owing to insufficiently deep existing millimeter surveys.

这篇文章利用ALMA探测到了CH3OH和其三种重氘化物质在低质量原恒星源B335附近的光谱线发射。它们在24天文单位的范围内呈环状分布，在连续谱峰处出现了强度减小。研究得出了这些物质在盘/包层系统中六个位置以及连续谱峰的柱密度和丰度比。CH3OH的D/H比率约为0.03-0.13，[CHD2OH]/[CH2DOH]比值更高，约为0.14-0.29。而[CH2DOH]/[CH3OD]比值约为4.9-15，高于统计比值3，并与其他低质量源报道的比值相当。通过分析CH3OH和HCOOH的线发射，研究了B335内数个天文单位尺度上的物理结构，发现了合理的入射旋转运动速度结构。得出B335具有小型盘结构的年轻原恒星和原恒星质量约为0.03-0.07太阳质量，离心力障的上限小于7天文单位。这种年轻的原恒星可能与相对较高的[CH2DOH]/[CH3OH]比值有关。
<br /><br />总结: 该研究利用ALMA探测了CH3OH和其三种重氘化物质在低质量原恒星源B335附近的光谱线发射，讨论了它们的分布和性质。通过分析这些物质在盘/包层系统中的柱密度和丰度比，研究了B335的物理结构，并推断出其具有小型盘结构的年轻原恒星。 <div>
Deuterium fractionation in the closest vicinity of a protostar is important in understanding its potential heritage to a planetary system. Here, we have detected the spectral line emission of CH3OH and its three deuterated species, CH2DOH, CHD2OH, and CH3OD, toward the low-mass protostellar source B335 at a resolution of 0.″03 (5 au) with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. They have a ring distribution within the radius of 24 au with the intensity depression at the continuum peak. We derive the column densities and abundance ratios of the above species at six positions in the disk/envelope system as well as the continuum peak. The D/H ratio of CH3OH is ∼[0.03–0.13], which is derived by correcting the statistical weight of 3 for CH2DOH. The [CHD2OH]/[CH2DOH] ratio is derived to be higher ([0.14–0.29]). On the other hand, the [CH2DOH]/[CH3OD] ratio ([4.9–15]) is higher than the statistical ratio of 3 and is comparable to those reported for other low-mass sources. We study the physical structure on a few astronomical unit scales in B335 by analyzing the CH3OH (183,15 − 182,16, A) and HCOOH (120,12 − 110,11) line emission. Velocity structures of these lines are reasonably explained as the infalling-rotating motion. The protostellar mass and the upper limit to the centrifugal barrier are thus derived to be 0.03–0.07 M⊙ and <7 au, respectively, showing that B335 harbors a young protostar with a tiny disk structure. Such youth of the protostar may be related to the relatively high [CH2DOH]/[CH3OH] ratio.

With space missions such as Kepler, TESS, and Gaia, we have a wealth of data on pulsating white dwarfs that can be leveraged in white dwarf asteroseismology. We address the question of the proportion of white dwarfs with thin hydrogen layers versus those with thick hydrogen layers. We also provide a mass–radius relation for carbon–oxygen-core, hydrogen-atmosphere white dwarfs. Such a relationship can be used in conjunction with magnitudes and distance measurements to constrain the mass and effective temperature of the white dwarfs. We select nine hydrogen-atmosphere pulsating white dwarfs for their rich pulsation spectra. From such pulsation spectra, we can derive the asymptotic period spacing, which in turn allows us to determine the thickness of the hydrogen and helium envelope of the models, without having to perform period-by-period fitting. We find that the majority of the white dwarfs have thicker hydrogen layers and we determine an upper limit of Mr = 1–10−2.2 for the location of the base of the helium layer, in accordance with stellar evolution models. We confirm a finding from earlier studies that used a mass–radius relation and Gaia data to determine the effective temperatures of white dwarfs. The Gaia data systematically point to white dwarfs of lower effective temperature than indicated by the spectroscopy. Our results also support the hypothesis that white dwarfs with thicker hydrogen layers are more common than those with thinner layers.

HCO+的重氧同位素对于天体物理学的研究非常重要，实验室记录了HC18O+、DC18O+、HC17O+和DC17O+的基态旋转谱，通过频率调制亚毫米波谱仪进行吸收光谱记录，进行了高水平的从头算计算以获取分子参数和碰撞效应的理论估计，并提供了DC17O+的首批实验旋转数据。这些结果支持当前和未来的天文学研究，为Atacama大型毫米/亚毫米波阵列观测对象的分析提供了更新的基准频率数据，HC18O+示踪剂的推导数据集达到了1.5 THz的精确度为数十亿分之几。 <div>
Heavy oxygen isotopic species of HCO+ are important optically thin astrophysical tracers. The ground-state rotational spectrum of HC18O+, DC18O+, HC17O+, and DC17O+ has been recorded in the laboratory in the frequency range from 85 GHz to 1.3 THz. The ions have been produced in the negative column of a glow-discharge plasma, and their spectrum has been recorded in absorption using a frequency-modulation submillimeter-wave spectrometer. Various sources of systematic error have been carefully accounted for in order to obtain highly accurate line-position measurements. Theoretical estimates of the molecular parameters and of the collision effects on the line shape have been obtained by high-level ab initio calculations. The analysis yielded much improved rotational and centrifugal distortion constants, thus bringing the spectroscopic characterization of these rare isotopic variants to the same level of the parent species. Also, the first experimental rotational data for DC17O+ have been provided. These results allow for the calculation of an updated set of rest frequencies to support current and future astrophysical studies. The derived data set for the widely used HC18O+ tracer reaches an accuracy of a few parts in 109 up to 1.5 THz. Such accuracy is important for the analysis of astrophysical objects targeted by Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations at the submillimeter regime.

<br /><br />总结:
ALMA观测了200多个原行星盘系统，大部分显示有行星存在。过渡盘中的尘埃间隙被认为是巨行星在合适的盘粘度下雕刻气体和尘埃的证据。然而，许多托瑞星系中的过渡盘具有异常高的吸积速率，挑战了这一理论。最近的理论进展挑战了传统的盘间隙形成理论和粘度驱动的吸积模型，提出了有磁化的盘风模型。研究表明，在磁化盘风占主导的吸积模式下，DM Tau系统内可能存在着一个中等质量的行星。这意味着DM Tau可能并不像想象中的那么湍动。然而，盘内粘度也应该对维持盘稳定性起到一定的湍动贡献。 <div>
Over 200 protoplanetary disk systems have been resolved by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), and the vast majority suggest the presence of planets. The dust gaps in transition disks are considered evidence of giant planets sculpting gas and dust under appropriate disk viscosity. However, the unusually high accretion rates in many T Tauri stars hosting transition disks challenge this theory. As the only disk currently observed with high turbulence, the high accretion rate (∼10−8.3 M⊙ yr−1) observed in DM Tau indicates the presence of strong turbulence within the system. Considering the recent theoretical advancements in magnetized disk winds are challenging the traditional gap-opening theories and viscosity-driven accretion models, our study presents a pioneering simulation incorporating a simplified magnetized disk wind model to explain the observed features in DM Tau. Employing multifluid simulations with an embedded medium mass planet, we successfully replicate the gap formation and asymmetric structures evident in ALMA Band 6 and the recent Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array 7 mm observations. Our results suggest that when magnetized disk wind dominates the accretion mode of the system, it is entirely possible for a planet with a medium mass to exist within the gap inside 20 au of DM Tau. This means that DM Tau may not be as turbulent as imagined. However, viscosity within the disk should also contribute a little turbulence to maintain disk stability.

We analyze four epochs of Hubble Space Telescope imaging over 18 yr for the Draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy. We measure precise proper motions for hundreds of stars and combine these with existing line-of-sight (LOS) velocities. This provides the first radially resolved 3D velocity dispersion profiles for any dwarf galaxy. These constrain the intrinsic velocity anisotropy and resolve the mass–anisotropy degeneracy. We solve the Jeans equations in oblate axisymmetric geometry to infer the mass profile. We find the velocity dispersion to be radially anisotropic along the symmetry axis and tangentially anisotropic in the equatorial plane, with a globally averaged value , (where 1 – in 3D). The logarithmic dark matter (DM) density slope over the observed radial range, Γdark, is , consistent with the inner cusp predicted in ΛCDM cosmology. As expected given Draco’s low mass and ancient star formation history, it does not appear to have been dissolved by baryonic processes. We rule out cores larger than 487, 717, and 942 pc at 1σ, 2σ, and 3σ confidence, respectively, thus imposing important constraints on the self-interacting DM cross section. Spherical models yield biased estimates for both the velocity anisotropy and the inferred slope. The circular velocity at our outermost data point (900 pc) is . We infer a dynamical distance of kpc and show that Draco has a modest LOS rotation, with . Our results provide a new stringent test of the so-called “cusp–core” problem that can be readily extended to other dwarfs.

这项研究使用Chandra-ACIS和XMM-Newton EPIC-pn仪器的高能拒绝率作为宇宙射线通量的代理，分析了2014年至2018年间的数据。研究发现，27天内有AMS质子通量与ACIS/EPIC-pn拒绝率之间的稳健相关性。然而，进一步观察发现了更短期的变化，ACIS和EPIC-pn拒绝率显示出大约25天和23天的重复变化。特别是在2016年至2017年期间，ACIS和EPIC-pn拒绝率还显示出了大约13.5天和9天的周期性。同时，研究还发现在2016年下半年AMS质子通量与ACIS/EPIC-pn拒绝率之间存在大约6天的时间滞后，而在2016年之前和2017年之后并未观察到这种现象。这些观察结果为宇宙射线对X射线天文台造成的影响提供了重要线索，进一步的物理机制研究仍在进行中。 <div>
Galactic cosmic-ray (GCR) particles have a significant impact on the particle-induced background of X-ray observatories, and their flux exhibits substantial temporal variability, potentially influencing background levels. In this study, we present 1 day binned high-energy reject rates derived from the Chandra-ACIS and XMM-Newton EPIC-pn instruments, serving as proxies for the GCR particle flux. We systematically analyze the ACIS and EPIC-pn reject rates and compare them with the AMS proton flux. Our analysis initially reveals robust correlations between the AMS proton flux and the ACIS/EPIC-pn reject rates when binned over 27 day intervals. However, a closer examination reveals substantial fluctuations within each 27 day bin, indicating shorter-term variability. Upon daily binning, we observe finer temporal structures in the data sets, demonstrating the presence of recurrent variations with periods of ∼25 days and 23 days in the ACIS and EPIC-pn reject rates, respectively, spanning the years 2014–2018. Notably, during the 2016–2017 period, we additionally detect periodicities of ∼13.5 days and 9 days in the ACIS and EPIC-pn reject rates, respectively. Intriguingly, we observe a time lag of ∼6 days between the AMS proton flux and the ACIS/EPIC-pn reject rates during the second half of 2016. This time lag is not visible before 2016 and after 2017. The underlying physical mechanisms responsible for this time lag remain a subject of ongoing investigation.

Atmospheric CH4 abundance on Earth-like inhabited exoplanets is likely controlled by marine biogenic production and atmospheric photochemical consumption. Such interactions have been previously examined for the case of the early Earth where primitive marine ecosystems supplied CH4 to the atmosphere, showing that the atmospheric CH4 response to biogenic CH4 flux variations is nonlinear, a critical property when assessing CH4 reliability as a biosignature. However, the contributions of atmospheric photochemistry, metabolic reactions, or solar irradiance to this nonlinear response are not well understood. Using an atmospheric photochemical model and a marine microbial ecosystem model, we show that the production of hydroxyl radicals from water vapor photodissociation is a critical factor controlling the atmospheric CH4 abundance. Consequently, atmospheric CH4 partial pressure (pCH4) on inhabited Earth-like exoplanets orbiting Sun-like stars (F-, G-, and K-type stars) would be controlled primarily by stellar irradiance. Specifically, irradiance at wavelengths of approximately 200–210 nm is a major controlling factor for atmospheric pCH4 when the carbon dioxide partial pressure is sufficiently high to absorb most stellar irradiance at 170–200 nm. Finally, we also demonstrated that inhabited exoplanets orbiting near the outer edge of K-type stars’ habitable zones are better suited for atmospheric pCH4 buildup. Such properties will provide valuable support for future detection of life signatures.

这篇文章介绍了关于z∼6-9星系流出现象的统计数据。通过分析JWST CEERS、GLASS和ERO数据中的61个经过光谱确认的星系，发现其中4个星系的[O III]+Hβ电离气体发射明显延伸到千秒差距尺度的恒星组分外部。与低红移星系相比，z∼6-9时期具有空间延伸气体的星系比例为4/18，比z∼0-1时期高一个数量级，这可能是由于在高红移时期频繁的主要并合事件触发了这种现象。此外，研究了30个z∼6-9星系的中等和高分辨率NIRSpec光谱，发现其中5个星系的[O III]禁线发射具有140-800 km/s的宽线，暗示存在星系流出现象。其中一个z=6.38的星系同时显示了空间延伸的气体发射和宽线，而没有一个具有明显的活动星系核的迹象，这表明星系流出主要是由恒星反馈驱动的。存在空间延伸气体发射或宽线的星系与没有这些现象的星系可能是由观测角度不同或这些星系处于高红移时期的早期、晚期或后期星系流出阶段所解释的，其中相对较大比例的这类星系表明在早期宇宙时期流出现象持续时间较长和/或更频繁。 <br /><br />总结: 通过分析z∼6-9时期的星系，发现了一些相对于低红移时期更为频繁的星系流出现象，这些流出现象主要由恒星反馈驱动，而不是活动星系核。这些发现将有助于我们更好地理解宇宙早期星系的形成和演化。 <div>
We present statistics of z ∼ 6–9 galaxy outflows indicated by spatially extended gas emission and broad lines. With a total of 61 spectroscopically confirmed galaxies at z ∼ 6–9 in the JWST CEERS, GLASS, and ERO data, we find four galaxies with [O iii] + Hβ ionized gas emission significantly extended beyond the kiloparsec-scale stellar components on the basis of the emission line images constructed by the subtraction of NIRCam broadband (line on/off-band) images. By comparison with low-z galaxies, the fraction of galaxies with spatially extended gas, 4/18, at z ∼ 6–9 is an order of magnitude higher than that at z ∼ 0–1, which can be explained by events triggered by frequent major mergers at high redshift. We also investigate medium- and high-resolution NIRSpec spectra of 30 galaxies at z ∼ 6–9, and identify five galaxies with broad (140−800 km s−1) lines in the [O iii] forbidden line emission, suggestive of galaxy outflows. One galaxy at z = 6.38 shows both spatially extended gas emission and the broad lines, while none of the galaxies with spatially extended gas emission or broad lines present a clear signature of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in either the line diagnostics or type 1 AGN line broadening (>1000 km s−1), which suggests that outflows are mainly driven by stellar feedback. The existence of galaxies with/without spatially extended gas emission or broad lines may be explained by different viewing angles toward outflows or the fact that these are galaxies in the early, late, or post phases of galaxy outflows at high redshift, where relatively large fractions of such galaxies indicate longer-duration and/or more frequent outflows at early cosmic epochs.

Bubbles driven by energy and mass injection from small scales are ubiquitous in astrophysical fluid systems and essential to feedback across multiple scales. In particular, O stars in young clusters produce high-velocity winds that create hot bubbles in the surrounding gas. We demonstrate that the dynamical evolution of these bubbles is critically dependent upon the geometry of their interfaces with their surroundings and the nature of heat transport across these interfaces. These factors together determine the amount of energy that can be lost from the interior through cooling at the interface, which in turn determines the ability of the bubble to do work on its surroundings. We further demonstrate that the scales relevant to physical dissipation across this interface are extremely difficult to resolve in global numerical simulations of bubbles for parameter values of interest. This means the dissipation driving evolution of these bubbles in numerical simulations is often of a numerical nature. We describe the physical and numerical principles that determine the level of dissipation in these simulations; we use this, along with a fractal model for the geometry of the interfaces, to explain differences in convergence behavior between hydrodynamical and magnetohydrodynamical simulations presented here. We additionally derive an expression for momentum as a function of bubble radius expected when the relevant dissipative scales are resolved and show that it still results in efficiently cooled solutions, as postulated in previous work.

The accelerated electrons during solar flares produce radio bursts and nonthermal X-ray signatures. The quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) and fine structures in spatial–spectral–temporal space in radio bursts depend on the emission mechanism and the local conditions, such as magnetic fields, electron density, and pitch-angle distribution. Radio burst observations with high-frequency time resolution imaging provide excellent diagnostics. In converging magnetic field geometries, the radio bursts can be produced via the electron cyclotron maser (ECM). Recently, using observations made by the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) at 1–2 GHz, Yu et al. reported a discovery of long-lasting auroral-like radio bursts persistent over a sunspot and interpreted them as ECM-generated emission. Here we investigate the detailed second and subsecond temporal variability of this continuous ECM source. We study the association of 5 s period QPPs with a concurrent GOES C1.5-class flare, utilizing VLA’s imaging spectroscopy capability with an extremely high temporal resolution (50 ms). We use the density and magnetic field extrapolation model to constrain the ECM emission to the second harmonic O-mode. Using the delay of QPPs from X-ray emission times, combined with X-ray spectroscopy and magnetic extrapolation, we constrain the energies and pitch angles of the ECM-emitting electrons to ≈4–8 keV and >26°. Our analysis shows that the loss-cone diffusion continuously fuels the ECM via Coulomb collisions and magnetic turbulence between a length scale of 5 and 100 Mm. We conclude that the QPP occurs via the Lotka–Volterra system, where the electrons from solar flares saturate the continuously operating ECM and cause temporary oscillations.

<div> 关键词: 磁流体动力学，阿尔文波，色球，太阳风，非理想MHD效应

总结:
这篇文章研究了色球中非理想磁流体动力学对太阳风的影响，通过进行阿尔文波驱动的MHD模拟，明确包括欧姆和等离子体扩散效应。发现色球中等离子体扩散显著地抑制了MHD波，进而使得达到日冕的阿尔文波的Poynting通量显著减少。因此，日冕温度和太阳风的质量损失率与理想MHD情况相比明显降低，这表明了太阳大气非理想MHD效应的重要性。然而，由于对等离子体扩散和阿尔文波反射对色球物理特性的敏感依赖，通过光球上对流产生的速度扰动轻微增加，温度和质量损失率得到了恢复。此外，还发现色球中阿尔文波的等离子体扩散抑制了在日冕的密度扰动产生，压缩性扰动的非线性生成被抑制。 <div>
We investigate nonideal magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) effects in the chromosphere on the solar wind by performing MHD simulations for Alfvén-wave-driven winds, explicitly including ohmic and ambipolar diffusion. We find that MHD waves are significantly damped in the chromosphere by ambipolar diffusion so that the Alfvénic Poynting flux that reaches the corona is substantially reduced. As a result, the coronal temperature and the mass-loss rate of the solar wind are considerably reduced, compared with those obtained from an ideal MHD case, which is indicative of the great importance of the nonideal MHD effects in the solar atmosphere. However, the temperature and the mass-loss rate are recovered by a small increase in the convection-originated velocity perturbation at the photosphere because of the sensitive dependence of the ambipolar diffusion and reflection of Alfvén waves on the physical properties of the chromosphere. We also find that density perturbations in the corona are reduced by the ambipolar diffusion of Alfvén waves in the chromosphere because the nonlinear generation of compressible perturbations is suppressed.

Protoplanetary disks are prone to several hydrodynamic instabilities. One candidate, convective overstability (COS), can drive radial semiconvection that may influence dust dynamics and planetesimal formation. However, the COS has primarily been studied in local models. This paper investigates the COS near the midplane of radially global disk models. We first conduct a global linear stability analysis, which shows that linear COS modes exist only radially inward of their Lindblad resonance (LR). The fastest-growing modes have LRs near the inner radial domain boundary with effective radial wavelengths that can be a substantial fraction of the disk radius. We then perform axisymmetric global simulations and find that the COS’s nonlinear saturation is similar to previous incompressible shearing box simulations. In particular, we observe the onset of persistent zonal and elevator flows for sufficiently steep radial entropy gradients. In full 3D, nonaxisymmetric global simulations, we find the COS produces large-scale, long-lived vortices, which induce the outward radial transport of angular momentum via the excitation of spiral density waves. The corresponding α-viscosity values of order 10−3 agree well with those found in previous 3D compressible shearing box simulations. However, in global disks, significant modifications to their radial structure are found, including the formation of pressure bumps. Interestingly, the COS typically generates an outward radial mass transport, i.e., decretion. We briefly discuss the possible implications of our results for planetesimal formation and for interpreting dust rings and asymmetries observed in protoplanetary disks.

总结: 本文利用JWST对z≳8的星系进行观测，发现它们比大多数模型预测的更明亮、更杂乱，引发了对第一代星系中星形成和反馈物理的多个新提议。本文重点探讨了紫外辐射在调节星形成中的作用，通过一系列宇宙射线流体动力学模拟，发现远紫外辐射对形成致密且大质量星团的抑制冷却过程具有主要影响，同时也是造成z≳10金属贫穷星系中爆发式星形成的物理过程。由于强烈的远紫外场，低金属云体保持温暖直到达到相对较高密度之前变为自遮蔽状态，并转变为较冷的部分分子相。因此星形成被延迟，直到云体累积足够的质量变得不稳定。在这一点上，云体经历快速星形成，高效地将气体转化为星体。因此我们观察到了异常明亮的星系（比连续星形成明亮10倍），以及后来停止形成星体几千万年的「死」星系。 <br /><br /> <div>
JWST observations of galaxies at z ≳ 8 suggest that they are more luminous and clumpier than predicted by most models, prompting several proposals on the physics of star formation and feedback in the first galaxies. In this paper, we focus on the role of ultraviolet (UV) radiation in regulating star formation by performing a set of cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulations of one galaxy at subparsec resolution with different radiative feedback models. We find that the suppression of cooling by far-UV (FUV) radiation (i.e., H2 dissociating radiation) from Population II stars is the main physical process triggering the formation of compact and massive star clusters and is responsible for the bursty star formation observed in metal-poor galaxies at z ≳ 10. Indeed, artificially suppressing FUV radiation leads to a less intense continuous mode of star formation distributed into numerous but low-mass open star clusters. Due to the intense FUV field, low-metallicity clouds remain warm (∼104 K) until they reach a relatively high density (≳103 cm−3), before becoming self-shielded and transitioning to a colder (∼100 K), partially molecular phase. As a result, star formation is delayed until the clouds accumulate enough mass to become gravitationally unstable. At this point, the clouds undergo rapid star formation, converting gas into stars with high efficiency. We therefore observe exceptionally bright galaxies (10 times brighter than for continuous star formation) and subsequent quenched “dead” galaxies that did not form stars for tens of Myr.

Cool red giant stars exhibit absorption bands of calcium monochloride (CaCl) in the optical region. In this work, the bands of CaCl corresponding to the A2Π − X2Σ+ transition with 4 and v″ ≤ 4, and B2Σ+ − X2Σ+ transition with 2 and v″ ≤ 2 are rotationally analyzed with PGOPHER, a multipurpose program for simulating and fitting molecular spectra. All bands were analyzed using high-resolution absorption spectra collected at the National Solar Observatory in 1985, calibrated with atomic lines from a high-resolution emission spectrum obtained in a separate hollow cathode experiment. The results are compared with previous laser-induced fluorescence measurements. Overall, the accuracy of spectroscopic constants for the A2Π and B2Σ+ states is improved. Scaled transition dipole moment calculations were used to obtain line strengths. Line lists are provided with Einstein A coefficients and oscillator strengths, which can be used to determine CaCl stellar abundances. Additionally, isotope splittings allowed us to estimate band origins for the 40Ca37Cl isotopologue based on band-head positions.

The precise measurement of neutron star (NS) spins can provide important insight into the formation and evolution of compact binaries containing NSs. While traditional methods of NS spin measurement rely on pulsar observations, gravitational-wave detections offer a complementary avenue. However, determining component spins with gravitational waves is hindered by the small dimensionless spins of the NSs and the degeneracy in the mass and spin parameters. This degeneracy can be addressed by the inclusion of higher-order modes in the waveform, which are important for systems with unequal masses. This study shows the suitability of NS–black hole mergers, which are naturally mass-asymmetric, for precise NS spin measurements. We explore the effects of the black hole masses and spins, higher-mode content, inclination angles, and detector sensitivity on the measurement of NS spin. We find that networks with next-generation observatories like the Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope can distinguish NS dimensionless spin of 0.04 (0.1) from zero at 1σ confidence for events within ∼350 (∼1000) Mpc. Networks with A+ and A♯ detectors achieve similar distinction within ∼30 (∼70) Mpc and ∼50 (∼110) Mpc, respectively.

<title>Single-epoch and Differential Astrometric Microlensing of Quasars</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We propose and discuss a new experimental approach to measure the centroid shift induced by gravitational microlensing in the images of lensed quasars (astrometric microlensing). Our strategy is based on taking the photocenter of a region in the quasar large enough as to be insensitive to microlensing as reference to measure the centroid displacement of the continuum. In this way, single-epoch measurements of astrometric microlensing can be performed. Using numerical simulations, we show that, indeed, the centroid shift monotonically decreases as the size of the emitting region increases, and only for relatively large regions, like the broad line region (BLR), does the centroid shift become negligible. This opens interesting possibilities to study the stratification of the different emitters in the accretion disk and the BLR. We estimate the amplitude of the centroid shifts for 79 gravitationally lensed images and study more thoroughly the special cases Q2237+030 A, RXJ1131-1231 A, PG1115+080 A2, and SDSS J1004+4112 A. We propose to use spectro-astrometry to simultaneously obtain the photocenters of the continuum and of different emission line regions since, with the precision of forthcoming instruments, astrometric microlensing by ∼1 M⊙ mass microlenses may be detected in many quasar lensed images. When we consider more massive micro/millilenses, M ≳ 10 M⊙, often proposed as the constituents of dark matter, the BLR becomes sensitive to microlensing and can no longer be used as a positional reference to measure centroid shifts. Differential microlensing between the images of a lensed quasar along several epochs should be used instead.

<title>Multiwavelength Emission of the Gamma-Ray Burst Prompt Phase. I. Time-resolved and Time-integrated Polarizations</title>

The time-integrated polarization degree (PD) in the prompt optical band of a gamma-ray burst (GRB) was predicted to be less than 20%, while the time-resolved one can reach as high as 75% in the photosphere model. Polarizations in the optical band during the GRB prompt phase have not previously been studied in the framework of the magnetic reconnection model. Here, a three-segment power law of the energy spectrum is used to reconstruct the Stokes parameters of the magnetic reconnection model. Multiwavelength light curves and polarization curves from the optical band to MeV gamma rays in the GRB prompt phase are studied. We found that, depending mainly on the jet dynamics, there is a long-lasting high-PD phase in all calculated energy bands for the typical parameter sets. The time-resolved PD could be as high as 50%, while the time-integrated one is roughly 17% in the optical band. The time-resolved PD in X-rays can reach 60% and the time-integrated one is around 30%–40%. The evolution of polarization angle (PA) is random in both optical and gamma-ray bands for the photosphere model, while it is roughly constant in the synchrotron models. Therefore, future time-resolved PA observations in the prompt optical or gamma-ray band could distinguish between the photosphere and synchrotron models.

<title>Possible Supercritical Accretion on the Ultraluminous X-Ray Source in the Metal-poor Galaxy I Zw 18</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present an analysis of X-ray observations of the ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) in I Zw 18 based on archival data taken with Chandra, XMM-Newton, and Suzaku. This ULX is considered to be an intermediate-mass black hole candidate simply because it is in the lowest-metallicity environment among ULXs, where the formation of heavy black holes is facilitated. However, actual study of the ULX based on observations spanning for a long period has been too limited to determine its nature. In this study, we investigate the spectral evolution of the ULX up to 2014, combining the previously unpublished Suzaku data with those from the other two satellites. We derive a positive correlation of between the bolometric luminosity L and inner-disk temperature Tin on the basis of the multicolor disk blackbody model, where we exclude the Chandra data, which have the lowest luminosity and systematic residuals in the fitting. The nominal relation for the standard disk is rejected at a significance level of 1.5%. These results suggest that the ULX was in the slim-disk state during these observations except at the time of the Chandra observation, in which the ULX was likely to be in a different state. The apparent inner-disk radius appears negatively correlated with the inner-disk temperature. Moreover, we find a radial dependence of the disk temperature of T(r) ∝ r−p with p < 0.75, which also supports the hypothesis that the ULX has a slim disk. Therefore, the I Zw 18 ULX is most likely to be powered by a stellar-mass compact object in supercritical accretion.

Convective processes are crucial in shaping exoplanetary atmospheres but are computationally expensive to simulate directly. A novel technique of simulating moist convection on tidally locked exoplanets is to use a global 3D model with a stretched mesh. This allows us to locally refine the model resolution to 4.7 km and resolve fine-scale convective processes without relying on parameterizations. We explore the impact of mesh stretching on the climate of a slowly rotating TRAPPIST-1e-like planet, assuming it is 1:1 tidally locked. In the stretched-mesh simulation with explicit convection, the climate is 5 K colder and 25% drier than that in the simulations with parameterized convection(with both stretched and quasi-uniform meshes). This is due to the increased cloud reflectivity—because of an increase in low-level cloudiness—and exacerbated by the diminished greenhouse effect due to less water vapor. At the same time, our stretched-mesh simulations reproduce the key characteristics of the global climate of tidally locked rocky exoplanets, without any noticeable numerical artifacts. Our methodology opens an exciting and computationally feasible avenue for improving our understanding of 3D mixing in exoplanetary atmospheres. Our study also demonstrates the feasibility of a global stretched-mesh configuration for LFRic-Atmosphere, the next-generation Met Office climate and weather model.

<title>The Peculiar Precursor of a Gamma-Ray Burst from a Binary Merger Involving a Magnetar</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The milestone discovery of GW170817-GRB 170817A-AT 2017gfo has shown that gravitational waves (GWs) could be produced during the merger of a neutron star–neutron star/black hole and that in electromagnetic (EM) waves, a gamma-ray burst (GRB) and a kilonova (KN) are generated in sequence after the merger. Observationally, however, EM properties before the merger phase are still unclear. Here we report a peculiar precursor in a KN-associated long-duration GRB 211211A, providing evidence of the EM before the merger. This precursor lasts ∼0.2 s, and the waiting time between the precursor and the main burst is ∼1 s, comparable to that between GW170817 and GRB 170817A. The spectrum of the precursor could be well fit with a nonthermal cutoff power-law model instead of a blackbody. In particular, a ∼22 Hz quasiperiodic oscillation candidate (∼3σ) is detected in the precursor. These temporal and spectral properties indicate that this precursor is probably produced by a catastrophic flare accompanied with magnetoelastic or crustal oscillations of a magnetar in a binary compact merger. The strong magnetic field of the magnetar can also account for the prolonged duration of GRB 211211A. However, it poses a challenge to reconcile the rather short lifetime of a magnetar with the rather long spiraling time of a binary neutron star system only by the GW radiation before the merger.

<title>Very Long Baseline Interferometry Detection of an Active Radio Source Potentially Driving 100 kpc Scale Emission in the Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxy IRAS F01004–2237</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) IRAS F01004−2237 exhibits 100 kpc scale continuum emission at radio wavelengths. The absence of extended X-ray emission in IRAS F01004−2237 has suggested an active galactic nucleus (AGN) origin for the extended radio emission, whose properties and role in merging systems still need to be better understood. We present the results of multifrequency observations of IRAS F01004−2237 conducted by the Very Long Baseline Array at 2.3 and 8.4 GHz. Compact 8.4 GHz continuum emission was detected on a 1 pc scale in the nuclear region with an intrinsic brightness temperature of 108.1 K suggesting that the radio source originated from an AGN, potentially driving the extended emission. In contrast, no significant emission was observed at 2.3 GHz, indicating the presence of low-frequency absorption. This absorption cannot be attributed solely to synchrotron self-absorption; alternatively, free–free absorption due to thermal plasma is mainly at work in the spectrum. From combined perspectives, including mid-infrared and X-ray data, the AGN is obscured in a dense environment. The kinetic power of the nonthermal jet, as inferred from the extended emission, can play a more important role in dispersing the surrounding medium than the thermal outflow in IRAS F01004−2237. These findings hint that jet activities in ULIRGs may contribute to AGN feedback during galaxy evolution induced by merger events.

<title>Progenitor Constraint-incorporating Shell Merger: The Case of Supernova Remnant G359.0–0.9</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
It is generally hard to put robust constraints on progenitor masses of supernovae and supernova remnants (SNRs) observationally, while they offer tantalizing clues to understanding explosion mechanisms and mass distribution. Our recent study suggests that “shell merger,” which is theoretically expected for stellar evolution, can appreciably affect the final yields of intermediate-mass elements (IMEs; such as Ne, Mg, and Si). In light of this, here we report the results of the X-ray spectral analysis of a Galactic SNR G359.0−0.9, whose abundance pattern may possibly be anomalous according to a previous study. Our spectroscopy using all the available data taken with XMM-Newton reveals that this remnant is classified as a Mg-rich SNR because of its high Mg-to-Ne ratio ( mass ratio ) and conclude that the result cannot be explained without the shell merger. By comparing the observation with theoretical calculations, we prefer the so-called Ne-burning shell intrusion and in this case, the progenitor mass MZAMS is likely <15M⊙. We confirm the result also with our new molecular-line observations with the Nobeyama 45 m telescope: G359.0−0.9 is located in the Scutum–Centaurus arm (2.66–2.94 kpc) and in this case, the resultant total ejecta mass ∼6.8M⊙ is indeed consistent with the above estimate. Our method using mass ratios of IMEs presented in this paper will become useful to distinguish the type of shell merger, the Ne-burning shell intrusion, and the O-burning shell merger, for future SNR studies.

<title>Effect of Transverse Magnetic Field on Kelvin–Helmholtz Instability in the Presence of a Radiation Field</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The dispersion relation of the magnetized Kelvin–Helmholtz (KH) instability driven by shear flow with zero thickness of the shear layer is derived theoretically based on a set of magnetohydrodynamic equations in the presence of a transverse magnetic field and a radiation field. The influence of the magnetic field strength, the radiation field strength, and the density ratio of the two sides of the shear layer on KH instability is analyzed by solving the dispersion equation. The results indicate that the presence of radiation and transverse magnetic fields can destabilize the KH instability due to the resulting increase in Mach number, which in turn reduces the compressibility of the system. Also, the extent of the destabilizing effect of the magnetic field can be affected by the magnetoacoustic Mach number M1f and the Mach number M2. The growth rates vary more significantly for relatively small values of both parameters. Finally, the stabilizing effect of a large density ratio is considered, and it is found that as the density ratio increases, the effect of the radiation field is more significant at larger Mach number M2. These results can be applied to astrophysical phenomena with velocity shear, such as flows across the transition layer between an H ii region and a molecular cloud, accretion flows, and shear flows of cosmic plasmas.

<title>On the Interacting/Active Lifetime of Supernova Fallback Disks around Isolated Neutron Stars</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad5319</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad5319</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The fallback disk model is widely accepted to explain long-period neutron stars (NSs) that cannot be simulated by magnetic dipole radiation. However, there was no confirmed detection of disks from the newly discovered long-period pulsars GLEAM-X 162759.5-523504.3 and GPM J1839-10 and the slowest known isolated NS 1E 161348-5055. This might be because the disks have either been in a noninteracting/inactive state where their emission is too weak to be detected or have been disrupted. In this work, we conduct simulations to examine the lifetime of supernova fallback disks around isolated NSs. We assume that the disks' mass varies in a self-similar way, and their interaction with the NS occurs only in an interacting/active state. Our results reveal that nearly all the interacting lifetimes for the disks are shorter than 105 yr, while the existence lifetimes are considerably longer.

本文提出了一种统计验证方法，用于评估不同仪器收集的相关数据集之间的协议。针对IBEX任务的新数据集进行了详细的案例研究，旨在为类似分析提供实用指南。自2008年以来，IBEX卫星一直在收集有关太阳圈高能中性原子（ENA）的数据，并受到各种背景噪声的影响，如宇宙射线和太阳高能粒子。IBEX任务最初发布了一个合格的三重巧合（qABC）数据产品，旨在提供无背景污染的ENA观测。进一步的测量表明，qABC数据实际上容易受到污染，具有相对较低的ENA计数和较高的背景率。为了减轻这个问题，任务团队最近考虑发布一种特定的合格双重巧合（qBC）数据产品，其检测率约为qABC数据产品的两倍。本论文介绍了对新的qBC数据产品与已发布的qABC数据产品进行基于模拟的验证。结果表明，qBCs可以合理地认为是对qABCs的源人口进行测量，其平均绝对偏差为3.6%。视觉诊断提供了跨数据产品的源速率一致性的额外确认。本文介绍的框架是通用的，并可应用于空间物理学领域内外的其他验证问题。

Space scientists often face the question of whether data collected by different instruments are measurements of the same source population. This paper proposes a statistical validation method for evaluating the agreement between such related data sets. It offers a detailed case study focused on validating a new data set from the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) mission, which serves as a practical how-to guide for similar analyses. Since 2008, the IBEX satellite has been gathering data on heliospheric energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) while being exposed to various sources of background noise, such as cosmic rays and solar energetic particles. The IBEX mission initially released only a qualified triple-coincidence (qABC) data product, which was designed to provide observations of ENAs free of background contamination. Further measurements revealed that the qABC data were in fact susceptible to contamination, having relatively low ENA counts and high background rates. To mitigate this issue, the mission team recently considered releasing a certain qualified double-coincidence (qBC) data product, which has roughly twice the detection rate of the qABC data product. This paper presents a simulation-based validation of the new qBC data product against the already-released qABC data product. The results show that the qBCs can plausibly be said to be measuring the same source population as the qABCs up to an average absolute deviation of 3.6%. Visual diagnostics provide additional confirmation of source rate coherence across data products. The framework introduced here is general and can be applied to other validation problems both within and outside the field of space physics.

总结:
本研究使用Spitzer和Herschel望远镜对小麦哲伦星云内的Wolf–Rayet星云N76进行了观测，并利用Cloudy模型对红外发射线进行建模。我们发现N76的物理条件为热HII区，电子温度最高可达2.4万K，电子密度在4至12cm-3之间，具有高离化参数。我们的模型表明，大部分的[Si ii]发射是在H ii区边缘产生的，而[O iii]和[Ne iii]等高电离线则主要由恒星风产生。通过分析低金属量的WR星云，本研究为了解WR星对邻近矮星系中离子化气体性质的影响提供了宝贵的见解。 <div>
We present Cloudy modeling of infrared emission lines in the Wolf–Rayet (WR) nebula N76 caused by one of the most luminous and hottest WR stars in the low metallicity Small Magellanic Cloud. We use spatially resolved mid-infrared Spitzer/InfRared Spectrograph and far-infrared Herschel/PACS spectroscopy to establish the physical conditions of the ionized gas. The spatially resolved distribution of the emission allows us to constrain properties much more accurately than using spatially integrated quantities. We construct models with a range of constant hydrogen densities between nH = 4–10 cm−3 and a stellar wind-blown cavity of 10 pc, which reproduces the intensity and shape of most ionized gas emission lines, including the high ionization lines [O iv] and [Ne v], as well as [S iii], [S iv], [O iii], and [Ne iii]. Our models suggest that the majority of [Si ii] emission (91%) is produced at the edge of the H ii region around the transition between ionized and atomic gas while very little of the [C ii] (<5%) is associated with the ionized gas. The physical conditions of N76 are characterized by a hot HII region with a maximum electron temperature of Te ∼ 24,000 K, electron densities that range from ne ∼ 4 to 12 cm−3, and high ionization parameters of By analyzing a low-metallicity WR nebula with a single ionization source, this work gives valuable insights into the impact WR stars have on the galaxy-integrated ionized gas properties in nearby dwarf galaxies.

<div> X-ray binaries, star formation rates, stellar masses, metallicity, NGC 300
总结: 本文研究了星系外X射线双星的人口学特性和人口统计学特征与宿主星系的恒星形成率、恒星质量和金属丰度之间的相关性。研究发现X射线双星的比例关系可能取决于金属丰度和恒星年龄，但在亚星系尺度上，金属丰度和恒星年龄对其影响仍然存在挑战。研究使用NGC 300的 X射线和红外观测数据进行自洽建模，检查其X射线双星的径向分布趋势；测得当前的恒星形成率为0.18 ± 0.08 M⊙ yr−1，恒星质量为M⋆ = M⊙。研究发现在约1037 erg s−1以下的X射线源存在明显过剩，可能为变星X射线双星和额外的背景活动星系核。对比文献中的整体X射线双星比例关系，发现只有年龄最年轻的区域与预测相符，提示X射线双星比例关系可能存在时间演化。 <div>
The population-wide properties and demographics of extragalactic X-ray binaries (XRBs) correlate with the star formation rates (SFRs), stellar masses (M⋆), and environmental factors (such as metallicity, Z) of their host galaxy. Although there is evidence that XRB scaling relations (LX/SFR for high-mass XRBs (HMXBs) and LX/M⋆ for low-mass XRBs) may depend on metallicity and stellar age across large samples of XRB-hosting galaxies, disentangling the effects of metallicity and stellar age from stochastic effects, particularly on subgalactic scales, remains a challenge. We use archival X-ray through IR observations of the nearby galaxy NGC 300 to self-consistently model the broadband spectral energy distribution and examine radial trends in its XRB population. We measure a current (<100 Myr) SFR of 0.18 ± 0.08 M⊙ yr−1 and stellar mass M⋆ = M⊙. Although we measure a metallicity gradient and radially resolved star formation histories that are consistent with the literature, there is a clear excess in the number of X-ray sources below ∼1037 erg s−1 that are likely a mix of variable XRBs and additional background active galactic nuclei. When we compare the subgalactic LX/SFR ratios as a function of Z to the galaxy-integrated LX-SFR-Z relationships from the literature, we find that only the regions hosting the youngest (≲30 Myr) HMXBs agree with predictions, hinting at time evolution of the LX–SFR–Z relationship.

We conduct one-dimensional stellar-evolution simulations of stars with zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) masses of MZAMS = 8.8 − 9.45 M⊙ toward core collapse by electron capture and find that the convective zone of the precollapse core can supply the required stochastic angular momentum fluctuations to set a jet-driven electron capture supernova explosion in the frame of the jittering jets explosion mechanism. By our assumed criteria of a minimum convective specific angular momentum and an accreted mass during jet launching of Macc ≃ 0.001−0.01 M⊙, the layer in the convective zone that when accreted launches the exploding jittering jets resides in the helium-rich zone. Depending on the model, this exploding layer is accreted at about a minute to a few hours after core collapse occurs, much shorter than the time the exploding shock crosses the star. The final (gravitational) mass of the neutron star (NS) remnant is in the range of MNS = 1.25−1.43 M⊙.

总结:
在这项研究中，研究人员使用了18个红移在6.0 < z < 7.1的类星体光谱来填补6 ≲ z ≲ 7之间的中性气体分数空白。他们运用神经网络重构类星体的连续辐射，对光谱进行规范化处理，然后将这些规范化后的光谱分为三个红移区间进行叠加。通过比较两种流体动力学模拟（ATON和CROC）中的模型，他们测量了平均中性气体分数，并同时拟合了每个叠加光谱的平均类星体寿命。他们发现中性气体分数在不同红移区间发生了变化，而平均类星体寿命约为7百万年，这与先前的研究结果相吻合。 <div>
The spectra of high-redshift (z ≳ 6) quasars contain valuable information on the progression of the Epoch of Reionization. At redshifts z < 6, the observed Lyman-series forest shows that the intergalactic medium is nearly ionized, while at z > 7 the observed quasar damping wings indicate high neutral gas fractions. However, there remains a gap in neutral gas fraction constraints at 6 ≲ z ≲ 7 where the Lyman-series forest becomes saturated but damping wings have yet to fully emerge. In this work, we use a sample of 18 quasar spectra at redshifts 6.0 < z < 7.1 to close this gap. We apply neural networks to reconstruct the quasars’ continuum emission around the partially absorbed Lyα line to normalize their spectra, and stack these continuum-normalized spectra in three redshift bins. To increase the robustness of our results, we compare the stacks to a grid of models from two hydrodynamical simulations, ATON and CROC, and we measure the volume-averaged neutral gas fraction, , while jointly fitting for the mean quasar lifetime, tQ, for each stacked spectrum. We chronicle the evolution of neutral gas fraction using the ATON (CROC) models as follows: ( ) at 〈z〉 = 6.10, ( ) at 〈z〉 = 6.46, and ( ) at 〈z〉 = 6.87. At the same time, we constrain the average quasar lifetime to be tQ ≲ 7 Myr across all redshift bins, in good agreement with previous studies.

<br /><br />总结:
Wolf-Rayet（W-R）星是非常重要的大质量恒星。通过模拟，我们发现双星合并是W-R恒星形成的重要途径，能够解释观测到的W-R恒星总体比例。我们的模型大致能够复现银河系W-R恒星的观测分布，但对大麦哲伦星云的观测分布解释不足。进行解释时，我们考虑了在双星合并过程中可能低估了质量损失率。 <div>
Wolf–Rayet (W-R) stars are very important massive stars. However, their origin and the observed binary fraction within the entire W-R population are still debated. We investigate some possible merger channels for the formation of W-R stars, including main sequence (MS)/Hertzsprung gap (HG) + MS, He + HG/giant branch (GB). We find that many products produced via binary merger can evolve into W-R stars, the MS/HG + MS merger channel can explain W-R stars with luminosities higher than ∼105.4L⊙, while the He + HG/GB merger channel can explain low-luminosity W-R stars in the range of 104.7L⊙ ∼ 105.5L⊙. In the population synthesis analysis of W-R stars, we assume an initial binary fraction (fini,bin) of 50% and 100% for massive stars. We also assume that MS/HG + MS merger products are nonrotating or rapidly rotating (ω/ωcrit = 0.8). In different cases, the calculated single fractions of W-R stars range from 22.2%–60.6% in the Milky Way (MW) and from 8.3%–70.9% in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The current observations fall within the range of our calculations. When the merger product of MS/HG + MS rotates rapidly, we estimate that there are approximately 1015–1396 W-R stars in the MW and 128–204 W-R stars in the LMC. Our model also roughly reproduces the observed single-peak luminosity distribution of W-R stars in the MW. However, the weak bimodal luminosity distribution observed in the LMC is not reproduced in our model. We assess that this may be due to the model underestimating the mass-loss rate in the LMC. In conclusion, we consider that the binary merger is a significant formation channel for W-R formation, and can explain the observed high fraction of the single W-R stars in the total population.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章讨论了外行星的形成理论，指出核心和鹅卵石聚集对岩石和冰行星的形成有影响，但还需要考虑气盘引力不稳定对M-矮星巨行星和远距离行星的影响。新模型提高了空间分辨率和采用了β冷却逼近，发现GDGI可以解释在离心轨道上（离心率小于0.2）形成距离约30到50天文单位的巨行星。随着原恒星质量减少至0.1太阳质量，形成的数量降至0。 <div>
Exoplanet demographics are sufficiently advanced to provide important constraints on theories of planet formation. While core and pebble accretion are preferred for rocky and icy planets, there appears to be a need for gas disk gravitational instability (GDGI) to play a role in the formation of M-dwarf gas giants and those orbiting at large distances. Here we present GDGI models that go beyond those presented by Boss (2011) dealing with the formation of wide-orbit gas giants. The new models use quadrupled spatial resolution, in both the radial and azimuthal directions, to reduce the effects of finite spatial resolution. The new models also employ the β cooling approximation, instead of the diffusion approximation used by Boss (2011), in order to push the models further in time. As in Boss (2011), the central protostars have masses of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, or 2.0 M⊙, surrounded by disks with masses ranging from 0.019 M⊙ to 0.21 M⊙. For each case, two models are computed, one with an initial minimum Toomre Q stability value ranging from 1.1 to 1.7, and one with a higher initial disk temperature, resulting in the initial minimum Q ranging from 2.2 to 3.4. These new models continue to show that GDGI can explain the formation of gas giants at distances of ∼30 to ∼50 au on eccentric orbits (e less than ∼0.2), though the number formed drops to 0 as the protostar mass decreases to 0.1 M⊙.

<div> 关键词: heliospheric models, farside observations, He ii 304 Å emission, STEREO, in situ measurements

总结: 
本文讨论了太阳圈模型面临的重要挑战，即缺乏对太阳全面观测的数据。文章提出了利用STEREO观测到的He ii 304 Å发射来获得太阳背面磁通量的新技术。研究通过比较模型预测的原位测量值与实际测量值发现，尽管存在一些数量上的差异，但这些差异远远小于太阳圈模型与实际观测数据之间的总体差异。然而，结果表明，那些显著改变开放通量与闭合通量以及总通量比值的活跃区域将对预测的原位测量结果产生最大的影响。 <br /><br /> <div>
A significant challenge facing heliospheric models is the lack of full Sun observational coverage. The lack of information about the farside photospheric magnetic field necessitates the use of various techniques to approximate the structure and appearance of this field. However, a recently developed technique that uses He ii 304 Å emission observed by the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) enables developing a magnetic flux proxy by imaging of active regions on the far side of the Sun. Incorporating information about these active regions on the far side of the Sun may have the potential to drastically improve heliospheric models. In this work, we run multiple heliospheric models with and without farside information obtained from STEREO observations of He ii 304 Å emission and compare the predicted in situ measurements from the models with real in situ data from STEREO and Earth. We find that although there are noticeable quantitative differences between the in situ predictions from the two models, they are dwarfed by the overall disagreement between the heliospheric model and the actual in situ data. Nevertheless, our results indicate that active regions that significantly change the ratio of open-to-closed and open-to-total flux create the biggest change in the predicted in situ measurements.

Based on the Insight-HXMT archival data, we have detected a new atypical low-frequency quasiperiodic oscillation (LFQPO) in the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1348−630. The new LFQPO is detected in all three instruments of Insight-HXMT with a combined significance of 3σ–5σ, covering a wide energy range of 1–100 keV. The fractional rms seems to decrease with energy. It exclusively appears in the hard state during both the main and mini outburst, spanning an X-ray intensity range by a factor of 10, and a very narrow hardness range. The frequency of this new type of LFQPO is moderately stable, in the range of 0.08–0.15 Hz. We discussed different models for the LFQPO, and found none can explain the observed properties of this new type of LFQPO.

<br /><br />总结:
2021年，加拿大氢强度映射实验（CHIME）无线电望远镜探测到536个快速无线电爆发（FRBs），并发布了一份目录。文章介绍了对其中140个FRBs的结果更新，其中包括了基带数据的分析和波形研究。可以通过望远镜的天线测量电压来最大化望远镜对主波束内任何方向的灵敏度，称为“波束成形”。通过这种方法，可以提高信噪比，将FRBs定位到次角分辨率，并校正仪器的波束响应。此外，本次更新还提供了极化信息以及数据集的基带数据。这些数据增加了对FRB极化特性的研究。 <div>
In 2021, a catalog of 536 fast radio bursts (FRBs) detected with the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) radio telescope was released by the CHIME/FRB Collaboration. This large collection of bursts, observed with a single instrument and uniform selection effects, has advanced our understanding of the FRB population. Here we update the results for 140 of these FRBs for which channelized raw voltage (“baseband”) data are available. With the voltages measured by the telescope’s antennas, it is possible to maximize the telescope sensitivity in any direction within the primary beam, an operation called “beamforming.” This allows us to increase the signal-to-noise ratios of the bursts and to localize them to subarcminute precision. The improved localizations are also used to correct the beam response of the instrument and to measure fluxes and fluences with an ∼10% uncertainty. Additionally, the time resolution is increased by 3 orders of magnitude relative to that in the first CHIME/FRB catalog, and, applying coherent dedispersion, burst morphologies can be studied in detail. Polarization information is also available for the full sample of 140 FRBs, providing an unprecedented data set to study the polarization properties of the population. We release the baseband data beamformed to the most probable position of each FRB. These data are analyzed in detail in a series of accompanying papers.

Magnetic reconnection is a fundamental process for releasing magnetic energy in space physics and astrophysics. At present, the usual way to investigate the reconnection process is through analytical studies or first-principle numerical simulations. This paper is the first to understand the turbulent magnetic reconnection process by exploring the nature of magnetic turbulence. From the perspective of radio synchrotron polarization statistics, we study how to recover the properties of the turbulent magnetic field by considering the line of sight along different directions of the reconnection layer. We find that polarization intensity statistics can reveal the spectral properties of reconnection turbulence. This work opens up a new way of understanding turbulent magnetic reconnection.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章讨论了天体物理环境的化学特性和动力学之间的密切关系，强调了对这些环境进行3D建模的必要性。然而，在3D流体动力学模拟中解决化学动力学是计算上不可行的。作者提出了一种名为mace的机器学习方法来模拟动态环境中的化学反应，通过使用自动编码器和一组潜在的常微分方程来降低化学网络的维度并对其进行时间演化。通过在PyTorch中高效实现，mace的性能优于传统方法约26倍，并且在计算上具有次线性的可扩展性。这种方法对于包括AGB喷流在内的天体物理环境的3D化学动力学模拟具有重要的应用潜力。 <div>
The chemistry of an astrophysical environment is closely coupled to its dynamics, the latter often found to be complex. Hence, to properly model these environments a 3D context is necessary. However, solving chemical kinetics within a 3D hydro simulation is computationally infeasible for even a modest parameter study. In order to develop a feasible 3D hydro-chemical simulation, the classical chemical approach needs to be replaced by a faster alternative. We present mace, a Machine-learning Approach to Chemistry Emulation, as a proof-of-concept work on emulating chemistry in a dynamical environment. Using the context of AGB outflows, we have developed an architecture that combines the use of an autoencoder (to reduce the dimensionality of the chemical network) and a set of latent ordinary differential equations (that are solved to perform the temporal evolution of the reduced features). Training this architecture with an integrated scheme makes it possible to successfully reproduce a full chemical pathway in a dynamical environment. mace outperforms its classical analog on average by a factor of 26. Furthermore, its efficient implementation in PyTorch results in a sublinear scaling with respect to the number of hydrodynamical simulation particles.

We present the second data release (DR2) of the Far-InfraREd Polarimetric Large-Area CMZ Exploration (FIREPLACE) survey. This survey utilized the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy High-resolution Airborne Wideband Camera plus instrument at 214 μm (E band) at a resolution of 19.″6 to observe thermal polarized dust emission throughout the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ). DR2 consists of observations obtained in 2022 covering the region of the CMZ extending from the Brick to the Sgr C molecular clouds (corresponding to a 1° × 0.°75 region of the sky). We combine DR2 with the first FIREPLACE data release (DR1) to obtain full coverage of the CMZ (a 1.°5 × 0.°75 region of the sky). After applying total and polarized intensity significance cuts on the full FIREPLACE data set, we obtain ∼64,000 Nyquist-sampled polarization pseudovectors. The distribution of polarization pseudovectors confirms a bimodal distribution in the CMZ magnetic field orientations, recovering field components that are oriented predominantly parallel or perpendicular to the Galactic plane. This distribution of orientations is similar to what was observed in DR1 and other studies. We also inspect the magnetic fields toward a set of prominent CMZ molecular clouds (the Brick, Three Little Pigs, 50 and 20 km s−1 clouds, circumnuclear disk, CO 0.02-0.02, and Sgr C), revealing spatially varying magnetic fields having orientations that generally trace the total intensity morphologies of the clouds. We find evidence that compression from stellar winds and shear from tidal forces are prominent mechanisms influencing the structure of the magnetic fields.

When a star undergoes core collapse, a vast amount of energy is released in a ∼10 s long burst of neutrinos of all species. Inverse beta decay in the star’s hydrogen envelope causes an electromagnetic cascade that ultimately results in a flare of gamma rays—an “echo” of the neutrino burst—at the characteristic energy of 0.511 MeV. We study the phenomenology and detectability of this flare. Its luminosity curve is characterized by a fast, seconds-long rise and an equally fast decline, with a minute- or hour-long plateau in between. For a near-Earth star (distance D ≲ 1 kpc) the echo will be observable at near future gamma-ray telescopes with an effective area of 103 cm2 or larger. Its observation will inform us on the envelope size and composition. In conjunction with the direct detection of the neutrino burst, it will also give information on the neutrino emission away from the line of sight and will enable tests of neutrino propagation effects between the stellar surface and Earth.

<div> ALMA Band 6 observations, Class II protoplanetary disks, external far-ultraviolet radiation, chemical composition, Orion Nebula Cluster

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了在奥利安星云星团边缘的两个受辐射的Class II原行星盘的化学成分。研究发现，受辐射的盘与孤立的盘没有显著差异，这表明它们距离大型Trapezium恒星足够远，使得其化学成分不再受到外部FUV辐射的影响。研究还指出，这些发现更可能与不同恒星质量相关，而非外部辐射场。为了进一步阐明外部辐射对不同类型盘中行星形成化学的影响，需要对质量较低的盘和靠近大型Trapezium恒星的盘进行更多观测。 <div>
Most stars are born in stellar clusters, and their protoplanetary disks, which are the birthplaces of planets, can, therefore, be affected by the radiation of nearby massive stars. However, little is known about the chemistry of externally irradiated disks, including whether or not their properties are similar to the so-far better-studied isolated disks. Motivated by this question, we present ALMA Band 6 observations of two irradiated Class II protoplanetary disks in the outskirts of the Orion Nebula Cluster to explore the chemical composition of disks exposed to (external) far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation fields: the 216-0939 disk and the binary system 253-1536A/B, which are exposed to radiation fields of 102–103 times the average interstellar radiation field. We detect lines from CO isotopologues, HCN, H2CO, and C2H toward both protoplanetary disks. Based on the observed disk-integrated line fluxes and flux ratios, we do not find significant differences between isolated and irradiated disks. The observed differences seem to be more closely related to the different stellar masses than to the external radiation field. This suggests that these disks are far enough away from the massive Trapezium stars, that their chemistry is no longer affected by external FUV radiation. Additional observations toward lower-mass disks and disks closer to the massive Trapezium stars are required to elucidate the level of external radiation required to make an impact on the chemistry of planet formation in different kinds of disks.

总结: 本研究就太阳高能电子谱的六种类型进行了探讨，并发现它们与太阳喷发现象的关联。具体来说，单幅功率谱(SPL)类型与硬X射线耀斑和西半球冠质物质抛射(CME)的关联较强，而上升双幂律(UDPL)类型与II型射电爆发和日冕物质抛射的关联显著，且速度更快。对于DDPL和ER类型，以及LP和DDPL类型，分别与II型射电爆发和全圆日冕物质抛射的关联较弱。此外，DDPL类型谱指数与关联CME速度呈正相关，而与耀斑强度呈负相关，而DDPL类型则相反。这些结果表明SPL类型可能是高处太阳日冕内的初始加速过程的结果，并为后续加速过程提供种子群体，形成了其他五种类型的高能电子谱。 <br /><br />

The energy spectral shape of solar energetic electron events carries important information on the energetic electron source/acceleration at the Sun. We investigate the association of six newly identified solar energetic electron spectral types with solar eruptive phenomena, including the downward double-power-law (DDPL) spectrum with break energy EB above 20 keV (DDPL ), DDPL with EB below 20 keV (DDPL ), upward double-power law (UDPL), single-power-law (SPL), Ellision–Ramaty–like (ER), and logarithmic-parabola (LP). We find that the SPL type shows (the other five types show) an association with hard X-ray flares of ∼38% (∼55%–82%) and an association with west-limb coronal mass ejections (CMEs) of ∼76% (∼85%–93%). Among the other five types, the DDPL and ER (LP and DDPL ) types only have an association with type II radio bursts of ∼7%–8% (∼16%–20%) and an association with halo CMEs of ∼5%–9% (∼11%–21%); however, the UDPL type exhibits a significant (∼47% and ∼50%) association with type II bursts and halo CMEs, with a significantly faster median CME speed of km s−1. For DDPL (DDPL ) with a positive (no) correlation between spectral indexes and no (a positive) correlation between the spectral index and break energy, the spectrum appears to be flatter as the associated CME (flare) becomes faster (stronger). These results suggest that the SPL type can result from the initial acceleration process that likely occurs high in the corona, and then provide seed populations for further acceleration processes to form the other five types: the DDPL and ER types via flare-related processes, the LP and DDPL types via CME-related processes, and the UDPL type via CME-driven shocks.

在这项研究中，通过使用JWST/NIRCam成像技术，我们对星系在“再电离纪”之前和之后的性质进行了调查，我们发现了(Hβ + [O iii])强发射体的一些重要性质，它们显示出在红移z = 5.5–7时的显著特征。在星系比星的质量和年龄之间存在着一定的关联性，并且与特定的星形成率(sSFR)呈正相关。在星形成率-星系质量平面上，这些发射体分布在主序列和星暴区，这在低星系质量时变得模糊。此外我们还发现星系的Hβ + [O iii]发射等当于具有高的特定的星形成率。因此，在研究星系的宇宙星系形成活动时，考虑到发射体和非发射体的星系是非常重要的。 <br /><br />总结: 星系的性质在再电离纪前后有显著变化，这与星系质量和特定的星形成率相关，Hβ + [O iii]和特定的星形成率相关，发射体和非发射体的星系性质相似，需要整体考虑星系形成活动。 <div>
We investigate the properties of strong (Hβ + [O iii]) emitters before and after the end of the “Epoch of Reionization” from z = 8 to z = 5.5. We make use of ultradeep JWST/NIRCam imaging in the parallel field (P2) of the MIRI Deep Imaging Survey (MIDIS) in the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field (H-XDF), in order to select prominent (Hβ + [O iii]) emitters (with rest-frame equivalent width (EW0) ≳ 100 Å) at z = 5.5–7, based on their flux density enhancement in the F356W band with respect to the spectral energy distribution continuum. We complement our selection with other (Hβ + [O iii]) emitters from the literature at similar and higher (z = 7−8) redshifts. We find (nonindependent) anticorrelations between EW0(Hβ + [O iii]) and both galaxy stellar mass and age, in agreement with previous studies, and a positive correlation with specific star formation rate (sSFR). On the SFR–M⋆ plane, the (Hβ + [O iii]) emitters populate both the star formation main sequence and the starburst region, which become indistinguishable at low stellar masses ( ). We find tentative evidence for a nonmonotonic relation between EW0(Hβ + [O iii]) and SFR, such that both parameters correlate with each other at SFR ≳ 1 M⊙ yr−1, while the correlation flattens out at lower SFRs. This suggests that low metallicities producing high EW0(Hβ + [O iii]) could be important at low SFR values. Interestingly, the properties of the strong emitters and other galaxies (33% and 67% of our z = 5.5–7 sample, respectively) are similar, including, in many cases, high sSFR. Therefore, it is crucial to consider both emitters and nonemitters to obtain a complete picture of the cosmic star formation activity around the Epoch of Reionization.

火星的形成过程中，挥发性物质如水、氢和碳在大气层、地幔和地核中的分布情况进行了分析。这种挥发性物质的分配对于影响内在磁场的产生、地幔对流和岩浆活动至关重要。研究表明，形成过程导致了火星地幔和地核中存在水和轻元素。研究采用了一种混合型原大气模型，考虑了上层由星云成分构成，下层由简化构建模块的撞击脱气成分构成。数值分析暗示，在火星大约达到现在一半大小后，形成这种高温高压的岩浆海会引发水蒸气、碳和氢从原始大气层迁移到行星内部。最终，大约数百亿吨的水可能已经分布到地幔中，并且如果再次通过撞击脱气形成塔尔西斯高原的洪水玄武岩，可能已经补给了火星古代的海洋。与此同时，数百亿吨的碳和数百亿吨的氢（相当于数百亿吨的H2O）发现分布在地核中。尽管硫的分布被简化为所有的硫都在地核中，但硫占地核质量的14%到19%的结果与“洞察”号所建议的地核密度一致。 <br /><br />总结: 火星形成过程中，水、碳和氢等挥发性物质从原始大气层迁移到内部，供给了火星古代海洋的水，分布在地幔和地核中。同时，硫主要分布在地核中。 <div>
We analyze the distribution of volatiles such as water, hydrogen, and carbon within the atmosphere, mantle, and core of Mars during its accretion stages. The partitioning of these volatiles is crucial as it influences the generation of intrinsic magnetic fields, mantle convection, and magmatic activity. The study suggests that the accretion process is responsible for the presence of water and light elements within the Martian mantle and core. We employ a hybrid-type proto-atmosphere model, which considers an upper layer composed of nebula components and a lower layer made up of degassed components from the impact degassing of the simplified building blocks based on the two-component model. Our numerical analysis implies that the formation of a magma ocean at this high temperature and pressure after around the half-size of the present Mars triggers the migration of water vapor, carbon, and hydrogen from the primordial atmosphere into the planetary interior. Ultimately, several 1021 kg of water could have been distributed to the mantle and, if degassed again by the formation of flood basalts on the Tharsis Plateau, could have supplied Mars’ ancient oceans. Meanwhile, several 1020 kg of carbon and 1019 kg of hydrogen (equivalent to 1020 kg H2O) were found to be distributed in the core. Although the distribution of sulfur was simplified so that all of the sulfur is in the core, a result of sulfur accounting for 14 wt% to 19 wt.% of the core mass would be consistent with the core density suggested by InSight.

<br /><br />
这篇文章报告了用30 μJy beam−1敏感度的525 MHz宽带(uGMRT图)发现的J0644+1043无线电星系的S形态结构。通过2米罗兹恒星望远镜对宿主星系的专门光谱观测得到了红移为0.0488，给出了异常无线电结构的投影线性尺度超过0.7 Mpc。这个巨型无线电星系由质量为M⊙的黑洞驱动，从其附近发出良好准直和有节状的射流，每个射流长约100 kpc。整个无线电结构可能是由于有效的射流进动而形成，年龄不到50百万年，1.4 GHz功率约为6×1024 W Hz−1，并且观察到的形态特征并不严格符合传统的Fanaroff–Riley (FR) FR I或FR II类别。
<br /> 
总结: 本文报道了J0644+1043无线电星系的S形态结构发现、红移测量结果和相关特征，包括射流长度和功率等信息。研究指出这种巨型无线电星系可能是由于有效的射流进动造成的，其特征不符合传统的FR I或FR II分类。 <div>
We report the discovery of an S-shaped morphology of the radio galaxy J0644+1043 imaged with a 30 μJy beam−1 sensitive 525 MHz broadband (bands 3 + 4) uGMRT map. Dedicated spectroscopic observations of the host galaxy carried out with the 2 m Rozhen telescope yielded a redshift of 0.0488, giving a projected linear size of the peculiar radio structure of over 0.7 Mpc. This giant radio galaxy is powered by a black hole of mass M⊙, from the vicinity of which emanate well-collimated and knotty jets, each ∼100 kpc long. The entire radio structure, presumably due to the effective jet precession, is less than 50 Myr old, has a power of ∼6 × 1024 W Hz−1 at 1.4 GHz, and has observed morphological characteristics that do not strictly conform to the traditional Fanaroff–Riley (FR) FR I or FR II categories.

<title>Reverse Shock Revisited in Cassiopeia A with Chandra</title>

<div> 关键词: Chandra X-ray Observatory, 反冲冲击, 超新星遗迹, 辐射谱学, 速度测量<br />
总结: 通过查看超新星遗迹Cassiopeia A的数据，利用Chandra X射线天文台的数据，研究了其中的反冲冲击现象。从S/Si Kα线流量比和Fe Kα线重心能量的径向分布图中可以看出，它们都呈单调增加的趋势，确认了Si和Fe丰富的喷射物质被反冲冲击加热。在Cassiopeia A中，S和Si线流量比的突然变化明显可见，从而确定了反冲冲击的位置，在观测者框架内，北西方向约为3950±210 km/s，南东方向约为2900±260 km/s。同时，喷射物质的框架内速度为北西方约为1150 km/s，南东方约为1300 km/s。通过测量得到的反冲冲击速度与X射线和/或光学图像获得的速度非常一致。这表明爆发星的非对称爆炸对反冲冲击和喷射物质的相互作用起着关键作用，最终塑造了超新星遗迹中观察到的复杂特征。 <br /><br /> <div>
Using data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory, we revisit the reverse shock in the supernova remnant (SNR) Cassiopeia A. Based on spectroscopy of a series of annuli in the northwest (NW) and southeast (SE), we get the radial profiles of the S/Si Kα line flux ratio and Fe Kα line centroid energy. They both show monotonic increase, confirming that the Si- and Fe-rich ejecta are heated by the reverse shock. The abrupt change of the S and Si line flux ratio is clearly observed in Cassiopeia A, leading to the determination of the reverse-shock location (∼1.′71 0.′16 and ∼1.′35 0.′18 in the NW and SE, with respect to the central source). By comparing the radial profiles of the S and Si line flux, we find that the reverse shock is moving outward in the frame of the observer, and the velocities are ∼3950 ± 210 km s−1 and ∼2900 ± 260 km s−1 in the NW and SE, respectively. In contrast, the velocities become ∼1150 km s−1 (NW) and ∼1300 km s−1 (SE) in the ejecta frame. Our measured reverse-shock velocities are quite consistent with those obtained from the X-ray and/or optical images. They therefore supply a cross-check of the accuracy for the two available methods for measuring the reverse-shock velocity in SNRs. Both the location and the velocity of the reverse shock show apparent asymmetry, suggesting that the asymmetric explosion of the progenitor plays a key role in the interaction between the reverse shock and the ejecta, ultimately shaping the complex features observed in SNRs.

总结:
本研究利用磁层多尺度探测器的高频数据首次证实了在电子尺度上存在周期调制的重连现象。这种周期调制被认为是由X线施加的有限磁场阱所导致的，这产生了离散的、色散的电子条纹。这些色散的条纹很好地由一个磁场阱损失转换模型所重现，它们周期性地打破了冻结条件并驱动能量耗散。这种电子转换效应消除了自由电子，增强了电子混合，并产生了高度结构化的三维分布，这产生了强烈的无线电辐射。这些启示性的结果表明，重连过程具有固有的由三维电子物理学确定的周期性，为理解空间和天体等离子体中重连驱动的能量传输提供了关键的见解。 <div>
We present the first evidence for periodically modulated reconnection at the electron scale in space, using unparalleled, high-cadence data from Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft. The periodic modulation is attributed to finite magnetic trapping imposed by the X-line, which generates discrete, dispersive electron stripes. The dispersive stripes, well reproduced by a trapping-loss transition model, periodically break the frozen-in condition and drive energy dissipation. Such an electron transition effect eliminates free electrons, enhances electron mixing, and causes highly structured, three-dimensional distributions that generate intense radio emissions. These illuminating results, suggesting that reconnection hosts inherent periodicity determined by three-dimensional electron physics, provide crucial insights into understanding reconnection-driven energy transport in space and astrophysical plasmas.

We present early-time ground-based optical follow-up observations of GRB 180418A, which was discovered by both Swift/BAT and Fermi/GBM. Its broadband afterglow was well monitored by Swift/XRT and ground-based optical telescopes. The optical light curve of GRB 180418A can be modeled by forward shock (FS) plus reverse shock (RS). We fit the light curves with standard external shock models and derive the physical properties of the outflow. It is found that the ratio RB ≡ εB,r/εB,f is 11.22, indicating a moderate degree of magnetization in the RS region. The reported duration of GRB 180418A, T90, lies in the intermediate region between short and long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We further discuss the classification of GRB 180418A, and calculate ε = Eγ,iso,52/Ep,z,2 values of 0.026 and 0.018 (assuming the redshift z is 1.0 and 1.5, respectively), which is closer to short GRBs (SGRBs) in the ε-T90,z plane. If GRB 180418A is an SGRB, it is the only reported SGRB thus far with RS emission in optical light curves. In order to compare the properties of GRB 180418A, we collected three SGRBs that may have RS emission (GRBs 060313, 090426, and 210207B) and also 22 long GRBs (LGRBs) with RS emission. We find that the parameters of LGRBs are in a wider range than those of SGRBs. Also, SGRBs appear to have very small RB values, but the results are generally similar to those of LGRBs. The fitting parameters of GRB 180418A are generally consistent with those of the other three SGRBs, implying that GRB 180418A may belong to the category of SGRBs.

总结:<br />
本研究使用了Grid Agnostic Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) for Extended Research Applications (GAMERA)模型对木星磁尾重新连接进行了模拟。研究结果表明，木星磁尾重新连接主要发生在午夜和午夜后区域，并受太阳风影响。太阳风增压会压缩木星磁层，减少重新连接的发生。研究验证了GAMERA模型在模拟木星磁层中的适用性，为我们提供了对木星磁层动态结构和太阳风响应的新见解。 <div>
In this study, we employ the Grid Agnostic Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) for Extended Research Applications (GAMERA), a high-resolving-power, three-dimensional global MHD model, to simulate magnetotail reconnection in Jupiter's magnetosphere. While previous satellite observations have provided initial statistics on magnetotail reconnection properties at Jupiter, they have been limited in spacetime coverage, leaving the dynamic process of Jovian magnetotail reconnection and its response to the solar wind (SW) poorly understood. Using MHD simulations, we quantitatively analyze the temporal evolution and spatial dependence of nightside reconnection in Jupiter's magnetotail under ideal quiet and enhanced SW conditions. Our results demonstrate that magnetotail reconnection tends to occur in the midnight and postmidnight sectors, with a low occurrence in the premidnight sector, consistent with both Galileo and Juno observations and predictions by Delamere & Bagenal. The magnetic local time (MLT)–radial distribution of magnetotail reconnection is broad, indicating that Jovian magnetotail reconnection is always dynamic rather than steady state. Enhanced SW ram pressure can decrease the MLT coverage of magnetotail reconnection by compressing Jupiter's magnetosphere. However, the occurrence of magnetotail reconnection near the midnight and postmidnight sectors is enhanced by SW compression beyond 60 RJ, but is not significantly impacted by SW compression within 60 RJ. Conversely, SW compression suppresses reconnection in the premidnight sector, leading to a stronger dawn–dusk asymmetry in the occurrence and location of magnetotail reconnection. This study validates the applicability of the GAMERA code for simulating Jupiter’s magnetosphere and provides complementary insights into the dynamic structure and the SW response of Jupiter’s magnetosphere.

在最近的研究中，发现了显示星系动力学特性的普遍关系。其中，径向加速度关系（RAR）是最受欢迎的关系之一，可以视为连接星系中的动力学径向加速度和重子加速度的普遍法则。这揭示了暗物质与星系中的重子物质之间意想不到的密切联系。本文通过对最近强大的银河旋转曲线分析，导出了银河RAR（GRAR），首次表明所谓的最佳拟合通用RAR与GRAR数据偏离超过5σ。这为以往研究所声称的星系中RAR的普遍性提供了强有力的证据。 <br /><br />总结: 宇宙学研究发现了一种普遍关系，即径向加速度关系（RAR），它连接了星系中的动力学径向加速度和重子加速度。然而，最新研究表明，这种普遍性可能不存在，并且在银河RAR数据方面存在显著偏差。这一发现为以往研究的观点提供了强有力的反驳。 <div>
In the past few decades, many studies revealed that there exist some apparent universal relations that can describe the dynamical properties in galaxies. In particular, the radial acceleration relation (RAR) is one of the most popular relations discovered recently that can be regarded as a universal law to connect the dynamical radial acceleration with the baryonic acceleration in galaxies. This has revealed an unexpected close connection between dark matter and baryonic matter in galaxies. In this article, by following the recent robust Galactic rotation curve analyzes, we derive the Galactic RAR (GRAR) and show for the first time that the alleged best-fit universal RAR deviates from the GRAR data at more than 5σ. This provides a strong evidence to falsify the universal nature of RAR in galaxies claimed in past studies.

We provide one of the most comprehensive metallicity studies at z ∼ 4 by analyzing the UV/optical Hubble Space Telescope photometry and rest-frame Very Large Telescope (VLT)/FORS2 UV and VLT/XSHOOTER optical spectra of J0332−3557, a gravitationally lensed galaxy magnified by a factor of 20. With a 5σ detection of the auroral O iii] λ1666 line, we are able to derive a direct gas metallicity estimate for our target. We find Zgas , which is compatible with an increase of both the gas fraction and the outflow metal loading factor from z ∼ 0 to z ∼ 4. J0332−3557 is the most metal-rich individual galaxy at z ∼ 4 for which the C/O ratio has been measured. We derive a low log(C/O) = −1.02 ± 0.2, which suggests that J0332−3557 is in the early stages of interstellar medium carbon enrichment driven mostly by massive stars. The low C/O abundance also indicates that J0332−3557 is characterized by a low star formation efficiency, higher yields of oxygen, and longer burst duration. We find that EWC III]1906,9 is as low as ∼3 Å, and the main drivers of the low EWC III]1906,9 are the higher gas metallicity and the low C/O abundance. J0332−3557 is characterized by one diffuse and two more compact regions ∼1 kpc in size. We find that the carbon emission mostly originates in the compact knots. Our study on J0332−3557 serves as an anchor for studies investigating the evolution of metallicity and C/O abundance across different redshifts.

总结:
本研究考察了围绕恒星的类地行星在潜在的适居区的可居住性。磁场的存在和强度以及与恒星磁场的相互作用是影响外行星可能适居性的关键因素之一。同时，行星需有足够强大的磁场来抵御恒星活动的影响，并且需远离恒星以避免直接的磁场连接。研究发现，84颗外行星满足这些条件，并且被认为是未来寻找外星生命迹象的最佳目标。 <div>
Considerable interest has centered on Earth-like planets orbiting in the circumstellar habitable zone (CHZ) of its star. However, the potential habitability of an exoplanet depends upon a number of additional factors, including the presence and strength of any planetary magnetic field and the interaction of this field with that of the host star. Not only must the exoplanet have a strong enough magnetic field to shield against stellar activity, but it must also orbit far enough from the star to avoid direct magnetic connectivity. We characterize stellar activity by the star’s Rossby number, Ro, the ratio of stellar rotation rate to convective turnover time. We employ a scaled model of the solar magnetic field to determine the star’s Alfvén radius, the distance at which the stellar wind becomes super-Alfvénic. Planets residing within the Alfvén surface may have a direct magnetic connection to the star and therefore not be the most viable candidates for habitability. Here, we determine the Rossby number of a sample of 1053 exoplanet-hosting stars for which the rotation rates have been observed and for which a convective turnover time can be calculated. We find that 84 exoplanets in our sample have orbits which lie inside the CHZ and that also lie outside the star’s Alfvén surface: 34 of these have been classified as terran (11) or superterran (23) planets. Applying the Alfvén surface habitability criterion yields a subset of the confirmed exoplanets that may be optimal targets for future observations in the search for signatures of life.

We present the Galaxy Assembly and Interaction Neural Networks (Gainn), a series of artificial neural networks for predicting the redshift, stellar mass, halo mass, and mass-weighted age of simulated galaxies based on James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) photometry. Our goal is to determine the best neural network for predicting these variables at 11 < z < 15. The parameters of the optimal neural network can then be used to estimate these variables for real, observed galaxies. The inputs of the neural networks are JWST filter magnitudes of a subset of five broadband filters (F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, and F444W) and two medium-band filters (F162M and F182M). We compare the performance of the neural networks using different combinations of these filters, as well as different activation functions and numbers of layers. The best neural network predicted redshift with a normalized rms error of , stellar mass with rms = , halo mass with a mean-squared error of , and mass-weighted age with rms = . We also test the performance of Gainn on real data from MACS0647JD, an object observed by JWST. Predictions from Gainn for the first projection of the object (JD1) have normalized bias 〈Δz〉 < 0.00228, which is significantly smaller than found with template-fitting methods. We find that the optimal filter combination is F277W, F356W, F162M, and F200W when considering both theoretical accuracy and observational resources from JWST.

该研究通过对30 Doradus地区H2CO的观测，揭示了R136恒星团对周围气体的影响。研究发现，随着距离R136的距离增加，气体动力学温度呈下降趋势，暗示了恒星的加热作用。另外，研究结果表明机械加热对H2CO测量温度的影响不明显。此外，在ALMA的CO观测中并未观察到R136附近的机械反馈增强的迹象。该地区的宇宙射线通量估计不确定，但可能解释了观测到的温度情况。研究还表明，H2CO发射气体受R136直接辐射和光解区光电加热的影响。总结: 该研究通过H2CO的观测揭示了R136恒星团对周围气体的影响，并探讨了加热机制和宇宙射线通量的可能性。 <div>
Feedback from star formation is a critical component of the evolution of galaxies and their interstellar medium. At parsec scales internal to molecular clouds, however, the observed signatures of that feedback on the physical properties of CO-emitting gas have often been weak or inconclusive. We present subparsec observations of H2CO in the 30 Doradus region, which contains the massive star cluster R136 that is clearly exerting feedback on its neighboring gas. H2CO provides a direct measure of gas kinetic temperature, and we find a trend of decreasing temperature with projected distance from R136 that may be indicative of gas heating by the stars. While it has been suggested that mechanical heating affects H2CO-measured temperature, we do not observe any correlation between TK and line width. The lack of an enhancement in mechanical feedback close to R136 is consistent with the absence of a radial trend in gravitational boundedness seen the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array CO observations. Estimates of cosmic-ray flux in the region are quite uncertain, but can plausibly explain the observed temperatures if R136 itself is the dominant local source of energetic protons. The observations presented here are also consistent with the H2CO-emitting gas near R136 being dominated by direct radiation from R136 and photoelectric heating in the photodissociation regions.

<div> 宇宙尘埃（diffuse lights）, N体模拟（N-body simulations）, 星系（galaxies）, 组和团（groups and clusters）, 红移（redshift）
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章探讨了宇宙尘埃在红移为1.5时的形成情况和主要形成机制。研究发现，无论宿主暗物质晕的质量或动力状态如何，贡献宇宙尘埃的Typical progenitors都以含有大量星系的巨型星系的形式进入暗物质晕。此外，在未动态稳定或更庞大的宿主暗物质晕中，来自含有大质量的Typical progenitors的宇宙尘埃更加显著，且其中一半以上已经在进入宿主暗物质晕之前经历了预处理过程。宇宙尘埃的主要形成机制是卫星星系的剥离过程，而40%-45%的宇宙尘埃星系与最明亮星系的合并树相关。此外，宇宙尘埃在具有相似质量的宿主暗物质晕中所占的比例随着红移的增加而减少，但在z=1.5时已经相当可观（约为10%）。然而，值得注意的是，与可观测半径和微弱表面亮度相关的探测限制可能会掩盖大量宇宙尘埃星系，甚至改变宇宙尘埃的主要形成渠道。 <div>
We explore the formation of the intragroup light and intracluster light, representing diffuse lights within groups and clusters, from the point that z = 1.5. For this, we perform multiresolution cosmological N-body simulations using the “galaxy replacement technique” and identify the progenitors in which the diffuse light stars existed when they fell into the groups or clusters. Our findings reveal that typical progenitors contributing to diffuse lights enter the host halo with massive galaxies containing a stellar mass of , regardless of the mass or dynamical state of the host halos at z = 0. In cases where the host halos are dynamically unrelaxed or more massive, diffuse lights from massive progenitors with are more prominent, with over half of them already preprocessed before entering the host halo. Additionally, we find that the main formation mechanism of diffuse lights is the stripping process of satellites, and a substantial fraction (40%–45%) of diffuse light stars are linked to the merger tree of the brightest cluster galaxy. Remarkably, all trends persist for groups and clusters at higher redshifts. The fraction of diffuse lights in the host halos with a similar mass decreases as the redshift increases, but they are already substantial at z = 1.5 (∼10%). However, it is crucial to acknowledge that detection limits related to the observable radius and faint-end surface brightness may obscure numerous diffuse light stars and even alter the main formation channel of diffuse lights.

总结:
研究人员使用CoCoNuT-FMT代码模拟了3D磁转变超新星模型的内部喷射产生的核合成产物。结果显示，强磁场可以提取原中子星的转动能量，导致爆炸比 typcial 的中微子驱动超新星早且更有能量（约3×1051 erg）。与无磁参考模型相比，磁转变模型的喷射物具有更多的中子丰富成分，Ye值降至约0.25。后处理计算表明，磁转变模型能够产生重元素，直到质量数约130。分析显示，两个磁转变模型（初始磁场强度分别为1010 G和1012 G）在重元素合成方面几乎没有差异，这与它们类似的爆炸动力学一致。此外，磁转变模型产生的放射性的56Ni质量约为0.19和0.14 M☉，接近超新星核合成的镍质量。研究结果已在Zenodo上公开发布，可供与恒星丰度图案比较，并用于建模银河化学演化，并与其他产物计算进行比较。这些结果丰富了三维磁转变超新星模拟的核合成产物研究，有助于量化产物的不确定性。 <div>
Core-collapse supernova (CCSN) explosions powered by rotation and magnetic fields present an interesting astrophysical site for nucleosynthesis that potentially contributes to the production of r-process elements. Here we present yields of the innermost ejecta in 3D magnetorotational CCSN models simulated using the CoCoNuT-FMT code. Strong magnetic fields tap the rotational energy of the proto−neutron star and lead to earlier and more energetic (∼3 × 1051 erg) explosions than typical neutrino-driven CCSNe. Compared to a reference nonmagnetic model, the ejecta in the magnetorotational models have much more neutron-rich components with Ye down to ∼0.25. Our post-processing calculations with the reaction network SkyNet show significant production of weak r-process elements up to mass number ∼130. We find negligible differences in the synthesis of heavy elements between two magnetorotational models with different initial field strengths of 1010 and 1012 G, in accord with their similar explosion dynamics. The magnetorotational models produce about ∼0.19 and 0.14 M☉ of radioactive 56Ni, on the low end of inferred hypernova nickel masses. The yields are publicly available at Zenodo (doi: 10.5281/zenodo.10578981) for comparison with stellar abundance patterns, inclusion in modeling galactic chemical evolution, and comparison with other yield calculations. Our results add to the yet-restricted corpus of nucleosynthesis yields from 3D magnetorotational supernova simulations and will help quantify yield uncertainties.

总结: 
本文报告了一个包含碳丰富的Wolf–Rayet星和一个OB星的长周期双星系统WR 125的最新观测结果。该系统出现了自1991年以来首次被NEOWISE-R探测到的红外暴发。研究者利用新的近红外和中红外光度测量数据验证了这两次暴发的一致性，并推导出了该系统的轨道周期。另外，通过光谱测量和分析，他们还确定了该系统的轨道偏心率，并对尘埃的性质和温度进行了研究。这些观测结果为未来的观测规划和尘埃形成的Wolf–Rayet双星系统研究提供了重要参考。<br /><br /> <div>
Several long-period binaries with a carbon-rich Wolf–Rayet star and an OB star produce dust in their wind collisions. In eccentric binaries, this is seen most strongly near periastron passage. The exact conditions leading to dust creation require the orbital properties to be determined, which is difficult owing to their long periods. Recently, the binary system WR 125 (WC7 + O9III) began a dust-creation episode seen through an infrared outburst first detected by NEOWISE-R, which was the first outburst detected since 1991. We present new near- and mid-infrared photometry, which we use to show consistency between the two outbursts and derive an orbital period of yr. We use a long time series of optical spectra to place the first constraints on its orbital elements, on the assumption that this system will produce dust near periastron. The orbit has a mild eccentricity of 0.29 ± 0.12 and is only derived for the Wolf–Rayet component, as the O star’s radial velocities have noise that is likely larger than the expected semiamplitude of the orbit. We also present SOFIA/FORCAST grism spectroscopy to examine the infrared spectral energy distribution of the dust during this outburst, comparing its properties to other WCd binaries, and deriving a dust temperature of 580 K in 2021. This collection of observations will allow us to plan future observations of this system and place the system in the context of dust-creating Wolf–Rayet binaries.

We report the results of an extensive set of simulations exploring the sensitivity of the BlackCAT CubeSat to long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). BlackCAT is a NASA APRA-funded CubeSat mission for the detection and real-time subarcminute localization of high-redshift (z ≳ 3.5) GRBs. Thanks to their luminous and long-lived afterglow emissions, GRBs are uniquely valuable probes of high-redshift star-forming galaxies and the intergalactic medium. In addition, each detected GRB with a known redshift serves to localize a region of high-redshift star formation in three dimensions, enabling deep follow-on searches for host galaxies and associated local and large-scale structures. We explore two distinct models for the GRB redshift distribution and luminosity function, both consistent with Swift observations. We find that, for either model, BlackCAT is expected to detect a mean of 42 bursts per year on orbit, with 6.7% to 10% of these at z > 3.5. BlackCAT bursts will be localized to an r90 ≲ 55″ precision and reported to the community within seconds. Due to the mission orbit and pointing scheme, bursts will be located in the night sky and well placed for deep multiwavelength follow-up observations. BlackCAT is on schedule to achieve launch readiness in 2025.

这篇文章讨论了天体物理中微中微子IC220405B和最近报道的极端高能潮汐撕裂事件(TDE)候选对象AT2021lwx (ZTF20abrbeie, 别名“Scary Barbie”)之间可能的关联。尽管TDE与重建的中微子事件方向相差2°6'（超出90%置信水平定位区域之外），但TDE候选对象与迄今为止报道的中微子-TDE关联具有一些重要特征：强红外灰尘回波、高玻色度光度、相对于峰值质量吸积率存在约百天的中微子时间延迟和高观测到的X射线光度。我们使用各向同性辐射模型来解释这种新的关联，其中中微子是由加速质子与红外光子碰撞产生的。在考虑AT2021lwx的高红移之后（通过在超大质量黑洞(SMBH)框架中解释数据），我们发现预期的中微子通量和中微子时间延迟在 qualitatively 上与其他TDEs是可比较的。由于数据仅在SMBH框架内的峰值后300天可用，灰尘回波解释存在显著的不确定性，因此在预测检测到的中微子数量方面也存在不确定性。我们建议对这个物体进行进一步的延长期跟踪，并建议在这种特殊情况下修改中微子到达方向的重建。 <br /><br />总结: 中微子IC220405B与高能潮汐撕裂事件AT2021lwx可能存在关联，尽管它们的方向有所偏差，但它们共享了一些重要的特征，如红外灰尘回波、高玻色度光度、中微子时间延迟和高观测X射线光度。使用各向同性辐射模型解释这种新的关联后，发现预期的中微子通量和中微子时间延迟与其他潮汐撕裂事件是可比较的，并建议对该物体进行进一步跟踪。 <div>
We discuss the possible association of an astrophysical neutrino (IC220405B) with the recently reported, extremely energetic tidal disruption event (TDE) candidate AT2021lwx (ZTF20abrbeie, aka “Scary Barbie”) at redshift z = 0.995. Although the TDE is about 2.°6 off the direction of the reconstructed neutrino event (outside the 90% confidence level localization region), the TDE candidate shares some important characteristics with so-far-reported neutrino–TDE associations: a strong infrared dust echo, high bolometric luminosity, a neutrino time delay with respect to the peak mass accretion rate of the order of a hundred days, and a high observed X-ray luminosity. We interpret this new association using an isotropic emission model, where neutrinos are produced by the collision of accelerated protons with infrared photons. After accounting for the high redshift of AT2021lwx (by interpreting the data in the supermassive black hole (SMBH) frame), we find that the expected neutrino fluences and neutrino time delays are qualitatively comparable to the other TDEs. Since data are only available up to 300 days postpeak in the SMBH frame, significant uncertainties exist in the dust echo interpretation, and therefore in the predicted number of neutrinos detected, . We recommend further follow-up of this object for an extended period and suggest refining the reconstruction of the neutrino arrival direction in this particular case.

<title>Infrared Band Strengths of Dangling OH Features in Amorphous Water at 20 K</title>

Infrared (IR) spectra of vapor-deposited amorphous water at low temperatures show two weak peaks at around 3720 and 3696 cm−1 assigned to free-OH stretching modes of two- and three-coordinated water molecules (so-called “dangling” OH bonds), respectively, on the ice surface. A recent JWST observation first succeeded in detection of a potential dangling OH feature at 3664 cm−1 for ices in molecular clouds, highlighting the importance of dangling OH bonds in interstellar ice chemistry. A lack of band strengths of these features at low temperatures restricts the quantification of dangling OH bonds from IR spectra, hindering development of a molecular-level understanding of the surface structure and chemistry of ice. Using IR multiple-angle incidence resolution spectrometry, we quantified the band strengths of two- and three-coordinated dangling OH features in amorphous water at 20 K as being 4.6 ± 1.6 × 10−18 and 9.1 ± 1.0 × 10−18 cm molecule−1, respectively. These values are more than an order of magnitude lower than band strengths of bulk-water molecules in ice and liquid water and are similar to those of H2O monomers confined in solid matrices. Adsorption of carbon monoxide with dangling OH bonds results in the appearance of a new broad dangling OH feature at 3680–3620 cm−1, with a band strength of 1.8 ± 0.1 × 10−17 cm molecule−1. The band strengths of dangling OH features determined in this study advance our understanding of the surface structure of interstellar ice analogs and recent IR observations of the JWST.

<title>Numerical Simulation of Equal Ratio Relations for the Peak Intensities of >10 MeV Energetic Protons</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Previous studies have highlighted the significance of perpendicular diffusion in the decay phase of particle intensities for >10 MeV energetic protons. Recently, an observational study has indicated that the peak intensity ratios across different energy channels (13−64 MeV protons) remain almost constant as the spacecraft location varies in many solar proton events. This interesting phenomenon is referred to as equal ratio relations. These findings suggest that perpendicular diffusion not only affects particle intensity during the decay phase but also throughout the rising phase. In this study, we perform numerical simulations of >10 MeV energetic proton events observed by STEREO A, STEREO B, and the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory. Our findings demonstrate that perpendicular diffusion strongly affects the entire time profile of particle intensity for spacecraft not magnetically connected to the source region. The numerical simulation results indicate that in order to reproduce observations, we need to include perpendicular diffusion near the source region and in interplanetary space. Perpendicular diffusion leads to nearly uniform peak ratios at different locations and contributes to the formation of the reservoir phenomenon during the decay phase. Consequently, these numerical results support the significant role of perpendicular diffusion in the formation of the longitudinal distribution of >10 MeV proton events.

The stellar spectra from the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) medium-resolution survey can be used to search for compact objects in binaries. The LAMOST Data Release 10 catalog includes >980,000 targets with multiple medium-resolution spectra. We select the targets with large or rapid radial-velocity variation, and obtained an input sample of 1822 sources. We use light curves and spectra to identify and exclude eclipsing binaries and double-lined spectroscopic binaries in the input sample. We finally derive a catalog of 89 candidates with well-folded radial velocity, which are all single-lined spectroscopic binaries, indicating an unseen companion residing in each system. The mass function of each system can be well constrained based on the radial-velocity curve. In our sample, 26 sources have mass function higher than 0.1 M⊙, among which 18 sources have ellipsoidal-type light curves. In our opinion, compact objects are likely existent in all these 26 binaries, which are worth follow-up identification.

总结:<br /><br />本研究使用N-体模拟模拟了巨行星系统的不稳定演化过程，从共振的初始条件开始，经过盘的消散和其他阶段。通过比较合成系统的周期比和标准化角动量分布与长周期木星型行星的观测统计，得出了关于轨道迁移速率、气体驱动偏心率阻尼效率和典型初始多重性的约束条件。研究发现，倾向于初始条件密集、阻尼效果较弱和巨行星数目较高。此外，模型表明，共振链的起源并不能以足够高的速率通过共面高偏心率路径形成热木星，以解释它们的观测普遍性。 <div>
Orbital evolution is a critical process that sculpts planetary systems, particularly during their early stages where planet–disk interactions are expected to lead to the formation of resonant chains. Despite the theoretically expected prominence of such configurations, they are scarcely observed among long-period giant exoplanets. This disparity suggests an evolutionary sequence wherein giant planet systems originate in compact multiresonant configurations, but subsequently become unstable, eventually relaxing to wider orbits—a phenomenon mirrored in our own solar system’s early history. In this work, we present a suite of N-body simulations that model the instability-driven evolution of giant planet systems, originating from resonant initial conditions, through phases of disk dispersal and beyond. By comparing the period ratio and normalized angular momentum distributions of our synthetic aggregate of systems with the observational census of long-period Jovian planets, we derive constraints on the expected rate of orbital migration, the efficiency of gas-driven eccentricity damping, and typical initial multiplicity. Our findings reveal a distinct inclination toward densely packed initial conditions, weak damping, and high giant planet multiplicities. Furthermore, our models indicate that resonant chain origins do not facilitate the formation of Hot Jupiters via the coplanar high-eccentricity pathway at rates high enough to explain their observed prevalence.

<br /><br />
这篇文章报告了使用Atacama大型毫米/亚毫米阵列从快速无线电暴(FRB) 20191001A的宿主星系中检测到CO(2-1)发射线，其空间分辨率达到0.9″(相当于3.5千秒差距) ，红移z = 0.2340。这是以宇宙距离探测到的第一个FRB宿主星系的空间分辨CO发射。推断出宿主星系的分子气体质量为(2.3 ± 0.4) × 1010M⊙，表明其富含气体，所得的分子气体比例μgas = 0.50 ± 0.22。这种分子气体质量和宿主星系的恒星形成率SFR = (8.06 ± 2.42) M⊙ yr−1，与其他FRB宿主星系观察到的分子气体质量Mgas = 9.6 × 108M⊙和SFR = 0.90M⊙ yr−1有所不同。这进一步证实了FRB可能起源于多样化星系环境中的单个或多个祖先的假设。基于观察到的速度场建模，分子气体盘主要由有序的循环旋转主导，尽管宿主星系有一个富含气体的伴星系，投影距离约为25 kpc。FRB祖先的形成可能并不是由这种相互作用触发的。我们推导了FRB检测点的分子气体柱密度的3σ上限为<2.1 × 1021 cm−2。

<br /><br />总结: 
- 通过ALMA探测到FRB宿主星系的CO(2-1)发射线，第一次在宇宙距离实现了这一成就。
- 推测宿主星系的分子气体质量和星形成率与其他FRB宿主星系有所不同，支持FRB可能起源于不同星系环境的假设。
- 分子气体盘显示出有序循环旋转，伴星系的影响可能并不是FRB祖先形成的触发因素。 <div>
We report the detection of the CO(2–1) emission line with a spatial resolution of 0.″9 (3.5 kpc) from the host galaxy of the fast radio burst (FRB), FRB 20191001A at z = 0.2340, using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. This is the first detection of spatially resolved CO emission from the host galaxy of an FRB at a cosmological distance. The inferred molecular gas mass of the host galaxy is (2.3 ± 0.4) × 1010M⊙, indicating that it is gas-rich, as evidenced by the measured molecular gas fraction μgas = 0.50 ± 0.22. This molecular gas mass and the star formation rate of the host, SFR = (8.06 ± 2.42) M⊙ yr−1, differ from those observed in the other FRB host galaxies with the average Mgas = 9.6 × 108M⊙ and SFR = 0.90M⊙ yr−1. This lends further credibility to the hypothesis that FRBs may originate from single or multiple progenitors across a diverse range of galaxy environments. Based on the observed velocity field modeling, we find that the molecular gas disk is dominated by an ordered circular rotation, despite the fact that the host galaxy has a gas-rich companion galaxy with a projected separation of ∼25 kpc. The formation of the FRB’s progenitor might not have been triggered by this interaction. We derive the 3σ upper limit of the molecular gas column density at the FRB detection site to be <2.1 × 1021 cm−2 with a 3σ upper limit.

There are two classes of gamma-ray transients with a duration shorter than 2 s. One consists of cosmic short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) taking place in the deep Universe via the neutron star mergers, and the other is the magnetar giant flares (GFs) with energies of ∼1044 − 1046 erg from “nearby” galaxies. Though the magnetar GFs and the short GRBs have rather similar temporal and spectral properties, their energies (Eγ,iso) are different by quite a few orders of magnitude and hence can be distinguished supposing the host galaxies have been robustly identified. The newly observed GRB 231115A has been widely discussed as a new GF event for its high probability of being associated with M82. Here we conduct a detailed analysis of its prompt emission observed by Fermi-GBM and compare the parameters with existing observations. The prompt gamma-ray emission properties of GRB 231115A, if associated with M82, nicely follow the Ep,z–Eγ,iso relation of the GFs, where Ep,z is the peak energy of the gamma-ray spectrum after the redshift (z) correction. To be a short GRB, the redshift needs to be ∼1. Though such a chance is low, the available X-ray/GeV observation upper limits are not stringent enough to further rule out this possibility. We have also discussed the prospect of convincingly establishing the magnetar origin of GRB 231115A-like events in the future.

在这篇文章中，研究者们探讨了在引力波信号中探测轨道离心率的痕迹，以揭示双黑洞的形成机制。他们发现，通过对比来自数值模拟的形成途径得出的离心率分布和从引力波信号中推断出的离心率估计，可以限制形成机制。研究人员报告说，现有引力波信号和天体物理模拟中使用的离心率定义不一致，主要是由于两者使用了不同的基准频率。他们提出了一种从天体物理模拟中计算离心率的方法，并发现存在重要差异。也就是说，现有研究中的引力波信号和天体物理形成渠道的离心率限制可能存在较大的差异。因此，在比较基于数据的离心率约束和天体物理形成渠道的期望时，需要谨慎对待这一差异。

Detecting imprints of orbital eccentricity in gravitational-wave (GW) signals promises to shed light on the formation mechanisms of binary black holes. To constrain the formation mechanisms, distributions of eccentricity derived from numerical simulations of astrophysical formation channels are compared to the estimates of eccentricity inferred from GW signals. We report that the definition of eccentricity typically used in astrophysical simulations is inconsistent with the one used while modeling GW signals, with the differences mainly arising due to the choice of reference frequency used in both cases. We also posit a prescription for calculating eccentricity from astrophysical simulations, by evolving ordinary differential equations obtained from post-Newtonian theory and using the dominant (ℓ = m = 2) mode’s frequency as the reference frequency; this ensures consistency in the definitions. On comparing the existing eccentricities of the binaries present in the Cluster Monte Carlo catalog of globular cluster simulations with the eccentricities calculated using the prescription presented here, we find a significant discrepancy at e ≳ 0.2; this discrepancy becomes worse with increasing eccentricity. We note the implications this discrepancy has for existing studies and recommend that care be taken when comparing data-driven constraints on eccentricity to expectations from astrophysical formation channels.

<div> AGN, variability, luminosity, accretion rate, black hole mass
总结:
这项研究对近9600个宽线选择的活动星系核（AGN）进行了研究，它们的宿主星系由Sloan Digital Sky Survey（SDSS）数据发布17号检测到。研究通过对比原始SDSS光度数据和在接下来几天到几十年内在Sloan g、r和i波段测得的光谱光度测量来计算整体变异性统计。通过对SDSS光谱拟合星系和AGN模板，研究分离出了AGN组分和宿主星系。研究对象的绝对星等在-24 < Mi < -18之间，且处于红移小于z ∼ 0.9范围内。变异性分析显示，亮度和变化幅度之间的反相关关系延伸至log(Lbol [erg s−1]) = 43.5，证明了这种关系在AGN光度上延伸了4个数量级。为了进一步探索AGN光度和变异性之间的关系，研究测定了Hβ线宽和静止5100 Å波长处的单色光度来确定黑洞质量和吸积率。研究结果表明，吸积率是影响变异幅度的主要参数，并且吸积率与振幅之间的反相关关系延伸至低至1% Eddington的吸积率。此外，研究还发现了变异幅度与黑洞质量之间的反相关关系，其中与低吸积率的AGN间的相关性最强。 <div>
We present the results from a study of ∼9600 broadline-selected active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with host galaxies detected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 17. We compute ensemble variability statistics based on a comparison of the original SDSS photometric data with spectrophotometric measurements obtained days to decades later in the Sloan g, r, and i bands. Galaxy and AGN templates have been fitted to the SDSS spectra to isolate the AGN component from the host galaxy. The sources have absolute magnitudes in the range −24 < Mi < −18 and lie at redshifts less than z ∼ 0.9. A variability analysis reveals that the anticorrelation between luminosity and variability amplitude continues down to log(Lbol [erg s−1]) = 43.5, demonstrating that the relationship extends by 4 orders of magnitude in AGN luminosity. To further explore the connection between AGN luminosity and variability, we determine the black hole mass and the accretion rate through measurement of the Hβ line width and the monochromatic luminosity at rest frame 5100 Å. Our results suggest that the accretion rate is the dominant parameter impacting the amplitude of variability and that the anticorrelation between the accretion rate and amplitude extends to rates as low as 1% Eddington. Moreover, we also identify an anticorrelation between the variability amplitude and black hole mass, with the correlation appearing strongest among the AGNs with low accretion rates.

<div> planetesimal formation, streaming instability, aerodynamic interactions, particle self-gravity, turbulent forcing
总结：<br /><br />本文研究了通过气体的两向空气动力学相互作用来实现固体浓缩，以及最终形成类地行星的流动不稳定性。作者进行了3D层流剪切盒模拟，并发现强制湍流可以显著增加所需的浓度阈值，作者还提供了临界Z的单一拟合值，并估计了考虑了粒子反馈和外部湍流的粒子尺度高度。最终实验表明，形成类地行星需要超过单位的粒子与气体的密度比值。 <div>
The streaming instability (SI) is a leading candidate for planetesimal formation, which can concentrate solids through two-way aerodynamic interactions with the gas. The resulting concentrations can become sufficiently dense to collapse under particle self-gravity, forming planetesimals. Previous studies have carried out large parameter surveys to establish the critical particle to gas surface density ratio (Z), above which SI-induced concentration triggers planetesimal formation. The threshold Z depends on the dimensionless stopping time (τs, a proxy for dust size). However, these studies neglected both particle self-gravity and external turbulence. Here, we perform 3D stratified shearing box simulations with both particle self-gravity and turbulent forcing, which we characterize via a turbulent diffusion parameter, αD. We find that forced turbulence, at amplitudes plausibly present in some protoplanetary disks, can increase the threshold Z by up to an order of magnitude. For example, for τs = 0.01, planetesimal formation occurs when Z ≳ 0.06, ≳0.1, and ≳0.2 at αD = 10−4, 10−3.5, and 10−3, respectively. We provide a single fit to the critical Z required for the SI to work as a function of αD and τs (although limited to the range τs = 0.01–0.1). Our simulations also show that planetesimal formation requires a mid-plane particle-to-gas density ratio that exceeds unity, with the critical value being largely insensitive to αD. Finally, we provide an estimation of particle scale height that accounts for both particle feedback and external turbulence.

The roles that mass and environment play in galaxy quenching are still under debate. Leveraging the Photometric objects Around Cosmic webs method, we analyze the excess surface distribution of photometric galaxies in different colors (rest-frame u − r) within the stellar mass range of 109.0 ∼ 1011.0M⊙ around spectroscopic massive central galaxies (1010.9 ∼ 1011.7M⊙) at the redshift interval of 0 < zs < 0.7, utilizing data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program and the spectroscopic samples of Slogan Digital Sky Survey (i.e., Main, LOWZ, and CMASS samples). We find that both mass and environmental quenching contribute to the evolution of companion galaxies. To isolate the environmental effect, we quantify the quenched fraction excess (QFE) of companion galaxies encircling massive central galaxies within 0.01h−1 Mpc < rp < 20h−1 Mpc, representing the surplus quenched fraction relative to the average. We find that the high-density halo environment affects star formation quenching up to about three times the virial radius, and this effect becomes stronger at lower redshift. We also find that even after being scaled by the virial radius, the environmental quenching efficiency is higher for more massive halos or for companion galaxies of higher stellar mass, though the trends are quite weak. We present a fitting formula that comprehensively captures the QFE across central and companion stellar mass bins, halo-centric distance bins, and redshift bins, offering a valuable tool for constraining galaxy formation models. Furthermore, we have made a quantitative comparison with IllustrisTNG that underscores some important differences, particularly in the excessive quenching of low-mass companion galaxies (<109.5M⊙) in the simulation.

<div> M87, radio galaxy, jet, X-ray image, flux variability
总结:
M87是一个著名的射电星系，其射流中的HST-1节点在X射线波段具有明亮的光结，我们分析了这个节点的X射线图像和通量变化。我们使用了2000年至2021年间112次Chandra ACIS-S观测数据进行了分析，总曝光时间为884千秒。通过解卷积图像研究了X射线射流的亮度分布，并测量了核心和HST-1的相对距离。从2003年到2005年（与HST-1的明亮闪耀同时），我们发现HST-1的通量与其与核心的偏移之间存在相关性。在随后的数据中，我们发现这种偏移稳定增加，这意味着HST-1的速度为6.6 ± 0.9c（2.0 ± 0.3 pc yr−1），与先前的结果一致。我们讨论了通量-偏移相关性的模型，这些模型包括了两个或四个相距数十秒差距的发射区域。我们将这些结果归因于射流中的移动激波，这使我们能够测量射流的内部结构。 <div>
The radio galaxy M87 is well known for its jet, which features a series of bright knots observable from radio to X-ray wavelengths. We analyze the X-ray image and flux variability of the knot HST-1 in the jet. Our analysis includes all 112 available Chandra ACIS-S observations from 2000 to 2021, with a total exposure time of ∼884 ks. We use deconvolved images to study the brightness profile of the X-ray jet and measure the relative separation between the core and HST-1. From 2003 to 2005 (which coincides with a bright flare from HST-1), we find a correlation between the flux of HST-1 and its offset from the core. In subsequent data, we find a steady increase in this offset, which implies a bulk superluminal motion for HST-1 of 6.6 ± 0.9 c (2.0 ± 0.3 pc yr−1), in keeping with prior results. We discuss models for the flux–offset correlation that feature either two or four emission regions separated by tens of parsecs. We attribute these results to moving shocks in the jet, which allow us to measure the internal structure of the jet.

总结:
本文报告了对M101星系中SN 2023ixf的多波段光度观测结果。超新星的绝对光度在爆发后3.9天达到最大值，之后逐渐稳定至约90天。有效温度在最初的观测后逐渐下降，并在两个月后稳定在约(3000-4000)K。光球半径的演化与速度呈现出类似于全同展开的趋势，并在之后缩小。根据放射性尾迹，初始镍质量约为0.098太阳质量。爆炸能量和喷射物质量分别估计为E ≃(1.0-5.7) × 10^51 erg和Mej ≃(3.8-16)太阳质量。峰值绝对光度被认为是喷射物与周围介质（CSM）相互作用的结果。我们发现一个冲击形成的CSM质量为MCSM ≃0.013太阳质量，CSM密度为ρCSM ≃2.5 × 10^-13克/厘米^3，以及一个前体恒星的质量损失率。 <div>
SN 2023ixf, recently reported in the nearby galaxy M101 at a distance of 6.85 Mpc, was one of the closest and brightest core-collapse supernovae in the last decade. In this work, we present multiwavelength photometric observation of SN 2023ixf with the Multi-channel Photometric Survey Telescope (Mephisto) in the uvgr bands and with the twin 50 cm telescopes in the griz bands. We find that the bolometric luminosity reached the maximum value of 3 × 1043 erg s−1 at 3.9 days after the explosion and fully settled onto the radioactive tail at ∼90 days. The effective temperature decreased from 3.2 × 104 K at the first observation and approached a constant of ∼(3000–4000) K after the first 2 months. The evolution of the photospheric radius is consistent with a homologous expansion with a velocity of 8700 km s−1 in the first 2 months, and it shrunk subsequently. Based on the radioactive tail, the initial nickel mass is about MNi ∼ 0.098 M⊙. The explosion energy and the ejecta mass are estimated to be E ≃ (1.0–5.7) × 1051 erg and Mej ≃ (3.8–16) M⊙, respectively. The peak bolometric luminosity is proposed to be contributed by the interaction between the ejecta and the circumstellar medium (CSM). We find a shocked CSM mass of MCSM ∼ 0.013 M⊙, a CSM density of ρCSM ∼ 2.5 × 10−13 g cm−3, and a mass-loss rate of the progenitor of .

磁场在分子云核中可能在星盘形成过程中发挥作用。通过ALMA大型项目“嵌入盘早期行星形成（eDisk）”对16个原恒星核进行了研究，解析了它们的盘，并使用JCMT POL-2观测推导了0.1 pc尺度的磁场形态。从密核中测量了磁场的平均取向和角度离散度，并与eDisk项目中动力学测定的原恒星质量的尺度和1.3毫米连续盘的半径进行了比较。我们观察到盘的半径与恒星质量之间存在显著的相关性，但没有发现盘半径与磁场取向角或磁场角度离散度之间的统计显著依赖性。然而，在考虑投影效应时，我们不能排除盘半径与三维空间中的偏离角之间存在正相关性的可能性。我们的结果表明，密核中磁场的形态可能在盘形成过程中并不起主导作用。相反，原恒星盘的尺寸可能更受到已被吸积到星+盘系统中的质量以及可能的其他参数（例如磁场强度、核自转和磁扩散性）的影响。 <br /><br />总结: 研究发现密核中的磁场形态对星盘形成过程不起主导作用，星盘的尺寸更可能受到被吸积到星+盘系统中的质量以及其他参数的影响。 <div>
The magnetic field of a molecular cloud core may play a role in the formation of circumstellar disks in the core. We present magnetic field morphologies in protostellar cores of 16 targets in the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array large program “Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk),” which resolved their disks with 7 au resolutions. The 0.1 pc scale magnetic field morphologies were inferred from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope POL-2 observations. The mean orientations and angular dispersions of the magnetic fields in the dense cores are measured and compared with the radii of the 1.3 mm continuum disks and the dynamically determined protostellar masses from the eDisk program. We observe a significant correlation between the disk radii and the stellar masses. We do not find any statistically significant dependence of the disk radii on the projected misalignment angles between the rotational axes of the disks and the magnetic fields in the dense cores, nor on the angular dispersions of the magnetic fields within these cores. However, when considering the projection effect, we cannot rule out a positive correlation between disk radii and misalignment angles in three-dimensional space. Our results suggest that the morphologies of magnetic fields in dense cores do not play a dominant role in the disk formation process. Instead, the sizes of protostellar disks may be more strongly affected by the amount of mass that has been accreted onto star+disk systems, and possibly other parameters, for example, magnetic field strength, core rotation, and magnetic diffusivity.

Mini-magnetospheres are small ion-scale structures that are well suited to studying kinetic-scale physics of collisionless space plasmas. Such ion-scale magnetospheres can be found on local regions of the Moon, associated with the lunar crustal magnetic field. In this paper, we report on the laboratory experimental study of magnetic reconnection in laser-driven, lunar-like ion-scale magnetospheres on the Large Plasma Device at the University of California, Los Angeles. In the experiment, a high-repetition rate (1 Hz), nanosecond laser is used to drive a fast-moving, collisionless plasma that expands into the field generated by a pulsed magnetic dipole embedded into a background plasma and magnetic field. The high-repetition rate enables the acquisition of time-resolved volumetric data of the magnetic and electric fields to characterize magnetic reconnection and calculate the reconnection rate. We notably observe the formation of Hall fields associated with reconnection. Particle-in-cell simulations reproducing the experimental results were performed to study the microphysics of the interaction. By analyzing the generalized Ohm’s law terms, we find that the electron-only reconnection is driven by kinetic effects through the electron pressure anisotropy. These results are compared to recent satellite measurements that found evidence of magnetic reconnection near the lunar surface.

In spite of significant progress in the research of fast radio bursts (FRBs) in recent decades, their origin is still under extensive debate. Investigation of the population of FRBs can provide new insight into this interesting problem. In this paper, based on the first Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME)/FRB catalog, we construct a Bayesian framework to analyze the FRB population, with the selection effect of the CHIME telescope being properly taken into account. The energy function is modeled as the power law with an exponential cutoff. Four redshift distribution models are considered, i.e., the star formation history (SFH) model, and three time-delayed models (Gaussian delay, log-normal delay, and power-law delay). The free parameters are simultaneously constrained using the Bayesian inference method, and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) is used in model comparison. According to the BIC, the log-normal delay model fits the data best. The power-law delay model and Gaussian delay model can also give reasonable fits, although they are not as good as the log-normal delay model. However, the SFH model is strongly disfavored compared with the three time-delayed models. The energy function is tightly constrained and is almost independent of the redshift models, with the best-fitting power-law index α ≈ 1.8 and cut-off energy . The FRB population shows on average a 3 ∼ 5 billion yr time delay with respect to the SFH. Therefore, the hypothesis that the FRB population traces the SFH is conclusively ruled out.

总结:<br /><br />这项研究利用星系-星系透镜数据在星系尺度上测试了广义相对论和f(T)引力理论。通过使用精确的球对称f(T)理论解和Navarro-Frenk-White模型对过剩表面密度进行建模，研究了引力势能、剪切分量和有效过剩表面密度在f(T)引力理论下与广义相对论的偏离。研究还对星系按颜色分为蓝色和红色，并利用信息准则对f(T)引力理论在偏离中心效应下的效率进行了分析。结果表明f(T)引力理论在拟合数据时比广义相对论和ΛCDM范例更具优势，对后者构成了挑战。 <div>
We use galaxy–galaxy lensing data to test general relativity and f(T) gravity at galaxy scales. We consider an exact spherically symmetric solution of f(T) theory, which is obtained from an approximate quadratic correction, and thus it is expected to hold for every realistic deviation from general relativity. Quantifying the deviation by a single parameter Q, and following the post-Newtonian approximation, we obtain the corresponding deviation in the gravitational potential, shear component, and effective excess surface density profile. We used five stellar mass samples and divided them into blue and red galaxies to test the model dependence on galaxy color, and we modeled the excess surface density profiles using the Navarro–Frenk–White profiles. Based on the group catalog from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS DR7) we finally extract Mpc−2 at 1σ confidence. This result indicates that f(T) corrections on top of general relativity are favored. Finally, we apply information criteria, such as the Akaike and Bayesian ones, and although the dependence of f(T) gravity on the off-center effect implies that its optimality needs to be carefully studied, our analysis shows that f(T) gravity is more efficient in fitting the data compared to general relativity and the ΛCDM paradigm, and thus it offers a challenge to the latter.

总结:<br />
年轻的恒星在联合中形成，提供了一个理想的环境来测量一个同龄人口的年龄。通过等时线拟合来测量同龄人口的年龄，这是一种典型的方法，但观测偏差可能会影响到对人口的物理特性的理解。研究发现，在星形成区域的等时线拟合中存在着表面上的质量依赖的年龄梯度，较低质量的恒星看起来比较高质量的恒星要年轻。星斑和星体多重性被认为是产生质量依赖的年龄梯度的机制，但星斑和多重性之间的相对重要性尚不清楚。研究采用模拟10兆年星际联合的类比进行了合成红光低分辨率光谱调查，包括质量依赖的多重性统计和年龄依赖的星斑覆盖分数。研究发现，仅仅未被发现的星斑并不会产生质量依赖的年龄梯度，而是均匀降低了人口的平均测量年龄。另外，二元星系统会产生质量依赖的年龄梯度，并且引入比星斑更多的年龄测量的离散度，但只要每个目标的距离测量准确，就可以很容易地从人口中剔除。研究得出结论，必须将星斑和未被发现的恒星多重性的特征纳入到对年轻星际联合的等时线拟合中，才能获得可靠的年龄。 <div>
Young stars form in associations, meaning that young stellar associations provide an ideal environment to measure the age of a nominally coeval population. Isochrone fitting, which is the typical method for measuring the age of a coeval population, can be impacted by observational biases that obscure the physical properties of a population. One feature in isochrone fits of star-forming regions is an apparent mass-dependent age gradient, where lower-mass stars appear systematically younger than higher-mass stars. Starspots and stellar multiplicity are proposed mechanisms for producing the mass-dependent age gradient, but the relative importance of starspots versus multiplicity remains unclear. We performed a synthetic red optical low-resolution spectroscopic survey of a simulated analog to a 10 Myr stellar association including mass-dependent multiplicity statistics and age-dependent starspot coverage fractions. We found that undetected starspots alone do not produce an apparent mass-dependent age gradient, but instead uniformly reduce the average measured age of the population. We also found that binaries continue to produce an apparent mass-dependent age gradient and introduce more scatter in the age measurement than spots, but are easily removed from the population as long as there are good distance measurements to each target. We conclude that it is crucial to incorporate treatments of both starspots and undetected stellar multiplicity into isochrone fits of young stellar associations to attain reliable ages.

<div> solar wind particles, waves, temperature anisotropies, clustering technique, Alfvénic fluctuations
<br /><br />总结:
本研究关注太阳风粒子的加热和加速问题，利用机器学习中的聚类技术分离出太阳风速度分布中的主要成分，发现质子和阿尔法粒子存在温度不均和粒子束现象。研究结果表明，阿尔法粒子存在大约占其核心的50%的大规模粒子束，而质子和阿尔法粒子的温度比大于4主要是因为存在大规模的阿尔法粒子束。此外，发现阿尔法粒子束和核心对Alfvénic波动和冲浪效应敏感，而质子和阿尔法粒子束之间存在共同的加热和加速机制。 <div>
The problems of heating and acceleration of solar wind particles are of significant and enduring interest in astrophysics. The interactions between waves and particles are crucial in determining the distributions of proton and alpha particles, resulting in non-Maxwellian characteristics, including temperature anisotropies and particle beams. These processes can be better understood as long as the beam can be separated from the core for the two major components of the solar wind. We utilized an alternative numerical approach that leverages the clustering technique employed in machine learning to differentiate the primary populations within the velocity distribution rather than employing the conventional bi-Maxwellian fitting method. Separation of the core and beam revealed new features for protons and alphas. We estimated that the total temperature of the two beams was slightly higher than that of their respective cores, and the temperature anisotropy for the cores and beams was larger than 1. We concluded that the temperature ratio between alphas and protons largely over 4 is due to the presence of a massive alpha beam, which is approximately 50% of the alpha core. We provided evidence that the alpha core and beam populations are sensitive to Alfvénic fluctuations and the surfing effect found in the literature can be recovered only when considering the core and beam as a single population. Several similarities between proton and alpha beams would suggest a common and local generation mechanism not shared with the alpha core, which may not have necessarily been accelerated and heated locally.

<br />
这篇文章利用Keck宇宙网络成像仪对27个典型星系的Lyα晕的观测结果进行了分析，这些星系的红移在2.0 < z < 3.2之间。研究发现 Lyα表面亮度的平均分布与星形成率、恒星质量、年龄、恒星连续性红移、星系形成率表面密度、以及星系形成率表面密度与恒星质量的比值等因素相关。Lyα晕的尺度长度与恒星质量、年龄和恒星连续性红移呈正相关，而与星形成率、星系形成率表面密度以及其与恒星质量的比值呈负相关。这些结果表明 Lyα发射的穿透率与星系内低柱密度通道有关，而中性气体遮挡的比例与星系的物理性质密切相关。具体来说，中性气体遮挡的比例随着恒星质量、年龄和E(B − V)的增加而增加，而随着星形成率、星系形成率表面密度以及其与恒星质量的比值的减小而减小。研究还发现共振散射的Lyα发射受到的衰减比（非共振）恒星连续发射更大，而且这种差异随着恒星质量、年龄和恒星连续性红移的增加而增加，而随着星系形成率表面密度与恒星质量的比例的减小而减小。这些结果表明，更红化的星系其周星系介质中的尘埃更多。 <br /><br />总结: 这篇文章利用Keck宇宙网络成像仪对27个典型星系的Lyα晕的观测结果进行了分析，发现Lyα晕的尺度长度与恒星质量、年龄和恒星连续性红移呈正相关，而与星形成率、星系形成率表面密度以及其与恒星质量的比值呈负相关。中性气体遮挡的比例与星系的物理性质密切相关，并且共振散射的Lyα发射受到的衰减比恒星连续发射更大，表明更红化的星系其周星系介质中的尘埃更多。 <div>
We present Keck Cosmic Web Imager integral-field unit observations around extended Lyα halos of 27 typical star-forming galaxies with redshifts 2.0 < z < 3.2 drawn from the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field survey. We examine the average Lyα surface brightness profiles in bins of star formation rate (SFR), stellar mass (M*), age, stellar continuum reddening, SFR surface density (ΣSFR), and ΣSFR normalized by stellar mass (ΣsSFR). The scale lengths of the halos correlate with stellar mass, age, and stellar continuum reddening and anticorrelate with SFR, ΣSFR, and ΣsSFR. These results are consistent with a scenario in which the down-the-barrel fraction of Lyα emission is modulated by the low-column-density channels in the interstellar medium, and in which the neutral gas covering fraction is related to the physical properties of the galaxies. Specifically, we find that this covering fraction increases with stellar mass, age, and E(B − V) and decreases with SFR, ΣSFR, and ΣsSFR. We also find that the resonantly scattered Lyα emission suffers greater attenuation than the (nonresonant) stellar continuum emission, and that the difference in attenuation increases with stellar mass, age, and stellar continuum reddening, and decreases with ΣsSFR. These results imply that more reddened galaxies have more dust in their circumgalactic medium.

<div> SNe Ia, eigenfunction method, LC stretch, progenitor white dwarf, delayed-detonation scenario
<br />总结:
本文提出了一种使用特征函数方法分析恒星爆炸光学曲线的方法，该方法基于延迟引爆模型并利用 LC stretch、前体白矮星的主序质量、中心密度等三个参数。研究表明，SNe Ia具有不同的特征和宿主星系相关性，其中根据恒星进化速度可以将其分为快速和缓慢两组。同时，对于91T型的SNe Ia来说，其光学曲线非常相似，且与恒星形成区域相关，有望成为早期宇宙中至 z≈4-11 的恒星形成追踪物。对于超亮型和亚亮型的SNe Ia，有约6%的异常数据可以归因于宿主的活跃恒星形成。最后，研究表明对于SNe Ia的多次爆发场景以及未来的调查具有重要意义。 <div>
We present an eigenfunction method to analyze 161 visual light curves (LCs) of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) obtained by the Carnegie Supernova Project to characterize their diversity and host-galaxy correlations. The eigenfunctions are based on the delayed-detonation (DD) scenario using three parameters: the LC stretch s determined by the amount of deflagration burning governing the 56Ni production, the main-sequence mass MMS of the progenitor white dwarf controlling the explosion energy, and its central density ρc shifting the 56Ni distribution. Our analysis tool (Supernova Parameter Analysis Tool) extracts the parameters from observations and projects them into physical space using their allowed ranges (MMS ≤ 8 M⊙, ρc ≤ 7–8 × 109 g cm−3). The residuals between fits and individual LC points are ≈1%–3% for ≈92% of objects. We find two distinct MMS groups corresponding to a fast (≈4–65 Myr) and a slow(≈200–500 Myr) stellar evolution. Most underluminous SNe Ia have hosts with low star formation but high MMS, suggesting slow evolution times of the progenitor system. 91T-like SNe show very similar LCs and high MMS and are correlated to star formation regions, making them potentially important tracers of star formation in the early Universe out to z ≈ 4–11. Some ∼6% outliers with nonphysical parameters using DD scenarios can be attributed to superluminous SNe Ia and subluminous SNe Ia with hosts of active star formation. For deciphering the SNe Ia diversity and high-precision SNe Ia cosmology, the importance is shown for LCs covering out to ≈60 days past maximum. Finally, our method and results are discussed within the framework of multiple explosion scenarios, and in light of upcoming surveys.

<div> 关键词: 光学闪耀，恒星，辐射动力学，电子束加热，大气模型

总结:<br /><br />本文使用RADYN代码计算了一系列1D辐射-动力学恒星耀斑模型，这些模型受到电子束加热的短脉冲驱动。模型表明高能电子束耀斑的全球通量比趋势，光谱匹配以及氢巴尔默γ线的形成均得到了良好的解释。研究发现，压力展宽和光学深度解释了白光恒星耀斑中氢巴尔默γ线的宽组分。该研究结果还揭示了高能电子束加热如何从冲击阶段演变到逐渐衰减阶段。这一研究建立了一个公开的模型库，并探讨了可能的应用。 <div>
Optical flares have been observed from magnetically active stars for many decades; unsurprisingly, the spectra and temporal evolution are complicated. For example, the shortcomings of optically thin, static slab models have long been recognized when confronted with the observations. A less incorrect—but equally simple—phenomenological T ≈ 9000 K blackbody model has instead been widely adopted in the absence of realistic (i.e., observationally tested) time-dependent, atmospheric models that are readily available. We use the RADYN code to calculate a grid of 1D radiative-hydrodynamic stellar flare models that are driven by short pulses of electron-beam heating. The flare heating rates in the low atmosphere vary over many orders of magnitude in the grid, and we show that the models with high-energy electron beams compare well to the global trends in flux ratios from impulsive-phase stellar flare, optical spectra. The models also match detailed spectral line-shape properties. We find that the pressure broadening and optical depths account for the broad components of the hydrogen Balmer γ lines in a powerful flare with echelle spectra. The self-consistent formation of the wings and nearby continuum level provides insight into how high-energy electron-beam heating evolves from the impulsive to the gradual decay phase in white-light stellar flares. The grid is publicly available, and we discuss possible applications.

<div> Keywords: sunspot cycle, deep learning, Solar Cycle 25, Solar Cycle 26, hemispheric activity

总结: <br /><br />该研究使用Informer模型分别预测了太阳25和26周期的活动水平。结果表明，这两个周期的活动水平将继续保持较弱至中等强度，且与24周期相比更强。还观察到了Gnevyshev峰值，表明大型太阳黑子群的数量将比小型黑子群多。此外，预测表明在25周期期间，南半球的活动水平将比北半球更强，表明两个半球之间存在显著的不对称和异步性。该研究结果显示如果针对每个半球单独进行预测，太阳周期预测可以变得更加准确。此外，与基于前兆和基于模型的预测方法相一致，太阳25和26周期很可能是弱至中等强度的周期。 <div>
Forecasting the amplitude and timing of the sunspot cycle is highly important for solar physics and space weather applications, but high-precision prediction of solar magnetic activity has remained an outstanding challenge. The Informer model, as the most advanced deep learning technique, is an ideal approach for predicting solar activity cycle. Using the whole-disk sunspot numbers (SSNs) between 1749 and 2023 and the hemispheric SSNs between 1992 and 2023, the amplitudes and timings of Solar Cycles 25 and 26 are predicted by the Informer model. The main results are the following: (1) the activity levels of Solar Cycles 25 and 26 continue being weak-moderate cycles with their strengths stronger than Solar Cycle 24, implying that the long-term solar variability is significantly modulated in length and magnitude by the Gleissberg century cycle; (2) the Gnevyshev peaks of Solar Cycles 25 and 26 are clearly observed with a higher value in the second peak, suggesting that the numbers of the large sunspot groups are greater compared to the small sunspot groups in these two cycles; and (3) during Solar Cycle 25, the activity level in the southern hemisphere is predicted to be stronger than that in the northern one, revealing significant asymmetry and asynchronization between the two hemispheres. Our analysis results show that solar cycle predictions can be made more accurate if performed separately for each hemisphere. Furthermore, Solar Cycles 25 and 26 are likely to be weak-moderate cycles, in agreement with the precursor-based and model-based prediction methods.

<div> Green Bank Telescope, pulsar survey, new pulsars, binary orbit, population estimates

总结: 本文介绍了Green Bank Telescope进行的820 MHz脉冲星调查，发现了六颗新的脉冲星并发现了一颗脉冲星的共同发现。其中一颗脉冲星处于短周期（4.5小时）的双星轨道上，并对脉冲星质量进行了初步测量。调查数据还用于估计调查的灵敏度，并测量了20个检测到的源的脉冲宽度和流量。对于在350 MHz的Green Bank北天幕调查中也被探测到的源，测量了散射参数并与该地区的预期进行了比较。最后，文章指出了Typical Galactic electron density模型在调查区域中电离度测量的显然低估，并讨论了未来的观测策略。 <div>
The Green Bank 820 MHz pulsar survey covers ≃173 deg2 in the Cygnus X region of the Galaxy, centered on l = 84.°5 and b = 1.°5. Significant star formation is present in this region, and lines of sight pass through three arms of the Galaxy (Orion–Cygnus, Perseus, and an outer arm). Using the Green Bank Telescope, we recorded 200 MHz of bandwidth for 4.5 minutes at 81.92 μs resolution for each of 3457 observed survey pointings during 2016 and 2017, covering about two-thirds of the total area. We searched these data for pulsars and report the discovery of six new pulsars—PSRs J2016+3820, J2016+4231, J2019+3810, J2035+3538, J2035+3655, and J2041+4551—and the codiscovery of PSR J2057+4701. PSR J2035+3655 is in a short (4.5 hr) binary orbit; we report the full binary solution and weakly constrain the mass of the pulsar via a marginal (2σ) detection of the Shapiro delay. We also searched the survey data for known pulsars to estimate the survey’s sensitivity and measured 820 MHz pulse widths and flux density for 20 detected sources. For sources that were also detected in the Green Bank North Celestial Cap survey at 350 MHz, we measure scattering parameters and compare to expectations for the region. With these results, we revisit the population estimates that motivated this survey and consider the impact of the survey’s yield on their underlying models. We note an apparent underestimate in dispersion measure predictions from typical Galactic electron density models in the survey region, and discuss future observation strategies.

通过对IRAS 00500+6713的多波段观测研究，发现了复杂的形态，其中包括内外X射线星云夹杂的尘埃红外环。研究使用XMM-Newton和Chandra X射线天文台的存档X射线数据，以限制X射线星云的角半径、质量和金属丰度，并构建了一个描述IRAS 00500+6713动力学演化的理论模型，包括超新星喷流与中心白矮星J005311富含碳燃烧灰的强风之间相互作用的影响。研究表明，内部X射线星云对应于风终止激波，而外部X射线星云对应于SN喷射物和星际物质之间的冲击界面。我们的模型显示，如果目前观测到的来自白矮星J005311的风在爆炸后大约810年后开始吹起，即约在公元1990年后，那么观测到的X射线特性可以通过我们的模型来解释，且产生超新星的能量和质量与Type Iax SNe的特性相符。喷射物为氧-氖和碳-氧白矮星的双重退化融合产生的超新星残骸，并且白矮星J005311是幸存的融合产物。 <br /><br />总结: 该研究通过对IRAS 00500+6713的多波段观测和X射线数据的分析，揭示了其复杂的形态，并提出了一个描述其动力学演化的理论模型。研究结果表明，IRAS 00500+6713可能是Type Iax supernova SN 1181的残余物，并且白矮星J005311可能是双重退化融合的幸存产物。 <div>
IRAS 00500+6713 is a hypothesized remnant of a Type Iax supernova SN 1181. Multiwavelength observations have revealed its complicated morphology; a dusty infrared ring is sandwiched by the inner and outer X-ray nebulae. We analyze the archival X-ray data taken by XMM-Newton and Chandra X-ray Observatory to constrain the angular radius, mass, and metal abundance of the X-ray nebulae, and construct a theoretical model describing the dynamical evolution of IRAS 00500+6713, including the effects of the interaction between the SN ejecta and the intense wind enriched with carbon-burning ashes from the central white dwarf (WD) J005311. We show that the inner X-ray nebula corresponds to the wind termination shock while the outer X-ray nebula to the shocked interface between the SN ejecta and the interstellar matter. The observed X-ray properties can be explained by our model with an ejecta kinetic energy of Eej = (0.77–1.1) × 1048 erg, an ejecta mass of Mej = 0.18–0.53 M⊙, if the currently observed wind from WD J005311 started to blow tw ≳ 810 yr after the explosion, i.e., approximately after 1990 CE. The inferred SN properties are compatible with those of Type Iax SNe and the timing of the wind launch may correspond to the Kelvin–Helmholtz contraction of the oxygen–neon core of WD J005311 that triggered a surface carbon burning. Our analysis supports that IRAS 00500+6713 is the remnant of SN Iax 1181 produced by a double degenerate merger of oxygen–neon and carbon–oxygen WDs, and WD J005311 is the surviving merger product.

<div> quasar, absorption lines, emission lines, photoionization simulations, circumnuclear gas<br />总结:<br />这篇文章详细分析了具有异常吸收和发射线谱的类星体SDSS J074850.39+442439.0（简写为J0748+4424），其红移为z = 2.18。通过光电离模拟，发现主要是来自于单电离的铁、镍和硅离子的窄吸收线可以合理地使用具有10^21.6–10^21.9 cm^-2的中性氢柱密度和10^6.0–10^6.6 cm^-3的数密度的均匀气体板以及10^-2.8–10^-2.1的电离参数来重现。推断这些气体位于黑洞周围约30–130 pc的距离。这些中等宽度的发射线在观测到的Lyα发射线中占主导地位，同时在Hα和[O iii]发射线中也被检测到。总体而言，发射线的强度与通过吸收线导出的参数和10%的覆盖分数所预测的值大部分一致。J0748+4424中固有的DLA本身包含了大量关于周围环境的信息，同时还可以作为一种“天然日冕仪”，暴露出否则会被BELs淹没的IELs。 <div>
We present a detailed analysis of the unusual absorption- and emission-line spectrum of the quasar SDSS J074850.39+442439.0 (hereafter J0748+4424) at a redshift of z = 2.18. The archival SDSS optical spectrum is abundant in narrow absorption lines (NALs) originating from mostly singly ionized iron, nickel, and silicon ions at both ground and excited levels. With the aid of the photoionization simulations, we find that these NALs can be reasonably well reproduced by a homogeneous gas slab with a neutral hydrogen column density of 1021.6–1021.9 cm−2 and a number density of 106.0–106.6 cm−3 illuminated by the quasar central engine with an ionization parameter of 10−2.8–10−2.1. We infer the gas is located at a distance of ∼30–130 pc from the black hole. This circumnuclear gas can reveal itself in emission lines of a width of ∼1000 km s−1. Such intermediate-width emission lines (IELs) are indeed dominant in the observed Lyα emission, as the Lyα broad emission line (BEL) is mostly eaten up by the expected damped Lyα absorption (DLA). The IELs, though rather weak, are also detected in Hα and [O iii] emission lines. The IEL intensities largely agree with the predicted values by the simplified photoionization models using the parameters derived from the absorption lines and a covering fraction of 10%. The intrinsic DLA in J0748+4424, while itself contains abundant information on the circumnuclear environment, may serve as a “natural coronagraph” at the line of sight, exposing the IELs that are otherwise overwhelmed by the BELs.

总结: 
G287.76-0.87是被Trumpler 16星团辐射的柱状结构，研究发现柱体相对于这一电离源的相对速度较小，气体运动在尾部比在头部更为湍流。通过LTE条件和非LTE条件的估算，确定了柱体内部的气体柱密度。发现柱体内部的热压力足够高，使其对周围热气体和辐射反馈保持稳定，但若有活跃的恒星风，则会对周围分子云进行雕刻，形成柱状结构。 <div>
We study the kinematics of a pillar, namely G287.76-0.87, using three rotational lines of 12CO(5-4), 12CO(8-7), 12CO(11-10), and a fine structure line of [O i] 63 μm in southern Carina observed by SOFIA/GREAT. This pillar is irradiated by the associated massive star cluster Trumpler 16, which includes η Carina. Our analysis shows that the relative velocity of the pillar with respect to this ionization source is small, ∼1 km s−1, and the gas motion in the tail is more turbulent than in the head. We also performed analytical calculations to estimate the gas column density in local thermal equilibrium (LTE) conditions, which yields NCO as (∼0.2–5) × 1017 cm−2. We further constrain the gas’s physical properties in non-LTE conditions using RADEX. The non-LTE estimations result in and NCO ≃ 1016 cm−2. We found that the thermal pressure within the G287.76-0.87 pillar is sufficiently high to make it stable for the surrounding hot gas and radiation feedback if the winds are not active. While they are active, stellar winds from the clustered stars sculpt the surrounding molecular cloud into pillars within the giant bubble around η Carina.

<div> CIB, COBE/DIRBE, Planck-HFI, Galactic dust emission, IPD emission
总结: 本研究使用更新的银河尘埃发射模型，测量了COBE Diffuse Infrared Background Experiment (DIRBE)和Planck High-Frequency Instrument (HFI)波段的宇宙红外背景（CIB）单极，并纠正了与此相关的各种辐射和校准增益。我们得出了CIB值，与先前直接测量的CIB值相比，结果显示了140微米以上波长的值较低。在这之下的值受到了与间行星尘埃（IPD）发射相关的大不确定性的影响，因此解释起来不够清晰。 <div>
We measured the cosmic infrared background (CIB) monopole for the COBE Diffuse Infrared Background Experiment (DIRBE) and Planck High-Frequency Instrument (HFI) bands with an updated model for the Galactic dust emission. This model includes a dust excess recently observed in 25% of the sky mainly at high latitude compared to the prediction from NH I. We correlated observations from COBE/DIRBE and Planck-HFI with this model to extract the zero levels of the sky maps. We corrected for the isotropic interplanetary dust (IPD) emission and calibration gains and obtained CIB values of 1.4 ± 8.0, 24.5 ± 3.9, 15.4 ± 4.9, 6.8 ± 2.0, 3.2 ± 0.3, 1.5 ± 0.1, 0.40 ± 0.05, 0.11 ± 0.04, 0.014 ± 0.027, and 0.008 ± 0.012 nW m−2 sr−1 at 60, 100, 140, and 240 μm, and 857, 545, 353, 217, 143, and 100 GHz. We compared those numbers with previous direct CIB measurements and extragalactic source counts. We obtain CIB values lower than previous measurements for wavelengths above 140 μm. Below this value, the large uncertainty related to the IPD emission prevents a clear interpretation.

本文报道了对IRAS 15099-5856的中心紧凑源IRS1进行高分辨率中红外成像观测的结果，研究了气体和尘埃的空间分布，并分析了其斯皮策中红外光谱，以探索IRS1的起源。观测结果显示IRS1呈现出复杂、不均匀的形态，其中包括[Ne ii] 12.81 μm和Qa 18.30 μm的明亮块状和弥散发射，证实IRS1是被附近的O型恒星Muzzio 10外部加热的扩展源，后者是星前体的候选双星伴侣。斯皮策中红外光谱显示了几条离子发射线，包括强烈的[Ne ii] 12.81 μm线，但未检测到氢线。研究人员利用云代码Cloudy对光谱进行了建模，结果显示IRS1的元素丰度接近超新星喷发物，其中氢被耗尽，金属元素（尤其是氖、氩和铁）得到增强。研究结果表明，IRS1源自超新星喷发物，暗示新形成的超新星尘中可能形成了结晶硅酸盐。

IRAS 15099-5856 in the young supernova remnant (SNR) MSH 15−52 is the first and only SNR-associated object with crystalline silicate dust detected so far, although its nature and the origin of the crystalline silicate are still unclear. In this paper, we present high-resolution mid-infrared (MIR) imaging observations of the bright central compact source IRS1 of IRAS 15099-5856 to study the spatial distributions of gas and dust and the analysis of its Spitzer MIR spectrum to explore the origin of IRS1. The MIR images obtained with the T-ReCS attached on the Gemini South telescope show a complicated, inhomogeneous morphology of IRS1 with bright clumps and diffuse emission in [Ne ii] 12.81 μm and Qa 18.30 μm, which confirms that IRS1 is an extended source externally heated by the nearby O star Muzzio 10, a candidate for the binary companion of the progenitor star. The Spitzer MIR spectrum reveals several ionic emission lines including a strong [Ne ii] 12.81 μm line, but no hydrogen line is detected. We model the spectrum using the photoionization code Cloudy with varying elemental composition. The elemental abundance of IRS1 derived from the model is close to that of supernova (SN) ejecta with depleted hydrogen and enhanced metals, particularly neon, argon, and iron. Our results imply that IRS1 originates from the SN ejecta and suggest the possibility of the formation of crystalline silicate in newly formed SN dust.

总结:
Cygnus X-3是一个高质量X射线双星系统，通过Chandra高能透射光栅分光仪获得了铁K谱线。铁K谱线显示了光电离平衡及星风中的内层壳层跃迁离散发射。观测到的禁闭线和相互作用线的发射线强度比表明，有来自镍和铍样离子态的谐振散射的显著贡献。此外，由于镍样离子的共振散射辐射的存在，可能会使铁K谱线的径向速度曲线的解释复杂化。推断结果显示，这些特征暗示着一个质量与Wolf–Rayet伴星相当的致密天体存在。 <div>
We analyze features of the Fe K spectrum of the high-mass X-ray binary Cygnus X-3. The spectrum was obtained with the Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer in the third diffraction order. The increased energy resolution of the third order enables us to fully resolve the Fe xxv Heα complex and the Fe xxvi Lyα lines. The emission-line spectrum shows the expected features of photoionization equilibrium, excited in the dense stellar wind of the companion star. We detect discrete emission from inner-shell transitions, in addition to absorption likely due to multiple unresolved transitions in lower ionization states. The emission-line intensity ratios observed in the range of the spectrum occupied by the Fe xxvn = 1–2 forbidden and intercombination lines suggest that there is a substantial contribution from resonantly scattered inner-shell emission from the Li- and Be-like ionization states. The Fe xxv forbidden and intercombination lines arise in the ionization zone closest to the compact object, and since they are not subject to radiative-transfer effects, we can use them in principle to constrain the radial velocity amplitude of the compact object. We infer that the results indicate a compact object mass of the order of the mass of the Wolf–Rayet companion star, but we note that the presence of resonantly scattered radiation from Li-like ions may complicate the interpretation of the He-like emission spectrum, and specifically of the radial velocity curve of the Fe xxv forbidden line.

这篇文章介绍了一种使用近红外和中红外的光谱能量分布来估计银河系渐近巨星分支（AGB）恒星距离的方法。作者假设一组给定的源属性（初始质量、恒星温度、组成和演化阶段）能够提供典型的光谱能量分布形状和亮度，然后将源进行颜色匹配到距离校准模板，并进行缩放以提取距离。通过与非常长基线干涉测量或Gaia视差测量估计的距离进行比较来测试该方法，结果显示两者之间有很强的相关性。然后构建了一个潜在接近银河系中心的源样本，用于校准模板的典型距离。得到了近15000颗BAaDE调查中心所属的银河系AGB恒星的统计距离估计结果，典型距离误差为±35%。利用这些统计距离，形成了一个由AGB恒星追踪的中间年龄恒星分布的地图，并且可以清晰地看到一个条状结构，这与先前报道的30°相对于GC-Sun方向矢量的倾斜角一致。这些结果促使更深入地研究AGB星群，以揭示银河系中的中间年龄恒星分布，以及确定AGB星群的光度和质量流失率分布的统计特性。<br /><br />总结:  这篇文章介绍了使用光谱能量分布的方法来估计银河系AGB恒星的距离。通过对比其他测量方法，验证了这种方法的有效性。作者利用统计距离得出了AGB星群的分布地图，并发现了一个条状结构，这有助于更深入地了解银河系中的中间年龄恒星分布。 <div>
We present a method to estimate distances to asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars in the Galaxy, using spectral energy distributions (SEDs) in the near- and mid-infrared. By assuming that a given set of source properties (initial mass, stellar temperature, composition, and evolutionary stage) will provide a typical SED shape and brightness, sources are color matched to a distance-calibrated template and thereafter scaled to extract the distance. The method is tested by comparing the distances obtained to those estimated from very long baseline interferometry or Gaia parallax measurements, yielding a strong correlation in both cases. Additional templates are formed by constructing a source sample likely to be close to the Galactic center, and thus with a common, typical distance for calibration of the templates. These first results provide statistical distance estimates to a set of almost 15,000 Milky Way AGB stars belonging to the Bulge Asymmetries and Dynamical Evolution (BAaDE) survey, with typical distance errors of ±35%. With these statistical distances, a map of the intermediate-age population of stars traced by AGBs is formed, and a clear bar structure can be discerned, consistent with the previously reported inclination angle of 30° to the GC–Sun direction vector. These results motivate deeper studies of the AGB population to tease out the intermediate-age stellar distribution throughout the Galaxy, as well as determining statistical properties of the AGB population luminosity and mass-loss-rate distributions.

How many gravitational-wave observations from double compact object mergers have we seen to date? This seemingly simple question surprisingly yields a somewhat ambiguous answer that depends on the chosen data-analysis pipeline, detection threshold, and other underlying assumptions. To illustrate this we provide visualizations of the number of existing detections from double compact object mergers by the end of the third observing run (O3) based on recent results from the literature. Additionally, we visualize the expected number of observations from future-generation detectors, highlighting the possibility of up to millions of detections per year by the time next-generation ground-based detectors like Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope come online. We present a publicly available code that highlights the exponential growth in gravitational-wave observations in the coming decades and the exciting prospects of gravitational-wave (astro)physics.

<div> 关键词: Insight-HXMT, EXO 2030+375, 巨大突发, 周期变化, X射线谱

总结: <br /><br />文章报告了2021年巨大突发期间对EXO 2030+375的Insight-HXMT观测结果，发现了可能的环形共振散射特征。在突发期间，该源的X射线亮度达到了10^38 erg s−1，X射线脉冲星的自旋周期为41.27秒，表现出复杂的时间和谱变化。脉冲轮廓的形状显示出在20keV以上出现了单个主峰，而在低能段则呈现出多峰图案，随着能量增加到10-20keV，脉冲轮廓的过渡从多峰到单峰发生在约0.8×10^38 erg s−1，这表明了从亚临界亮度到超临界亮度状态的演变。此外，在接近峰值亮度时，在EXO 2030+375的脉冲分数-能量关系中发现了CRSF能量之前的一个深谷结构。对光谱参数的详细分析显示，幂律光子指数随着亮度增加呈现出三种不同的趋势，这些谱变化也标志着从亚临界到超临界状态的光谱过渡。临界亮度推断出一个磁场约为(4.8-6.0)×10^12 G，支持了约47keV的环形线的存在。在突发期间广阔的X射线谱上应用的Compton化模型也暗示着表面磁场范围在(5−9) × 10^12 G。 <div>
Based on Insight-HXMT observations of EXO 2030+375 during its 2021 giant outburst, we report the analysis of pulse variations and the broadband X-ray spectrum, and find the presence of a potential cyclotron resonant scattering feature (CRSF) with the fundamental line at ∼47 keV from both average spectra and phase-resolved spectroscopy. During the outburst, the source reached an X-ray luminosity of ∼1038 erg s−1 from 2 to 105 keV at a distance of 7.1 kpc. The X-ray pulsar at the spin period of 41.27 ± 0.61 s exhibits complex timing and spectral variations with both energy and luminosity during the outburst. The shapes of the pulse profiles show the single main peak above ∼20 keV, while appearing to exhibit multipeak patterns in low-energy bands, and the transition of the 10–20 keV pulse profiles from multipeak to single peak is observed at ∼0.8 × 1038 erg s−1, which suggests the evolution from the subcritical luminosity (pencil-beam dominated) to the supercritical luminosity (fan-beam dominated) regime. A dip structure before the energy of the CRSFs is found in the pulse fraction–energy relation of EXO 2030+375 near the peak luminosity. A detailed analysis of spectral parameters showed that the power-law photon index exhibits three distinct trends as luminosity increases, and these spectral changes also signify a spectral transition from subcritical to supercritical regimes. The critical luminosity infers a magnetic field of ∼(4.8−6.0) × 1012 G, which supports the presence of the cyclotron line at ∼47 keV. A Comptonization model applied for the broad X-ray spectra during the outburst also suggests the surface magnetic field ranging from ∼(5−9) × 1012 G.

总结: 
研究团队进行了新的深度Chandra观测，发现了SPT-CLJ 2031-4037星系团的复杂结构，类似于子弹星系团。使用X射线数据，确认了存在两个震波前沿，分别位于西北和东南方向，通过直接测量气体温度跃变来进行确认。西北方向的震波前沿强度更大，密度跃变为3.16 ± 0.34，并且马赫数超过2，表明该星系团是罕见的高马赫数的碰撞系统。研究团队利用西北方向的震波对比了两种震波加热模型，发现温度变化符合库仑碰撞加热模型。而对于东南区域的震波前沿，发现密度跃变为1.53 ± 0.14，马赫数为。 <div>
We present our findings from the new deep Chandra observations (256 ks) of the merging galaxy cluster SPT-CLJ 2031-4037 at z = 0.34. Our observations reveal intricate structures seen in a major merger akin to the Bullet Cluster. The X-ray data confirm the existence of two shock fronts, one to the northwest and one to the southeast, by directly measuring the temperature jump of gas across the surface brightness edges. The stronger shock front in the northwest has a density jump of 3.16 ± 0.34 across the sharp surface brightness edge and Mach number , which makes this cluster one of the rare merging systems with a Mach number M > 2. We use the northwestern shock to compare two models for shock heating—the instant heating model and the Coulomb collisional heating model—and we determine that the temperatures across the shock front agree with the Coulomb collisional model of heating. For the shock front in the southeastern region, we find a density jump of 1.53 ± 0.14 and a Mach number of .

在最近的研究中发现，Ωm与个体模拟星系的属性之间存在着相对密切的相关性。由于这一发现，人们已经证明可以利用个体星系的属性来确定Ωm，并同时考虑来自超新星和活动星系核等天体物理过程的不确定性。本研究 quantifies 了使用多个星系的属性是否能够加强这些限制。为此，我们使用神经网络对Ωm和σ8两个宇宙学参数以及四个天体物理参数进行无似然推断，使用了CAMELS项目中成千上万次的流体力学模拟的多个星系的属性。我们发现，使用多个星系的属性可以增加Ωm推断的精度。此外，使用多个星系还可以推断出以前仅用单个星系难以约束的其他参数。我们展示了同一组星系属性是如何影响从一个或多个星系中获得Ωm的约束。最后，我们 quantified 了模型的鲁棒性，并发现在没有确定模型的有效范围的情况下，该模型在测试其他星系形成模型的星系时表现不佳。

<br /><br />总结: 
1. Ωm与个体模拟星系的属性存在紧密相关性
2. 使用多个星系的属性可以增加Ωm推断的精度
3. 使用多个星系还能推断出以前难以约束的其他参数
4. 显示了同一组星系属性是如何影响从一个或多个星系中获得Ωm的约束
5. 在没有确定模型的有效范围的情况下，该模型在测试其他星系形成模型的星系时表现不佳 <div>
Recent works have discovered a relatively tight correlation between Ωm and the properties of individual simulated galaxies. Because of this, it has been shown that constraints on Ωm can be placed using the properties of individual galaxies while accounting for uncertainties in astrophysical processes such as feedback from supernovae and active galactic nuclei. In this work, we quantify whether using the properties of multiple galaxies simultaneously can tighten those constraints. For this, we train neural networks to perform likelihood-free inference on the value of two cosmological parameters (Ωm and σ8) and four astrophysical parameters using the properties of several galaxies from thousands of hydrodynamic simulations of the CAMELS project. We find that using properties of more than one galaxy increases the precision of the Ωm inference. Furthermore, using multiple galaxies enables the inference of other parameters that were poorly constrained with one single galaxy. We show that the same subset of galaxy properties are responsible for the constraints on Ωm from one and multiple galaxies. Finally, we quantify the robustness of the model and find that without identifying the model range of validity, the model does not perform well when tested on galaxies from other galaxy formation models.

总结: 
该研究对H+He潮汐破坏事件（TDE）AT 2019azh进行了光度和光谱观测，并与公共光度数据相结合。研究发现，TDE的光变曲线斜率发生变化，且在峰值光变曲线中可能存在一个突起，这可能表明出现了多种主导发射机制。此外，研究还确认了先前TDE中观察到的现象，即红色发射比蓝色发射延迟峰值。该文还发现，AT 2019azh的峰值后玻尔光度曲线更适合以指数下降，而非经典的t−5/3（事实上，任何）幂定律下降。作者还提供了Hα发射线演化的最早测量结果，并发现V波段光度曲线峰值和Hα亮度峰值之间没有显著的时间延迟。这些结果可以用来约束未来的TDE线形成和发射机制模型。需要更多的TDE预峰值1-2天间隔观测来确定这些特征是否在TDE中普遍存在，并且需要详细的发射模型来充分利用这些观测来理解TDE的发射物理。 <div>
AT 2019azh is a H+He tidal disruption event (TDE) with one of the most extensive ultraviolet and optical data sets available to date. We present our photometric and spectroscopic observations of this event starting several weeks before and out to approximately 2 yr after the g-band's peak brightness and combine them with public photometric data. This extensive data set robustly reveals a change in the light-curve slope and a possible bump in the rising light curve of a TDE for the first time, which may indicate more than one dominant emission mechanism contributing to the pre-peak light curve. Indeed, we find that the MOSFiT-derived parameters of AT 2019azh, which assume reprocessed accretion as the sole source of emission, are not entirely self-consistent. We further confirm the relation seen in previous TDEs whereby the redder emission peaks later than the bluer emission. The post-peak bolometric light curve of AT 2019azh is better described by an exponential decline than by the canonical t−5/3 (and in fact any) power-law decline. We find a possible mid-infrared excess around the peak optical luminosity, but cannot determine its origin. In addition, we provide the earliest measurements of the Hα emission-line evolution and find no significant time delay between the peak of the V-band light curve and that of the Hα luminosity. These results can be used to constrain future models of TDE line formation and emission mechanisms in general. More pre-peak 1–2 days cadence observations of TDEs are required to determine whether the characteristics observed here are common among TDEs. More importantly, detailed emission models are needed to fully exploit such observations for understanding the emission physics of TDEs.

总结: 
Astro2020 Decadal Survey确定了对环绕星系的星系间介质（CGM；星系周围的气体等离子体）进行绘图的关键目标。研究人员探讨了利用未来的大口径X射线微量计来表征附近星系晕中和周围的CGM的前景。他们从流体动力学模拟（EAGLE、IllustrisTNG和Simba）中创建了现实的模拟观测结果，这些结果展示了广泛的潜在测量可能性，将解决星系形成和演化中的一些开放问题。通过在模拟观测中包括所有的背景和前景成分，研究人员展示了为什么用当前仪器（如X射线CCD）无法进行这些测量，以及为什么只有微量计才能让我们区分微弱的CGM发射线和明亮的银河系前景发射线。他们发现，根据流星形成速率，平均而言，银河系质量的个体晕可以被跟踪到较大的半径，大约R500，对于更大的星系甚至可达到R200，利用明显的发射线（如O vii或O viii）。此外，他们表明个体星系晕的发射线比例可以揭示径向温度结构。亚结构测量表明，将有可能将方位变化与星系的反馈模式联系起来。他们展示了通过谱线拟合构建个体星系晕的温度、速度和丰度比图，揭示了旋转特征、活跃星系核喷发和富集。 <br /><br /> <div>
The Astro2020 Decadal Survey has identified the mapping of the circumgalactic medium (CGM; the gaseous plasma around galaxies) as a key objective. We explore the prospects for characterizing the CGM in and around nearby galaxy halos with a future large-grasp X-ray microcalorimeter. We create realistic mock observations from hydrodynamical simulations (EAGLE, IllustrisTNG, and Simba) that demonstrate a wide range of potential measurements, which will address the open questions in galaxy formation and evolution. By including all background and foreground components in our mock observations, we show why it is impossible to perform these measurements with current instruments, such as X-ray CCDs, and why only microcalorimeters will allow us to distinguish the faint CGM emission from the bright Milky Way (MW) foreground emission lines. We find that individual halos of MW mass can, on average and depending on star formation rate, be traced out to large radii, around R500, and for larger galaxies even out to R200, using prominent emission lines, such as O vii, or O viii. Furthermore, we show that emission-line ratios for individual halos can reveal the radial temperature structure. Substructure measurements show that it will be possible to relate azimuthal variations to the feedback mode of the galaxy. We demonstrate the ability to construct temperature, velocity, and abundance ratio maps from spectral fitting for individual galaxy halos, which reveal rotation features, active galactic nucleus outbursts, and enrichment.

The catalog, containing ≈188,564 (136,235) galaxies at 0.2 < z < 8.0 with stellar mass and K-band total magnitude K < 25.2 (24.3) AB, enables a range of extragalactic studies. We also provide photometric redshifts, corresponding redshift probability distributions, and rest-frame absolute magnitudes and colors derived using the template-fitting code eazy-py. Photometric redshift errors are less than 3%−4% at z < 4 across the full brightness range in the K band and stellar mass range . Stellar population properties (e.g., stellar mass, star formation rate, dust extinction) are derived from the modeling of the spectral energy distributions using the codes FAST and Dense Basis.

太阳风质子, (β∥, T⊥/T∥) 相空间频率分布, 温度异向性驱动的等离子体不稳定性, 碰撞弛豫, 碰撞/集体效应的动力学计算
<br /><br />总结:
本文研究了太阳风质子在(β∥, T⊥/T∥)相空间中的频率分布特征，发现高β∥边界由温度异向性驱动的等离子体不稳定性部分解释，而低β∥边界与碰撞弛豫过程密切相关。Vafin等人的工作表明了碰撞弛豫频率νpp的等值线能与左侧边界匹配，表明碰撞弛豫过程与左侧边界形成关系密切。本文通过对质子的碰撞弛豫过程进行动力学计算，发现最终弛豫状态与观测到的边界吻合。结合集体不稳定性区域的计算，发现碰撞/集体效应提供了观测结果的基本解释。 <div>
The frequency distribution of solar wind protons, measured in the vicinity of Earth’s orbit, is customarily plotted in (β∥, T⊥/T∥) phase space. Here, T⊥/T∥ is the ratio of perpendicular and parallel temperatures, and β∥ = 8πnT∥/B2 is the ratio of parallel thermal energy to background magnetic field energy, the so-called “parallel beta,” with ⊥ and ∥ denoting directions with respect to the ambient magnetic field. Such a frequency distribution, plotted as a two-dimensional histogram, forms a peculiar rhombic shape defined with an outer boundary in the said phase space. Past studies reveal that the threshold conditions for temperature anisotropy–driven plasma instability partially account for the boundary on the high-β∥ side. The low-β∥ side remains largely unexplained despite some efforts. Work by Vafin et al. recently showed that certain contours of collisional relaxation frequency, νpp, when parameterized by T⊥/T∥ and β∥, could match the overall shape of the left-hand boundary, thus suggesting that the collisional relaxation process might be closely related to the formation of the left-hand boundary. The present paper extends the analysis by Vafin et al. and carries out the dynamical computation of the collisional relaxation process for an ensemble of initial proton states with varying degrees of anisotropic temperatures. The final states of the relaxed protons are shown to closely match the observed boundary to the left of the (β∥, T⊥/T∥) phase space. When coupled with a similar set of calculations for the ensemble in the collective instability regime, it is found that the combined collisional/collective effects provide the baseline explanation for the observation.

<div> ALMA, absorption lines, Galactic molecular gas, velocity components, chemical models
<br />总结:
该研究利用ALMA对QSO J1851+0035进行了观测，发现了17种分子，并对18种进行了上限设定。研究识别出20个独立的速度组分，推测具有τ≲1的组分对应于弥散云或云外缘。CO J = 1–0和J = 2–1吸收线的多高斯拟合显示这些组分由窄线和宽线组成。通过高HCN/HNC异构体比值推断的动力学温度达到了≳40 K，对应的热宽度解释了窄线组分的线宽。CN类分子和碳氢化合物之间有着密切和线性的相关性。CO/HCO+丰度比显示出数量级差距，较小的比值出现在较小的N(HCO+)（或较低的AV）范围内。一些速度组分在单天线CO发射和ALMA HCO+吸收中被探测到，但没有相应的ALMA CO吸收。这可能可以通过未能分辨的∼1 pc天线波束中的凝聚CO发射体混合周围具有极低CO/HCO+丰度比（即CO贫富）的扩展组分来解释。 <div>
Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) data toward QSO J1851+0035 (l = 33.°498, b = +0.°194) were used to study absorption lines by Galactic molecular gas. We detected 17 species (CO, 13CO, C18O, HCO+, H13CO+, HCO, H2CO, C2H, c-C3H, c-C3H2, CN, HCN, HNC, CS, SO, SiO, and C) and set upper limits to 18 species as reference values for chemical models. About 20 independent velocity components at 4.7–10.9 kpc from the Galactic center were identified. Their column density and excitation temperature estimated from the absorption study, as well as the CO intensity distributions obtained from the FUGIN survey, indicate that the components with τ ≲1 correspond to diffuse clouds or cloud outer edges. Simultaneous multiple-Gaussian fitting of CO J = 1–0 and J = 2–1 absorption lines shows that these are composed of narrow- and broad-line components. The kinetic temperature empirically expected from the high HCN/HNC isomer ratio (≳4) reaches ≳40 K and the corresponding thermal width accounts for the line widths of the narrow-line components. CN-bearing molecules and hydrocarbons have tight and linear correlations within the groups. The CO/HCO+ abundance ratio showed a dispersion as large as 3 orders of magnitude with a smaller ratio in a smaller N(HCO+) (or lower AV) range. Some of the velocity components are detected in single-dish CO emission and ALMA HCO+ absorption but without corresponding ALMA CO absorption. This may be explained by the mixture of clumpy CO emitters not resolved with the ∼1 pc single-dish beam surrounded by extended components with a very low CO/HCO+ abundance ratio (i.e., CO-poor gas).

<div> 关键词: 加热分配，湍流能量，黑洞吸积盘，磁流体力学，剪切流
总结: <br /><br />这篇论文讨论了湍流加热在黑洞吸积盘中对离子和电子的分配问题，指出了宏观和微观尺度之间的挑战性差距。研究发现，能量注入慢波和阿尔芬波级联之间的分配取决于受控于Maxwell和Reynolds应力张量的角动量传输、剪切速率和平均磁场方向。通过磁流体力学剪切盒模拟，得出了由磁旋不稳定引起的湍流应力张量的数值结果，并推导出慢波和阿尔芬波级联之间的注入功率比。最后，提出了一个基于宏观特征的局部子网格模型，用于计算离子与电子加热比。 <div>
The partition of turbulent heating between ions and electrons in radiatively inefficient accretion flows plays a crucial role in determining the observational appearance of accreting black holes. Modeling this partition is, however, a challenging problem because of the large scale-separation between the macroscopic scales at which energy is injected by turbulence and the microscopic ones at which it is dissipated into heat. Recent studies of particle heating from collisionless damping of turbulent energy have shown that the partition of energy between ions and electrons is dictated by the ratio of the energy injected into the slow and Alfvén wave cascades as well as the plasma β parameter. In this paper, we study the mechanism of the injection of turbulent energy into slow- and Alfvén-wave cascades in magnetized shear flows. We show that this ratio depends on the particular (rϕ) components of the Maxwell and Reynolds stress tensors that cause the transport of angular momentum, the shearing rate, and the orientation of the mean magnetic field with respect to the shear. We then use numerical magnetohydrodynamic shearing-box simulations with background conditions relevant to black hole accretion disks to compute the magnitudes of the stress tensors for turbulence driven by the magneto-rotational instability and derive the injection power ratio between slow and Alfvén wave cascades. We use these results to formulate a local subgrid model for the ion-to-electron heating ratio that depends on the macroscopic characteristics of the accretion flow.

<div> IC 3599, Seyfert 1.9, X-ray outburst, accretion-disk instability, Swift mission
<br />总结: 研究报告了对Seyfert 1.9星系IC 3599的跟踪观察，包括两次X射线爆发的发现和相关解释。第一次X射线爆发是在1990年由ROSAT发现的，第二次是在2010年由Swift发现的。有人假设IC 3599的爆发是由于重复的部分潮汐剥离引起的，预测了2019/2020年的再次爆发；另一种解释认为观察到的事件是由于吸积盘不稳定引起的，这意味着大爆发之间的时间间隔要长得多。Swift的持续监测不支持2019/2020年再次剧烈爆发的假设，而支持吸积盘不稳定的情景。此外，IC 3599的长期X射线光变曲线显示持续的强变化，2022年12月出现了X射线的小闪焰，随后X射线谱呈现出特殊的硬化。 <div>
We report on follow-up observations of the Seyfert 1.9 galaxy IC 3599 with the NASA Neil Gehrels Swift mission. The detection of a second X-ray outburst in 2010 by Swift after the first discovery of a bright X-ray outburst in 1990 by ROSAT led to the suggestion of two very different explanations. The first one assumed that IC 3599 exhibits outbursts due to repeated partial tidal stripping of a star, predicting another outburst of IC 3599 in 2019/2020. The second, alternative scenario assumed that the event observed in X-rays is due to an accretion-disk instability, which would suggest a much longer period between the large outbursts. Our continued monitoring campaign by Swift allowed us to test the first scenario that predicted a repetition of high-amplitude flaring activity in 2019/2020. We do not find any evidence of dramatic flaring activity with factors of 100 since the last X-ray outburst seen in 2010. These observations support the accretion-disk scenario. Further, while IC 3599 remains in low-emission states, the long-term X-ray light curve of IC 3599 reveals ongoing strong variability of a factor of a few. The most remarkable event is a miniflare of a factor of 10 in X-rays in 2022 December. After that flare, the otherwise supersoft X-ray spectrum shows an exceptional hardening, reminiscent of a temporary corona formation.

<div> 磁流体扭结、能量转换、电流片、几何结构、磁场重构<br />
<br />总结:<br />本研究通过对磁流体扭结和电流片的多重动态能量转换以及二维几何结构进行研究，发现在磁流体扭结中存在着不同的能量转换方式，主要是能量动力机在FR1和FR5中占主导地位，而在FR2-4中主要是能量耗散。在磁流体扭结周围观察到电磁场和等离子体之间的动态能量交换，以及薄电流片周围的能量动力机和能量耗散现象。通过磁场重构得出六个磁流体扭结的估计长宽比，以及薄电流片的厚度。研究结果表明，FR4是一个合并的磁流体扭结，其磁场图显示了明显的能量耗散现象。这一发现与之前的多个岛屿合并的模拟研究结果相符。 <div>
A series of six ion-scale magnetic flux ropes (FR1–6) and a thin current sheet, encountered by Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft in the magnetosheath side of the dayside magnetopause boundary layer, are studied for multiple flux rope dynamics in terms of energy conversion and two-dimensional geometry structure. The thin current sheet is identified in between FR1 and FR2. The energy exchange between electromagnetic fields and plasmas is dynamic in FR1–5 and also surrounding the flux ropes, while a low-energy conversion rate is seen in FR6. Different energy conversions exist in the flux ropes: energy dynamo is predominant in FR1 and FR5, while energy dissipation is dominated in FR2–4. Both the energy dynamo and dissipation primarily result from j∥E∥. Strong dissipation, surrounded by an energy dynamo, happens at the thin current sheet and is accompanied by ion agyrotropic behavior. From the reconstructed magnetic field maps, the estimated aspect ratios of the six flux ropes are 0.78, 0.16, 0.66, 0.11, 0.40, and 0.46 in order, and the thickness of the thin current sheet is ∼63 km (∼1.8 ion inertial length). Evidently, the magnetic field map shows that FR4 is a coalescing flux rope where a pronounced dissipation is present. The overall finding agrees with the previous simulation studies of multiple island coalescence.

总结:
本研究分析了在不同观测方法下，矮星系和大质量星系中低质量恒星初始质量函数(IMF)的银河级别变化。尽管不同方法存在系统性差异，但一个具有金属依赖斜率的低质量恒星IMF模型与大多数观测结果一致，表明宇宙中的恒星形成过程具有高度一致性。我们还强调了对低质量IMF变化的更全面理解的必要性，考虑到测量偏差和金属以外的因素。 <br /><br /> <div>
The stellar initial mass function (IMF) characterizes the mass distribution of newly formed stars in various cosmic environments, serving as a fundamental assumption in astrophysical research. Recent findings challenge the prevalent notion of a universal and static IMF, proposing instead that the IMF’s shape is contingent upon the star formation environment. In this study, we analyze the galaxy-wide variation in the IMF for low-mass stars in both dwarf and massive galaxies with diverse observational methods. Despite systematic discrepancies between different approaches, an IMF model with a metallicity-dependent slope for the low-mass stars aligns with the majority of observations, indicating a high degree of uniformity in the star formation processes across the Universe. We also emphasize the need for a more comprehensive understanding of the variation in the low-mass IMF, considering measurement biases and factors beyond metallicity.

这篇论文探讨了宇宙物理系统中常见的超音速等温湍流过程的能量。研究表明，守恒能量是动能（K）和Helmholtz自由能（F）的总和。研究人员预测了自由能P（F）和动能P（K）的概率分布，以及它们非平凡的联合分布P（F，K）。他们通过一系列驱动湍流模拟验证了这些预测，发现结果与预测非常吻合。模拟湍流的马赫数范围从1到8，并有三种驱动模式：纯螺旋型、纯压缩型和混合型。研究发现P（F）在F = 0处不连续，不连续性随着马赫数和压缩驱动而增加。P（K）类似于负偏态的对数正态分布。联合分布P（F，K）显示出双峰分布，气体要么存在于高F和高K，要么存在于低F和低K。 
<br /><br />总结: 这项研究探讨了超音速等温湍流的能量分布规律，提出了动能和Helmholtz自由能的概率分布，并通过模拟验证了这些预测。研究结果表明，湍流的能量分布在不同条件下存在不同的特征，为理解宇宙中湍流运动提供了重要参考。 <div>
Supersonic isothermal turbulence is a common process in astrophysical systems. In this work, we explore the energy in such systems. We show that the conserved energy is the sum of the kinetic energy (K) and Helmholtz free energy (F). We develop analytic predictions for the probability distributions, P(F) and P(K), as well as their nontrivial joint distribution, P(F, K). We verify these predictions with a suite of driven turbulence simulations, finding excellent agreement. The turbulence simulations were performed at Mach numbers ranging from 1 to 8, and three modes of driving: purely solenoidal, purely compressive, and mixed. We find that P(F) is discontinuous at F = 0, with the discontinuity increasing with Mach number and compressive driving. P(K) resembles a lognormal with a negative skew. The joint distribution, P(F, K), shows a bimodal distribution, with gas either existing at high F and high K or at low F and low K.

<div> 中间质量黑洞（IMBHs），BHMF，ERDF，活动星系核（AGNs），活跃分数

总结: 该研究调查了黑洞质量函数（BHMF）和厄丁顿比分布函数（ERDF），着重关注质量低至M•∼104M⊙的中间质量黑洞（IMBHs）。通过对红移z<0.35的已探测到宽Hα发射线的活动星系核（AGNs）进行研究，构建了包括243个IMBHs（M•<106M⊙）在内的14242个AGN样本。通过最大后验估计联合建模BHMF和ERDF，发现BHMF在∼106M⊙处峰值，并在低质量端呈现相对恒定值10-4 Mpc-3 dex-1。通过将type 1 AGNs的BHMF与基于更新的黑洞质量-宿主星系恒星质量关系的星系质量函数进行比较，推导出活跃分数。同时，利用type 1分数的上限和下限确定所有AGNs的活跃分数。对于质量较大的星系（M⋆>1010M⊙），活跃分数下降至15%–40%，对于M⋆∼108M⊙的侏儒星系，下降至低于∼2%。这些结果表明，如果IMBHs和超大质量黑洞的工作周期相似，质量较低星系（M⋆∼108.5–109M⊙）的黑洞占据分数预计将达到∼50%。 <div>
We investigate the black hole mass function (BHMF) and the Eddington ratio distribution function (ERDF), focusing on the intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) with masses down to M• ∼ 104 M⊙. Based on the active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with a detected broad Hα emission line, we construct a sample of 14,242 AGNs at redshift z < 0.35, including 243 IMBHs with M• < 106 M⊙. By jointly modeling the BHMF and ERDF via the maximum posterior estimation, we find that the BHMF peaks at ∼106 M⊙ and exhibits a relatively constant value of 10−4 Mpc−3 dex−1 at the low-mass end. By comparing the derived BHMF of type 1 AGNs with the galaxy mass function based on the updated black hole mass–host galaxy stellar mass relation, we derive the active fraction. We also determine the active fraction for all AGNs using the upper and lower limit of the type 1 fraction. The active fraction decreases from 15%–40% for massive galaxies (M⋆ > 1010 M⊙) to lower than ∼2% for dwarf galaxies with M⋆ ∼ 108 M⊙. These results suggest that the black hole occupation fraction is expected to be ∼50% for low-mass galaxies (M⋆ ∼ 108.5–109 M⊙) if the duty cycle is similar between IMBHs and supermassive black holes.

<div> 聚合物，极化特性，星际尘埃，形状修剪，X射线散射
总结:
本文研究了45种非凸形状的聚合物，它们都是由N个大小相等的球体聚合而成的。研究者考虑了三种不同的聚集方案，分别为N = 2，N = 3和N = 256个随机聚合物以及通过系统修剪初始随机聚合物来增加扁平化或拉长的“修剪”N = 256个聚合物。研究发现，唯一与星光极化和极化热辐射观察一致的形状是那些被修剪以增加其不对称性的形状。文章指出，如果恒星间尘埃颗粒是高孔隙度的聚合物，则必须存在可以导致极端拉长或扁平化的过程；否则，恒星间尘埃颗粒必然由相当紧凑的结构主导，最多具有中等孔隙度。文章还指出，在10微米硅酸盐特征的极化与光学范围内的星光极化的比率对孔隙度和形状不敏感。X射线散射可能是确定恒星间尘埃颗粒孔隙度的最佳工具。研究者提出，恒星间尘埃颗粒的适度孔隙度可能是“光解致密化”的结果。一些0级恒星核中观察到的高极化分数需要在密集区域中减少孔隙度和/或增加聚合物不对称性进行处理。 <div>
A previous study (Paper I) investigated the polarization properties of a variety of simple convex grain shapes, some of which were found to be consistent with the observed polarization properties of interstellar dust from far-ultraviolet to far-infrared. Here, we study the optical properties of 45 nonconvex shapes, all aggregates of N equal-sized spheres. We consider N = 2, N = 3, and N = 256 random aggregates obtained from three different aggregation schemes. We also consider “trimmed” N = 256 aggregates obtained by systematically trimming initially random aggregates to increase either flattening or elongation. The “macroporosities” of the studied aggregates range from (for the N = 2 bisphere) to (for the N = 256 “BA” aggregates). The only aggregates consistent with observations of starlight polarization and polarized thermal emission are shapes that have been trimmed to increase their asymmetry. If interstellar grains are high-porosity aggregates, there must be processes causing extreme elongation or flattening; if not, interstellar grains must be dominated by fairly compact structures, with at most moderate porosities. The ratio of polarization in the 10 μm silicate feature to starlight polarization in the optical is shown to be insensitive to porosity and shape. X-ray scattering may be the best tool to determine the porosity of interstellar grains. We propose that modest porosities of interstellar grains could be the result of “photolytic densification.” High polarization fractions observed in some Class 0 cores require processes to reduce porosities and/or increase asymmetries of aggregates in dense regions.

Using GOES magnetometer data spanning over 30 yr, we study the distribution of Pc5 ultralow-frequency waves at geosynchronous orbit. The CLEAN algorithm was applied to detect narrowband Pc5 waves. This method was first used in astronomical radio interferometry, but has since been applied to many other areas. The algorithm allows for identification of multiple individual peaks within the same power spectral density. We found close to 30,000 events in each magnetic field component in field-aligned coordinates. With some exceptions, results were in agreement with previous studies. Wave occurrence along magnetic local time (MLT) was higher in the 18–23 MLT sector. However, the largest accumulated wave amplitudes were observed on the dayside, peaking close to local noon. As expected, wave amplitudes were larger during more active solar wind conditions. For the radial and parallel components, amplitudes were maximum at the interplanetary magnetic field clock angle of −30° to −45°. The resultant database of Pc5 ultralow-frequency wave events can be used to constrain radiation belt models, while the CLEAN method provides a unique technique to automatically detect narrowband plasma waves in the magnetosphere and beyond.

The Next Generation Deep Extragalactic Exploratory Public (NGDEEP) survey program was designed specifically to include Near Infrared Slitless Spectroscopic observations (NGDEEP-NISS) to detect multiple emission lines in as many galaxies as possible and across a wide redshift range using the Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph. We present early results obtained from the first set of observations (Epoch 1, 50% of the allocated orbits) of this program (NGDEEP-NISS1). Using a set of independently developed calibration files designed to deal with a complex combination of overlapping spectra, multiple position angles, and multiple cross filters and grisms, in conjunction with a robust and proven algorithm for quantifying contamination from overlapping dispersed spectra, NGDEEP-NISS1 has achieved a 3σ sensitivity limit of 2 × 10−18 erg s−1 cm−2. We demonstrate the power of deep wide field slitless spectroscopy (WFSS) to characterize the star formation rates, and metallicity ([O iii]/Hβ), and dust content, of galaxies at 1 < z < 3.5. The latter showing intriguing initial results on the applicability and assumptions made regarding the use of Case B recombination. Further, we identify the presence of active galactic nuclei and infer the mass of their supermassive black holes using broadened restframe Mg ii and Hβ emission lines. The spectroscopic results are then compared with the physical properties of galaxies extrapolated from fitting spectral energy distribution models to photometry alone. The results clearly demonstrate the unique power and efficiency of WFSS at near-infrared wavelengths over other methods to determine the properties of galaxies across a broad range of redshifts.

本研究利用第三代斯隆数字天文巡天/重子振荡光谱巡天（BOSS）的CMASS北银道帽样本进行推断，目的是对中微子质量进行限制。我们利用空洞大小函数、空洞-星系交叉功率谱和星系自相关功率谱进行推断。通过模拟基于隐式似然推断的方法，使用了粒子-中微子宇宙学模拟中的丰富暗物质分布模型。在保守的尺度下，我们从星系自相关功率谱和完整数据向量中找到了中微子质量∑mν的上限为0.43和0.35电子伏特（95%可信区间）。放松尺度限制后，我们得到了0.28和0.32电子伏特的结果。总体而言，空洞统计似乎为自相关功率谱添加了适度但非零的信息。我们还证实了空洞大小函数呈泊松分布的假设。

Cosmic voids identified in the spatial distribution of galaxies provide complementary information to two-point statistics. In particular, constraints on the neutrino mass sum, ∑mν, promise to benefit from the inclusion of void statistics. We perform inference on the CMASS Northern Galactic Cap sample of the third-generation Sloan Digital Sky Survey/Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) with the aim of constraining ∑mν. We utilize the void size function, the void–galaxy cross power spectrum, and the galaxy auto power spectrum. To extract constraints from these summary statistics we use a simulation-based approach, specifically implicit likelihood inference. We populate approximate gravity-only, particle-neutrino cosmological simulations with an expressive halo occupation distribution model. With a conservative scale cut of and a Planck-inspired Lambda cold dark matter prior, we find upper bounds on ∑mν of 0.43 and 0.35 eV from the galaxy auto power spectrum and the full data vector, respectively (95% credible interval). Relaxing the scale cut to , we find 0.28 and 0.32 eV. Generally, void statistics appear to add modest but nonzero information beyond the auto power spectrum. We also substantiate the usual assumption that the void size function is Poisson distributed.

<div> 关键词: Gamma-ray bursts, clustering analysis, radiation mechanisms, GRB classes, progenitor origins
总结:<br />这项研究利用了聚类分析方法对来自Fermi和BATSE的Gamma射线暴数据进行了分析，鉴定出了四类GRB(A-D)，并根据辐射机制、持续时间和光谱指数进行了评估。长GRBs主要表现为演变辐射，短GRBs更倾向于光谱辐射。大约63%的暴发显示出同步辐射特征，其余37%与光球辐射相关。通过对这些类别进行考察，可以更好地了解GRB的辐射、持续时间和起源。<br /> <div>
Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), often attributed to massive star collapse or binary compact object mergers, exhibit diverse emission characteristics hinting at multiple GRB classes based on various factors like progenitors, radiation mechanisms, and central engines. This study employs unsupervised clustering using the nested Gaussian mixture model algorithm to analyze data from Fermi and BATSE, identifying four classes (A–D) based on duration, spectral peak, and spectral index of time-integrated spectra of GRBs. Class proportions are approximately 70%, 10%, 3%, and 17%, respectively, with A and B comprising mostly long GRBs, C mainly short GRBs, and D encompassing both types. The classes are further assessed based on spectral index α, indicating distinct radiation mechanisms: α > −0.67 for photospheric emission, α ≤ −1.5 for fast-cooling synchrotron, and −1.5 < α ≤ −0.67 for slow-cooling synchrotron. Classes B and C align with photospheric emission, while A and D predominantly exhibit synchrotron radiation. Short GRBs are predominantly photospheric emission, whereas long GRBs tend to favor synchrotron emission. Overall, 63% of the total bursts exhibit α profiles indicative of synchrotron emission, with the remaining 37% associated with photospheric emission. Considering the limited data of kilonova and supernova associated with GRBs, classes are examined for progenitor origins, suggesting a hybrid nature for A and D, and collapsar and merger origins for B and C, respectively. This clustering analysis results in four GRB classes, which, upon investigation, reveal the diverse and complex nature of GRBs in terms of their radiation, duration, and progenitor.

<br /><br />总结:
这篇文章讨论了原行星盘中固体颗粒的径向漂移对行星形成的影响。通常认为固体颗粒的径向漂移会威胁行星的形成，因为它会在颗粒组装成行星之前将它们从盘中移除。然而，径向漂移可能也会在盘中特定位置集中固体颗粒，从而加速凝聚过程。研究发现，在一些情况下，行星体可能会向外漂移，而不是向内。这导致盘中存在一些半径作为行星体的稳定吸引体。研究还发现，即使考虑到行星体尺寸的广泛差异，这可能会导致行星体表面密度增加超过一个数量级。 <div>
Radial drift of solid particles in the protoplanetary disk is often invoked as a threat to planet formation, as it removes solid material from the disk before it can be assembled into planets. However, it may also concentrate solids at particular locations in the disk, thus accelerating the coagulation process. Planetesimals are thought to drift much faster in an eccentric disk, due to their higher velocities with respect to the gas, but their drift rate has only been calculated using approximate means. In this work, we show that in some cases previous estimates of the drift rate, based on a modification of the results for an axisymmetric disk, are highly inaccurate. In particular, we find that under some easily realized circumstances, planetesimals may drift outwards, rather than inwards. This results in the existence of radii in the disk that act as stable attractors of planetesimals. We show that this can lead to a local enhancement of more than an order of magnitude in the surface density of planetesimals, even when a wide dispersion of planetesimal size is considered.

这篇文章使用JWST对高密度热土星HD 149026b的日食光谱进行了研究，创建了一系列1D辐射-对流-热化学平衡大气模型和光谱。研究发现，钛氧化物引起了热反转，与数据不一致，而氧化钒的存在改变了大气的温度-压力轮廓。预估了HD 149026b的大气金属丰度，并发现较低的金属丰度使其更符合其他巨大行星的质量-金属丰度关系。还发现C/O比例，并根据热再分布因子推测了HD 149026b大气中可能存在的分子。总结: 这篇文章使用JWST对HD 149026b进行了大气特性的研究，发现了大气金属丰度和热再分布的重要参数，并对大气中可能存在的分子进行了推测。 <div>
Recent JWST eclipse spectra of the high-density hot Saturn HD 149026b between 2.35 and 5.08 μm have allowed for in-depth study of its atmosphere. To understand its atmospheric properties, we have created a grid of 1D radiative-convective–thermochemical–equilibrium atmosphere models and spectra with PICASO 3.0. In agreement with previous work, we find that the presence of gaseous TiO creates a thermal inversion, which is inconsistent with the data. The presence of gaseous VO, however, which condenses at temperatures 200 K cooler, does not cause such inversions but alters the temperature–pressure profile of the atmosphere. We estimate an atmospheric metallicity of solar without VO and solar with VO, a factor of ∼10 times smaller than previous work from Bean et al., who relied on atmosphere retrievals. We attribute this significant difference in metallicity to a larger temperature gradient at low pressures in radiative equilibrium models. Such models with lower metallicities readily fit the strong CO2 feature at 4.3 μm. Our lower estimated metallicity makes HD 149026b more consistent with the mass–metallicity relationship for other giant planets. We find a C/O ratio of with and without VO. The best-fit heat redistribution factor without VO is 1.17, a very high value suggesting very little dayside energy transport and no energy transport to the nightside. The heat redistribution factor shrinks to a more plausible value of , with VO, which we regard as circumstantial evidence for the molecule in the atmosphere of HD 149026b.

总结:<br />
本研究利用Solar Orbiter和Parker Solar Probe的观测数据，结合磁流体模型，对快速太阳风和慢Alfvénic太阳风的组成和变化进行了研究。通过对离子组成、电离态比率等多方面的分析，成功验证了模型和实测数据相结合的有效性，并确定了来自小赤道区冕洞的两条快速太阳风流，和来自冕洞边界的高Alfvénicity慢太阳风流的特征。这项研究充分展示了多种仪器和数据的综合研究对于太阳风来源的重要性。 <div>
We seek to understand the composition and variability of fast solar wind (FSW) and slow Alfvénic solar wind emerging from coronal holes (CHs). We leverage an opportune conjunction between Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe (PSP) during PSP Encounter 11 to include compositional diagnostics from the Solar Orbiter Heavy Ion Sensor as these variations provide crucial insights into the origin and nature of the solar wind. We use potential field source surface and magnetohydrodynamic models to connect the observed plasma at PSP and Solar Orbiter to its origin footpoint in the photosphere and compare these results with the in situ measurements. A very clear signature of a heliospheric current sheet crossing as evidenced by enhancements in low first ionization potential (FIP) elements, ion charge state ratios, proton density, low Alfvénicity, and polarity estimates validates the combination of modeling, data, and mapping. We identify two FSW streams emerging from small equatorial CHs with low ion charge state ratios, low FIP bias, high Alfvénicity, and low footpoint brightness, yet anomalously low alpha particle abundance for both streams. We identify high-Alfvénicity slow solar wind emerging from the overexpanded boundary of a CH having intermediate alpha abundance, high Alfvénicity, and dips in ion charge state ratios corresponding to CH boundaries. Through this comprehensive analysis, we highlight the power of multi-instrument conjunction studies in assessing the sources of the solar wind.

<title>A Temperature or Far-ultraviolet Tracer? The HNC/HCN Ratio in M83 on the Scale of Giant Molecular Clouds</title>

<div> 高分辨率观测、星系M83、HNC/HCN比率、星际物质、紫外辐射

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章讨论了HNC/HCN比率在星系M83中的观测，以及它与星际物质和紫外辐射的关系。研究发现，在星系中心区域，HNC/HCN比率随着星形率的增加而升高，而在条状末端区域，HNC/HCN比率与星形率、星形效率和柱密度无关。这一结果与之前关于HNC/HCN比率随温度升高而降低的假设不符。通过对光谱形状的分析，结果表明这一趋势可能是由于HCN的光学厚和HNC的光学薄所致。此外，在条状末端区域，通过对远红外比值的尘埃温度和HNC/HCN比率的大尺度（约200pc）相关性的比较，发现HNC/HCN比率与尘埃温度呈负相关，表明HNC/HCN比率取决于影响低柱密度星际介质的紫外辐射场。 <div>
The HNC/HCN ratio is observationally known as a thermometer in Galactic interstellar molecular clouds. A recent study has alternatively suggested that the HNC/HCN ratio is affected by the ultraviolet (UV) field, not by the temperature. We aim to study this ratio on the scale of giant molecular clouds in the barred spiral galaxy M83 towards the southwestern bar end and the central region from Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations, and if possible, distinguish the above scenarios. We compare the high-resolution (40–50 pc) HNC/HCN ratios with the star formation rate from the 3 mm continuum intensity and the molecular mass inferred from the HCN intensities. Our results show that the HNC/HCN ratios do not vary with the star formation rates, star formation efficiencies, or column densities in the bar-end region. In the central region, the HNC/HCN ratios become higher with higher star formation rates, which tend to cause higher temperatures. This result is not consistent with the previously proposed scenario in which the HNC/HCN ratio decreases with increasing temperature. Spectral shapes suggest that this trend may be due to optically thick HCN and optically thin HNC. In addition, we compare the large-scale (∼200 pc) correlation between the dust temperature from the far-IR ratio and the HNC/HCN ratio for the southwestern bar-end region. The HNC/HCN ratio is lower when the dust temperatures are higher. We suggest from the above results that the HNC/HCN ratio depends on the UV radiation field that affects the interstellar medium on the ∼100 pc scale where the column densities are low.

<div> 关键词: 红超巨星(RSGs), Magellanic Clouds, GP回归, 颗粒化参数, 金属丰度

总结:<br />
这篇文章系统地研究了在麦哲伦云中红超巨星(RSGs)的颗粒化现象。首先对RSG样本进行了前景星和可能被错误标识的源的检查，然后对光变曲线进行了排除异常值和光度质量的检查。接着采用高斯过程回归(GP)来建模颗粒化，应用马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛方法来推导颗粒化幅度σ和无阻尼振荡器的周期ρ，以及阻尼时间尺度τ。然后通过计算无量纲品质因子Q对RSGs进行进一步分析。结合颗粒化参数和恒星参数，建立了稳健的时间尺度ρ的缩放关系，而幅度σ的缩放关系则由分段函数表示，可能与暗淡RSGs的幅度趋向某个特定值有关。通过比较小麦哲伦云和大麦哲伦云的结果，证实随着金属丰度的增加，振幅和时间尺度也会变大。在两个星系之间的缩放关系方面，发现ρ几乎不受金属丰度的影响，而σ受金属丰度的影响更为显著。文章还比较了GP方法和颗粒化的周期图拟合，讨论了它们各自的优势。 <div>
The granulation of red supergiants (RSGs) in the Magellanic Clouds is systematically investigated by combining the latest RSG samples and light curves from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment and the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae. The present RSG samples are first examined for foreground stars and possible misidentified sources, and the light curves are sequentially checked to remove the outliers by white noise and photometric quality. The Gaussian process (GP) regression is used to model the granulation, and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo is applied to derive the granulation amplitude σ and the period of the undamped oscillator ρ, as well as the damping timescale τ. The dimensionless quality factor Q is then calculated through Q = πτ/ρ. RSGs around are considered to have significant granulation signals and are used for further analysis. Combining granulation parameters with stellar parameters, robust scaling relations for the timescale ρ are established, while the scaling relations for amplitude σ are represented by a piecewise function, possibly related to the tendency of amplitudes in faint RSGs to converge toward a certain value. Comparing results between the Small Magellanic Cloud and the Large Magellanic Cloud confirms that amplitudes and timescales become larger with metallicity. In examining the scaling relations between the two galaxies, it is found that ρ is nearly independent of metallicity, whereas σ is more significantly affected by metallicity. The GP method is compared with the periodogram fitting of the granulations, and the advantages of either are discussed.

<title>A New Timescale–Mass Scaling for the Optical Variation of Active Galactic Nuclei across the Intermediate-mass to Supermassive Scales</title>

The variability of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) has long been servicing as an essential avenue of exploring the accretion physics of a black hole (BH). There are two commonly used methods for analyzing AGN variability. First, the AGN variability, characterized by the structure function (SF) of a single band, can be well described by a damped random walk (DRW) process on timescales longer than ∼weeks, shorter than which departures have been reported. Second, the color variation (CV) between two bands behaves timescale dependent, raising challenges to the widely accepted reprocessing scenario. However, both the departure from the DRW process and the timescale-dependent CV are hitherto limited to AGNs, mainly quasars, at the supermassive scale. Here, utilizing the high-cadence multiwavelength monitoring on NGC 4395 harboring an intermediate-mass BH, we unveil at the intermediate-mass scale for the first time, prominent departures from the DRW process at timescales shorter than ∼hours in all three nights and bands, and plausible timescale-dependent CVs in the two longest nights of observation. Furthermore, comparing SFs of NGC 4395 to four AGNs at the supermassive scale, we suggest a new scaling relation between the timescale (τ; across nearly 3 orders of magnitude) and the BH mass (MBH): where the exponent γ is likely ≃0.6–0.8. This exponent differs from most previous measurements, but confirms a few, and is consistent with a recent theoretical prediction, suggesting a similar accretion process in AGNs across different mass scales.

In this paper, we introduce a U-Net model of deep learning algorithms for reconstructions of the 3D peculiar velocity field, which simplifies the reconstruction process with enhanced precision. We test the adaptability of the U-Net model with simulation data under more realistic conditions, including the redshift space distortion effect and halo mass threshold. Our results show that the U-Net model outperforms the analytical method that runs under ideal conditions, with a 16% improvement in precision, 13% in residuals, 18% in correlation coefficient, and 27% in average coherence. The deep learning algorithm exhibits exceptional capacities to capture velocity features in nonlinear regions and substantially improve reconstruction precision in boundary regions. We then apply the U-Net model trained under Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) observational conditions to the SDSS Data Release 7 data for observational 3D peculiar velocity reconstructions.

The details of the dynamo process in the Sun are an important aspect of research in solar-terrestrial physics and astrophysics. The surface part of the dynamo can be constrained by direct observations, but the subsurface part lacks direct observational constraints. The torsional oscillations, a small periodic variation of the Sun's rotation with the solar cycle, are thought to result from the Lorentz force of the cyclic magnetic field generated by the dynamo. In this study, we aim to discriminate between three Babcock–Leighton dynamo models by comparing the zonal acceleration of the three models with the observed one. The property that the poleward and equatorward branches of the torsional oscillations originate from about ±55° latitudes with their own migration time periods serves as an effective discriminator that could constrain the configuration of the magnetic field in the convection zone. The toroidal field, comprising poleward and equatorward branches separated at about ±55° latitudes, can generate the two branches of the torsional oscillations. The alternating acceleration and deceleration bands in time are the other property of the torsional oscillations that discriminates between the dynamo models. To reproduce this property, the phase difference between the radial (Br) and toroidal (Bϕ) components of the magnetic field near the surface should be about π/2.

We here focus on the behavior of supernovae that technically explode in 1D (spherical symmetry). When simulated in 3D, however, the outcomes of representative progenitors of this class are quite different in almost all relevant quantities. In 3D, the explosion energies can be 2 to 10 times higher, and there are correspondingly large differences in the 56Ni yields. These differences between the 3D and 1D simulations reflect in part the relative delay to explosion of the latter and in the former the presence of protoneutron star convection that boosts the driving neutrino luminosities by as much as ∼50% at later times. In addition, we find that the ejecta in 3D models are more neutron-rich, resulting in significant weak r-process and 48Ca yields. Furthermore, we find that in 3D the core is an interesting, though subdominant, source of acoustic power. In summary, we find that though a model might be found theoretically to explode in 1D, one must perform supernova simulations in 3D to capture most of the associated observables. The differences between 1D and 3D models are just too large to ignore.

We compare mock ultraviolet C ii and Si ii absorption and emission line features generated using a ∼109M⊙ virtual galaxy with observations of 131 z ∼ 3 galaxies from the vandels survey. We find that the mock spectra reproduce reasonably well a large majority (83%) of the vandels spectra (χ2 < 2), but do not resemble the most massive objects (⪆1010 M⊙), which exhibit broad absorption features. Interestingly, the best-matching mock spectra originate from periods of intense star formation in the virtual galaxy, where its luminosity is 4 times higher than in periods of relative quiescence. Furthermore, for each galaxy, we predict the Lyman continuum (LyC) escape fractions ( ) using the environment of the virtual galaxy. We derive an average of 0.01 ± 0.02, consistent with other estimates from the literature. The are tightly correlated with the Lyα escape fractions and highly consistent with observed empirical trends. Additionally, galaxies with larger exhibit bluer β slopes, more Lyα flux, and weaker low-ionization absorption lines. Building upon the good agreement between and observationally established LyC diagnostics, we examine the LyC leakage mechanisms in the simulation. We find that LyC photon leakage is enhanced in directions where the observed flux dominantly emerges from compact regions depleted of neutral gas and dust, mirroring the scenario inferred from observational data. In general, this study further highlights the potential of high-resolution radiation hydrodynamics simulations in analyzing UV absorption and emission line features and providing valuable insights into the LyC leakage of star-forming galaxies.

总结:
通过对Serpens South原行星团和延伸的纤维的密集气体进行观测和分析，发现大部分密集核是超维特性的，而位于纤维中的核主要是由引力束缚的。这些核无法形成恒星，除非它们获得额外的质量或其内部运动减少。南部纤维显示了明显的速度梯度，可能因为向星团的质量流动。北部纤维的运动更加复杂。观察发现非热运动与气体温度存在强相关性，这种加热和星团驱动的流出与密集气体的相互作用可能是导致增加非热运动的原因。假设一定比例的核质量最终会形成年轻恒星，未来Serpens South原行星团中的星际气体将会转向更高的质量形成恒星。 <br /><br /> <div>
Most stars form in clusters and groups rather than in isolation. We present ≲5″ angular resolution (∼2000 au, or 0.01 pc) Very Large Array NH3 (1,1), (2,2), and (3,3) and 1.3 cm continuum emission observations of the dense gas within the Serpens South protocluster and extended filaments to the north and south. We identify 94 dense cores using a dendrogram analysis of the NH3 (1,1) integrated intensity. Gas temperatures TK and nonthermal line widths σNT both increase toward the center of the young stellar cluster, in the dense gas generally and in the cores specifically. We find that most cores (54%) are supervirial, with gravitationally bound cores located primarily in the filaments. Cores in the protocluster have higher virial parameters by a factor of ∼1.7, driven primarily by the increased core σNT values. These cores cannot collapse to form stars unless they accrete additional mass or their core internal motions are reduced. The southern filament shows a significant velocity gradient previously interpreted as mass flow toward the cluster. We find more complex kinematics in the northern filament. We find a strong correlation between σNT and TK, and argue that the enhanced temperatures and nonthermal motions are due to mechanical heating and interaction between the protocluster-driven outflows and the dense gas. Filament-led accretion may also contribute to the increased σNT values. Assuming a constant fraction of core mass ends up in the young stars, future star formation in the Serpens South protocluster will shift to higher masses by a factor of ∼2.

<title>Reconstruction of Cosmic Black Hole Growth and Mass Distribution from Quasar Luminosity Functions at z > 4: Implications for Faint and Low-mass Populations in JWST</title>

<br />总结:<br />本文通过理论模型描述了黑洞从初期种子阶段到大约4的生长过程，考虑了吸积期间的持续时间、Eddington比率分布，以及BH吸积速率的质量依赖性。通过4≤z≤6范围内的观测到的QLF，约束了模型参数，发现高红移BH群体在z≳6时迅速增长，随后速度减缓。向较低红移（z<6）方向，质量相关吸积抑制了M•>10^8M⊙的高质量BH的增长，导致M•≳10^10M⊙时出现质量饱和。我们预测了4≤z≤11时BH质量函数，为未来观测提供了基准。这些发现还表明了早期BH-星系质量相关的两个不同路径：BH/星际质量比接近本地值M•/M⋆≃ 5×10^-3的群体通过适度增长保持相关性，而在本地相关性之上开始增长的群体则在z∼6时成为超质量，达到M•/M⋆∼0.01-0.1。 <div>
The evolution of the quasar luminosity function (QLF) is fundamental to understanding the cosmic evolution of black holes (BHs) through their accretion phases. In the era of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), Euclid, and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, their unprecedented detection sensitivity and wide survey area can unveil the low-luminosity quasar and low-mass BH population, and provide new insights into quasar host galaxies. We present a theoretical model describing BH growth from initial seeding at z ≳ 20 to ∼ 4, incorporating the duration of accretion episodes, the distribution of Eddington ratios, and the mass dependency of BH accretion rates. By constraining the model parameters with the observed QLFs at 4 ≤ z ≤ 6 across a wide UV luminosity range, we find that the high-redshift BH population grows rapidly at z ≳ 6, and decelerates the pace in subsequent epochs. Toward lower redshifts (z < 6), mass-dependent accretion inhibits the growth of high-mass BHs with M• > 108M⊙, leading to mass saturation at M• ≳ 1010M⊙. We predict the BH mass function down to M• ∼ 106M⊙ for both unobscured and obscured quasar populations at 4 ≤ z ≤ 11, offering a benchmark for future observational tests. Our model accounts for the presence of both bright and faint quasars at z > 4, including those discovered by JWST. Furthermore, our findings suggest two distinct pathways for the early assembly of the BH–galaxy mass correlation: the population with a BH-to-stellar-mass ratio near the local value of M•/M⋆ ≃ 5 × 10−3 maintains proximity to the relation via moderate growth, while the population that begins to grow above the local relation becomes as overmassive as M•/M⋆ ∼ 0.01–0.1 by z ∼ 6 via rapid mass accretion.

总结: <br />这项研究关注孤立矮椭球星系中恒星反馈的数值模拟，结果显示恒星反馈会导致最近的星形成停滞。模拟结果与Leo II的观测数据相匹配，但在恒星年龄和金属丰度分布上存在差异，暗示了宇宙中的气体输入可能在塑造矮椭球星系中扮演更为复杂的角色。研究结果表明，目前停滞的矮星系不一定需要在星团或星系团内演化，恒星反馈可能足以塑造这些星系。 <div>
A fundamental question regarding the evolution of dwarf spheroidal galaxies is the identification of the key physical mechanisms responsible for gas depletion. Here, we focus on the study of stellar feedback in isolated dwarf spheroidal galaxies by performing numerical simulations using a modified version of the smoothed-particle hydrodynamics code GADGET-3. The Milky Way satellite Leo II (PGC 34176) in the Local Group was considered as our default model dwarf galaxy. The parameter space for the stellar feedback models was explored to match observational constraints of Leo II, such as residual gas mass, total mass within the tidal radius, star formation history, final stellar mass, stellar ages, and metallicity. Additionally, we examined the impact of the binary fraction of stars, initial mass function, dark matter halo mass, and initial gas reservoir. Many simulations revealed recent star formation quenching due to stellar feedback. In general, the gas depletion, expected star formation history, total mass of stars, and total mass within the tidal radius were adequately reproduced in the simulations when compared to observational estimates. However, there were discrepancies in the distribution of stellar ages and metallicities, which suggested that the cosmic gas infall would play a more complex role in our dwarf spheroidal galaxy than captured by a monolithic infall scenario. Our results suggest that currently quenched dwarf galaxies may not necessarily need to evolve within clusters or groups and that stellar feedback alone could be a sufficient factor in shaping at least some of these galaxies as we observe them today.

White dwarf stars have been used for decades as precise and accurate age indicators. This work presents a test of the reliability of white dwarf total ages when spectroscopic observations are available. We conduct follow-up spectroscopy of 148 individual white dwarfs in widely separated double-white-dwarf (WD+WD) binaries. We supplement the sample with 264 previously published white dwarf spectra, as well as 1292 high-confidence white dwarf spectral types inferred from their Gaia XP spectra. We find that spectroscopic fits to optical spectra do not provide noticeable improvement to the age agreement among white dwarfs in wide WD+WD binaries. The median age agreement is ≈1.5σ for both photometrically and spectroscopically determined total ages, for pairs of white dwarfs with each having a total age uncertainty < 20%. For DA white dwarfs, we further find that photometrically determined atmospheric parameters from spectral energy distribution fitting give better total age agreement (1.0σ, 0.2 Gyr, or 14% of the binary’s average total age) compared to spectroscopically determined parameters from Balmer-line fits (agreement of 1.5σ, 0.3 Gyr, or 28% of binary’s average total age). We find further evidence of a significant merger fraction among wide WD+WD binaries: across multiple spectroscopically identified samples, roughly 20% are inconsistent with a monotonically increasing initial–final mass relation. We recommend the acquisition of an identification spectrum to ensure the correct atmospheric models are used in photometric fits in order to determine the most accurate total age of a white dwarf star.

总结:<br /><br />本文利用NASA帕克太阳探测器的数据集，通过Hurst重整化范围R/S分析、去趋势波动分析、居中移动平均分析和自然时间波动的研究方法，研究了太阳能粒子时间序列的长期持续性。通过交叉相关分析，模拟了背景系统噪声，并从原始数据中减去。这四种方法的应用使我们能够区分安静太阳期和活跃太阳期，识别活动的开始并在最大太阳能粒子通量达到之前揭示活动的有趣细节。还首次根据自然时间波动的熵变化估计了未来风暴的最大太阳能粒子通量。 <div>
We investigate the long-term persistence of solar energetic particle (SEP) time series by means of four different methods: Hurst rescaled range R/S analysis, detrended fluctuation analysis, centered moving average analysis, and the fluctuation of natural time under the time reversal method. For these analyses, we use data sets from the Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun instrument suite on board NASA's Parker Solar Probe. Background systematic noise is modeled using cross-correlation analysis between different SEP energy channels and subtracted from the original data. The use of these four methods for deriving the time-series persistence allows us to (i) differentiate between quiet- and active-Sun periods based on the values of the corresponding self-similarity exponents alone; (ii) identify the onset of an ongoing activity well before it reaches its maximum SEP flux; (iii) reveal an interesting fine structure when activity is observed; and (iv) provide, for the first time, an estimate of the maximum SEP flux of a future storm based on the entropy change of natural time under time reversal.

总结: <br />
本研究探讨了太阳风密度结构的周期性变化，发现了两种不同尺度的周期性结构，并通过仿真推断了它们的大小范围。该研究是首个针对磁场强度周期性变化与PDS相关性的统计研究。通过对太阳风密度和磁场强度的观测和分析，为约束模型和深入了解PDS与磁层耦合关系提供了重要信息。 <br /> <div>
Periodic density structures (PDSs) are quasiperiodic variations of solar wind density ranging from a few minutes to a few hours. PDSs advect with the solar wind and have radial length scales (Lx) of tens to several thousand megameters, thus belonging to the class of “mesoscale structures.” Current interplanetary multispacecraft observations are not at spatial separations capable of directly measuring the 3D size scale of PDSs or other mesoscale structures. Instead, previous investigations estimated characteristic spatial scales in solar wind parameters using cross-correlation and/or coherence analysis applied to multispacecraft observations. For the solar wind density and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) intensity, the reported size scales perpendicular to the Sun–Earth line (Ly) ranged between ≈30 and ≈200 Earth Radii (RE). Here, we implemented a similar approach for the same parameters, but focused on high-density, slow-solar-wind intervals with PDSs observed by the Wind and ARTEMIS-P1 spacecraft. Additionally, this is the first statistical study of the IMF intensity periodicities in relation to PDSs. We identified intervals in which the two spacecraft observed the same periodicity, obtaining two PDS groups based on their radial length scale: Lx1 ≈ 86RE and Lx2 ≈ 35RE. Then, we classified the events based on the periodic variations’ coherence level. Reproducing the results with simulations of the PDSs’ transit, we inferred the Ly order of magnitudes for the two PDS groups: Ly1 ≈ 340RE and Ly2 ≈ 187RE. Knowing the PDSs’ size scales is fundamental for constraining models aimed at reproducing these structures and is critical for better understanding the PDS–magnetosphere coupling.

Of the about 300 gas-phase molecular species so far detected in the interstellar medium (ISM), mostly via observations of their rotational lines, around 40% contain nitrogen (N) atoms. Likewise, of the less than a dozen interstellar molecules, firmly or likely detected in the solid-state water-dominated icy matrix by means of infrared observations, two bear N. A crucial parameter that regulates whether a species is in the gas or adsorbed on the icy phase is their binding energy (BE) toward the icy grain. Therefore, an accurate quantification of the BE is of paramount importance to properly model the ISM chemistry through numerical models. However, very few BEs are available in the literature, either determined experimentally or theoretically. In the present study, we calculate the BEs of 21 among the most abundant interstellar N-bearing species. We adopted two structural water ice models, representing a crystalline and an amorphous surface, using a reliable cost-effective procedure based on the density functional theory. While on the crystalline surface model only one BE per species is obtained due to the high symmetry of the unit cell, on the amorphous model from 5 to 10 BEs are obtained, due to its richer surface morphological variety. Most of our computed BEs agree with available experimental and other computational values. Finally, we discuss how the newly computed BEs can help estimate which N-bearing species can be frozen at the water snow line and, therefore, incorporated in water-rich ice planetesimals.

总结:
该研究利用500米口径球面射电望远镜(FAST)对蜘蛛脉冲星J1816+ 4510进行了射电日食特性的观测。研究发现，随着频率的增加，脉冲星J1816+ 4510的日食出射比入射时间更长，且呈现出更对称的现象。此外，观测还表明，由于伴星的散射作用，脉冲轮廓在日食区域进一步变宽。研究还发现，日食期间的射电脉冲模糊主要受到散射的影响，而不是色散度测量的波动。这些观测结果有助于理论研究蜘蛛脉冲星系统的射电日食机制。 <div>
We report on the radio eclipse properties of spider pulsar J1816+4510 using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The high-sensitivity FAST observations will allow us to probe much deeper into the eclipse region of this pulsar at higher frequencies >1 GHz. The duration of the full eclipse, eclipse ingress, and egress at 1100, 1200, 1300, and 1400 MHz are measured, respectively. The variation of eclipse duration with frequency is studied by splitting the FAST observations into four subbands. It is found that the eclipse egress of PSR J1816+4510 takes longer than the ingress and becomes more symmetrical with increasing frequency. The variations of the durations with the frequency for the full eclipse, eclipse ingress, and egress follow a power-law decay pattern with different indices. The pulse profile variations near the eclipse are studied. It is found that the broadening of pulse profiles becomes more prominent with deepening into the eclipse region due to the scattering from the companion star. Moreover, the pulse smearing induced by the scattering and the rapid dispersion measure (DM) fluctuations within a subintegration during the eclipse egress at different frequencies and orbital phases is comparatively studied. It is found that the scattering plays a more important role than the DM fluctuations for the pulse smearing of the eclipse. The observations of this paper will provide important clues for the theoretical studies of the radio eclipse mechanism of the spider pulsar systems.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present an analysis of the whole 2018 outburst of the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1820+070 with Insight-HXMT data. We focus our study on the temporal evolution of the parameters of the source. We employ two different models to fit the disk’s thermal spectrum: the Newtonian model diskbb and the relativistic model nkbb. These two models provide different pictures of the source in the soft state. With diskbb, we find that the inner edge of the disk is close to the innermost stable circular orbit of a fast-rotating black hole and the corona changes geometry from the hard to the soft state. With nkbb, we find that the disk is truncated in the soft state and that the coronal geometry does not change significantly during the whole outburst. However, the model with nkbb can predict an untruncated disk around a fast-rotating black hole if we assume that the disk inclination angle is around 30° (instead of ∼60°, which is the inclination angle of the jet and is usually adopted as the disk inclination angle in the literature) and we employ a high-density reflection model. In such a case, we measure a high value of the black hole spin parameter with observations in the soft state, in agreement with the high spin value found from the analysis of the reflection features and in disagreement with the low spin value found by previous continuum-fitting method measurements with the disk inclination angle set to the value of the jet inclination angle.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work reports a novel plasma wave observation in the near-Sun solar wind: frequency-dispersed ion acoustic waves. Similar waves have previously been reported in association with interplanetary shocks or planetary bow shocks, but the waves reported here occur throughout the solar wind sunward of ∼60 solar radii, far from any identified shocks. The waves reported here vary their central frequency by factors of 3–10 over tens of milliseconds, with frequencies that move up or down in time. Using a semiautomated identification algorithm, thousands of wave instances are recorded during each near-Sun orbit of the Parker Solar Probe spacecraft. Wave statistical properties are determined and used to estimate their plasma frame frequency and the energies of protons most likely to be resonant with these waves. Proton velocity distribution functions are explored for one wave interval, and proton enhancements that may be consistent with proton beams are observed. A conclusion from this analysis is that properties of the observed frequency-dispersed ion acoustic waves are consistent with driving by cold, impulsively accelerated proton beams near the ambient proton thermal speed. Based on the large number of observed waves and their properties, it is likely that the impulsive proton beam acceleration mechanism generating these waves is active throughout the inner heliosphere. This may have implications for the acceleration of the solar wind.

<title>Does the Correlation between 2MRS Galaxies and the CMB Indicate an Unmodeled CMB Foreground?</title>

We revisit the claimed detection of a new cosmic microwave background (CMB) foreground based on the correlation between low-redshift Two Micron All Sky Survey Redshift Survey (2MRS) galaxies and CMB temperature maps from the Planck and Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe missions. We reproduce the reported measurements but argue that the original analysis significantly underestimated the uncertainties. We cross-correlate the 2MRS galaxy positions with simulated CMB maps and show that the correlation measured with the real data for late-type spiral galaxies at angular scales θ ≥ 0.°1 and redshift cz < 4500 km s−1 is consistent with zero at the 1.7σ level or less, depending on the exact CMB map and simulation construction. This was the sample that formed the basis for the original detection claim. For smaller angular separations the results are not robust to galaxy type or CMB cleaning method, and we are unable to draw firm conclusions. The original analysis did not propose a specific, falsifiable physical correlation mechanism, and it is impossible to rule out any contribution from an underlying physical effect. However, given our calculations, the lack of signal from expanding the redshift range, and the lack of corroboration from other galaxy surveys, we do not find the evidence for a new CMB foreground signal compelling.

<title>Formation Pathways of the Compact Stellar Systems</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The formation pathways of compact stellar systems (CSSs) are still under debate. We utilize the NewHorizon simulation to investigate the origins of such objects in the field environment. We identified 55 CSS candidates in the simulation whose properties are similar to those of the observed ultracompact dwarfs and compact ellipticals (cEs). All but two most massive objects (cE candidates) are a result of a short starburst. Sixteen are formed by tidal stripping, while the other 39 are intrinsically compact from their birth. The stripped objects originate from dwarf-like galaxies with a dark halo, but most of their dark matter is stripped through their orbital motion around a more massive neighbor galaxy. The 39 intrinsically compact systems are further divided into associated or isolated groups, depending on whether they were born near a massive dark halo or not. The isolated intrinsically compact objects (seven) are born in a dark halo and their stellar properties are older and metal-poor compared to the associated counterparts (32). The stripped compact objects occupy a distinct region in the age–metallicity plane from the intrinsically compact objects. The associated intrinsically compact objects in our sample have never had a dark halo; they are the surviving star clumps of a massive galaxy.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The X-ray morphologies of clusters of galaxies display significant variations, reflecting their dynamical histories and the nonlinear dependence of X-ray emissivity on the density of the intracluster gas. Qualitative and quantitative assessments of X-ray morphology have long been considered a proxy for determining whether clusters are dynamically active or “relaxed.” Conversely, the use of circularly or elliptically symmetric models for cluster emission can be complicated by the variety of complex features realized in nature, spanning scales from megaparsecs down to the resolution limit of current X-ray observatories. In this work, we use mock X-ray images from simulated clusters from The Three Hundred project to define a basis set of cluster image features. We take advantage of the clusters’ approximate self-similarity to minimize the differences between images before encoding the remaining diversity through a distribution of high-order polynomial coefficients. Principal component analysis then provides an orthogonal basis for this distribution, corresponding to natural perturbations from an average model. This representation allows novel, realistically complex X-ray cluster images to be easily generated, and we provide code to do so. The approach provides a simple way to generate training data for cluster image analysis algorithms and could be straightforwardly adapted to generate clusters displaying specific types of features or selected by physical characteristics available in the original simulations.

<br /><br />
总结: 本文通过光谱观测确定了X射线双星IGR J16194−2810中M型巨星的单线光谱轨道，发现其谱学轨道周期为192.5天，为光度周期的两倍，证实该巨星是一个椭圆变星。巨星被鉴定为一个接近红巨星顶点的一级上升巨星，其伴星是一颗中子星（NS），并填满它的罗切波，证实了该系统的分类为低质量X射线双星（LMXB）。对M巨星的C、N、O和Fe丰度进行推导，发现其C、N和O的值与[Fe/H] = −0.14的场巨星典型。该系统没有很大的脉冲速度。并呈现了该系统演化为双中子星-白矮星的模型。该X射线特性在这一模型的背景下进行了讨论。这种双星是一个罕见的例子，具有明亮的、长轨道周期的LMXB系统，在暂态椭圆阶段的早期。 <div>
A single-lined spectroscopic orbit for the M giant in the X-ray binary IGR J16194−2810 is determined from a time series of optical spectra. The spectroscopic orbital period of 192.5 days is twice that of the photometric period, confirming that the M giant in the system is an ellipsoidal variable. The giant is identified as a first ascent giant approaching the red giant tip. The primary is a neutron star (NS) with its M giant companion filling its Roche lobe, verifying the system classification as a low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB). Stellar C, N, O, and Fe abundances are derived for the M giant with the C, N, and O values typical for a field giant with [Fe/H] = −0.14. The system does not have a large kick velocity. Models for the evolution of the system into a binary NS–white dwarf are presented. The X-ray properties are discussed in the context of this model. This binary is a rare example of a luminous, long orbital period LMXB early in the transient ellipsoidal phase.

对186个经光谱确认的II型超新星（SN）光谱曲线（LCs）进行了分析，使用ZTF和ASTR发现的观察结果。采用水动力模型推断了这些LCs的物理参数，考虑了前体星的质量、爆炸能量和周围星际物质（CSM）的存在。CSM通过质量损失率、β速率定律在前体星表面的风加速以及CSM半径来建模。还推断了每颗SN的爆炸时间、衰减（AV）和红移。结果显示有利于低质量的前体星（MZAMS < 14 M⊙），具有密集的CSM（ > 10−3M⊙ yr−1，CSM半径约为1015厘米，β > 2）。此外，发现从SN LCs推断的红移比使用宿主星系光度红移推断的要准确得多，这表明在LSST时代可以使用这种方法从大型II型SNe样本中推断出更准确的宿主星系红移。最后，将结果与文献中的类似工作进行了比较。<br /><br />总结: 对186个光谱确认的II型超新星进行了分析，结果表明有利于低质量的前体星，具有密集的CSM。此外，还发现从SN LCs推断的红移比使用宿主星系光度红移推断的要准确得多，可用于LSST时代推断更准确的宿主星系红移。最后将结果与文献中的类似工作进行了比较。 <div>
We report an analysis of a sample of 186 spectroscopically confirmed Type II supernova (SN) light curves (LCs) obtained from a combination of Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System observations. We implement a method to infer physical parameters from these LCs using hydrodynamic models that take into account the progenitor mass, the explosion energy, and the presence of circumstellar matter (CSM). The CSM is modeled via the mass-loss rate, wind acceleration at the surface of the progenitor star with a β velocity law, and the CSM radius. We also infer the time of explosion, attenuation (AV), and the redshift for each SN. Our results favor low-mass progenitor stars (MZAMS < 14 M⊙) with a dense CSM ( > 10−3M⊙ yr−1, CSM radius ∼ 1015 cm, and β > 2). Additionally, we find that the redshifts inferred from the SN LCs are significantly more accurate than those inferred using the host galaxy photometric redshift, suggesting that this method could be used to infer more accurate host galaxy redshifts from large samples of Type II SNe in the LSST era. Lastly, we compare our results with similar works from the literature.

这项研究使用相对论性Brueckner-Hartree-Fock形式主义，研究了零温和高达70 MeV的有对称性和非对称性核物质的性质。我们使用三个Bonn势（A、B和C）来研究非对称核物质的性质，这些势考虑了介子质量、偶合强度、截断参数和形式因子。计算出的非对称核物质的性质为构建了适用于中子星的方程态（EOS）模型奠定了基础。这些模型使得能够计算非转动、均匀转动和差异转动的中子星的总体特性。值得注意的是，本文研究的EOS模型足够灵活，可以适应有史以来发现的质量最大的中子星PSR J0952–0607，其质量估计为2.35 ± 0.17 M⊙。此外，它们还给出了PSR J0030+451的质量和半径，与这颗脉冲星建立的置信区间相吻合。<br /><br />总结: 本研究使用相对论性Brueckner-Hartree-Fock形式主义研究了对称和非对称核物质的性质，为构建适用于中子星的方程态模型奠定了基础。这些模型还能够计算中子星的总体特性，并且足够灵活，适应已发现的质量最大的中子星，同时也与其他脉冲星的特性相吻合。 <div>
This study investigates the properties of symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter using the relativistic Brueckner–Hartree–Fock formalism, examining both zero and finite temperatures up to 70 MeV. Employing the full Dirac space, we incorporate three Bonn potentials (A, B, and C), which account for meson masses, coupling strengths, cutoff parameters, and form factors. The calculated properties of asymmetric nuclear matter form the basis for constructing equation-of-state (EOS) models tailored for neutron stars. These models, in turn, enable the computation of bulk properties for nonrotating, uniformly rotating, and differentially rotating neutron stars. Notably, the EOS models studied in this paper are sufficiently versatile to accommodate the mass of the most massive neutron star ever detected, PSR J0952–0607, estimated to be 2.35 ± 0.17 M⊙. Furthermore, they yield masses and radii for PSR J0030+451 that align with the confidence intervals established for this pulsar.

在Atacama大毫米/亚毫米阵列进行了对10个高红移（2.2 ≤ z ≤ 2.7）超巨磁暴星系核的连续观测，并通过堆叠分析限制了热离子化的环星系气体的存在。测量出一个Compton-y参数剖面，在大约50千秒差距的半径处峰值为(1.7±1.1) x 10^-6。将堆叠观测结果与活动星系核反馈风模型和广义Navarro-Frenk-White压力剖面模型进行比较，限制了堆叠的超巨磁暴星系核的晕质量和反馈风功率。观测结果限制了观测平均晕质量为M500 < 1×10^13M⊙，平均反馈风功率<1×10^12L⊙，这是超巨磁暴星系核辐射总亮度的<1%。

We present continuum observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array of 10 high-redshift (2.2 ≤ z ≤ 2.7) ultraluminous quasars (QSOs) and constrain the presence of hot, ionized, circumgalactic gas in a stacking analysis. We measure a Compton-y parameter profile with a peak value of (1.7 ± 1.1) × 10−6 at a radius of ∼50 kpc. We compare our stacked observations to active galactic nucleus feedback wind models and generalized Navarro–Frenk–White pressure profile models to constrain the wind luminosity and halo mass of the stacked QSOs. Our observations constrain the observed average halo mass to M500 < 1 × 1013M⊙ and the average feedback wind power <1 × 1012L⊙, which is <1% of the bolometric luminosity of the quasar.

<div> 关键词: 星流, 银河系, 磁盘倾斜, 数值实验, 暗物质<br />
总结: <br />
本研究通过数值实验发现，银河系磁盘的倾斜会对星流的形态和运动学产生影响。倾斜率为15° Gyr−1时，对Pal 5的潮尾模型与观测结果吻合良好，可解释潮尾的明显变窄现象。另外，未考虑倾斜磁盘可能会导致对银河系局部暗物质分布形状参数的约束出现5%–10%的偏差，不同星流的偏差方向也不同。磁盘倾斜可能解释不同星流推断银河系暗物质晕形状时出现的不一致现象。 <div>
Stellar streams are sensitive tracers of the gravitational potential, which is typically assumed to be static in the inner Galaxy. However, massive mergers like Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus can impart torques on the stellar disk of the Milky Way that result in the disk tilting at rates of up to 10°–20° Gyr−1. Here, we demonstrate the effects of disk tilting on the morphology and kinematics of stellar streams. Through a series of numerical experiments, we find that streams with nearby apocenters (rapo ≲ 20 kpc) are sensitive to disk tilting, with the primary effect being changes to the stream’s on-sky track and width. Interestingly, disk tilting can produce both more diffuse streams and more narrow streams, depending on the orbital inclination of the progenitor and the direction in which the disk is tilting. Our model of Pal 5's tidal tails for a tilting rate of 15° Gyr−1 is in excellent agreement with the observed stream’s track and width, and reproduces the extreme narrowing of the trailing tail. We also find that failure to account for a tilting disk can bias constraints on shape parameters of the Milky Way’s local dark matter distribution at the level of 5%–10%, with the direction of the bias changing for different streams. Disk tilting could therefore explain discrepancies in the Milky Way’s dark matter halo shape inferred using different streams.

The luminosities (L) and velocity dispersions (σ) of the extinction-corrected Balmer emission lines of giant H ii regions in nearby galaxies exhibit a tight correlation (∼0.35 dex scatter). There are few constraints, however, on whether giant H ii regions at significant look-back times follow an L–σ relation, given the angular resolution and sensitivity required to study them individually. We measure the luminosities and velocity dispersions of Hα and Hβ emission from 11 H ii regions in Sp1149, a spiral galaxy at redshift (z) z = 1.49 multiply imaged by the MACS J1149 galaxy cluster. Sp1149 is also the host galaxy of the first-known strongly lensed supernova with resolved images, SN Refsdal. We employ archival Keck I OSIRIS observations, and newly acquired Keck I MOSFIRE and Large Binocular Telescope LUCI long-slit spectra of Sp1149. When we use the GLAFIC simply parameterized lens model, we find that the Hα luminosities of the H ii regions at z = 1.49 are a factor of brighter than predicted by the low-redshift L–σ relation we measure from Very Large Telescope MUSE spectroscopy. If the lens model is accurate, then the H ii regions in Sp1149 differ from their low-redshift counterparts. We identify an H ii region in Sp1149 that is dramatically brighter (by 2.03 ± 0.44 dex) than our low-redshift L–σ relation predicts given its low velocity dispersion. Finally, the H ii regions in Sp1149 are consistent, perhaps surprisingly, with the z ≈ 0 star-forming locus on the Baldwin–Phillips–Terlevich diagram.

We present the first systematic X-ray pulse timing analysis of the six members of the so-called “Magnificent Seven” nearby thermally emitting isolated neutron stars (XINS) with detected pulsations. Using the extensive collection of archival XMM-Newton, Chandra, and NICER observations spanning over two decades, we obtain the first firm measurement of the spin-down rate for RX J2143.0+0654, while for the rest we improve upon previously published spin ephemerides and extend them by up to an additional decade. Five of the XINS follow steady spin-down with no indication of major anomalies in their long-term timing behavior; the notable exception is RX J0720.4−3125, for which, in addition to confirming the previously identified glitch, we detect a second spin derivative. The high-quality folded X-ray pulse profiles produced with the updated timing solutions exhibit diverse and complex morphologies, as well as striking energy dependence. These peculiarities cannot be readily explained by blackbody-like isotropic emission and simple hot-spot configurations, hinting at the presence of complex multitemperature surface heat distributions and highly anisotropic radiation patterns, such as may arise from a strongly magnetized atmospheric layer.

总结:
通过在PETRA III 同步辐射装置的P04光束线上使用电子束离子阱对Fe xvii离子进行共振激发，我们将强软X射线跃迁的能量精度提高了4-20倍。结合高分辨率光电子能谱仪，我们同时跟踪瞬时光子能量波动，将系统不确定性最小化至10-15毫电子伏特，相当于速度误差±∼5 km s−1，大大提高了我们对这一关键天体物理离子的认识。我们的大规模相互作用计算包括400万多个相对论构型，并且与实验结果达到了前所未有的一致性，使得电子间相互关联的理论误差远远小于量子电动力学（QED）修正。这一QED基准测试增强了我们对未来对其他复杂原子离子的天体物理、等离子体物理和高电荷离子光钟的计算的信任。 <br /><br /> <div>
We improve by a factor of 4–20 the energy accuracy of the strongest soft X-ray transitions of Fe xvii ions by resonantly exciting them in an electron beam ion trap with a monochromatic beam at the P04 beamline of the PETRA III synchrotron facility. By simultaneously tracking instantaneous photon-energy fluctuations with a high-resolution photoelectron spectrometer, we minimize systematic uncertainties down to 10–15 meV, or velocity equivalent ±∼5 km s−1 in their rest energies, substantially improving our knowledge of this key astrophysical ion. Our large-scale configuration-interaction computations include more than 4 million relativistic configurations and agree with the experiment at a level without precedent for a 10-electron system. Thereby, theoretical uncertainties for interelectronic correlations become far smaller than those of quantum electrodynamics (QED) corrections. The present QED benchmark strengthens our trust in future calculations of many other complex atomic ions of interest to astrophysics, plasma physics, and the development of optical clocks with highly charged ions.

Numerical simulations of test particle transport in the presence of synthetic turbulence with known properties still provide the most reliable estimations of the diffusion coefficients of charged particles in turbulent space plasmas available. The development and implementation of such simulations, however, are far from straightforward. The present study provides a comprehensive treatment of the development and testing of such a simulation code, detailing the simulation of synthetic turbulence and diffusion coefficients, as well as various numerical tests to validate code output. Furthermore, a novel test for such codes is proposed, namely, the transport of charged particles in pure slab turbulence, which proves sensitive to numerical factors prior tests remain insensitive to.

本研究研究了四次日冕物质抛射（CMEs）的形成，这些CMEs源自同源喷射。所有的喷射都来自2012年7月2日的NOAA活跃区（AR）11515，在约14小时内发生。所有的CME都是宽阔的（角宽度约为95°至150°），并且在LASCO日冕仪图像中以约300至500 km/s的速度传播。在Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly图像的各种EUV波长观察中发现，在所有情况下，喷射的源区位于AR 11515的前部边界，该区域在每次事件发生前都有一小团丝状物。基于非线性自由力磁场外推的日冕磁场建模表明，在每种情况下，丝状物都被包含在一个由上面的紧凑环所约束的磁通绳内。丝状物的南方支点都扎根于喷发起始发生的负极区。这个负极区经历持续的磁通变化，包括在磁通绳附近相反极性的涌现和取消，EUV图像显示在每次喷发前丝状物的东南支点附近出现明亮现象。因此，这些磁通的变化很可能是随后喷发的原因。这四次同源喷发都源自AR的正极部分连接到两个遥远的负极区的两个大规模环系统的相邻支点，对太阳日冕产生了大规模影响。<br /><br />总结: 本研究研究了四次同源喷发的形成，它们都源自同一活跃区，喷发的速度和角宽度在特定范围内。通过对磁场建模和EUV图像的观察，发现了喷发前的磁通变化和明亮现象。这四次同源喷发都源自两个大规模环系统的相邻支点，并对太阳日冕产生了大规模影响。 <div>
We study the formation of four coronal mass ejections (CMEs) originating from homologous blowout jets. All of the blowout jets originated from NOAA Active Region (AR) 11515 on 2012 July 2, within a time interval of ≈14 hr. All of the CMEs were wide (angular widths ≈ 95°–150°), and propagated with speeds ranging between ≈300 and 500 km s−1 in LASCO coronagraph images. Observations at various EUV wavelengths in Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly images reveal that in all the cases, the source region of the jets lies at the boundary of the leading part of AR 11515 that hosts a small filament before each event. Coronal magnetic field modeling based on nonlinear force-free extrapolations indicates that in each case, the filament is contained inside of a magnetic flux rope that remains constrained by overlying compact loops. The southern footpoint of each filament is rooted in the negative polarity region where the eruption onsets occur. This negative polarity region undergoes continuous flux changes, including emergence and cancellation with opposite polarity in the vicinity of the flux rope, and the EUV images reveal brightening episodes near the filament’s southeastern footpoint before each eruption. Therefore, these flux changes are likely the cause of the subsequent eruptions. These four homologous eruptions originate near adjacent feet of two large-scale loop systems connecting from that positive polarity part of the AR to two remote negative polarity regions, and result in large-scale consequences in the solar corona.

Magnetic reconnection is an important physical process of energy conversion in the heliosphere. Parker Solar Probe (PSP) passes through current sheets of the inner heliosphere and is likely to encounter magnetic reconnection events there. PSP traversed a magnetic reconnection exhaust region that occurred in the coronal streamer during its perihelion Encounter 8. We report an observation of the counterstream of strahl electrons and compressible waves in the exhaust region on the antisunward side of the reconnection site. We analyze the wave characteristics using electromagnetic singular value decomposition techniques and find that the propagation direction of the compressible waves is quasi-perpendicular to the local magnetic field. Combining with the topology of the magnetic field, we infer that the compressible waves converge from the edge to the center of the exhaust region, and then propagate away from it. Further, we select 12 magnetic reconnection events during Encounter 5–8 for statistics and find that the oblique compressible waves are commonly detected throughout the inner heliospheric current sheet. In addition, we discuss the possible nature of wave branches for these compressible waves. Our work shows that magnetic reconnection in the heliosphere not only changes the topology of the large-scale magnetic field in the heliosphere, but also affects the transport characteristics of solar wind plasma and suprathermal particles, and regulates the states of waves and turbulence in the heliosphere.

<br /><br />总结:
本文是对微暗体对Lyα森林的影响进行了系统研究的首次尝试。通过进行1D辐射-流体力学模拟，首次得出了受紫外光蚀的微暗体的H i柱密度剖面。研究结果表明，在期望的离子化背景辐射下，微暗体对吸收体存在显著影响，会增加阻尼Lyα吸收体的发生率，并平均使Lyα流量减少约3%。此外，在解释z≳5.5的Lyα森林时，还需要考虑微暗体吸收的影响。通过对这些量的灵敏度进行研究，还可以对离子化背景辐射的强度进行限制。 <div>
Dense gas in minihalos with masses of 106−108M⊙ can shield themselves from reionization for ∼100 Myr after being exposed to the UV background. These self-shielded systems, often unresolved in cosmological simulations, can introduce strong absorption in quasar spectra. This paper is the first systematic study on the impact of these systems on the Lyα forest. We first derive the H i column density profile of photoevaporating minihalos by conducting 1D radiation–hydrodynamics simulations. We utilize these results to estimate the Lyα opacity from minihalos in a large-scale simulation that cannot resolve self-shielding. When the ionization rate of the background radiation is 0.03 × 10−12 s−1, as expected near the end of reionization at z ∼ 5.5, we find that the incidence rate of damped Lyα absorbers increases by a factor of ∼2−4 compared to at z = 4.5. The Lyα flux is, on average, suppressed by ∼3% of its mean due to minihalos. The absorption features enhance the 1D power spectrum up to ∼5% at k ∼ 0.1 h Mpc−1 (or 10−3 km−1 s), which is comparable to the enhancement caused by inhomogeneous reionization. The flux is particularly suppressed in the vicinity of large halos along the line-of-sight direction at separations of up to 10 h−1 Mpc at r⊥ ≲ 2 h−1 Mpc. However, these effects become much smaller for higher ionizing rates (≳0.3 × 10−12 s−1) expected in the post-reionization Universe. Our findings highlight the need to consider minihalo absorption when interpreting the Lyα forest at z ≳ 5.5. Moreover, the sensitivity of these quantities to the ionizing background intensity can be exploited to constrain the intensity itself.

<div> Swift GRBs, spectral lag, Lorentz invariance violation, energy bands, quantum-gravitational energy scale

总结: 本文研究了伽马射线爆发中光子的能量到达时间差异，发现多能量波段的光变曲线可以用于限制洛伦兹不变性的破坏程度。通过对90个具有红移信息的Swift GRB进行分析，得出了洛伦兹不变性破坏的上限，相当于量子引力能标的下限为EQG ≥ 2.2 × 1014GeV。这表明在高能天体物理现象中可能存在量子引力效应。 <div>
The arrival times of photons with different energy could be different, even when they are emitted from the same source simultaneously. Such a spectral lag is a common property among high-energy astrophysics phenomena like gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The potential violation of the Lorentz invariance caused by quantum fluctuations in background spacetime metrics could cause the spectral lag. In this paper, we try to make a constraint on Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) with multiple energy bands light curves of GRBs. With a sample of 90 Swift GRBs with redshifts, we calculate their spectral offsets from four fixed energy bands within their source frame. With help from the cross-correlation function and kernel smooth procedure, we extract improved spectral shifts. By using these more general spectral lags, we obtain an upper limit on LIV, equivalent to a lower limit on the quantum-gravitational energy scale of EQG ≥ 2.2 × 1014GeV.

<title>Low-frequency Absorption and Radio Recombination Line Features of the Galactic Center Lobe</title>

The Galactic center lobe (GCL) is a ∼1° object located north of the Galactic center. In the mid-infrared, the GCL appears as two 8.0 μm filaments that roughly define an ellipse. There is strong 24 μm and radio continuum emission in the interior of the ellipse. Due to its morphology and location in the sky, previous authors have argued that the GCL is created by outflows from star formation in the central molecular zone or by activity of the central black hole Sgr A*. We present images of the GCL from the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky Murchison Widefield Array survey in radio continuum that show thermal absorption against the Galactic center, incompatible with an interpretation of synchrotron self-absorption. Estimates of the cosmic-ray emissivity in this direction allow us to place a distance constraint on the GCL. To be consistent with standard emissivity assumptions, the GCL would be located 2 kpc away. At a distance of 8 kpc, the synchrotron background emissivity is enhanced by ∼75% in the direction of the GCL. We also present radio recombination line data from the Green Bank Telescope that constrain the electron temperature and line widths in this region, which are also more explicable if the GCL lies relatively close.

The Galactic center lobe (GCL) is an object ∼1° across that is located north of the Galactic center. In the mid-infrared (MIR) the GCL appears as two 8.0 μm filaments between which there is strong 24 μm and radio continuum emission. Due to its morphology and location in the sky, previous authors have argued that the GCL is located in the Galactic center region, created by outflows from star formation or by activity of the central black hole Sagittarius A*. In an associated paper, low-frequency radio emission indicates that the GCL must instead lie foreground to the Galactic center. If the GCL is foreground to the Galactic center, it is likely to be a type of object common throughout the Galactic disk; we here investigate whether its properties are similar to those of Galactic H ii regions. We find that the GCL’s MIR morphology, MIR flux densities, dust temperatures, and radio recombination line properties as traced by the Green Bank Telescope Diffuse Ionized Gas Survey are consistent with those of known Galactic H ii regions, although the derived electron temperature is low. We search for the ionizing source(s) of the possible H ii region and identify a stellar cluster candidate (Camargo #1092/Ryu & Lee #532) and a cluster of young stellar objects (the SPICY cluster G359.3+0.3) whose members have Gaia parallaxes distances of 1.7 ± 0.4 kpc. Taken together, the results of our companion paper and those shown here suggest that the GCL has properties consistent with those of an H ii region located ∼2 kpc from the Sun.

<title>Statistical Study of the Sub-ion-scale Magnetic Holes in the Lunar Space Environment</title>

Sub-ion-scale magnetic holes play a significant role in electron transportation and energy dissipation. In the upstream region of the terrestrial bow shock, they are expected to originate from the upstream solar wind as well as the foreshock. The Moon can move into the solar wind; whether it can affect the observation of the sub-ion-scale magnetic holes is unclear. Here, we statistically investigate 268 sub-ion-scale magnetic holes in the lunar space environment based on observations of the Acceleration, Reconnection, Turbulence and Electrodynamics of the Moon’s Interaction with the Sun mission. The median duration of these magnetic holes is ∼0.31 s, and the median size of their cross sections is ∼0.5 ρi or ∼38.9 ρe. We regard an isolated or a train of magnetic holes as an event; thus, these magnetic holes belong to 207 events. The data at XSSE < 0 and |YSSE| < 2 RM (lunar radii) account for ∼21.7% of all observed data, but ∼89.4% of the events are observed in this region, suggesting that they are more likely to occur in the lunar wake. Furthermore, their occurrence rates in the lunar wake are much larger in the region close to its boundary than in other wake regions. And the occurrence rates in the lunar wake near the boundary at XSSE > −3 RM are larger in the dawnside than that in the duskside. These observations suggest that the region in the lunar wake close to its boundary is a possible source of sub-ion-scale magnetic holes.

本研究调查了[C/O]elem比率对碳同位素分馏的影响，发现当[C/O]elem比率超过1时，由于同位素交换反应，12CO/13CO比率可能低于元素碳同位素比率。TW Hya周围观测到的12CO/13CO和H12CN/H13CN比率可以在[C/O]elem比率为2-5时得到复制。在暖分子层的下边界附近，冰的形成导致气相[C/O]elem比率接近于1，从而减少了不同[C/O]elem比率下12CO/13CO比率的变化。总结: 本研究发现在TW Hya周围的盘中存在碳同位素分馏现象，其机制可以通过[C/O]elem比率为2-5时同位素选择性光解离和同位素交换反应来解释。 <div>
Carbon isotope fractionation of CO has been reported in the disk around TW Hya, where elemental carbon is more abundant than elemental oxygen ([C/O]elem > 1). We investigated the effects of the [C/O]elem ratio on carbon fractionation using astrochemical models that incorporate isotope-selective photodissociation and isotope exchange reactions. The 12CO/13CO ratio could be lower than the elemental carbon isotope ratio due to isotope exchange reactions when the [C/O]elem ratio exceeds unity. The observed 12CO/13CO and H12CN/H13CN ratios around TW Hya could be reproduced when the [C/O]elem ratio is 2–5. In the vicinity of the lower boundary of the warm molecular layer, the formation of ices leads to the gas-phase [C/O]elem ratio approaching unity, irrespective of the total (gas + ice) [C/O]elem ratio. This phenomenon reduces the variation in the 12CO/13CO ratio across different [C/O]elem ratios.

该研究利用 189 个存档 NuSTAR 观测数据，对来自24个源的X射线双星系统的黑洞自旋进行了分析。研究发现以前关于少数源自旋值低的报告通常是错误的，事实上这些源往往携带自旋值较高的黑洞。在 1σ 误差范围内，大约 86% 的样本的自旋值 ≥ 0.95，约 94% 的样本的自旋值 ≥ 0.9，而所有样本的自旋值均 ≥ 0.7。研究还发现高质量X射线双星系统与低质量X射线双星系统一致地显示出自旋值 ≥ 0.9，这与引力波事件中发现的黑洞的自旋值一致。研究还发现，在一些情况下，同一源的不同光谱产生相似的自旋测量结果，但关于内部盘倾斜度的值相互矛盾；作者提出这可能是由于变化的盘风遮挡了相对论性铁K发射线的蓝翼。作者讨论了测量结果的影响、他们的独特观点和未来利用新任务对黑洞自旋进行表征的努力。

We extend our recent work on black hole spin in X-ray binary systems to include an analysis of 189 archival NuSTAR observations from 24 sources. Using self-consistent data reduction pipelines, spectral models, and statistical techniques, we report an unprecedented and uniform sample of 36 stellar-mass black hole spin measurements based on relativistic reflection. This treatment suggests that prior reports of low spins in a small number of sources were generally erroneous: our comprehensive treatment finds that those sources tend to harbor black holes with high spin values. Overall, within 1σ uncertainty, ∼86% of the sample are consistent with a ≥ 0.95, ∼94% of the sample are consistent with a ≥ 0.9, and 100% are consistent with a ≥ 0.7 (the theoretical maximum for neutron stars; a = cJ/GM2). We also find that the high-mass X-ray binaries (those with A-, B-, or O-type companions) are consistent with a ≥ 0.9 within the 1σ errors; this is in agreement with the low-mass X-ray binary population and may be especially important for comparisons to black holes discovered in gravitational wave events. In some cases, different spectra from the same source yield similar spin measurements but conflicting values for the inclination of the inner disk; we suggest that this is due to variable disk winds obscuring the blue wing of the relativistic Fe K emission line. We discuss the implications of our measurements, the unique view of systematic uncertainties enabled by our treatment, and future efforts to characterize black hole spins with new missions.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了一个包含亚毫米星系和两个背景QSO的系统，观测结果显示在该系统中存在一个延伸约180千秒差距的Lyα星云，该星云可能对应于穿过热暗物质晕的冷气流。文章还比较了两种不同环境中的Lyα星云，发现围绕QSOs的星云比围绕亚毫米星系的星云更亮，并展示出更陡的表面亮度分布。文章指出，尽管在亚毫米星系周围探测Lyα星云存在困难，但通过比较研究高红移星云的重要见解可获得重要见解。 <div>
The GAMA J0913−0107 system is a rare conjunction of a submillimeter galaxy (SMG) at z ≈ 2.7 and two background QSOs with projected separations <200 kpc. Previous high-resolution QSO absorption-line spectroscopy has revealed high H i column density, extremely metal-poor (∼1% solar) gas streams in the circumgalactic medium of the SMG. Here we present deep optical integral-field spectroscopy of the system with the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI). Reaching a 2σ surface brightness limit ≈10−19 erg s−1 cm−2 arcsec−2 with ∼2 hr of integration time, we detect a filamentary Lyα nebula stretching ∼180 kpc from the SMG intercepting both QSO sightlines. This Lyα filament may correspond to the same cool gas stream penetrating through the hot halo seen in the absorption. In contrast to Lyα nebulae around QSOs, there is no obvious local source for photoionization due to the massive dust content. While uncertain, we consider the possibility that the nebula is ionized by shocks induced by the infall, obscured star formation, and/or a boosted UV background. The SMG–QSOs conjunction multiplied the efficiency of the KCWI observations, allowing a direct comparison of Lyα nebulae in two distinct environments. We find that the nebulae around the QSOs are much brighter and show steeper surface brightness profiles than the SMG nebula. This is consistent with the additional photoionization and Lyα scattering provided by the QSOs. While illustrating the challenges of detecting Lyα nebulae around SMGs, our work also demonstrates that important insights can be gained from comparative studies of high-z Lyα nebulae.

SGR 1935+2154是过去十年中最活跃的磁星，自2019年以来每年至少有一个活跃期。文章报道了2022年1月的活动，并呈现出观测到的112个X射线爆发的时间和时间积分光谱特性。这次活动持续约45天，爆发特性在活动期间没有显著的演变。文章指出，自2016年以来爆发的平均持续时间较短，光谱也逐渐变软，同时爆发通量和黑体发射半径逐渐增加。研究还发现，软成分开始变得更陡峭，而硬成分的趋势较为平缓。至今为止，观测到的爆发特性中没有显示出类似于2020年快速射电爆发FRB 200428的硬、长X射线对应物的特性。文章对这些结果进行了与源自2014年发现以来的8年历史的比较讨论。 <div>
The X-ray and radio burst-emitting soft gamma-ray repeater SGR 1935+2154 has been the most active magnetar during the past decade, with at least one active episode each year since 2019. We report on the 2022 January activity as observed by the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor and present the temporal and time-integrated spectral properties of the observed 112 X-ray bursts. No radio bursts were reported during the activity. The mean burst duration is comparable to most of the previous activities but is shorter than that of 2020, during which the magnetar emitted radio bursts. The mean burst spectrum is softer than the earlier activities and a long-term softening trend since 2016 is evident and is accompanied by a rise in the mean burst fluence and blackbody emission radii. The power-law indices of the correlation also show an evolution during 2019–2022, where the soft component started becoming steeper, whereas the hard component shows a less steep trend. The burst properties show no significant evolution within the activity, which lasted for ∼ 45 days, and none of the observed bursts showed properties reminiscent of those of the hard, long X-ray counterpart to the 2020 fast radio burst FRB 200428 from the source. We discuss the results comparatively with the 8 yr history of the source since its discovery in 2014.

总结:
本研究探讨了活动星系核盘的外部、中部和内部区域中的吸积修饰星体(AMS)的特征，考虑了这些AMS在向内移动时的生长过程。我们计算了它们的多波段辐射能谱(SED)和热光曲线。结果显示，在中部区域发生的邦迪爆炸的热辐射可以导致UV耀斑，其光度约为10^44 erg/s。中部和内部区域邦迪爆炸的辐射峰值分别出现在X射线波段，光度约为10^43和10^42 erg/s。反康普顿辐射的γ射线光度范围从10^42–10^43 erg/s，在外部区域峰值约为10 MeV，在中部和内部区域峰值约为GeV。中部区域中AMS的可观测耀斑表现为缓慢上升和快速的高斯衰减，持续数月；而内部区域中表现为快速上升和缓慢的高斯衰减，持续数小时。这些不同的SED和光曲线特征为我们提供了有关活动星系核相关的各种天文短暂时间尺度的宝贵见解。 <div>
Stars and compact objects embedded in accretion disks of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), dubbed accretion-modified stars (AMSs), often experience hyper-Eddington accretion in the dense gas environment, resulting in powerful outflows as the Bondi explosion and formation of cavities. The varying gas properties across different regions of the AGN disk can give rise to diverse and intriguing phenomena. In this paper, we conduct a study on the characteristics of AMSs situated in the outer, middle, and inner regions of the AGN disk, where the growth of the AMSs during the shift inward is considered. We calculate their multiwavelength spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and thermal light curves. Our results reveal that the thermal luminosity of the Bondi explosion occurring in the middle region leads to UV flares with a luminosity of ∼1044 erg s−1. The synchrotron radiation of Bondi explosion in the middle and inner regions peaks at the X-ray band with luminosities of ∼1043 and ∼1042 erg s−1, respectively. The γ-ray luminosity of inverse Compton radiation spans from 1042–1043 erg s−1 peaked at the ∼10 MeV (outer region) and ∼GeV (middle and inner regions) bands. The observable flares of AMS in the middle region exhibit a slow rise and rapid Gaussian decay with a duration of months, while in the inner region, it exhibits a fast rise and slow Gaussian decay with a duration of several hours. These various SED and light-curve features provide valuable insights into the various astronomical transient timescales associated with AGNs.

It is believed that dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) form during galaxy mergers. Studying dual-AGN emission can provide valuable insights into galaxy merging and evolution. To investigate parsec-scale radio emission properties, we observed eight radio components of four selected dual-AGN systems using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) at 5 GHz in multiple-phase-center mode. Among them, two compact radio components, labeled J0051+0020B and J2300-0005A, were detected clearly on parsec scales for the first time. However, the radio emission of the other six components was resolved out in the high-resolution images. We provide the values or upper limits of the brightness temperature and radio emission power, and analyze the emission origins in detail for each target. Based on their physical properties reported in this work and in the literature, we suggest that the radio emission in J0051+0020B and J2300-0005A originates primarily from compact jets, while the other six sources show more complex emission mechanisms. In addition, our VLBA observations suggest that the systematic X-ray deficit in our dual-AGN sample is likely attributed to the tidally induced effect and possibly a viewing angle effect.

V2487 Ophiuchi (V2487 Oph) is a recurrent nova with classical nova eruptions in 1900 and 1998, and it is also the most extreme known superflare star. These superflares are roughly hour-long flares with amplitudes and optical energies reaching up to 1.10 mag and 1039.21 erg, respectively, with the superflares recurring once a day. The V2487 Oph superflares are certainly operating with the same mechanism as all the other types of superflare stars, where magnetic loops are twisted and stretched until reconnection occurs, whereupon ambient electrons are accelerated to relativistic energies and then emit bremsstrahlung radiation from X-ray to radio. V2487 Oph is unique among known superflare stars in that one of the loop footprints is in an accretion disk. This exact mechanism was theoretically predicted by M. R. Hayashi and colleagues in 1996. Now, I have found two superflares recorded on Harvard archival photographs from 1941 and 1942. These two superflares have B-magnitude amplitudes of >1.83 and >2.00 mag and total radiated energies of 1042.4 and 1042.5 erg, respectively, with bolometric corrections. Each has emitted energies of ∼30 billion Carringtons, in units of the most energetic solar flare. Further, I find superflares in Zwicky Transient Factory light curves, so V2487 Oph has been superflaring from 1941 to 2023. For the observed number distribution of dN/dE = 4E−2 superflares per year, for E in units of 1041 erg, the emitted energy in superflare light is 1042.1 erg in each year, or 1044.1 erg from 1941 to 2023.

<br />
C4H和c-C3H2是重要的不饱和碳氢化合物，它们在银河系的冷分子核中形成大型有机分子起着重要作用。通过IRAM 30m望远镜对19个邻近的冷分子核进行了C4H（N=9-8）线、c-C3H2（JKa,Kb=21,2-10,1）和H13CO+（J=1-0）的映射观测。在13个源中检测到了C4H 9-8，而在18个源中检测到了c-C3H2。在冷分子核中普遍存在的C4H和c-C3H2分子提供了形成大型有机分子的物质。发现了C4H 9-8和c-C3H2 2-1之间不同的空间分布。在假定局部热力学平衡条件下使用固定激发温度得到了这三种分子的相对丰度。C4H与c-C3H2的丰度比在不同源中的范围从0.34±0.09到G032.93+02到4.65±0.50的G008.67+22。发现了C4H/H13CO+和c-C3H2/H13CO+丰度比之间的微弱相关性，相关系数为0.46，这表明C4H和c-C3H2分子之间没有紧密的天体化学联系。 <br /><br />总结: C4H和c-C3H2在冷分子核中普遍存在，为大型有机分子的形成提供了物质。它们的空间分布不同，丰度比在不同源中有所变化，丰度比之间存在微弱相关性，但并没有紧密的天体化学联系。 <div>
C4H and c-C3H2, as unsaturated hydrocarbon molecules, are important for forming large organic molecules in the interstellar medium. We present mapping observations of C4H (N = 9−8) lines, c-C3H2 (JKa,Kb = 21,2–10,1), and H13CO+ (J = 1−0) toward 19 nearby cold molecular cores in the Milky Way with the IRAM 30 m telescope. C4H 9–8 was detected in 13 sources, while c-C3H2 was detected in 18 sources. The widely existing C4H and c-C3H2 molecules in cold cores provide material to form large organic molecules. Different spatial distributions between C4H 9–8 and c-C3H2 2–1 were found. The relative abundances of these three molecules were obtained under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium conditions with a fixed excitation temperature. The abundance ratio of C4H to c-C3H2 ranged from 0.34 ± 0.09 in G032.93+02 to 4.65 ± 0.50 in G008.67+22. A weak correlation between C4H/H13CO+ and c-C3H2/H13CO+ abundance ratios was found, with a correlation coefficient of 0.46, which indicates that there is no tight astrochemical connection between C4H and c-C3H2 molecules.

<div> 关键词: SN 2017dio, 爆发物质特性, CSM, 质量损失历史, 化学组成

总结:
SN 2017dio 是一颗具有非典型光曲线和氢丰富CSM特征的Ic-BL超新星。研究发现它的温度自爆炸后20天开始呈线性增加。利用56Ni加上喷射物-CSM相互作用模型拟合其光曲线，发现喷射物、56Ni和CSM的质量分别约为12.41 M⊙、0.17 M⊙和5.82 M⊙。早期光球速度和超新星的动能与SNe Ic-BL和超新星相当。研究推测SN 2017dio的CSM可能来自于超巨星类似的喷发或脉动对不稳定性，或者是超新星爆发前1.2-11.4年的双星质量损失。此外，发现其喷发质量大于许多SNe Ic-BL，但其56Ni质量与文献中SNe Ic-BL的平均值相近，低于超新星的典型HNe（如SN 1998bw和SN 2003dh）。 <div>
We study the energy sources, the physical properties of the ejecta and the circumstellar medium (CSM), and the mass-loss history of the progenitor of SN 2017dio, which is a broad-lined Ic (Ic-BL) supernova (SN) having unusual light curves (LCs) and signatures of hydrogen-rich CSM in its early spectrum. We find that the temperature of SN 2017dio began to increase linearly about 20 days after the explosion. We use the 56Ni plus the ejecta–CSM interaction model to fit the LCs of SN 2017dio, finding that the masses of the ejecta, the 56Ni, and the CSM are ∼12.41 M⊙, ∼0.17 M⊙, and ∼5.82 M⊙, respectively. The early-time photosphere velocity and the kinetic energy of the SN are, respectively, ∼1.89 × 104 km s−1 and ∼2.66 × 1052 erg, which are comparable to those of SNe Ic-BL and hypernovae (HNe), respectively. We suggest that the CSM of SN 2017dio might be from a luminous blue variable–like outburst or pulsational pair instability ∼1.2−11.4 yr prior to the SN explosion or binary mass transfer. Moreover, we find that its ejecta mass is larger than those of many SNe Ic-BL and that its 56Ni mass (MNi) is approximately equal to the mean (or median) value of MNi of SNe Ic-BL in the literature but lower than MNi of prototype HNe (e.g., SN 1998bw and SN 2003dh).

研究指出，行星磁场可以影响电离层等离子体的运输和与太阳风的耦合。然而，火星上仅存在较弱和零星的壳状磁场，导致科学家们不清楚壳状磁场是否会影响电离层主峰。通过对不均匀分布的壳状磁场进行电离层测量，研究发现壳状磁场的强度和配置能够影响电离层主峰。电离层峰值电子密度在强水平壳状磁场区域倾向于减少。结果表明，壳状磁场可能通过调制太阳风高能粒子沉积来影响电离层主峰；强水平磁场可以部分阻止高能粒子沉积，从而减弱冲击电离作用。<br /><br />总结: 行星磁场影响电离层; 火星上壳状磁场影响电离层主峰; 水平磁场能减少电离层峰值密度。 <div>
Planetary magnetic fields can affect ionospheric plasma transport and coupling with the solar wind. In contrast to the terrestrial global magnetic field, there are only weaker and sporadic crustal magnetic fields on Mars. Many studies have indicated that Martian crustal fields can still modulate the topside ionosphere and its coupling with the solar wind. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether the crustal fields can affect the ionospheric main peak, which does not directly interact with the solar wind and is dominated by photochemical processes. In this study, the crustal field effect was identified from ionospheric measurements over unevenly distributed crustal fields. Both the intensity and configuration of the crustal fields were found to be capable of affecting the ionospheric main peak. The ionospheric peak electron density tends to decrease in the strong horizontal crustal field region. The results suggest that the crustal fields may affect the ionospheric main peak through modulating solar wind energetic particle precipitation; strong horizontal magnetic fields can partially prevent energetic particle precipitation and thus weaken impact ionization.

总结:<br /><br />这项研究使用VLITE和其他仪器在97个球状星团中搜索脉冲星，发现了一个新的毫秒脉冲星。研究小组发现了10个源，多出了预期的4个。在GLIMPSE-C01星团中发现了一个具有较大脉冲星候选。他们还通过其他波段的观测进一步确认了该候选天体的特性。他们还在该星团中探测到一个自转周期为19.78毫秒的双星脉冲星，并发现其X射线辐射比大多数毫秒脉冲星都强，暗示其磁场较强，表明其再循环过程可能被中断。这项研究表明在高色散方向进行低频率搜索是识别脉冲星候选天体的有效途径。 <div>
We present results from a search for pulsars in globular clusters, including the discovery of a new millisecond pulsar in the stellar cluster GLIMPSE-C01. We searched for low-frequency radio sources within 97 globular clusters using images from the VLA Low-band Ionosphere and Transient Experiment (VLITE) and epochs 1 and 2 of the VLITE Commensal Sky Survey. We discovered 10 sources in our search area, four more than expected from extragalactic source counts at our sensitivity limits. The strongest pulsar candidate was a point source found in GLIMPSE-C01 with a spectral index ∼ − 2.6, and we present additional measurements at 0.675 and 1.25 GHz from the GMRT and 1.52 GHz from the VLA that confirm the spectral index. Using archival Green Bank Telescope S-band data from 2005, we detect a binary pulsar with a spin period of 19.78 ms within the cluster. Although we cannot confirm that this pulsar is at the same position as the steep-spectrum source using the existing data, the pulse flux is consistent with the predicted flux density from other frequencies, making it a probable match. The source also shows strong X-ray emission, indicative of a higher magnetic field than most millisecond pulsars, suggesting that its recycling was interrupted. We demonstrate that low-frequency searches for steep-spectrum sources are an effective way to identify pulsar candidates, in particular on sightlines with high dispersion.

在这项研究中，科学家们通过模拟大规模星团的Monte Carlo模拟，研究了非常巨大恒星的生长过程。他们发现，初始条件对最终非常巨大恒星的质量有很大影响，尤其是初始星团的密度以及恒星初始质量分布。研究结果表明，在较高密度且具有重质量恒星初始质量分布的星团中，很容易形成质量超过1000太阳质量的非常巨大恒星。他们还通过重新计算模型多次得出了非常巨大恒星质量的统计分布。这项研究有助于预测和理解非常巨大恒星的形成和演化过程。<br /><br />总结: <br />非常巨大恒星的质量受星团初始条件影响；初始密度和质量分布决定非常巨大恒星质量；通过统计分布研究非常巨大恒星的质量形成。 <div>
Very massive stars (VMSs) formed via a sequence of stellar collisions in dense star clusters have been proposed as the progenitors of massive black hole seeds. VMSs could indeed collapse to form intermediate-mass black holes, which would then grow by accretion to become the supermassive black holes observed at the centers of galaxies and powering high-redshift quasars. Previous studies have investigated how different cluster initial conditions affect the formation of a VMS, including mass segregation, stellar collisions, and binaries, among others. In this study, we investigate the growth of VMSs with a new grid of Cluster Monte Carlo star cluster simulations—the most expansive to date. The simulations span a wide range of initial conditions, varying the number of stars, cluster density, stellar initial mass function (IMF), and primordial binary fraction. We find a gradual shift in the mass of the most massive collision product across the parameter space; in particular, denser clusters born with top-heavy IMFs provide strong collisional regimes that form VMSs with masses easily exceeding 1000 M⊙. Our results are used to derive a fitting formula that can predict the typical mass of a VMS formed as a function of the star cluster properties. Additionally, we study the stochasticity of this process and derive a statistical distribution for the mass of the VMS formed in one of our models, recomputing the model 50 times with different initial random seeds.

<br />总结: 本研究使用高分辨率TNG50宇宙学模拟研究了质量类似于Fornax星系团的七个暗物质晕的H i分布。模拟结果表明，在1个暗物质晕半径范围内，Fornax-like TNG50暗物质晕的中性氢云总覆盖面积约为12%（10 kpc像素）和6%（2 kpc像素）。当限制在离星系超过10个半质量半径的气体时，平均值仅略有下降，分别为10%（10 kpc像素）和4%（2 kpc像素）。此外，观测测量显示大量中性氢云分布在星系之外，但似乎与卫星星系相关。该研究为研究冷气体存活的物理过程和宇宙学重子流提供了重要线索。 <div>
The presence of dense, neutral hydrogen clouds in the hot, diffuse intragroup and intracluster (IC) medium is an important clue to the physical processes controlling the survival of cold gas and sheds light on cosmological baryon flows in massive halos. Advances in numerical modeling and observational surveys mean that theory and observational comparisons are now possible. In this paper, we use the high-resolution TNG50 cosmological simulation to study the H i distribution in seven halos with masses similar to the Fornax galaxy cluster. Adopting observational sensitivities similar to the MeerKAT Fornax Survey (MFS), an ongoing H i survey that will probe to column densities of 1018 cm−2, we find that Fornax-like TNG50 halos have an extended distribution of neutral hydrogen clouds. Within 1 Rvir, we predict the MFS will observe a total H i covering fraction of ∼12% (mean value) for 10 kpc pixels and 6% for 2 kpc pixels. If we restrict this to gas more than 10 half-mass radii from galaxies, the mean values only decrease mildly, to 10% (4%) for 10 (2) kpc pixels (albeit with significant halo-to-halo spread). Although there are large amounts of H i outside of galaxies, the gas seems to be associated with satellites, judging both by the visual inspection of projections and by comparison of the line of sight velocities of galaxies and IC H i.

总结:<br /><br />本研究利用深空望远镜中红外仪对HUDF中的28个星系进行了观测，首次在λ > 1 μm的波长下揭示了它们的恒星结构。通过新的深空望远镜光度测量，修正了恒星质量估计，并发现与之前的分析结果有良好的一致性。研究发现，宇宙中午时的大质量、富含气体、正在形成恒星的星系的恒星结构比较平滑，且集中于中心，这对星系形成模拟提出了额外的限制。下一步，匹配分辨率的ALMA观测将对将质量和光线加权的星系结构与尘埃丰富的星际介质进一步联系起来。 <div>
We present deep James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)/Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) F560W observations of a flux-limited, Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA)-selected sample of 28 galaxies at z = 0.5–3.7 in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF). The data from the MIRI Deep Imaging Survey (MIDIS) reveal the stellar structure of the HUDF galaxies at rest-frame wavelengths of λ > 1 μm for the first time. We revise the stellar mass estimates using new JWST photometry and find good agreement with pre-JWST analyses; the few discrepancies can be explained by blending issues in the earlier lower-resolution Spitzer data. At z ∼ 2.5, the resolved rest-frame near-infrared (1.6 μm) structure of the galaxies is significantly more smooth and centrally concentrated than seen by the Hubble Space Telescope at rest-frame 450 nm (F160W), with effective radii of Re(F560W) = 1–5 kpc and Sérsic indices mostly close to an exponential (disk-like) profile (n ≈ 1), up to n ≈ 5 (excluding active galactic nuclei). We find an average size ratio of Re(F560W)/Re(F160W) ≈ 0.7 that decreases with stellar mass. The stellar structure of the ALMA-selected galaxies is indistinguishable from a HUDF reference sample of all galaxies with a MIRI flux density greater than 1 μJy. We supplement our analysis with custom-made, position-dependent, empirical point-spread function models for the F560W observations. The results imply that a smoother stellar structure is in place in massive gas-rich, star-forming galaxies at “Cosmic Noon,” despite a more clumpy rest-frame optical appearance, placing additional constraints on galaxy formation simulations. As a next step, matched-resolution, resolved ALMA observations will be crucial to further link the mass- and light-weighted galaxy structures to the dusty interstellar medium.

总结:
这篇文章研究了两个不寻常的长伽马射线暴（GRB），分别是GRB 211211A和GRB 230307A。研究发现它们具有相似的发射特性，包括零光谱延迟，极短的最小变化时间尺度，以及与热流量和总流量之间的强相关性。还观察到它们的光谱在整个发射过程中都是准热谱，并且光谱宽度比模型预测的黑体辐射要宽。研究者认为这两个GRB可能与紧凑恒星合并有关，并且通过光球辐射解释了它们的辐射机制。 <div>
GRB 211211A is a peculiar long gamma-ray burst (GRB) with very high brightness and short burst properties. Its full light curve consists of three emission episodes, i.e., a precursor, a main burst, and an extended emission. We find that a recently detected long-duration GRB 230307A also includes the three consistent emission episodes. Furthermore, the two bursts have similar redshifts, 0.076 and 0.065, respectively. We perform a detailed temporal and spectral analysis of the two GRBs to compare their temporal and spectral properties. Our analysis shows that the two bursts share great similarities for both the whole emission and the three corresponding emission phases, which are listed as follows: (1) they have near zero spectral lag; (2) they have very short minimum variability timescale (MVT); (3) they lie in the same region of in the MVT–T90, Amati relation and hardness–T90 planes; (4) the three phases are quasi-thermal spectra; (5) both the peak energy and the low-energy index track the flux; (6) the time-resolved spectra are much wider than those of the blackbody predicted by the model; (7) there are strong correlations between thermal flux and total flux and the correlation coefficients, and the slopes for the corresponding stages are very consistent; and (8) the photosphere emission properties are very consistent. Other investigations and observations suggest that the two GRBs indeed belong to a short burst with a compact star merger origin. Therefore, we think that GRB 230307A and GRB 211211A are rare and similar GRBs, and the photospheric radiation can interpret their radiation mechanisms.

总结:
LIGO和Virgo天文探测器使用模板匹配滤波方法主要检测聚合致密双星的引力波信号。然而，非定常噪音干扰以及对黑洞自旋进动和高阶波形谐波的局限性影响了检测灵敏度。研究首次表明，深度学习可用于准确重建具有高阶模式的进动双黑洞信号波形，并可用于快速触发生成算法以增强在线搜索。实验结果显示，该模型对真实LIGO噪音中模拟注入的信号具有高度重叠度，并且在各种黑洞质量和自旋配置下都表现一致。应用于真实引力波事件时，模型的重建结果与非模型和模型分析的重叠度在85%至98%之间，表明深度学习在分析各种致密双星信号方面是一个强大的工具。<br /><br /> <div>
Gravitational-wave signals from coalescing compact binaries in the LIGO and Virgo interferometers are primarily detected by the template-based matched filtering method. While this method is optimal for stationary and Gaussian data scenarios, its sensitivity is often affected by nonstationary noise transients in the detectors. Moreover, most of the current searches do not account for the effects of precession of black hole spins and higher-order waveform harmonics, focusing solely on the leading-order quadrupolar modes. This limitation impacts our search for interesting astrophysical sources, such as intermediate-mass black hole binaries and hierarchical mergers. Here we show, for the first time, that deep learning can be used for accurate waveform reconstruction of precessing binary black hole signals with higher-order modes. This approach can also be adapted into a rapid trigger generation algorithm to enhance online searches. Our model, tested on simulated injections in real LIGO noise from the third observing run (2019–2020) achieved a high degree of overlap with injected signals. This accuracy was consistent across a wide range of black hole masses and spin configurations chosen for this study. When applied to real gravitational-wave events, our model's reconstructions achieved between 85% and 98% overlap with those obtained by Coherent WaveBurst (unmodeled) and LALInference (modeled) analyses. These results suggest that deep learning is a potent tool for analyzing signals from a diverse catalog of compact binaries.

总结:<br />
文章通过研究星系团中的"水母"星系，发现了在其气体触须中形成的新型矮星系。这些触须中的星形成区域质量庞大，且具有金属丰富、年龄较短和典型的矮星系半质量半径等特点。研究还发现这些新型矮星系是由气体触须中诞生的，其本身并不具备暗物质晕。这一发现丰富了我们对星系形成和演化的认识。 <div>
When falling into a galaxy cluster, galaxies experience a loss of gas due to ram pressure stripping. In particular, disk galaxies lose gas from their disks, and very large tentacles of gas can be formed. Because of the morphology of these stripped galaxies, they have been referred to as jellyfish galaxies. It has been found that star formation is triggered not only in the disk, but also in the tentacles of such jellyfish galaxies. The observed star-forming regions located in the tentacles of those galaxies have been found to be as massive as 3 × 107M⊙ and with sizes >100 pc. Interestingly, these parameters in mass and size agree with those of dwarf galaxies. In this work, we make use of the state-of-the-art magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) cosmological simulation IllustrisTNG-50 to study massive jellyfish galaxies with long tentacles. We find that, in the tentacles of TNG-50 jellyfish galaxies, the star formation regions (gas+stars) formed could be as massive as ∼2 × 108M⊙. A particular star-forming region was analyzed. This region has a star formation rate of 0.04 M⊙ yr−1, it is metal-rich, has an average age of 0.46 Gyr, and has a half-mass radius of ∼1 kpc, typical of standard dwarf galaxies. Most importantly, this region is gravitationally self-bound. Overall, we identify a new type of dwarf galaxy being born from the gas tentacles of jellyfish galaxies that, by construction, lacks a dark matter halo.

通过对FRB 20121102A射电暴的观测数据分析，发现了4.605天的周期性和另一个可能的周期性。前者与之前的研究结果一致，而后者是新发现。4.605天的周期性在能量较高的射电暴中表现更为明显。这些（可能的）周期性的存在，以及相应的射电暴在相位空间中的积累，与射电暴可能来自于一个有着紧密伴星行星的双变星系统的理论预测一致。这一发现对确定射电暴的起源具有重要意义。<br /><br />总结: 高能射电暴的观测数据分析发现了4.605天的周期性以及一个新的可能周期性，这与双变星系统理论模型相符，有助于确定射电暴的起源。 <div>
A firm establishment of the presence or the lack of periodicity in repeating fast radio bursts is crucial for determining their origins. Here, we compile 1145 radio bursts of FRB 20121102A with fluence larger than 0.15 Jy ms from observations using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope, the Arecibo Observatory, the Green Bank Telescope, the Effelsberg Telescope, the MeerKAT Telescope, the Lovell Telescope, the Deep Space Network 70 m radio telescopes, the Very Large Array, and the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope, spanning the time interval of MJD 57175−58776. A quasi-period of days and a candidate quasi-period of days are found through the phase-folding probability binomial analysis. The former is consistent with previous findings and the latter is new. The 4.605 day periodicity is more obvious in high-energy bursts with fluence larger than 1 × 1038 erg. The presence of these (candidate) quasi-periods, together with the corresponding width of burst accumulation in the phase space, are consistent with the bursts originating from a binary degenerate star system with a close-by planet around the primary neutron star.

<div> 黑洞，相对论，辐射传输，磁流体力学，射电成像
总结:
本研究通过进行广义相对论的辐射传输计算，展示了包括高度磁化区域在内的相对论性喷流的射电成像。研究发现，对于几乎是垂直观测者来说，230 GHz的光子频率会呈现出多个环状像，这是因为光子在分离表面的弯曲效应非常强烈。此外，在反喷流区域还会出现一个明亮的泪滴状组成部分。在黑洞自旋量级较高时，会呈现出更细小直径的环状特征。这些形态特征不太受广义相对论理想磁流体力学模型参数的影响，因为分离表面的位置主要受到黑洞自旋的调控。我们的广义相对论理想磁流体力学模型和高度磁化喷流漏斗的发射特征可能会在未来的观测中得到检验，例如下一代事件视界望远镜和黑洞探测器。 <div>
By performing general-relativistic radiative transfer calculations, we show the radio images of relativistic jets including highly magnetized regions inside jet funnels, based on steady, axisymmetric, and semianalytic general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics models. It is found that multiple ring images appear at the photon frequency of 230 GHz for nearly pole-on observers, because of the strong light-bending effect on photons generated at the separation surface, which is the boundary between the inflow and outflow flows in the jet funnel. A bright teardrop-shaped component, which extends from the bright rings of the separation surface, also appears in the counterjet region. The diameter of the brightest outermost ring originated from the counterjet is ∼60 μas, which is consistent with the ringlike images of M87 at 86 GHz observed with GMVA, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, and the Greenland Telescope, whose ring diameter is . The thinner and smaller-diameter rings are exhibited when the black hole spin magnitude is higher. These morphological features are expected to appear without being prominently affected by the detailed magnetohydrodynamic plasma parameters of our general-relativistic ideal magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) jet model, since the location of the separation surface is mainly regulated by the black hole spin. Our GRMHD model and the emission features of the images in the horizon-scale, highly magnetized jet funnel may be tested by future observations, e.g., the next-generation Event Horizon Telescope and the Black Hole Explorer.

该研究利用哈勃空间望远镜进行多次观测，得出了NGC 1783星团内年轻恒星的准确运动学信息，证明这些年轻恒星确实属于该星团，并且它们的空间分布比较老年恒星更加扩散。研究通过N体模拟发现，这些年轻恒星的特性无法仅通过蓝巨星和星老化来解释，而是更可能是外部低质量恒星系统的吸积结果，从而形成了年轻恒星和老年恒星混合的现象。

总结: 这项研究通过哈勃空间望远镜得知NGC 1783星团内年轻恒星的运动学特性，并提出了这些年轻恒星由外部低质量恒星系统吸积所致的观点。 <div>
The presence of young stellar populations in the Large Magellanic Cloud cluster NGC 1783 has caught significant attention, with suggestions ranging from it being a genuine secondary stellar generation to a population of blue straggler stars or simply contamination from background stars. Thanks to multiepoch observations with the Hubble Space Telescope, proper motions for stars within the field of NGC 1783 have been derived, thus allowing accurate cluster membership determination. Here, we report that the younger stars within NGC 1783 indeed belong to the cluster and their spatial distribution is more extended compared to the bulk of the older stellar population, consistent with previous studies. Through N-body simulations, we demonstrate that the observed characteristics of the younger stars cannot be explained solely by blue straggler stars in the context of the isolated dynamical evolution of NGC 1783. Instead, accretion of the external, low-mass stellar system can better account for both the inverse spatial concentration and the radial velocity isotropy of the younger stars. We propose that NGC 1783 may have accreted external stars from low-mass stellar systems, resulting in a mixture of external younger stars and blue straggler stars from the older bulk population, thereby accounting for the characteristics of the younger sequence.

Atmospheric pollutants such as chlorofluorocarbons and NO2 have been proposed as potential remotely detectable atmospheric technosignature gases. Here we investigate the potential for artificial greenhouse gases including CF4, C2F6, C3F8, SF6, and NF3 to generate detectable atmospheric signatures. In contrast to passive incidental by-products of industrial processes, artificial greenhouse gases would represent an intentional effort to change the climate of a planet with long-lived, low-toxicity gases and would possess low false positive potential. An extraterrestrial civilization may be motivated to undertake such an effort to arrest a predicted snowball state on their home world or to terraform an otherwise uninhabitable terrestrial planet within their system. Because artificial greenhouse gases strongly absorb in the thermal mid-infrared window of temperate atmospheres, a terraformed planet will logically possess strong absorption features from these gases at mid-infrared wavelengths (∼8–12 μm), possibly accompanied by diagnostic features in the near-infrared. As a proof of concept, we calculate the needed observation time to detect 1 [10](100) ppm of C2F6/C3F8/SF6 on TRAPPIST-1 f with JWST MIRI’s Low Resolution Spectrometer (LRS) and NIRSpec. We find that a combination of 1[10](100) ppm each of C2F6, C3F8, and SF6 can be detected with a signal-to-noise ratio ≧ 5 in as few as 25[10](5) transits with MIRI/LRS. We further explore mid-infrared direct-imaging scenarios with the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets mission concept and find these gases are more detectable than standard biosignatures at these concentrations. Consequently, artificial greenhouse gases can be readily detected (or excluded) during normal planetary characterization observations with no additional overhead.

总结:<br /><br />本文通过使用3D数据驱动全球磁流体动力学数值模型探讨了动态日冕中形成的磁场反转的演变。研究发现，影响磁场反转寿命的两个因素是角度和长度的组合以及速度剪切。角度和长度的组合确保了重新连接后更大曲率的磁场反转能够持续更长时间，而速度剪切则影响着磁场反转的增强或削弱。这些发现有助于解释磁场反转能够在太阳风和星际空间中持续存在的原因。 <div>
Parker Solar Probe, the closest spacecraft to the Sun, has renewed our understanding of the solar corona and the interplanetary space. One of its important findings is the prevalence of switchbacks, which display localized magnetic reversals along the otherwise Parker spirals. While some switchbacks might disappear quickly, others can maintain for a long period of time, and there are indications that many switchbacks strengthen from the solar corona to the interplanetary space despite their magnetic tension force, which tends to straighten the magnetic field lines. Therefore, how these switchbacks could be maintained for a long period of time remains a mystery. In this paper, we employed a 3D data-driven global full magnetohydrodynamics numerical model to explore the evolution of switchbacks formed in the dynamic corona. Our simulations indicate that two factors can affect the lifetime of a switchback. One factor is the combination of angle and leg length ensures that the switchback with greater curvature after reconnection can last longer, and the greater the angle, the more magnetic field lines that can be reconnected, and thus the longer the duration. We call this influencing factor flux tube shape factor. The other factor is the velocity shear, i.e., when the solar wind at the convex-outward turning of a switchback is faster than that at the concave-outward turning, the switchback becomes enhanced during propagation, and it weakens when the velocity difference is opposite.

The regular behavior of the pulsations of high-amplitude δ Sct (HADS) stars gives a greater chance to investigate the interiors of stars. We analyzed seven HADS stars showing peak-to-peak amplitudes of more than 0.3 mag that were newly observed by TESS. We obtained that TIC 374753270, TIC 710783, and TIC 187386415 pulsate in fundamental radial mode; also, TIC 130474019 and TIC 160120432 show double radial modes. On the other hand, TIC 148357344 and TIC 278119167 demonstrate triple-mode behavior. Our analysis shows that these seven stars are close to the red edge of the (inside) instability strip in the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram. The fundamental mode of these seven targets follows the period–luminosity (PL) relation for δ Sct stars. However, TIC 278119167 deviates slightly from the fundamental PL relation. The double-mode and triple-mode HADS stars (TIC 130474019, TIC 160120432, TIC 148357344, and TIC 278119167) are in agreement with the period ratio ranges (fundamental to first and second overtones). Using the information of 176 HADS stars (Netzel and Smolec), we find a scaling relation ( )) between the metallicity ([Fe/H]) and mass (M), luminosity (L), effective temperature (Teff), and the fundamental period (P0). We estimate the metallicity of the seven newly identified HADS stars ranging from −0.62 to 0.37 dex.

总结:
本研究提出了一套大质量主序星（10≤M1≤40 M⊙）的二进制演化模型，通过非守恒质量传递来跟踪这些系统的喷射物的总质量和化学成分。这些喷射物显示出所需的热氢燃烧丰度特征，能够解释大质量恒星聚类中观察到的多重星族的丰度模式。研究计算了与野外恒星群中分布一致的质量、质量比和周期的一群二进制星的总产出。结果表明，这些物质的总丰度富集了氦、氮、钠和铝，并且缺乏碳、氧和镁，其丰度变化量与观测结果一致。此外，研究还表明，这样一群二进制星将在约12百万年的特征时间尺度内将其约25%的质量排出为这些喷射物（与所有恒星为单星时的4%相比）。作者强调，需要认真考虑大质量二进制星作为解释大质量星团中多重星族所需的富集物来源，因为几乎所有大质量恒星都是在二进制或更高阶多重系统中形成的，大质量二进制星主要是在聚类中形成的，并且大质量二进制星自然产生符合要求的物质。 <div>
We present a suite of binary evolution models with massive primaries (10 ≤ M1 ≤ 40 M⊙) and periods and mass ratios chosen such that the systems undergo nonconservative mass transfer while the primaries have helium cores. We track the total mass and chemical composition of the ejecta from these systems. This material shows the abundance signatures of hot hydrogen burning that are needed to explain the abundance patterns seen in multiple populations in massive star clusters. We then calculate the total yield of a population of binary stars with masses, mass ratios, and periods consistent with their distribution in a field population. We show that the overall abundance of this material is enriched in helium, nitrogen, sodium, and aluminum, and depleted in carbon, oxygen, and magnesium, by amounts that are consistent with observations. We also show that such a population of binaries will return approximately 25% of its mass in this ejecta (compared to 4% if all the stars were single), over a characteristic timescale of about 12 Myr. We argue that massive binaries must be seriously considered as a contributor to the source of enriched material needed to explain the multiple populations in massive clusters, since essentially all massive stars are formed in binaries or higher-order multiples, massive binaries are primarily formed in clusters, and massive binaries naturally produce material of the right composition.

总结: 
Henize 2–10是一个正在经历正反馈黑洞的矮星系，通过对其H2O“kilomaser”的研究，发现了两个不同位置和速度的maser源。第一个maser源与已知的黑洞流出和触发的星形成区域相吻合，这证实了一部分maser是由于黑洞流出冲击沿流动的密集分子气体而产生的。第二个maser源位于东南方，远离中央黑洞，具有狭窄的宽度，这表明它与星形成有关。这项工作揭示了Henize 2–10中H2O kilomaser的性质，并阐明了流出驱动的H2O maser与正反馈黑洞之间的第一个已知联系。<br /><br /> <div>
Henize 2–10 is a dwarf galaxy experiencing positive black hole (BH) feedback from a radio-detected low-luminosity active galactic nucleus. Previous Green Bank Telescope (GBT) observations detected a H2O “kilomaser” in Henize 2–10, but the low angular resolution (33″) left the location and origin of the maser ambiguous. We present new Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array observations of the H2O maser line at 22.23508 GHz in Henize 2–10 with ∼2″ resolution. These observations reveal two maser sources distinct in position and velocity. The first maser source is spatially coincident with the known BH outflow and the region of triggered star formation ∼70 pc to the east. Combined with the broad width of the maser (W50 ∼ 66 km s−1), this confirms our hypothesis that part of the maser detected with the GBT is produced by the impact of the BH outflow shocking the dense molecular gas along the flow and at the interface of the eastern star-forming region. The second maser source lies to the southeast, far from the central BH, and has a narrow width (W50 ∼ 8 km s−1), suggesting a star formation–related origin. This work has revealed the nature of the H2O kilomaser in Henize 2–10 and illustrates the first known connection between outflow-driven H2O masers and positive BH feedback.

We report the detection of a long X-ray burst from the ultracompact binary 4U 1850–087. The type I X-ray burst was observed on MJD 60171.65 by the Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image and Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER). We analyze the NICER data between MJD 60095.19 and 60177.43, which includes the observation covering parts of the long X-ray burst decay phase, i.e., 0.15–3.8 hr after the trigger. The persistent spectra are well described by a multicolor disk blackbody, with an inner temperature of ∼0.5 keV, a thermally Comptonized continuum, an asymptotic power-law photon index of Γ ∼ 2.2, and an electron temperature of kTe ∼ 20–30 keV. The mean persistent flux was around 3.8 × 10−10 erg cm−2 s−1, corresponding to a local mass accretion rate of . Part of the time-resolved burst spectra show a clear deviation from the blackbody model, which can be improved by considering the enhanced persistent emission due to the Poynting–Robertson drag or the reflected disk emission illuminated by the burst. From the burst flux during the cooling phase, we estimate the burst duration, τ ≈ 0.78 hr, the burst fluence, Eb ≈ 4.1 × 1041 erg, and the ignition column depth, yign ≈ 3.5 × 1010 g cm−2. These long X-ray burst parameters from 4U 1850–087 suggest a regime of unstable burning of a thick, pure helium layer slowly accreted from a helium donor star. Moreover, we identify 7σ significant ∼1 keV emission lines in the burst spectra, which may originate from the surrounding accretion disk.

总结:
本研究基于Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS)数据，展示了地球白天侧对不同太阳风条件下哨兵模式波的动态响应。统计结果显示，哨兵模式波的发生率、振幅以及相应的电子温度各向异性随着Psw的增加而增加，这归因于磁场在磁层外磁屏和外磁层的压缩。此外，在太阳际磁场向南的情况下，哨兵模式波的发生率比太阳际磁场向北的情况下更高，大多数对应于Te⊥/Te∥ > 1，并且在准径向太阳际磁场下有更高的发生率。这些结果表明，这些磁屏和外磁层中的哨兵模式波像内部磁层一样明显受太阳风的调节。这项工作推动了我们对太阳-地球相互作用的理解。 <div>
Whistler-mode waves have been extensively observed and investigated in terrestrial space. In this study, we present the dynamic response of whistler-mode waves to different solar wind conditions in the dayside terrestrial space based on Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) data. Statistical results show that the occurrence rate, amplitudes, and corresponding electron temperature anisotropy of whistler-mode waves increase with Psw in the dayside terrestrial space, which is attributed to the compression of magnetic fields in these magnetosheath and outer magnetosphere. Furthermore, whistler-mode waves under the southward interplanetary magnetic fields (IMFs) show a higher occurrence rate than that under the northward IMFs, mostly corresponding to Te⊥/Te∥ > 1, and have a higher occurrence rate during quasi-radial IMFs. These results present that whistler-mode waves in these magnetosheath and outer magnetosphere are also modulated by the solar wind as clearly as the inner magnetosphere. This work advanced our understanding in the solar–terrestrial interaction.

Energetic positrons have been observed in the interstellar medium, and high-energy positrons with relativistic energies up to approximately 1 TeV have been detected in Galactic cosmic rays. We conducted a study on the acceleration of particles, specifically positrons, in a nonrelativistic quasi-parallel collisionless shock induced by a plasma consisting of protons, electrons, and positrons. The positron-to-proton number density ratio in the plasma is 0.1. We focused on a representative shock with a sonic Mach number of 17.1 and an Alfvénic Mach number of 16.8 in the rest frame of the shock. To investigate the acceleration mechanisms of particles including positrons in the shock, we utilized 1D particle-in-cell simulations. It was found that all three species of particles in the shock can be accelerated and exhibit power-law spectra. At the shock front, a significant portion of incoming upstream particles are reflected and undergo significant energy increases, and these reflected particles can be efficiently injected into the process of diffusive shock acceleration (DSA). Moveover, the reflected positrons can be further accelerated by an electric field parallel to the magnetic field when they move along the magnetic field upstream of the shock. As a result, positrons can be preferentially accelerated to be injected in the DSA process compared to electrons.

<br /><br />总结: 本论文研究了太阳射电爆发中相干辐射的发生率，使用了1988年至2023年Nobeyama射电偏振计观测到的3800个太阳射电爆发的修订目录。重点关注1.0和2.0 GHz数据，观察到了达到10^10 Jy数量级的射电流量。之前的研究表明，这些爆发是由电子回旋脉塞（ECM）辐射引起的。根据射电波谱，可以区分1 GHz的相干辐射和传统的不相干回旋辐射。对于超过100 sfu的爆发，发现四分之三的1 GHz爆发和一半的2 GHz爆发具有主导的相干辐射成分，假设为ECM。在1 GHz的大多数非常明亮的爆发中，极化度很高，与相干辐射机制一致，但并非总是100%极化。1至2 GHz的频率范围被广泛用于地球应用，这些结果对理解可能影响这些应用的极端流量水平是相关的，并且为与其他恒星和潜在外行星上的ECM辐射研究进行比较提供了参考。 <div>
This paper investigates the incidence of coherent emission in solar radio bursts, using a revised catalog of 3800 solar radio bursts observed by the Nobeyama Radio Polarimeters from 1988 to 2023. We focus on the 1.0 and 2.0 GHz data, where radio fluxes of order 1010 Jy have been observed. Previous work has suggested that these bursts are due to electron cyclotron maser (ECM) emission. In at least one well-studied case, the bright emission at 1 GHz consists of narrowband spikes of millisecond duration. Coherent emission at 1 GHz can be distinguished from traditional incoherent gyrosynchrotron flare emission based on the radio spectrum: Gyrosynchrotron emission at 1 GHz usually has a spectrum rising with frequency, so bursts in which 1 GHz is stronger than higher-frequency measurements are unlikely to be incoherent gyrosynchrotron. Based on this criterion, it is found that for bursts exceeding 100 sfu, three-quarters of all bursts at 1 GHz and half of all 2 GHz bursts have a dominant coherent emission component, assumed to be ECM. The majority of the very bright bursts at 1 GHz are highly circularly polarized, consistent with a coherent emission mechanism, but not always 100% polarized. The frequency range from 1 to 2 GHz is heavily utilized for terrestrial applications, and these results are relevant for understanding the extreme flux levels that may impact such applications. Further, they provide a reference for comparison with the study of ECM emission from other stars and potentially exoplanets.

<div> LIM, spectral line emissions, redshift, interloping lines, cross-correlations
总结: 
LIM是天体物理学中的一种重要探测方法，通过对远距离星系的积分谱线发射进行统计分析。文章介绍了一种新的方法LIM-LLX来量化线-线交叉相关，用于研究目标信号和干扰信号。研究发现，在特定红移下，使用CO(6-5)线与C ii 158进行交叉相关可以得到较高的信噪比，并且较少偏差。通过利用不同的CO跃迁线来探测低红移的宇宙，还展示了交叉相关的广泛能力。最后，将低频通道整合到实验中，可以最大限度地减少仪器噪声和干扰信号引入的偏差。 <div>
Line intensity mapping (LIM) serves as a potent probe in astrophysics, relying on the statistical analysis of integrated spectral line emissions originating from distant star-forming galaxies. While LIM observations hold the promise of achieving a broad spectrum of scientific objectives, a significant hurdle for future experiments lies in distinguishing the targeted spectral line emitted at a specific redshift from undesired line emissions originating at different redshifts. The presence of these interloping lines poses a challenge to the accuracy of cosmological analyses. In this study, we introduce a novel approach to quantify line–line cross-correlations (LIM-LLX), enabling us to investigate the target signal amid instrumental noise and interloping emissions. For example, at a redshift of z ∼ 3.7, we observed that the measured auto-power spectrum of C ii 158 exhibited substantial bias, from interloping line emission. However, cross-correlating C ii 158 with CO(6–5) lines using an FYST-like experiment yielded a promising result, with a signal-to-noise ratio of ∼10. This measurement is notably unbiased. Additionally, we explore the extensive capabilities of cross-correlation by leveraging various CO transitions to probe the tomographic Universe at lower redshifts through LIM-LLX. We further demonstrate that incorporating low-frequency channels, such as 90 and 150 GHz, into FYST’s EoR-Spec-like experiment can maximize the potential for cross-correlation studies, effectively reducing the bias introduced by instrumental noise and interlopers.

<div> 关键词: 两维模型, 云形成, 热木星, 微物理, 气体和云的输运

总结: 
本研究提出了一个新的热木星大气中云的两维微物理模型，考虑了纵向气体和云的输运效应。通过对平衡温度从1000到2100 K范围内的一系列热木星进行模拟，预测了云粒子大小分布与行星经度和大气高度的关系。结果表明，在二维模型中，某些云物种能够在热木星的白昼侧被输运并存活，这在一维模型中是无法预测的。此外，我们发现凝结性气体物种的耗尽程度随着经度和大气高度的变化而变化，进而影响了气相化学反应。最后，我们讨论了各种模型敏感度，包括云属性对微物理参数的敏感度相对较小，而对大气热结构以及冷凝物质的水平和垂直输运的敏感度更大。 <div>
We present a new two-dimensional, bin-scheme microphysical model of cloud formation in the atmospheres of hot Jupiters that includes the effects of longitudinal gas and cloud transport. We predict cloud particle size distributions as a function of planetary longitude and atmospheric height for a grid of hot Jupiters with equilibrium temperatures ranging from 1000 to 2100 K. The predicted 2D cloud distributions vary significantly from models that do not consider horizontal cloud transport and we discuss the microphysical and transport timescales that give rise to the differences in 2D versus 1D models. We find that the horizontal advection of cloud particles increases the cloud formation efficiency for nearly all cloud species and homogenizes cloud distributions across the planets in our model grid. In 2D models, certain cloud species are able to be transported and survive on the daysides of hot Jupiters in cases where 1D models would not predict the existence of clouds. We demonstrate that the depletion of condensible gas species varies as a function of longitude and atmospheric height across the planet, which impacts the resultant gas-phase chemistry. Finally, we discuss various model sensitivities including the sensitivity of cloud properties to microphysical parameters, which we find to be substantially less than the sensitivity to the atmospheric thermal structure and horizontal and vertical transport of condensible material.

The measurements of morphological indicators of galaxies are often influenced by a series of observational effects. In this study, we utilize a sample of 832 TNG50 simulated galaxies with log(M*/M⊙)> 9 at 0.5 < z < 3 to investigate the differences in nonparametric morphological indicators (C, A, Gini, M20, AO, and DO) derived from noise-free and high-resolution TNG50 images and mock images simulated to have the same observational conditions as JWST/NIRCam. We quantify the relationship between intrinsic and observed values of the morphological indicators and accordingly apply this calibration to 4733 galaxies in the same stellar mass and redshift ranges observed in JWST CEERS and JADES surveys. We find a significant evolution of morphological indicators with rest-frame wavelength (λrf) at λrf < 1 μm, while essentially no obvious variations occur at λrf > 1 μm. The morphological indicators of star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and quiescent galaxies (QGs) are significantly different. The morphologies of QGs exhibit a higher sensitivity to rest-frame wavelength than SFGs. After analyzing the evolution of morphological indicators in the rest-frame V band (0.5–0.7 μm) and rest-frame J band (1.1–1.4 μm), we find that the morphologies of QGs evolve substantially with both redshift and stellar mass. For SFGs, the C, Gini, and M20 show a rapid evolution with stellar mass at log(M*/M⊙) ≥ 10.5, while the AO, DO, and A evolve with both redshift and stellar mass. Our comparison shows that TNG50 simulations effectively reproduce the morphological indicators we measured from JWST observations when the impact of dust attenuation is considered.

<br /><br />
总结: 本研究利用JWST/MIRI在Hubble eXtreme Deep Field的超深图像，在z≃7-8时限制了强Hα发射体（HAEs）在“宇宙再电离”中的作用。样本包括年轻（<35 Myr）低质量（≲109M⊙）的星系，它们的紫外线连续光谱坡度（β）范围广，与星等质量有关。计算结果表明这些发射体对周围星系间介质进行再电离仅需较小的逸出分数（fesc，rel）为6%至15%。与同一红移范围内的非HAE星系相比，强、年轻、低质量的发射体可能在宇宙再电离中发挥了重要作用。 <div>
By using an ultradeep JWST/MIRI image at 5.6 μm in the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field, we constrain the role of strong Hα emitters (HAEs) during “cosmic reionization” at z ≃ 7–8. Our sample of HAEs is comprised of young (<35 Myr) galaxies, except for one single galaxy (≈300 Myr), with low stellar masses (≲109M⊙). These HAEs show a wide range of rest-frame UV continuum slopes (β), with a median value of β = −2.15 ± 0.21, which broadly correlates with stellar mass. We estimate the ionizing photon production efficiency (ξion,0) of these sources (assuming fesc,LyC = 0%), which yields a median value . We show that ξion,0 positively correlates with Hα equivalent width and specific star formation rate. Instead ξion,0 weakly anticorrelates with stellar mass and β. Based on the β values, we predict , which results in . Considering this and related findings from the literature, we find a mild evolution of ξion with redshift. Additionally, our results suggest that these HAEs require only modest escape fractions (fesc,rel) of 6%–15% to reionize their surrounding intergalactic medium. By only considering the contribution of these HAEs, we estimated their total ionizing emissivity ( ) as . When comparing their with non-HAE galaxies across the same redshift range, we find that that strong, young, and low-mass emitters may have played an important role during cosmic reionization.

<div> 超大质量黑洞，活动星系核，超高红移，BH-星系质量比，BH成长路径
<br />
这项研究使用变化选择的活动星系核样本（iAB ≤ 25.9 and z ≤ 4.5）进行了超大质量黑洞（SMBHs）和宿主星系之间关系的研究。他们基于单次测量维里定律方法估计了黑洞质量（MBH = 10^5.5−10M⊙），并通过谱能分布拟合将总星质量（Mstar = 10^10−12M⊙）与AGN组件分离。研究发现 BH-星系质量比（MBH/Mstar）的红移演化取决于MBH，这是由于MBH与Mstar之间没有明显的相关性。在1.5 < z < 3的低红移变化AGNs中，具有庞大SMBHs（MBH > 10^9M⊙）的对象显示出明显更高的BH-星系质量比（> ∼1%），这意味着庞大SMBHs存在一种典型的成长路径，比目前观察到的局部宇宙中具有相同BH范围的BH-星系球比（MBH/Mbulge）更快。另一方面，在0.5 < z < 3的小质量SMBHs（MBH < 10^8M⊙）中，变化AGNs显示出与局部对象相似的BH-星系质量比（∼0.1%），但比观察到的z > 4时的小些。我们解释说，在中红移时期，宿主星系中的小质量SMBHs已经获得足够的恒星质量，尽管高红移星系相对于中/局部宇宙的星系仍处于星系形成的早期阶段。

超大质量黑洞与宿主星系的关系研究发现，BH-星系质量比的红移演化取决于黑洞质量，大质量SMBHs的成长速度比星系中恒星球成分的形成速度更快，而小质量SMBHs的情况与局部宇宙的类似，但高于高红移时期。这说明在中红移时期，宿主星系中的小质量SMBHs已经获得足够的恒星质量，而高红移星系相对于中/局部宇宙的星系仍处于星系形成的早期阶段。 <div>
We present the study on the relationship between supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their host galaxies using our variability-selected active galactic nuclei (AGNs) sample (iAB ≤ 25.9 and z ≤ 4.5) constructed from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program Ultradeep survey in the COSMOS field. We estimated the black hole (BH) mass (MBH = 105.5−10M⊙) based on the single-epoch virial method and the total stellar mass (Mstar = 1010−12M⊙) by separating the AGN component with spectral energy distribution fitting. We found that the redshift evolution of the BH–stellar mass ratio (MBH/Mstar) depends on the MBH, which is caused by no significant correlation between MBH and Mstar. Variable AGNs with massive SMBHs (MBH > 109M⊙) at 1.5 < z < 3 show considerably higher BH–stellar mass ratios (> ∼1%) than the BH–bulge ratios (MBH/Mbulge) observed in the local Universe for the same BH range. This implies that there is a typical growth path of massive SMBHs, which is faster than the formation of the bulge component as final products seen in the present day. For the low-mass SMBHs (MBH < 108M⊙) at 0.5 < z < 3, on the other hand, variable AGNs show similar BH–stellar mass ratios with the local objects (∼0.1%), but smaller than those observed at z > 4. We interpret that host galaxies harboring less massive SMBHs at intermediate redshift have already acquired sufficient stellar mass, although high-z galaxies are still in the early stage of galaxy formation relative to those at the intermediate/local Universe.

在这篇论文中，研究人员调查了碳氧白矮星中的结晶驱动对流现象。他们提出了一种混合长度理论的版本，其中自洽地包括了热扩散和成分梯度的影响，并根据局部热量和成分通量提供了对流参数的解决方案。他们的公式能够在低Peclet数时平稳过渡到缓慢的热盐对流状态，在大Peclet数时呈现快速绝热对流状态。该公式还允许热驱动和成分驱动的对流，并能正确考虑在热稳定背景下成分驱动对流的热传输方向。他们使用MESA恒星演化代码计算了不同模型的冷却白矮星在结晶过程中的成分和热通量，并确定了对流状态和对流速度。他们发现，在恒星冷却历史的大部分时间里，对流发生在缓慢的热盐对流状态下。然而，在结晶开始时，成分通量足够大，能够在短时间内驱动快速翻转对流（约10百万年）。他们估计了这两个阶段的对流速度，并讨论了用结晶驱动的涡流解释观测到的白矮星磁场的影响。<br /><br />总结: 白矮星中的结晶驱动对流现象得到了研究。研究人员提出了一种混合长度理论，并使用MESA代码进行了模拟计算。他们发现，在白矮星的冷却历史中，对流主要发生在缓慢的热盐对流状态下，但在结晶开始阶段会出现快速翻转对流。对此，他们估算了对流速度，并探讨了结晶驱动的涡流对观测到的白矮星磁场的影响。 <div>
We investigate crystallization-driven convection in carbon–oxygen white dwarfs. We present a version of the mixing length theory that self-consistently includes the effects of thermal diffusion and composition gradients, and provides solutions for the convective parameters based on the local heat and composition fluxes. Our formulation smoothly transitions between the regimes of fast adiabatic convection at large Peclet number and slow thermohaline convection at low Peclet number. It also allows for both thermally driven and compositionally driven convection, including correctly accounting for the direction of heat transport for compositionally driven convection in a thermally stable background. We use the MESA stellar evolution code to calculate the composition and heat fluxes during crystallization in different models of cooling white dwarfs, and determine the regime of convection and the convective velocity. We find that convection occurs in the regime of slow thermohaline convection during most of the cooling history of the star. However, at the onset of crystallization, the composition flux is large enough to drive fast overturning convection for a short time (∼10 Myr). We estimate the convective velocities in both of these phases and discuss the implications for explaining observed white dwarf magnetic fields with crystallization-driven dynamos.

总结: <br />
本文介绍了脉冲星周围扩展的伽马射线源，即TeV halo的发现和特性。研究指出，这些源的伽马射线是由脉冲星风星云的逃逸电子/正电子与背景辐射场发生逆康普顿散射产生的。目前存在三种不同的粒子输运机制模型，分别是各向同性的、抑制扩散模型；各向同性的、不受抑制扩散模型以及各向异性扩散模型。这三种模型对宇宙射线输运机制和星际磁场的性质有着不同的影响。研究还计算了这些模型下脉冲星halo的X射线发射，发现这些逃逸电子/正电子的同步辐射可以产生相应的X射线halo，并且在三种模型下预期的表面亮度轮廓有所不同。由此可见，敏感的X射线探测器对于理解脉冲星halo的形成机制至关重要，也可以作为星际湍流性质的探测器。 <div>
Pulsar halos (also termed “TeV halos”) are a new class of γ-ray sources in the Galaxy, which manifest as extended γ-ray emission around middle-aged pulsars, as discovered around the Geminga pulsar, the Monogem pulsar, and PSR J0622+3749 by the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov Observatory and the Large High-Altitude Air Shower Observatory. A consensus has been reached that the teraelectronvolt emission comes from the inverse Compton scattering of escaping electrons/positrons from the pulsar wind nebula of the soft background radiation field, while the particle transport mechanism in the halo is still in dispute. Currently, there are mainly three interpretations: the isotropic, suppressed diffusion model; the isotropic, unsuppressed diffusion model that considers the ballistic propagation of newly injected particles; and the anisotropic diffusion model. While the predicted γ-ray surface brightness profiles of all three models can be more or less consistent with the observations, the implications of the three models for cosmic-ray transport mechanisms and the properties of the interstellar magnetic field are quite different. In this study, we calculate the anticipated X-ray emission of pulsar halos under the three models. We show that the synchrotron radiation of these escaping electrons/positrons can produce a corresponding X-ray halo around the pulsar and that the expected surface brightness profiles are distinct in the three models. We suggest that sensitive X-ray detectors of a large field of view (such as eROSITA and the Einstein Probe) with a reasonably long exposure time are crucial to understanding the formation mechanism of pulsar halos and can serve as a probe of the properties of interstellar turbulence.

<div> 关键词: WRLOF, 星际二进制, MESA, 观测数据, 质量转移
总结:
WRLOF是一种质量转移机制，通过在MESA中进行参数研究，发现在大多数模型中，接受者被加速到临界旋转速率。然后假设恒星发展了增强的风，以有效减少角动量，从而保持亚临界旋转。质量转移效率明显低于忽略接受者旋转的先前研究。研究结果与M67中蓝色窥视者的观测资料相比，表明WRLOF机制能够定性解释它们快速旋转的起源、在H-R图上的位置以及它们的轨道周期。 <br /><br /> <div>
Wind Roche-lobe overflow (WRLOF) is a mass-transfer mechanism proposed by Mohamed and Podsiadlowski for stellar binaries wherein the wind acceleration zone of the donor star exceeds its Roche-lobe radius, allowing stellar wind material to be transferred to the accretor at enhanced rates. WRLOF may explain characteristics observed in blue lurkers and blue stragglers. While WRLOF has been implemented in rapid population synthesis codes, it has yet to be explored thoroughly in detailed binary models such as MESA (a 1D stellar evolution code), and over a wide range of initial binary configurations. We incorporate WRLOF accretion in MESA to investigate wide low-mass binaries at solar metallicity. We perform a parameter study over the initial orbital periods and stellar masses. In most of the models where we consider angular momentum transfer during accretion, the accretor is spun up to the critical (or breakup) rotation rate. Then we assume the star develops a boosted wind to efficiently reduce the angular momentum so that it could maintain subcritical rotation. Balanced by boosted wind loss, the accretor only gains ∼2% of its total mass, but can maintain a near-critical rotation rate during WRLOF. Notably, the mass-transfer efficiency is significantly smaller than in previous studies in which the rotation of the accretor is ignored. We compare our results to observational data of blue lurkers in M67 and find that the WRLOF mechanism can qualitatively explain the origin of their rapid rotation, their location on the H-R diagram, and their orbital periods.

We explore the evolution of massive stars (>8 M⊙) with 1D models and present analytical fits to the masses and binding energies of the convective portions of their envelopes. These fits are given as functions of total mass, metallicity, and surface temperature (used as a proxy for evolutionary phase). They enable the application of the two-stage common envelope (CE) formalism in rapid binary population synthesis frameworks. We estimate that the degree of orbital hardening following CE ejection spans 6 orders of magnitude and is a very strong function of the accretor mass, and, to a lesser extent, donor evolutionary phase.

Hydrogen chloride (HCl) is a key repository of chlorine in the interstellar medium. Accurate determinations of its abundance are critical to assessing the chlorine elemental abundance and constraining stellar nucleosynthesis models. To aid in modeling recent and future observations of HCl rovibrational spectra, we present cross sections and rate coefficients for collisions between HCl and molecular hydrogen. Transitions between rovibrational states of HCl are considered for temperatures ranging from 10 to 3000 K. Cross sections are computed using a full dimensional quantum close-coupling (CC) method and a reduced dimensionality coupled-states (CS) approach. The CS results, benchmarked against the CC results, are used with a recoupling approach to calculate hyperfine-resolved rate coefficients for rovibrational transitions of HCl induced by H2. The rate coefficients will allow for a better determination of the HCl abundance in the interstellar medium and an improved understanding of interstellar chlorine chemistry. We demonstrate the utility of the new rate coefficients in a nonthermodynamic equilibrium radiative transfer model applied to observations of HCl rovibrational transitions in a circumstellar shell.

The Cygnus region, which contains massive molecular and atomic clouds and young stars, is a promising Galactic neutrino source candidate. Cosmic-ray transport in the region can produce neutrinos and γ-rays. Recently, the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) detected an ultrahigh-energy γ-ray bubble (Cygnus Bubble) in this region. Using publicly available track events detected by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory in 7 yr of full detector operation, we conduct searches for correlated neutrino signals from the Cygnus Bubble with neutrino emission templates based on LHAASO γ-ray observations. No significant signals were found for any employed templates. With the 7 TeV γ-ray flux template, we set a flux upper limit of 90% confidence level for the neutrino emission from the Cygnus Bubble to be 5.7 × 10−13 TeV−1 cm−2 s−1 at 5 TeV.

在这篇文章中，研究人员报告了他们在深度JWST NIRCam成像中偶然发现的低质量星系Ark 227（M* = 5 × 109M⊙；d = 35 Mpc）周围的星际晕。通过组合大半径处的解析恒星与NIRCam和Dragonfly成像处的弥散辐射，研究人员能够跟踪该星系的表面亮度和颜色分布，并观察到超过预测暗物质晕的整个范围，从0.1到100 kpc。他们观察到在10-20 kpc处有一个特征，模拟显示这可能是由质量比为1:10的次要合并引起的。金属丰度在这个径向范围内下降，进一步支持了次要合并的情况。此外，在50到100 kpc处还有第二个出现迹象，伴随着金属丰度的下降。最外层包层中的恒星质量约为107M⊙。这些结果表明Ark 227经历了多次与低质量星系的合并，与冷暗物质主导宇宙结构的分级生长的情况大致一致。最后，他们还发现了一个与Ark 227相关的超微暗星系，证明JWST能够探测到至少距离约30 Mpc的极低质量矮星系。<br /><br />总结: 这篇文章报道了利用JWST NIRCam成像发现的低质量星系Ark 227周围的星际晕，以及这些观察结果对暗物质和星系合并的重要意义。 <div>
We report the serendipitous discovery of an extended stellar halo surrounding the low-mass galaxy Ark 227 (M* = 5 × 109M⊙; d = 35 Mpc) in deep JWST NIRCam imaging from the Blue Jay Survey. The F200W–F444W color provides robust star–galaxy separation, enabling the identification of stars at very low density. By combining resolved stars at large galactocentric distances with diffuse emission from NIRCam and Dragonfly imaging at smaller distances, we trace the surface-brightness and color profiles of this galaxy over the entire extent of its predicted dark matter halo, from 0.1 to 100 kpc. Controlled N-body simulations have predicted that minor mergers create “accretion shelves” in the surface-brightness profile at large radius. We observe such a feature in Ark 227 at 10–20 kpc, which, according to models, could be caused by a merger with total mass ratio 1:10. The metallicity declines over this radial range, further supporting the minor merger scenario. There is tentative evidence of a second shelf at μV ≈ 35 mag arcsec−2 extending from 50 to 100 kpc, along with a corresponding drop in metallicity. The stellar mass in this outermost envelope is ≈107M⊙. These results suggest that Ark 227 experienced multiple mergers with a spectrum of lower-mass galaxies—a scenario that is broadly consistent with the hierarchical growth of structure in a cold-dark-matter-dominated universe. Finally, we identify an ultra-faint dwarf associated with Ark 227 with M* ≈ 105M⊙ and μV,e = 28.1 mag arcsec−2, demonstrating that JWST is capable of detecting very-low-mass dwarfs to distances of at least ∼30 Mpc.

通过全光谱拟合技术推断了NGC 2865、NGC 3818和NGC 4915三个早型星系的年龄、中心速度色散和相对于Fe的C、N、O、Mg、Si、Ca、Ti、Cr、Mn、Co、Ni、Cu、Sr、Ba和Eu的丰度比。这三个星系都有光学上的干扰结构，与1、7和6亿年前发生的重大并合事件有关。NGC 3818和NGC 4915显示出与没有细微结构的ETG相似的化学特征，与气体贫的椭圆星系的并合一致。而NGC 2865的钙、铬和锰的丰度比明显较高，简单的富气体并合情景无法解释这种差异。这三个具有细微结构的ETG展示了各种丰度，表明ETG具有细微结构可以通过多种途径和类型的星系并合形成。<br /><br />总结: 本研究使用全光谱拟合技术对NGC 2865、NGC 3818和NGC 4915三个早型星系进行了研究，发现它们的化学特征和丰度显示出不同的模式，暗示着ETG可以通过多种途径和类型的星系并合形成。 <div>
Our understanding of early-type galaxies (ETGs) has grown in the past decade with the advance of full-spectrum fitting techniques used to infer the properties of the stellar populations that make up the galaxy. We present ages, central velocity dispersions, and abundance ratios relative to Fe of C, N, O, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Sr, Ba, and Eu, derived using full-spectrum fitting techniques for three ETGs, NGC 2865, NGC 3818, and NGC 4915. Each of these three galaxies were selected because they have optical, disturbed structures (fine structure) that are linked to major merger events that occurred 1, 7, and 6 Gyr ago, respectively. Two of the ETGs, NGC 3818 and NGC 4915, show chemical signatures similar to ETGs without fine structure, which is consistent with a gas-poor merger of elliptical galaxies in which substantial star formation is not expected. For NGC 2865, we find a statistically higher abundance of Ca (an α element) and Cr and Mn (Fe-peak elements). We show that for NGC 2865, a simple gas-rich merger scenario fails to explain the larger abundance ratios compared to ETGs without fine structure. These three ETGs with fine structure exhibit a range of abundances, suggesting ETGs with fine structure can form via multiple pathways and types of galaxy mergers.

We report Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array/Atacama Compact Array observations of a high-density region of the Corona Australis cloud forming a young star cluster, and the results of resolving internal structures. In addition to embedded Class 0/I protostars in the continuum, a number of complex dense filamentary structures are detected in the C18O and SO lines by the 7 m array. These are substructures of the molecular clump that are detected by the total power array as extended emission. We identify 101 and 37 filamentary structures with widths of a few thousand astronomical units in C18O and SO, respectively, which are called feathers. The typical column density of the feathers in C18O is about 1022 cm−2, and the volume density and line mass are ∼105 cm−3 and a few M☉ pc−1, respectively. This line mass is significantly smaller than the critical line mass expected for cold and dense gas. These structures have complex velocity fields, indicating a turbulent interior. The number of feathers associated with Class 0/I protostars is only ∼10, indicating that most of them do not form stars but rather are transient structures. The formation of feathers can be interpreted as a result of colliding gas flow because the morphology is well reproduced by MHD simulations, and this is supported by the presence of H i shells in the vicinity. The colliding gas flows may accumulate gas and form filaments and feathers, and trigger the active star formation of the R CrA cluster.

这篇文章介绍了利用分光偏振技术研究活动星系核（AGNs）中心区域的方法和结果。研究发现，通过偏振测量可以探索磁场结构、演变和喷流中的粒子加速物理。对PKS 0637–75和PKS 1510–089进行了分光偏振研究，发现了连续光偏振的变化，其中PKS 0637–75的平均水平为2.5%，PKS 1510–089的平均水平为7.5%。在广谱线和连续谱中观察到了偏振变化，但广谱线的偏振水平较低。研究结果还确认了光谱能量分布模拟的结论，即PKS 0637–75的光偏振主要受吸积盘辐射影响，而PKS 1510–089的光偏振既受吸积盘辐射影响，又受喷流辐射影响，在瞬变状态下喷流贡献更大。
<br /><br />总结: <br />分光偏振技术用于研究AGNs中心区域；PKS 0637–75和PKS 1510–089的光偏振显示出连续光偏振变化；广谱线的光偏振较低，但结果证实了光谱能量分布模拟的结论。 <div>
Spectropolarimetry is a powerful tool to investigate the central regions of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) as polarization signatures are key to probing magnetic field structure, evolution, and the physics of particle acceleration in jets. Optical linear polarization of blazars is typically greater than a few percent, indicating the emission is dominated by nonthermal synchrotron radiation, while polarization less than a few percent is common for other type 1 AGNs. We present a spectropolarimetric study of PKS 0637–75 and PKS 1510–089 to determine how the head-on orientation of a jet and dominant emission processes influence polarimetric variations in the broad lines and continuum. Observations were obtained biweekly from the Robert Stobie Spectrograph on the Southern African Large Telescope. Variability in the continuum polarization is detected for both PKS 0637–75 and PKS 1510–089, with a total average level of 2.5% ± 0.1% and 7.5% ± 0.1%, respectively. There is no clear polarization in the broad Balmer emission lines and weak polarization in Mg ii as the average level across all observations is 0.2% ± 0.1% for Hβ, 0.2% ± 0.3% for Hγ, and 0.6% ± 0.2% for Mg ii. We find that polarization measurements confirm the conclusions drawn from spectral energy distribution modeling of the disk–jet contributions to the emission as optical polarization and time variability for PKS 0637–75 are shown to be dominated by accretion disk emission while those of PKS 1510–089 are due to both disk and jet emission, with greater jet contribution during flaring states.

在这项研究中，使用谐波密度泛函理论计算，系统研究了具有边缘缺陷的多环芳烃（PAHs）的光谱特性。通过与JWST早期释放科学PDRs4All计划的Orion Bar的NIRSpec和MIRI-MRS光谱进行直接比较，评估了它们在天文学上的相关性。研究发现，具有边缘缺陷的PAHs能够很好地再现天文学上的6.2μm PAH发射带，包括其蓝色边，计算中考虑了偏振效应，而无需含氮的PAHs。具有边缘缺陷的小型中性PAHs解释了3.3μm带的蓝翼。在再现8.6和11.2μm带轮廓时需要较少数量的边缘缺陷，而11.0 + 11.2/12.7μm带强度比是边缘缺陷数量的一种衡量。对Orion Bar光谱的盲数据库拟合将6-15μm区域的误差控制在9.9％，并清晰地显示了电荷的轮廓，其中6-10μm PAH带由PAH阳离子携带，而10-15μm区域主要由中性PAHs携带。阴离子的贡献可以忽略不计。扶手椅状PAHs适合12.7μm带，同时产生了一个非常微弱的以3.225μm为中心的宽发射特征。锯齿状PAHs适合11.2μm带。研究得出结论，具有较少边缘缺陷的PAHs，以及扶手椅状和锯齿状PAHs，都对观测到的星际红外发射有贡献。 <br /><br />总结: 该研究通过密度泛函理论计算和天文观测数据对多环芳烃（PAHs）的光谱特性进行了系统研究，并发现具有边缘缺陷的PAHs能够很好地再现天文学上观测到的发射光谱特征。另外，研究还发现PAHs的电荷分布与红外发射波段有明显的相关性，且不同形式的PAHs对不同的红外波段有不同的贡献。 <div>
A systematic study was performed on the spectral properties of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with edge defects using harmonic density functional theory calculations. Their potential astronomical relevance was assessed through direct comparison with NIRSpec and MIRI-MRS spectra of the atomic photodissociation region of the Orion Bar from the JWST Early Release Science PDRs4All program. It is found that the astronomical 6.2 μm PAH emission band, including its blue side, is well reproduced by PAHs with edge defects, when taking into account the effects of polarization in the computations, and without a need for PAHs that contain nitrogen. Small neutral PAHs with edge defects explain the blue wing of the 3.3 μm band. A low number of edge defects is required to reproduce the 8.6 and 11.2 μm band profiles, while the 11.0 + 11.2/12.7 μm band intensity ratio is a measure for the number of edge defects. A blind database fit to the Orion Bar spectrum reproduces the 6–15 μm region with an error of 9.9% and shows a clear delineation of charge, with the 6–10 μm PAH bands being carried by PAH cations and the 10–15 μm region by predominantly neutral PAHs. The contribution of anions is negligible. Armchair PAHs fit the 12.7 μm band, simultaneously producing a very weak broad emission feature centered at 3.225 μm. Zigzag PAHs fit the 11.2 μm band. It is concluded that PAHs with a low number of edge defects, in addition to armchair and zigzag PAHs, all contribute to the observed interstellar infrared emission.

We present an atmospheric retrieval analysis of Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Camera 3/G141 spectroscopic phase curve observations of two brown dwarfs, WD-0137B and EPIC-2122B, in ultrashort period orbits around white dwarf hosts. These systems are analogous to hot and ultra-hot Jupiter systems, enabling a unique and high-precision comparison to exoplanet systems. We use the PHOENIX Exoplanet Retrieval Algorithm retrieval suite to test various analysis setups, including joint-phase retrievals, multiple temperature structures, and nonuniform abundances. We find that WD-0137B has a dayside that closely resembles that of other ultra-hot Jupiters with inverted temperature structures and H− opacity, but quickly transitions to a mostly noninverted temperature structure on the nightside. Meanwhile, EPIC-2122B’s atmosphere remains inverted at all constrained longitudes, with dominant H− opacity. Retrievals with multiple temperature profiles and nonuniform vertical abundances were generally not statistically justified for this data set, but retrievals with dayside-dilution factors were found to be justified. Retrieving all phases simultaneously with a linear combination of a dayside and nightside atmosphere was found to be an adequate representation of the entire phase curve once a longitudinal temperature gradient free parameter was included in the retrieval. Comparing to global circulation models, we attribute behavior in the 1D retrievals to the inclined viewing geometry of the systems, which results in always-visible irradiated and inverted portions of the atmosphere contaminating spectra measured from the nightside hemisphere. This study sheds light on the similarities between these irradiated brown dwarf systems and hot and ultra-hot Jupiters, but also their unique differences, including the influence of the inclined viewing geometry.

<br /><br />总结: 本研究利用大约9000个核方程态，通过线性广义相对论形式主义研究了中子星内部的准正常f-模振荡。我们发现f-模频率与核饱和性质之间存在一定的关联，但需要更复杂的方法来揭示多参数关系。在PSR J0740+6620和PSR J0030+0451观测数据上，我们发现NICER数据与部分和最小重叠的核子-夸克混合方程态模型的半径和频率值相吻合，这表明需要考虑超饱和密度下的异质子。未来观测可以进一步验证核子-夸克混合方程态或提供对其的明确证据。 <div>
We study quasi-normal f-mode oscillations in neutron star (NS) interiors within a linearized general relativistic formalism. We utilize approximately 9000 nuclear equations of state (EOSs) using spectral representation techniques, incorporating constraints on nuclear saturation properties, chiral effective field theory for pure neutron matter, and perturbative quantum chromodynamics for densities pertinent to NS cores. The median values of the f-mode frequency, νf (damping time, τf) for NSs with masses ranging from 1.4 to 2.0 M⊙ lie between 1.80 and 2.20 kHz (0.13–0.22 s) for our entire EOS set. Our study reveals a weak correlation between f-mode frequencies and individual nuclear saturation properties, prompting the necessity for more intricate methodologies to unveil multiparameter relationships. We observe a robust linear relationship between the radii and f-mode frequencies for different NS masses. Leveraging this correlation alongside NICER observations of PSR J0740+6620 and PSR J0030+0451, we establish constraints that exhibit partial and minimal overlap for observational data from Riley et al. and Miller et al., respectively, with our nucleonic EOS data set. Moreover, NICER data align closely with the radius and frequency values for a few hadron–quark hybrid EOS models. This indicates the need to consider additional exotic particles such as deconfined quarks at suprasaturation densities. We conclude that future observations of the radius or f-mode frequency for more than one NS mass, particularly at the extremes of the viable NS mass scale, would either rule out nucleon-only EOSs or provide definitive evidence in its favor.

Large-scale coronal plasma evolutions can be adequately described by magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations. However, full multidimensional MHD simulations require substantial computational resources. Given the low plasma β in the solar corona, in many coronal studies, it suffices to approximate the magnetic field to remain topologically fixed and effectively conduct one-dimensional (1D) hydrodynamic (HD) simulations instead. This approach is often employed in studies of coronal loops and their liability to form condensations related to thermal instability. While 1D HD simulations along given and fixed field line shapes are convenient and fast, they are difficult to directly compare with multidimensional phenomena. Therefore, it is more convenient to solve volume-filling, multidimensional versions of the MHD equations where we freeze the magnetic field, transforming it into frozen-field HD (ffHD) equations for simulation. We have incorporated this ffHD module into our open-source MPI-AMRVAC code and tested it using a two-dimensional (2D) evaporation–condensation model to study prominence formation due to radiative losses. The 2D ffHD results are compared with those from actual 2D MHD and pseudo-2D HD simulations, analyzing the differences and their causes. Pseudo-2D studies account for the known flux tube expansion effects. Overall, the performance of 2D ffHD is close to that of 2D MHD and pseudo-2D HD. The 2D tests conducted in this paper will be extended in follow-up studies to 3D simulations based on analytical or observational approaches.

Recent astrophysical models predict that stellar-mass binary black holes (BBHs) could form and coalesce within a few gravitational radii of a supermassive black hole (SMBH). Detecting the gravitational waves (GWs) from such systems requires numerical tools that can track the dynamics of the binaries while capturing all the essential relativistic effects. This work develops upon our earlier study of a BBH moving along a circular orbit in the equatorial plane of a Kerr SMBH. Here we modify the numerical method to simulate a BBH falling toward the SMBH along a parabolic orbit of arbitrary inclination with respect to the equator. By tracking the evolution in a frame freely falling alongside the binary, we find that the eccentricity of the BBH is more easily excited than it is in the previous equatorial case, and that the cause is the asymmetry of the tidal tensor imposed on the binary when the binary moves out of the equatorial plane. Since the eccentricity reaches maximum around the same time as the BBH becomes the closest to the SMBH, multiband GW bursts could be produced that are simultaneously detectable by space- and ground-based detectors. We show that the effective spin parameters of such GW events also undergo significant variation due to the rapid reorientation of the inner BBHs during their interaction with SMBHs. These results demonstrate the richness of three-body dynamics in the region of strong gravity, and highlight the necessity of building new numerical tools to simulate such systems.

<br /><br />总结:
这篇文章讨论了在明亮状态与暗淡状态之间发生转变的活动星系核（AGN）中观察到的强软X射线辐射。研究通过三维辐射磁流体模拟成功地复现了黑洞周围的热辐射低效涡流外的温暖、汤姆逊光厚区域。研究表明，这一区域是由于反康普顿散射导致的有效辐射冷却形成的，并且得出与CLAGN的亮度一致的计算亮度0.01-0.08个Eddington亮度。同时还发现，这个温暖的康普顿化区域很好地符合由方位磁场支撑的磁化盘的稳态模型。当支撑辐射冷却区域的反平行方位磁场在盘的赤道平面周围重新连接时，该区域的温度会因释放到该区域的磁能而升高。 <div>
Strong soft X-ray emission called soft X-ray excess is often observed in luminous active galactic nuclei (AGN). It has been suggested that the soft X-rays are emitted from a warm (T = 106 ∼ 107 K) region that is optically thick for the Thomson scattering (warm Comptonization region). Motivated by the recent observations that soft X-ray excess appears in changing look AGN (CLAGN) during the state transition from a dim state without broad emission lines to a bright state with broad emission lines, we performed global three-dimensional radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations, assuming that the mass accretion rate increases and becomes around 10% of the Eddington accretion rate. The simulation successfully reproduces a warm, Thomson-thick region outside the hot radiatively inefficient accretion flow near the black hole. The warm region is formed by efficient radiative cooling due to inverse Compton scattering. The calculated luminosity 0.01−0.08 LEdd is consistent with the luminosity of CLAGN. We also found that the warm Comptonization region is well described by the steady model of magnetized disks supported by azimuthal magnetic fields. When the antiparallel azimuthal magnetic fields supporting the radiatively cooled region reconnect around the equatorial plane of the disk, the temperature of the region becomes higher by releasing the magnetic energy transported to the region.

<div> 关键词: DESI, fine-structure constant, α variation, galaxy sample, redshift

总结: 本研究利用暗能量光谱仪（DESI）对α精细结构常数的时空变化施加了强约束。利用约110,000个具有强且窄的[O iii] λλ4959, 5007发射线的星系进行测量，发现红移变化水平为(2–3) × 10^(-5)的α变化，但这很有可能是由于波长标定的系统误差引起的。通过改进波长标定和增加星系样本，预期能够获得更好的约束。未发现明显的大尺度结构中的α空间变化。 <br /><br />总结: <div>
We present strong constraints on the spacetime variation of the fine-structure constant α using the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). In this pilot work, we utilize ∼110,000 galaxies with strong and narrow [O iii] λλ4959, 5007 emission lines to measure the relative variation Δα/α in space and time. The [O iii] doublet is arguably the best choice for this purpose owing to its wide wavelength separation between the two lines and its strong emission in many galaxies. Our galaxy sample spans a redshift range of 0 < z < 0.95, covering half of all cosmic time. We divide the sample into subsamples in 10 redshift bins (Δz = 0.1), and calculate Δα/α for the individual subsamples. The uncertainties of the measured Δα/α are roughly between 2 × 10−6 and 2 × 10−5. We find an apparent α variation with redshift at a level of Δα/α = (2–3) × 10−5. This is highly likely to be caused by systematics associated with wavelength calibration, since such small systematics can be caused by a wavelength distortion of 0.002–0.003 Å, which is beyond the accuracy that the current DESI data can achieve. We refine the wavelength calibration using sky lines for a small fraction of the galaxies, but this does not change our main results. We further probe the spatial variation of α in small redshift ranges, and do not find obvious, large-scale structures in the spatial distribution of Δα/α. As DESI is ongoing, we will include more galaxies, and by improving the wavelength calibration, we expect to obtain a better constraint that is comparable to the strongest current constraint.

<div> PSR B2110+27, FAST, 脉冲周期，subpulse drift, nulling事件<br />
<br />总结:<br />研究使用FAST对PSR B2110+27的单脉冲发射进行了仔细的观测，发现了显著的subpulse drift和nulling现象。nulling事件持续时间短，整体nulling比例约为27% ± 3%。另外，subpulses的漂移方向存在突然变化，偶尔转化为稳定状态或显示低漂移率。经纬度解析波动谱分析显示，脉冲星存在两个不同的重复周期P3 = (10.8 ± 2.5)P 和 P3 = (31.6 ± 4.2)P。subpulse分离在不同漂移模式下保持一致，P2 = 2.°3 ± 0.°2。更全面的分析表明，这种独特的漂移行为可以用偶极场的旋转模型来解释。在null状态中观察到漂移带记忆和明显的相位记忆，尽管还未检测到nulling本身的显著周期性，这表明这些现象可能源于频繁出现的别名漂移带与随机的null脉冲相交。 <div>
Careful scrutiny of the single pulse emissions from PSR B2110+27 has been conducted through highly sensitive observations using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) at a central frequency of 1250 MHz. Our investigation revealed significant subpulse drift behavior and nulling in this pulsar. Moreover, we observed that the nulling events tend to be of short duration, with an estimated overall nulling fraction of approximately 27% ± 3%. It is noteworthy that the drift direction of the subpulses exhibits abrupt changes, occasionally transitioning into a steady state or displaying a low drift rate. Analysis using longitude resolved fluctuation spectra indicates the presence of two distinct repetition periods for the pulsar: P3 = (10.8 ± 2.5)P and P3 = (31.6 ± 4.2)P, where P denotes the pulsar period. Our investigation revealed that the subpulse separation remains consistent across different drift patterns, with P2 = 2.°3 ± 0.°2. A more comprehensive analysis indicates that the unique drift behavior observed can be explained by a carousel model of the dipole field. Minor changes in P2 and drift rate caused significant variations in the apparent P3 and abrupt shifts in the drift direction, while the true repetition period (assuming first-order aliasing) changed by only ∼10%. We observe a drift band memory and apparent phase memory across the null state in this pulsar, as well as variations in the drift rate and drift direction across the null state, though we have not detected significant periodicity of the nulling itself. This suggests that these phenomena may arise from random null pulses intersecting with the frequently aliased drift bands.

<title>Large-scale Overdensity of Lyman Break Galaxies around the z = 6.3 Ultraluminous Quasar J0100 + 2802</title>

We study the environment of the z = 6.33 ultraluminous quasar SDSS J010013.02+280225.8 (J0100) to understand its association with large-scale structure. Theoretical models propose high-redshift quasars as markers of galaxy overdensities residing in the most massive dark matter halos (DMHs) in the early Universe. J0100 is an ultraluminous quasar with the most massive black hole known at z ≳ 6, suggesting a high likelihood of residing in a massive DMH. We present wide-field (∼522 arcmin2) imaging in the r, i, and z bands from the Large Binocular Cameras on the Large Binocular Telescope, with Y- and J-band imaging from the Wide-field Infrared Camera on the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope, centered on J0100. Applying color selections, we identify 23 objects as i-dropout Lyman break galaxy (LBG) candidates in the J0100 field. We use the deep photometric catalog in the 1.27 deg2 COSMOS field to calculate the density of LBGs in a blank field, and to estimate the selection completeness and purity. The observed surface density of LBG candidates in the J0100 field corresponds to a galaxy overdensity of δ = 4 (at 8.4σ). This large-scale overdensity suggests that the ∼22 arcmin2 overdensity found by Kashino et al. using JWST data extends out to much larger scales. We calculate the angular autocorrelation function of the candidates and find a positive correlation on ≲10′ scales as well as evidence of asymmetries in their spatial distribution, further suggesting the direct detection of large-scale structure in the field of the ultraluminous quasar J0100.

<title>Finding Candidate TeV Halos among Very-high-energy Sources</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We search for possible pulsar TeV halos among the very-high-energy (VHE) sources reported in different VHE surveys, among which in particular we use the results from the first Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory catalog of γ-ray sources. Six candidates are found. They share similar properties of containing a middle-aged, γ-ray–bright pulsar in their positional error circles (the respective pulsars are J0248+6021, J0359+5414, J0622+3749, J0633+0632, J2006+3102, and J2238+5903), being in a rather clean field without any common Galactic VHE-emitting supernova remnants or (bright) pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe), and showing an absence of any γ-ray emissions in 0.1–500 GeV after removing the pulsars’ emissions. Combining these candidates with several reported (candidate) TeV halos, we obtain relationships between their luminosity at 50 TeV (L50TeV) and the corresponding pulsars’ spin-down energy ( ), which are and , respectively. The relationships are nearly identical to previously reported ones. We probe possible connections between the extent/sizes of the VHE sources and the pulsars’ ages, and find a weak older-and-smaller trend. By comparing to the VHE detection results for PWNe, it is clear that the (candidate) TeV halos have hard emissions by either having power-law indices smaller than 2 in 1–25 TeV or by only being detected in 25–100 TeV. In addition, we also consider seven other VHE sources as possible TeV halos based on the results from different studies of them, but they do not fit cleanly with the properties listed above, indicating their potentially complex nature.

总结: 本研究通过CosmoRun套件模拟了一个银河系质量星系的演化至红移z = 2以下的过程，并与同样的八个暗物质模拟进行了比较。研究了星系在z = 4和3时的一般性质以及最后一次主要并合之前的演化过程，重点关注了旋转支持的盘的形成、质量-金属丰度关系、特定星形成速率、气体的金属丰度梯度以及恒星盘中的非轴对称结构。研究发现，大多数模拟代码在低红移时期都发展出了旋转支持的结构，大多数模拟结果在高和中红移都与观测结果符合较好，并且复现了来自解析模型和低红移观测得到的气体金属丰度梯度。研究还发现模拟代码之间的差异主要是由于控制重力求解器时间步进策略的代码相关参数的变化导致的，早期恒星反馈的变化也会导致低红移并合的时间差异。所有至z = 2的模拟数据和辅助数据将被公开发布。 <br /><br />总结: 本研究通过模拟了一个银河系质量星系的演化至红移z = 2以下的过程，并与同样的八个暗物质模拟进行了比较。研究了星系在z = 4和3时的一般性质以及最后一次主要并合之前的演化过程，重点关注了旋转支持的盘的形成、质量-金属丰度关系、特定星形成速率、气体的金属丰度梯度以及恒星盘中的非轴对称结构。研究发现，大多数模拟代码在低红移时期都发展出了旋转支持的结构，大多数模拟结果在高和中红移都与观测结果符合较好，并且复现了来自解析模型和低红移观测得到的气体金属丰度梯度。 <div>
In this fourth paper from the AGORA Collaboration, we study the evolution down to redshift z = 2 and below of a set of cosmological zoom-in simulations of a Milky Way mass galaxy by eight of the leading hydrodynamic simulation codes. We also compare this CosmoRun suite of simulations with dark matter-only simulations by the same eight codes. We analyze general properties of the halo and galaxy at z = 4 and 3, and before the last major merger, focusing on the formation of well-defined rotationally supported disks, the mass–metallicity relation, the specific star formation rate, the gas metallicity gradients, and the nonaxisymmetric structures in the stellar disks. Codes generally converge well to the stellar-to-halo mass ratios predicted by semianalytic models at z ∼ 2. We see that almost all the hydro codes develop rotationally supported structures at low redshifts. Most agree within 0.5 dex with the observed mass–metallicity relation at high and intermediate redshifts, and reproduce the gas metallicity gradients obtained from analytical models and low-redshift observations. We confirm that the intercode differences in the halo assembly history reported in the first paper of the collaboration also exist in CosmoRun, making the code-to-code comparison more difficult. We show that such differences are mainly due to variations in code-dependent parameters that control the time stepping strategy of the gravity solver. We find that variations in the early stellar feedback can also result in differences in the timing of the low-redshift mergers. All the simulation data down to z = 2 and the auxiliary data will be made publicly available.

总结:
在这项研究中，我们使用了基于高斯和伽马函数混合的模型来拟合具有不同组成部分的SFH。我们的主要目标是利用这个模型来揭示SFH的形状及相应的物理驱动因素。具体来说，我们将这个模型应用于TNG100-1模拟中的星系星形成历史。我们的研究得出了以下发现。首先，我们的模型很好地拟合了TNG星系星形成历史，特别是对于高质量和红色星系；其次，拟合组件的数量和形状与星系的质量和颜色之间存在明显的关系，尤其是中心/孤立星系和卫星星系之间的差异明显；最后，我们的模型使我们能够轻松提取星形成历史中的不同星形成时期并分析每个星形成时期的持续时间和时机。我们的发现表明，每个星形成时期的时机与星系质量和颜色之间存在着密切的关系。 <div>
The star formation history (SFH) is a key issue in the evolution of galaxies. In this work, we developed a model based on a Gaussian and gamma function mixture to fit SFHs with varying numbers of components. Our primary objective was to use this model to reveal the shape of SFHs and the corresponding physical driving factors. Specifically, we applied this model to fit SFHs from the TNG100-1 simulation. Our study led to the following findings. (1) Our model fits with TNG star formation histories well, especially for high-mass and red galaxies; (2) a clear relationship exists between the number and shape of fitted components and the mass and color of galaxies, with notable differences observed between central/isolated and satellite galaxies. (3) Our model allows us to extract different episodes of star formation within star formation histories with ease and analyze the duration and timing of each star formation episode. Our findings indicate a strong relationship between the timing of each star formation episode and galaxy mass and color.

总结:
太阳风暴常常引发不同形态的日冕物质抛射，包括喷射状、气泡状和双重日冕物质抛射。本研究利用太阳动力学观测卫星和太阳地球关系观测卫星的高时空分辨率立体观测数据，在2010年10月至2012年12月期间对太阳喷射相关的日冕物质抛射进行了统计研究。结果显示，日冕物质抛射的形态可能与丝状结构的长度和磁重连相关，而且大多发生在扇-脊磁场拓扑结构中。这一研究为解析日冕物质抛射形态与太阳活动物理机制之间的关联提供了重要线索。<br /><br /> <div>
A solar jet can often cause coronal mass ejections (CMEs) with different morphologies in the high corona, for example, jet-like CMEs, bubble-like CMEs, and so-called twin CMEs that include a pair of simultaneous jet-like and bubble-like CMEs. However, what determines the morphology of a jet-related CME is still an open question. Using high spatiotemporal resolution stereoscopic observations taken by the Solar Dynamics Observatory and the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory from 2010 October to 2012 December, we performed a statistical study of jet-related CMEs to study the potential physical factors that determine the morphology of CMEs in the outer corona. Our statistical sample includes 16 jet-related CME events of which seven are twin CME events and nine are jet-like narrow CMEs. We find that all CMEs in our sample were accompanied by filament-driven blowout jets and Type III radio bursts during their initial formation and involved magnetic reconnection between filament channels and the surrounding magnetic fields. Most of our cases occurred in a fan-spine magnetic configuration. Our study suggests that the bubble-like components of twin CMEs lacking an obvious core are related to the expansion of the closed-loop systems next to the fan-spine topology, while the jet-like component is from the coronal extension of the jet plasma along open fields. Based on the statistical results, we conclude that the morphology of jet-related CMEs in the high corona may be related to the filament length and the initial magnetic null point height of the fan-spine structures.

总结: 
本研究旨在解析无线电安静活动星系核（RQ AGNs）发射的无线电波的起源，发现其中一种潜在来源是AGN盘风与星际介质（ISM）的冲击相互作用。研究中构建了一个球形、一区域和自相似扩展模型，用于模拟紫外快流（UFOs）与ISM之间的冲击结构。通过解决输运方程，考虑扩散冲击加速作为加速机制和同步辐射以及反Compton冷却作为冷却机制，计算了非热电子的能量密度分布。根据所得的非热电子能量分布，建立了冲击ISM的无线电同步辐射光谱模型。通过X射线观测和测量的UFO速度，研究了15个附近的RQ AGNs的观测无线电光谱所需的冲击ISM参数。其中11个RQ AGNs的无线电光谱可以通过AGN盘风模型解释，这是冲击相互作用可能是它们无线电发射源的有力指示。预测的典型源尺寸和磁场强度分别为几百pc和0.1 mG。此外，还讨论了我们的预测是否可以通过未来的无线电观测来验证。 <br /> <br />总结: <div>
Unraveling the origins of radio emissions from radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (RQ AGNs) remains a pivotal challenge in astrophysics. One potential source of this radiation is the shock interaction between AGN disk winds and the interstellar medium (ISM). To understand this phenomenon, we construct a spherical, one-zone, and self-similar expansion model of shock structure between ultrafast outflows (UFOs) and the ISM. We then calculate the energy density distribution of nonthermal electrons by solving the transport equation, considering diffusive shock acceleration as the acceleration mechanism and synchrotron and inverse Compton cooling as the cooling mechanisms. Based on the derived energy distribution of nonthermal electrons, we model the radio synchrotron spectrum of the shocked ISM. For the 15 nearby RQ AGNs hosting UFOs, we investigate the shocked ISM parameters required to model their observed radio spectra based on X-ray observations and measured UFO velocities. Radio spectra of 11 out of 15 nearby RQ AGNs would be explained by the AGN disk wind model. This is a compelling indication that shock interactions between AGN disk winds and the ISM could indeed be the source of their radio emissions. The typical predicted source size and magnetic field strength are several 100 pc and 0.1 mG, respectively. We also discuss whether our prediction can be tested by future radio observations.

总结:
太阳表面磁场的观测通常局限于地球和太阳之间的直线。作者使用STEREO观测的He ii 304 Å强度图像推断远侧活动区域的出现时间、位置和总未签名磁通量，并开发了自动检测算法将这些数据合并到AFT模型中。该研究发现，在不包含远侧数据的SFT模型中，Solar Cycle 24的最大期间缺少了4-6 × 1022 Mx的磁通量。He ii 304 Å数据可以改进表面通量模型，但需要注意减少耀斑事件引起的强度激增。研究还发现，仅使用He ii 304 Å数据无法完整呈现完整的磁场图像，需要直接的磁场观测数据。 <div>
Observations of the Sun’s photospheric magnetic field are often confined to the Sun–Earth line. Surface flux transport (SFT) models, such as the Advective Flux Transport (AFT) model, simulate the evolution of the photospheric magnetic field to produce magnetic maps over the entire surface of the Sun. While these models are able to evolve active regions that transit the near side of the Sun, new far-side side flux emergence is typically neglected. We demonstrate a new method for creating improved maps of the magnetic field over the Sun’s entire photosphere using data obtained by the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) mission. STEREO He ii 304 Å intensity images are used to infer the time, location, and total unsigned magnetic flux of far-side active regions. We have developed an automatic detection algorithm for finding and ingesting new far-side active region emergence into the AFT model. We conduct a series of simulations to investigate the impact of including active region emergence in AFT, both with and without data assimilation of magnetograms. We find that while He ii 304 Å can be used to improve surface flux models, care must taken to mitigate intensity surges from flaring events. We estimate that during Solar Cycle 24's maximum (2011–2015), 4–6 × 1022 Mx of flux is missing from SFT models that do not include far-side data. We find that while He ii 304 Å data alone can be used to create synchronic maps of photospheric magnetic field that resemble the observations, it is insufficient to produce a complete picture without direct magnetic observations from magnetographs.

<div> cosmological simulations, interstellar dust, reionization era, observational constraints, stellar feedback
总结：<br /><br />这篇文章使用宇宙学仿真模拟了再电离时代星系内的星际尘埃含量，并进行了观测数据的比较。研究发现，在模型参数方面存在无法同时满足观测约束的问题。具体来说，预测在z=5时含有较大星尘质量D/Z≳0.1的模型，由于假设了较高的产生产额和/或星际介质中的高效增长，与总星尘质量和红外光度的约束相符，但这些模型导致了紫外光的过度衰减，无法匹配βUV的观测。为了调查这一差异，研究分析了通过红外和紫外辐射探测的星星和尘埃的相对空间分布，发现与现有数据相比存在过度对称的形态，这很可能是由于模拟中使用的恒星反馈模型的局限性所致。因此，研究结果表明高红移星系中尘埃分布的可观测特性是检验恒星反馈的一个特别严格的测试。 <div>
We model the interstellar dust content of the reionization era with a suite of cosmological, fluid-dynamical simulations of galaxies with stellar masses ranging from ∼105 to 109M⊙ in the first 1.2 Gyr of the Universe. We use a post-processing method that accounts for dust creation and destruction processes, allowing us to systematically vary the parameters of these processes to test whether dust-dependent observable quantities of galaxies at these epochs could be useful for placing constraints on dust physics. We then forward model observable properties of these galaxies to compare to existing data. We find that we are unable to simultaneously match existing observational constraints with any one set of model parameters. Specifically, the models that predict the largest dust masses D/Z ≳ 0.1 at z = 5—because of high assumed production yields and/or efficient growth via accretion in the interstellar medium—are preferred by constraints on total dust mass and infrared (IR) luminosities, but these models produce far too much attenuation in the ultraviolet (UV), preventing them from matching observations of βUV. To investigate this discrepancy, we analyze the relative spatial distribution of stars and dust as probed by IR and UV emission, which appear to exhibit overly symmetric morphologies compared to existing data, likely due to the limitations of the stellar feedback model used in the simulations. Our results indicate that the observable properties of the dust distribution in high redshift galaxies are a particularly strong test of stellar feedback.

Observational evidence is accumulating that turbulence in the solar wind is intermittent (non-Gaussian) because of the strong presence of a quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D), low-frequency turbulence component containing nonpropagating, closed, small-scale magnetic flux ropes with open meandering field lines in between. le Roux & Zank showed how one can derive fractional focused and Parker-type transport equations that model large-scale anomalous transport in the solar wind as the outcome of energetic particle interaction with quasi-2D turbulence. In this follow-up paper this theory is developed further to address certain limitations. (i) The second moment of the Lévy probability distribution function (PDF) specified in the theory for the particle step size is infinite, indicating unphysical transport. (ii) The expected transition of energetic particle transport from anomalous to normal diffusion beyond a certain critical transport distance was not included. (iii) The competition between anomalous diffusion and advection is not properly sustained at late times. Shortcomings (i) and (ii) are addressed by introducing an exponentially truncated Lévy PDF for the energetic particle step size in the theory, resulting in revised tempered fractional focused and Parker-type transport equations featuring tempered fractional derivatives that enable modeling of tempered Lévy flights. Furthermore, these equations are cast in a tempered fractional telegrapher form to investigate whether the fractional wave equation part of the equation can restore causality in unscattered particle transport during early times and in Lévy flights during intermediate times (Lévy walks). They are also transformed into a tempered fractional Fokker–Planck form to overcome limitation (iii).

NGC 4190 ULX-1是一个光谱特征硬的ULX，具有两个热组分和一个高能过剩。尽管没有探测到脉冲，但源表现出显著的随机变化，表明可能存在一个高能截断的幂律成分。在过去的XMM-Newton数据拟合中，发现热组分的亮度-温度演化遵循超Eddington薄盘的行为，而期望的光谱展宽并未观察到，这可能表明内部吸积盘受到了磁场的截断。因此，虽然没有探测到脉冲，但有引人注目的证据表明NGC 4190 ULX-1是一个可能的中子星吸积者，然而需要进一步广谱观测来确认这一行为。<br /><br />总结: <br />NGC 4190 ULX-1有硬光谱和热组分，表现出随机变化，可能存在高能截断的幂律成分。研究发现其亮度-温度演化遵循超Eddington薄盘的行为，但没有观察到预期的光谱展宽，可能受到磁场的影响。需要进一步观测来确认其性质。 <div>
We observed the nearby and relatively understudied ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) NGC 4190 ULX-1 jointly with Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) and NuSTAR to investigate its broadband spectrum, timing properties, and spectral variation over time. We found NGC 4190 ULX-1 to have a hard spectrum characterized by two thermal components (with temperatures ∼0.25 and ∼1.6 keV) and a high-energy excess typical of the ULX population although the spectrum turns over at an unusually low energy. While no pulsations were detected (with pulsed fraction 3σ upper limits of 16% for NICER and 35% for NuSTAR), the source shows significant stochastic variability, and the covariance spectrum indicates the presence of a high-energy cutoff power-law component, potentially indicative of an accretion column. Additionally, when fitting archival XMM-Newton data with a similar model, we find that the luminosity–temperature evolution of the hot thermal component follows the behavior of a super-Eddington slim disk though the expected spectral broadening for such a disk is not seen, suggesting that the inner accretion disk may be truncated by a magnetic field. Therefore, despite the lack of detected pulsations, there is tantalizing evidence for NGC 4190 ULX-1 being a candidate neutron star accretor although further broadband observations will be required to confirm this behavior.

<div> 高分辨率，脉冲星，射电观测，星际介质，散射屏幕

这项研究报告了对“B0919+06”脉冲星的高分辨率动态频谱分析结果。使用五百米口径球面射电望远镜和帕克斯射电望远镜的超宽带接收器，观测了多个时段。研究显示在1250 MHz频率下，相关带宽、衍射时间和漂移率分别为25.89 MHz、分钟和MHz-1。射电观测参数的频率相关性呈现出单幂律光谱特征，表明星际介质中的电子密度波动大致遵循科尔莫哥洛夫光谱。二次谱呈现出两个明确的抛物线弧线，外弧和内弧的曲率分别为0.002和0.02 s3。对于各向同性散射，散射屏幕的位置大致确定在距离脉冲星约157.3和726.0 pc的位置。内部闪烁弧在宽带范围内同时存在，表明闪烁弧是一个宽频现象。弧线的曲率随观测频率的变化符合幂律规律，指数为-2.05±0.05，这意味着散射屏幕的物理距离范围从689.7到883.3 pc。 <br /><br />总结: 该研究采用射电观测技术对脉冲星进行了高分辨率动态频谱分析，结果显示出星际介质中的电子密度波动基本遵循科尔莫哥洛夫光谱规律。同时确定了散射屏幕的位置和物理距离范围，为进一步探索星际介质的微观结构提供了潜在方法。 <div>
Radio observations of pulsars offer a potential method to probe the intricate microstructure in the turbulent interstellar medium. Here we report on a high-resolution dynamic spectral analysis of the “swooshing pulsar” B0919+06 observed with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope over multiple epochs and with the ultrawideband receiver on the Parkes radio telescope. For all observations, the dynamic scintillation spectra, two-dimensional autocovariance functions, and secondary spectra are presented. At 1250 MHz, the decorrelation bandwidth, diffraction timescale, and the drift rate are determined to be Δνd = 25.89 ± 7.55 MHz, minutes, and MHz−1, respectively. The frequency dependencies of the scintillation parameters exhibit single power-law spectral behaviors, indicating that the electron density fluctuations in the interstellar medium approximately follow the Kolmogorov spectrum. The secondary spectra exhibit two distinct parabolic arcs with well-determined curvatures of 0.002 and 0.02 s3 for the outer and inner arcs, respectively. The locations of the scattering screens are approximately determined to be 157.3 and 726.0 pc, respectively, from the pulsar for isotropic scattering. The inner scintillation arc is present contemporaneously over a wide frequency range, indicating that the scintillation arc is a broadband phenomenon. The arc curvature scales with observing frequency as a power law with an index of −2.05 ± 0.05, which implies that the scattering screen spans a physical distance from 689.7 to 883.3 pc from the pulsar.

<div> 关键词: 外行星系统、星际大行星、星系形成理论、动力学N体模拟、热木星

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了外行星系统的星系形成模型，发现热木星的宿主恒星显示出与非宿主恒星不同的相空间特征，这可能是因为它们形成于星际密度较高的恒星形成区域，经历了动力学的干扰。通过模拟实验发现，保留其行星的恒星相空间较高，这是因为它们经历的干扰较少。而行星轨道被显著改变的宿主恒星也主要分布在高相空间区域。这证实了其他研究的结论，即热木星宿主恒星的高相空间特征不是由动力学干扰或恒星团聚引起的，而是反映了这些恒星（动力学上）比其他外行星宿主恒星更年轻。 <div>
The architectures of extrasolar planetary systems often deviate considerably from the “standard” model for planet formation, which is largely based on our own solar system. In particular, gas giants on close orbits are not predicted by planet formation theory and so some processes are thought to move the planets closer to their host stars. Recent research has suggested that hot-Jupiter host stars display a different phase space compared to stars that do not host hot Jupiters. This has been attributed to these stars forming in star-forming regions of high stellar density, where dynamical interactions with passing stars have perturbed the planets. We test this hypothesis by quantifying the phase space of planet-hosting stars in dynamical N-body simulations of star-forming regions. We find that stars that retain their planets have a higher phase space than nonhosts, regardless of their initial physical density. This is because an imprint of the kinematic substructure from the regions birth is retained, as these stars have experienced fewer and less disruptive encounters than stars whose planets have been liberated and become free-floating. However, host stars whose planets remain bound but have had their orbits significantly altered by dynamical encounters are also primarily found in high phase space regimes. We therefore corroborate other research in this area that has suggested the high phase space of hot-Jupiter host stars is not caused by dynamical encounters or stellar clustering, but rather reflects an age bias in that these stars are (kinematically) younger than other exoplanet host stars.

<br /><br />总结:
Fermi泡沫的全频谱显示出与边缘强冲击电子加速和环境星际辐射密切相关的特征。辐射频谱中的冷却断裂对应着微波范围的不同。发现泡沫边缘存在下游的尘埃成分，掩盖了预期的大约35 GHz频谱断裂点。模型显示泡沫几百万年的年龄，边缘附近的辐射场和磁化程度均相对均匀。 <div>
The full, radio to γ-ray spectrum of the Fermi bubbles is shown to be consistent with standard strong-shock electron acceleration at the bubble edge, without the unnatural energy cutoffs and unrealistic electron cooling of previous studies, if the ambient interstellar radiation is strong; the γ-ray cooling break should then have a microwave counterpart, undetected until now. Indeed, a broadband bubble-edge analysis uncovers a pronounced downstream dust component, which masked the anticipated ∼35 GHz spectral break, and the same overall radio softening consistent with Kraichnan diffusion previously reported in γ-rays. A self-consistent bulk and edge model implies a few Myr old bubbles, with fairly uniform radiation fields and enhanced magnetization near the edge.

这项研究通过研究与超新星遗迹相关的年轻脉冲星的群体来推导中子星的初始自旋周期分布。他们使用层次贝叶斯方法考虑了个体观测的测量不确定性和选择效应。在不进行选择效应修正的情况下，他们发现脉冲星的初始自旋周期遵循威布尔分布，在40毫秒处达到高峰，比起对数正态分布，贝叶斯因子为200。他们定量研究了射电脉冲星调查中已知的选择效应，包括脉冲展宽和周期相关的束缚比例。他们表明，基于ATNF脉冲星目录中的脉冲星亮度和自旋周期测量，脉冲展宽对推断脉冲星周期分布的影响可能微乎其微。在修正束缚选择效应后，威布尔分布仍然是首选模型，但其高峰略微偏向更长的周期，达到50毫秒。他们的方法将在约方公里阵列时代约束中子星的诞生特性方面发挥作用。

We derive the initial spin period distribution of neutron stars by studying the population of young pulsars associated with supernova remnants. Our hierarchical Bayesian approach accounts for the measurement uncertainties of individual observations and selection effects. Without correcting for selection effects, as done in previous studies, we find that pulsar initial spin periods follow a Weibull distribution, peaking at 40 ms, which is favored against a lognormal distribution with a Bayes factor of 200. The known selection effects in radio pulsar surveys, including pulse broadening and period-dependent beaming fraction, have been quantitatively investigated. We show that, based on measurements of pulsar luminosity and spin period from the ATNF Pulsar Catalogue, the impact of pulse broadening on the inference of the pulsar period distribution is likely to be insignificant. Correcting for the beaming selection effect, the Weibull distribution remains the preferred model, while its peak slightly shifts to longer periods at 50 ms. Our method will prove useful in constraining the birth properties of neutron stars in the Square Kilometre Array era.

<div> NS-NS binary merger, supramassive NS, accretion disk, EOS constraints, collapse time distribution
总结：<br /><br />本文研究了NS-NS双星合并形成紧凑遗留物的过程，发现受NS初始表面磁场影响较小。考虑了吸积盘效应后，发现SMNS形成的崩塌时间分布基本不变，但磁偶极辐射总能量取决于初始磁场强度。通过对SMNS比例的约束，排除了一些EOS，并得到了三种候选EOS。在观测数据比较后发现，仅有ENG EOS符合观测结果。最后通过基于ENG EOS和银河系统的质量分布得出，大约99%的NS-NS合并会在10^7s内坍缩成黑洞。这包括立刻形成黑洞（36.5%），形成SMNS（60.7%），或者经过吸积后转变成黑洞或SMNS（2.1%）。并且指出了GW170817和GW190425的遗物更有可能是黑洞。 <div>
The merger of a neutron star (NS)–NS binary can form different productions of compact remnants, among which a supramassive NS (SMNS) can create an internal plateau, and the following steep decay marks the collapse of the SMNS. The proportion of the SMNS and the corresponding collapse time are often used to constrain the NS equation of state (EOS). This paper revisits this topic by considering the effect of an accretion disk on a compact remnant, which is not considered in previous works. Compared with previous works, the collapse-time distribution (peaks ∼100 s) of SMNSs formed from an NS–NS merger is almost unaffected by the initial surface magnetic field (Bs,i) of the NS, but the total energy output of the magnetic dipole radiation from the SMNSs depends on Bs,i significantly. Coupling the constraints from the SMNS fraction, we exclude some EOSs and obtain three candidate EOSs, i.e., DD2, ENG, and MPA1. By comparing the distributions of the collapse time and the luminosity of the internal plateau (in the short gamma-ray bursts) for observations obtained based on the three candidate EOSs, it is shown that only the EOS of ENG is favored. Our sample, based on the ENG EOS and a mass distribution motivated by Galactic systems, suggests that approximately 99% of NS–NS mergers collapse to form a black hole (BH) within 107s. This includes scenarios promptly forming a BH (36.5%), an SMNS (60.7%), or a stable NS that transitions into a BH or an SMNS following accretion (2.1%). It also indicates that the remnants for GW170817 and GW190425, and the second object of GW190814, are more likely to be BHs.

文章介绍了使用Markov Chain Monte Carlo方法基于Gaia DR3数据对大麦哲伦星云(LMC)盘进行了动力学建模。研究发现星团和年轻恒星具有明显不同的动力学中心，盘倾斜角，节点线位置角和尺度半径。同时还观察到盘参数有显著的径向变化，并发现可能与长条和螺旋臂的扰动有关。动力学异常的星团指示了LMC盘中的时空扰动，与预期的LMC与小麦哲伦星云最近碰撞的影响因素和时间相匹配。 <div>
The internal kinematics of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) disk have been modeled by several studies using different tracers with varying coverage, resulting in a range of parameters. Here, we model the LMC disk using 1705 star clusters and field stars, based on a robust Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, using Gaia DR3 data. The dependency of the model parameters on the age, coverage, and strength of the clusters are also presented. This is the first comprehensive 2D kinematic study using star clusters. Red clump (RC) stars and young main-sequence stars are also modeled for comparison. The clusters and field stars are found to have distinctly different kinematic centers, disk inclination, position angle of the line of nodes, and scale radius. We also note a significant radial variation of the disk parameters. Clusters and young stars are found to have a large residual proper motion and a relatively large velocity dispersion when compared to the RC field population, which could be due to perturbation from the bar and spiral arms. We trace the presence of the large residual proper motion and noncircular motion among clusters likely to be due to the bar and detect a decrease in the scale radius as a result of the possible evolution of the bar. The kinematically deviant clusters point to a spatiotemporal disturbance in the LMC disk, matching with the expected impact factor and time of the recent collision between the LMC and the Small Magellanic Cloud.

<div> 黑洞，GRMHD模拟，立体磁流体动力学，冲击波，电子加热
总结:
GRMHD模拟显示黑洞倾斜盘中存在冲击波。我们通过2D粒子在电离细胞模拟研究了这些冲击波的效率和机制，发现后冲击波电子温度几乎不受等离子体beta值和前冲击波电子与离子温度比的影响。我们发现在Ms约为5-6时，电子的非绝热加热受到磁泵驱动的影响。我们的结果为黑洞吸积流中的无碰撞冲击波提供了物理合理的子网预设，可以用于电子加热。 <div>
General relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of black hole tilted disks—where the angular momentum of the accretion flow at large distances is misaligned with respect to the black hole spin—commonly display standing shocks within a few to tens of gravitational radii from the black hole. In GRMHD simulations of geometrically thick, optically thin accretion flows, applicable to low-luminosity sources like Sgr A* and M87*, the shocks have transrelativistic speed, moderate plasma beta (the ratio of ion thermal pressure to magnetic pressure is βpi1 ∼ 1–8), and low sonic Mach number (the ratio of shock speed to sound speed is Ms ∼ 1–6). We study such shocks with 2D particle-in-cell simulations, and we quantify the efficiency and mechanisms of electron heating for the special case of preshock magnetic fields perpendicular to the shock direction of propagation. We find that the postshock electron temperature Te2 exceeds the adiabatic expectation Te2,ad by an amount , nearly independent of the plasma beta and of the preshock electron-to-ion temperature ratio Te1/Ti1, which we vary from 0.1 to unity. We investigate the heating physics for Ms ∼ 5–6 and find that electron superadiabatic heating is governed by magnetic pumping at Te1/Ti1 = 1, whereas heating by B-parallel electric fields (i.e., parallel to the local magnetic field) dominates at Te1/Ti1 = 0.1. Our results provide physically motivated subgrid prescriptions for electron heating at the collisionless shocks seen in GRMHD simulations of black hole accretion flows.

<div> 关键词: 磁场, 年轻原恒星, 偏振观测, 稳定性, 辐射

总结:
磁场在年轻原恒星的形成中起着重要作用，通过多尺度和多波长的尘埃偏振观测可以揭示从云到核到原恒星的推断磁场。本文利用SOFIA上的HAWC+对IRAS 16293-2422年轻原恒星三重系统进行了连续偏振观测，结果表明平均磁场角度为89°±23°，与在更大尺度（≳2000 au）上观测到的∼170°磁场形态不同。这种对齐差异表明较短波长的HAWC+数据在追踪来自喷流腔的暖尘的磁场，而较长波长的数据在追踪来自较冷尘的均匀磁场。此外，我们还在这个源中发现，观测波长对尘埃辐射峰值有很大影响，尘埃辐射峰值随着波长的增加从B源（北方源）逐渐变向A源（南方源）。 <div>
Magnetic fields likely play an important role in the formation of young protostars. Multiscale and multiwavelength dust polarization observations can reveal the inferred magnetic field from scales of the cloud to core to protostar. We present continuum polarization observations of the young protostellar triple system IRAS 16293-2422 at 89 μm using HAWC+ on SOFIA. The inferred magnetic field is very uniform with an average field angle of 89° ± 23° (E of N), which is different from the ∼170° field morphology seen at 850 μm at larger scales (≳2000 au) with JCMT POL-2 and at 1.3 mm on smaller scales (≲300 au) with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The HAWC+ magnetic field direction is aligned with the known E-W outflow. This alignment difference suggests that the shorter wavelength HAWC+ data is tracing the magnetic field associated with warmer dust likely from the outflow cavity, whereas the longer wavelength data are tracing the bulk magnetic field from cooler dust. Also, we show in this source the dust emission peak is strongly affected by the observing wavelength. The dust continuum peaks closer to source B (northern source) at shorter wavelengths and progressively moves toward the southern A source with increasing wavelength (from 22 to 850 μm).

总结:
本文使用不稳定性分析推导了存在CRs时的激波宽度。我们得出了一个将激波宽度与CR指数以及上游粒子加速的分数联系起来的解析表达式。我们发现当这个分数超过30%时，一种新的不稳定性变得主导。激波经历了一个转变，其宽度增加了大约8-10倍，CR加速效果结束了。我们的分析适用于强非相对论和非磁化激波。我们讨论了这些结果对观察到的CR光谱和通量的预期范围以及非相对论碰撞激波的结构的影响。 <div>
Despite being studied for many years, the structure of collisionless shocks is still not fully determined. Such shocks are known to be accelerators of cosmic rays (CRs), which, in turn, modify the shock structure. The shock width λ is known to be connected to the CR spectral index a. Here, we use an instability analysis to derive the shock width in the presence of CRs. We obtain an analytical expression connecting the shock width to the CR index and to the fraction of upstream particles that are accelerated. We find that when this fraction becomes larger than ∼30%, a new instability becomes dominant. The shock undergoes a transition where its width increases by a factor ∼8–10, and the CR acceleration effectively ends. Our analysis is valid for strong, nonrelativistic, and unmagnetized shocks. We discuss the implication of these results on the expected range of CR spectra and flux observed and on the structure of nonrelativistic collisionless shocks.

<div> 黑洞候选天体 Swift J1727.8–1613 的QPO的研究揭示了其频率与能量之间的关联，以及其与频率的变化的性质。观测发现在3赫兹以下，频率与能量的关系较小，而在3赫兹以上则显示出明显的变化。此外，在频率超过8赫兹后，变化速率急剧下降，这与以前报道的现象类似，暗示了一个共同的物理机制。此外，QPO的rms频率关系可以用Lense-Thirring进动模型解释。同时，能量与相位滞后之间的关系也表明了黑洞系统的高倾角性质。

1. Insight-HXMT观测新黑洞候选天体的QPO。
2. QPO频率在能量变化下的特点。
3. 频率超过8赫兹后的变化速率急剧下降。
4. QPO的rms频率关系可以用Lense-Thirring进动模型解释。
5. 能量与相位滞后之间的关系表明黑洞系统的高倾角性质。 <div>
Based on observations from the Insight Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (Insight-HXMT), an analysis of type C quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) observed during the outburst of the new black hole candidate Swift J1727.8–1613 in 2023 was conducted. This analysis scrutinized the QPO’s evolution throughout the outburst, particularly noting its rapid frequency escalation during two flare events. Utilizing the energy range covered by Insight-HXMT, a dependency of the QPO frequency on energy was observed. Below approximately 3 Hz, minimal variations in frequency with energy were noted, whereas clear variations with photon energy were observed when it exceeded approximately 3 Hz. Additionally, a sharp drop in the rate of change was observed when the frequency exceeded approximately 8 Hz. This behavior, similar to several previously reported sources, suggests the presence of a common underlying physical mechanism. Moreover, the QPO rms–frequency relationship can be explained by the Lense–Thirring precession model. The relationship between rms energy and phase lag with frequency suggests the black hole system as a high-inclination source.

这项研究在Large Magellanic Cloud中进行了一次11.6小时的射电脉冲搜索观测，发现了49个具有较高信噪比的脉冲。这些脉冲被认为可能来自LMC脉冲星，并且在LMC DM范围内发现了三次重复脉冲。然而，仍不清楚这些脉冲中是否包含来自PSR J0537−6910的信号。总结: 该研究在LMC中进行了射电脉冲搜索，发现了一系列脉冲，可能来自LMC脉冲星，其中包括三次重复脉冲，但是否包含目标X射线脉冲星的信号仍不确定。 <div>
I conducted a new search for dispersed radio pulses from the X-ray pulsar PSR J0537−6910 in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) in a long (11.6 hr) archival 1.4 GHz Parkes search observation. I searched dispersion measures (DMs) between 0 and 10,000 pc cm−3 and detected 49 pulses with a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) greater than 7 at a wide range of DMs using the HEIMDALL and FETCH pulse detection and classification packages. All of the pulses were weak, with none having an S/N above 8.5. There was a significant excess of pulses observed in the DM range of the known pulsar population in the LMC, suggesting that these pulses may originate from LMC pulsars. Three repeat pulses, each having widths ≲1 ms, were detected in a single DM trial of 103.412 pc cm−3, which is in the LMC DM range. This is unlikely to occur by chance in a single DM trial in this search at the (marginally significant) 4.3σ level. It remains unclear whether any of the detected pulses in the sample are from PSR J0537−6910 itself.

总结: 
该研究提出了HaloFlow，这是一种新的机器学习方法，可以从星系的光度和形态推断出宿主暗物质晕的质量Mh。该方法利用基于模拟的推断和正态流进行严格的贝叶斯推断。它在Bottrell等人的最新合成星系图像上进行训练，这些图像是基于IllustrisTNG宇宙大尺度模拟构建的，并包括了Subaru战略计划的Hyper Suprime-Cam观测的实际影响。通过研究发现，HaloFlow能够准确且无偏地推断出Mh的后验分布，还能够量化光度观测在限制Mh方面的全部信息内容。包括形态特征在内显著提高了Mh约束的精确性，并且卫星总亮度也能产生类似的效果。与使用恒星-暗物质晕质量关系的标准方法相比，HaloFlow能够改善Mh的约束力约40%。在接下来的研究中，他们将利用真实观测数据的星系-星系透镜测量来验证和校准HaloFlow。 <div>
We present HaloFlow, a new machine-learning approach for inferring the mass of host dark matter halos, Mh, from the photometry and morphology of galaxies (https://github.com/changhoonhahn/haloflow/). HaloFlow uses simulation-based inference with normalizing flows to conduct rigorous Bayesian inference. It is trained on state-of-the-art synthetic galaxy images from Bottrell et al. that are constructed from the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamic simulation and include realistic effects of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategy Program observations. We design HaloFlow to infer Mh and stellar mass, M*, using grizy band magnitudes, morphological properties quantifying characteristic size, concentration and asymmetry, total measured satellite luminosity, and number of satellites. We demonstrate that HaloFlow infers accurate and unbiased posteriors of Mh. Furthermore, we quantify the full information content in the photometric observations of galaxies in constraining Mh. With magnitudes alone, we infer Mh with and 0.182 dex for field and group galaxies. Including morphological properties significantly improves the precision of Mh constraints, as does total satellite luminosity: and 0.132 dex. Compared to the standard approach using the stellar-to-halo mass relation, we improve Mh constraints by ∼40%. In subsequent papers, we will validate and calibrate HaloFlow with galaxy–galaxy lensing measurements on real observational data.

<div> 关键词: 双类星系、宇宙正午、星体形成率、中红外光谱、星际有机分子<br />
总结: 这项研究通过JWST/MIRI中红外积分场光谱观测了一个红移为z=2.17的双类类星系J074922.96+225511.7。研究发现，该星系中存在着广泛的星际有机分子和Fe ii发射，星体形成率为103.0±0.2M⊙ yr−1，比对红移为z∼2的星系使用红外光度函数的结果高出5倍。虽然星体形成率与同红移下的星系相当，但这个星系的分子气体含量却低于预期。研究也未观测到任何由类星体驱动的影响星系内PAH和Fe ii的流出现象。这项研究凸显了J0749+2255的极端富含星尘特性，暗示了双类类星体的阶段与强烈的星体形成活动之间可能存在联系。 <br /><br /> <div>
Dual quasars—two active supermassive black holes at galactic scales—represent crucial objects for studying the impact of galaxy mergers and quasar activity on the star formation rate (SFR) within their host galaxies, particularly at cosmic noon when SFR peaks. We present JWST/MIRI mid-infrared integral field spectroscopy of J074922.96+225511.7, a dual quasar with a projected separation of 3.8 kpc at a redshift z = 2.17. We detect spatially extended [Fe ii] 5.34 μm and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) 3.3 μm emissions from the star formation activity in its host galaxy. We derive the SFR of 103.0±0.2M⊙ yr−1 using PAH 3.3 μm, which is 5 times higher than that derived from the knee of the infrared luminosity function for galaxies at z ∼ 2. While the SFR of J0749+2255 agrees with that of star-forming galaxies of comparable stellar mass at the same redshifts, its molecular gas content falls short of expectations based on the molecular Kennicutt–Schmidt law. This discrepancy may result from molecular gas depletion due to the longer elevated stage of star formation, even after the molecular gas reservoir is depleted. We do not observe any quasar-driven outflow that impacts PAH and [Fe ii] in the host galaxy based on the spatially resolved maps. From the expected flux in PAH-based star formation, the [Fe ii] line likely originates from the star-forming regions in the host galaxy. Our study highlights the extreme stardust nature of J0749+2255, indicating a potential connection between the dual quasar phase and intense star formation activities.

<title>Star Formation Rates in [Ne V] 3426 Å Selected Active Galactic Nuclei: Evidence for a Decrease along the Main Sequence?</title>

<div> AGN, [Ne v], sSFR, main sequence, star formation
总结:
本研究选择了1215个AGN样本，通过检测高电离[Ne v] 3426 Å发射线来研究它们在星系主序列上的行为。我们发现由于AGN的贡献，基于发射线的sSFR值并不可靠。因此，我们使用来自SED的sSFR值来研究主序列。我们发现[Ne v]样本中sSFR沿主序列下降的证据，这与Burst Alert望远镜AGN样本的结果一致。尽管我们没有发现与AGN活动抑制星形成的证据，但我们的结果支持AGN宿主星系的气体分数较星形星系低。如果气体的减少和因此抑制星形成是由于AGN活动引起的，那么这种现象必须发生在先前的时期。 <div>
Studying the behavior along the galaxy main sequence is key in furthering our understanding of the possible connection between active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity and star formation. We select a sample of 1215 AGN from the catalog of Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxy properties from the Portsmouth group by detection of the high-ionization [Ne v] 3426 Å emission line. Our sample extends from 1040 to 1042.5 erg s−1 in [Ne v] luminosity in a redshift range z = 0.17 to 0.57. We compare the specific star formation rates (sSFRs; SFR scaled by galaxy mass) obtained from the corrected [O ii] and Hα luminosities, and the spectral energy distribution (SED)–determined values from Portsmouth. We find that the emission-line-based sSFR values are unreliable for the [Ne v] sample due to the AGN contribution, and proceed with the SED sSFRs for our study of the main sequence. We find evidence for a decrease in sSFR along the main sequence in the [Ne v] sample, which is consistent with results from the hard X-ray Burst Alert Telescope AGN sample, which extends to lower redshifts than our [Ne v] sample. Although we do not find evidence that the concurrent AGN activity is suppressing star formation, our results are consistent with a lower gas fraction in the host galaxies of the AGN as compared to that of the star-forming galaxies. If the evacuation of gas, and therefore suppression of star formation, is due to AGN activity, it must have occurred in a previous epoch.

通过研究本地星系和高红移星系的相关化学演化, 我们对 Ne, S, Cl 和 Ar 的丰度模式进行了调查, 通过 CLASSY 对局部星系(SFGs)的研究结果,发现 Ne/O, S/O, Cl/O 和 Ar/O 与气相金属丰度的相关性, 对于金属丰度较低的部分没有明显相关性, 但是对于金属丰度较高的部分却存在相关性, 这可能是由于离子校正因子(ICFs)的影响; 以 CLASSY 作为本地参考, 评估了 Ne/O, S/O, Ar/O 在 z > 3 的星系中的演化情况, 发现 Ne/O 没有演化, 而 S/O 和 Ar/O 由于缺乏直接丰度测量而可能会影响对元素演化的解释; 确定了 CLASSY 的基本金属丰度关系(FMR)并与高红移 FMR 进行比较, 发现没有演化; 最后, 对质量-氖关系进行了分析, 发现在后期有轻微的演化。CLASSY 星系的丰度模式和广泛的物理性质范围为解释 JWST 观测到的早期星系的化学丰度提供了重要的基准。 <br /><br />总结: 星际化学演化研究了Ne, S, Cl和Ar在不同金属丰度下的丰度模式，并考虑了ICFs对丰度比例的影响；通过对CLASSY星系和高红移星系的比较，发现Ne/O没有演化，但由于对S/O和Ar/O的缺乏直接丰度测量可能会影响对元素演化的解释；最后进行了质量-氖关系分析，发现在后期存在轻微的演化。CLASSY星系的丰度模式和广泛的物理性质范围为解释JWST观测到的早期星系的化学丰度提供了重要的基准。 <div>
To study the chemical evolution across cosmic epochs, we investigate Ne, S, Cl, and Ar abundance patterns in the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph Legacy Archive Spectroscopic SurveY (CLASSY). CLASSY comprises local star-forming galaxies (SFGs; 0.02 < z < 0.18) with enhanced star formation rates, making them strong analogues to high-z SFGs. With direct measurements of electron temperature, we derive accurate ionic abundances for all elements and assess ionization correction factors (ICFs) to account for unseen ions and derive total abundances. We find Ne/O, S/O, Cl/O, and Ar/O exhibit constant trends with gas-phase metallicity for 12+log(O/H) < 8.5 but significant correlation for Ne/O and Ar/O with metallicity for 12+log(O/H) > 8.5, likely due to ICFs. Thus, the applicability of the ICFs to integrated spectra of galaxies could bias results, underestimating true abundance ratios. Using CLASSY as a local reference, we assess the evolution of Ne/O, S/O, and Ar/O in galaxies at z > 3, finding no cosmic evolution of Ne/O, while the lack of direct abundance determinations for S/O and Ar/O can bias the interpretation of the evolution of these elements. We determine the fundamental metallicity relationship (FMR) for CLASSY and compare to the high-redshift FMR, finding no evolution. Finally, we perform the first mass–neon relationship analysis across cosmic epochs, finding a slight evolution to high Ne at later epochs. The robust abundance patterns of CLASSY galaxies and their broad range of physical properties provide essential benchmarks for interpreting the chemical enrichment of the early galaxies observed with the JWST.

该研究分析了近邻条状螺旋星系M83中的CO到H2转换因子（αCO）和气尘比（δGDR）的径向变化趋势，结果表明从该星系中心到边缘，αCO和δGDR都呈现出2-3倍的增加。研究结果显示，这些值与银河系中的测量值一致。此外，研究人员还测试了由于径向金属丰度梯度和基础云团体变化可能引起的αCO变化的可能性。使用分子云CO亮度函数和云团质量与亮度的经验幂律关系，研究表明基础云团体的变化可能解释αCO的径向变化因子约为1.5-2.0。 <div>
We analyze the CO-to-H2 conversion factor (αCO) in the nearby barred spiral galaxy M83. We present new H i observations from the VLA and single-dish GBT in the disk of the galaxy, and combine them with maps of CO(1-0) integrated intensity and dust surface density from the literature. αCO and the gas-to-dust ratio (δGDR) are simultaneously derived in annuli of 2 kpc width from R = 1–7 kpc. We find that αCO and δGDR both increase radially, by a factor of ∼2–3 from the center to the outskirts of the disk. The luminosity-weighted averages over the disk are αCO = 3.14 (2.06, 4.96) and δGDR = 137 (111, 182) at the 68% (1σ) confidence level. These are consistent with the αCO and δGDR values measured in the Milky Way. In addition to possible variations of αCO due to the radial metallicity gradient, we test the possibility of variations in αCO due to changes in the underlying cloud populations, as a function of galactic radius. Using a truncated power-law molecular cloud CO luminosity function and an empirical power-law relation for cloud mass and luminosity, we show that the changes in the underlying cloud population may account for a factor of ∼1.5–2.0 radial change in αCO.

<title>On the Origin of the Variety of Velocity Dispersion Profiles of Galaxies</title>

<div> 关键词: 速度离散度轮廓、积分场光谱学、星体质量、星体形成、宇宙动力学模拟<br />
总结:<br />
本研究使用了来自两项调查的积分场光谱学数据，对比了两个宇宙动力学模拟的结果，发现观测和模拟的星体速度离散度轮廓存在显著差异。内部轮廓主要受到原地形成的年轻和老年星体的相对径向分布的影响，而外部轮廓则受到外积星体的影响。更大质量的星体有更高比例的外积星体，因此外部速度离散度轮廓的斜率更高，并且呈现更强的径向各向异性。外部速度离散度的多样性反映了各个星系组装历史的多样性。 <div>
Observed and simulated galaxies exhibit a significant variation in their velocity dispersion profiles. We examine the inner and outer slopes of stellar velocity dispersion profiles using integral field spectroscopy data from two surveys, SAMI (for z < 0.115) and CALIFA (for z < 0.03), comparing them with results from two cosmological hydrodynamic simulations: Horizon-AGN (for z = 0.017) and NewHorizon (for z ≲ 1). The simulated galaxies closely reproduce the variety of velocity dispersion slopes and stellar mass dependence of both inner and outer radii (0.5 r50 and 3 r50) as observed, where r50 stands for half-light radius. The inner slopes are mainly influenced by the relative radial distribution of the young and old stars formed in situ: a younger center shows a flatter inner profile. The presence of accreted (ex situ) stars has two effects on the velocity dispersion profiles. First, because they are more dispersed in spatial and velocity distributions compared to in situ formed stars, it increases the outer slope of the velocity dispersion profile. It also causes the velocity anisotropy to be more radial. More massive galaxies have a higher fraction of stars formed ex situ and hence show a higher slope in outer velocity dispersion profile and a higher degree of radial anisotropy. The diversity in the outer velocity dispersion profiles reflects the diverse assembly histories among galaxies.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了NGC 5907 ULX1这个极端亮的超光源X射线脉冲星。研究利用2014年7月XMM-Newton和NuSTAR同时观测的数据进行了广带X射线研究。文章显示，相位分辨光谱可以用一个模型很好地再现，其中包含一个温度梯度为p = 0.5的多色盘黑体辐射和一个带有指数截断的幂律。盘部分是相位不变的，具有约0.3 keV的最内温度，其归一化值表明盘的倾角相对较低，与其他文献中的先前声明相矛盾。幂律成分归因于在中子星的磁层内的吸积流发射，显示出相位相关的光谱形状变化；前峰相位的光谱略硬于后峰相位。这意味着磁层在磁轴周围具有不对称的几何结构，并且在脉冲峰之前，靠近磁极的热区域变得可见。 <div>
The discovery of coherent pulsations from several ultraluminous X-ray pulsars (ULXPs) has provided direct evidence of a supercritical accretion flow. However, the geometrical structure of such an accretion flow onto the central neutron star remains poorly understood. NGC 5907 ULX1 is one of the most luminous ULXPs, with a luminosity exceeding 1041 erg s−1. Here we present a broadband X-ray study of this ULXP using the data from simultaneous observations with XMM-Newton and NuSTAR conducted in 2014 July. The phase-resolved spectra are well reproduced by a model consisting of a multicolor disk blackbody emission with a temperature gradient of p = 0.5 (T ∝ r−p) and a power law with an exponential cutoff. The disk component is phase-invariant and has an innermost temperature of ∼ 0.3 keV. Its normalization suggests a relatively low inclination angle of the disk, in contrast to the previous claims in other literature. The power-law component, attributed to the emission from the accretion flow inside the magnetosphere of the neutron star, indicates phase-dependent spectral shape changes; the spectrum is slightly harder in the pre-peak phase than in the post-peak phase. This implies that the magnetosphere has an asymmetric geometry around the magnetic axis and that hotter regions close to the magnetic pole become visible before the pulse peak.

In the absence of a parallax distance to a pulsar or a surviving binary in a supernova remnant (SNR), distances to Galactic SNRs are generally very uncertain. However, by combining Gaia data with wide-field, multifiber echelle spectroscopy, it is now possible to obtain accurate distances to many SNRs with limited extinction by searching for the appearance of high-velocity Ca ii or Na i absorption lines in hot stars as a function of distance. We demonstrate this for the SNR S147 using the spectra of 259 luminous blue stars. We obtain a median distance of 1.37 kpc (1.30–1.47 kpc at 90% confidence), which is consistent with the median parallax distance to the pulsar of 1.46 kpc (1.12–2.10 kpc at 90% confidence) but with significantly smaller uncertainties. Our distance is also consistent with the distance to the candidate unbound binary companion in this SNR, HD 37424 at a photogeometric distance of 1.45 kpc (1.40–1.50 kpc at 1σ). The presence of high-velocity absorption lines is correlated with the Hα/O [iii] emission-line flux of the SNR but not with the radio flux.

Solar activities have an extraordinary impact on interplanetary space, enriching the plasma dynamics including turbulent heating of various species. The small fraction of alpha particles is believed to play a significant role in the turbulent dynamics of the solar wind. Here we present fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations to reveal the influences of the alpha particles in decaying plasma turbulence. Multiple run cases with different controlled variations of proton and alpha density are performed to compare and evaluate the energy conversion processes. It is found that the alpha particles can suppress the energy conversion rate with increasing density. Besides, the alpha particles show more heating intermittency than the proton species. Interestingly, on the other hand, the electrons do not show any change in their dynamics, including overall heating. These two positive charge species have more correlation in temperature anisotropy as their densities are comparable. Our results provide valuable insights on the turbulence with different species compositions to a certain extent, especially with abundant heavy particles.

总结:
该研究使用PHANGS-MUSE和PHANGS-ALMA调查的数据，对四个条状星系进行研究，通过Hα速度梯度图突出显示了条的驱动震荡和剪切。研究发现，在条状星系中，速度梯度增强的区域抑制了星的形成，大部分这些区域被分类为低电离核发射线区域(LINER)或复合区。研究结果与数值模拟结果一致，表明剪切力强的条状星系中，星的形成被抑制。 <div>
Bars drive gas inflow. As the gas flows inward, shocks and shear occur along the bar dust lanes. Such shocks and shear can affect the star formation (SF) and change the gas properties. For four barred galaxies, we present Hα velocity gradient maps that highlight bar-driven shocks and shear using data from the PHANGS-MUSE and PHANGS-ALMA surveys, which allow us to study bar kinematics in unprecedented detail. Velocity gradients are enhanced along the bar dust lanes, where shocks and shear are shown to occur in numerical simulations. Velocity gradient maps also efficiently pick up H ii regions that are expanding or moving relative to the surroundings. We put pseudo-slits on the regions where velocity gradients are enhanced and find that Hα and CO velocities jump up to ∼170 km s−1, even after removing the effects of circular motions due to the galaxy rotation. Enhanced velocity gradients either coincide with the peak of CO intensity along the bar dust lanes or are slightly offset from CO intensity peaks, depending on the objects. Using the Baldwin–Philips–Terlevich BPT diagnostic, we identify the source of ionization on each spaxel and find that SF is inhibited in the high-velocity gradient regions of the bar, and the majority of those regions are classified as a low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER) or composite. This implies that SF is inhibited where bar-driven shear and shocks are strong. Our results are consistent with the results from the numerical simulations that show SF is inhibited in the bar where the shear force is strong.

Neutron stars represent unique laboratories, offering insights into the physics of supranuclear-density matter and serving as potential hosts for dark matter. This study explores the impact of dark matter cores on rapidly rotating neutron stars through the two-fluid approximation, assuming minimal interaction between baryonic matter and dark matter. The investigation employs phenomenological models for fermionic and bosonic dark matter, revealing that universal relations governing mass and radius changes due to rotation remain largely unaffected in the presence of a dark matter core. Specifically, for a 5% dark matter mass fraction, the percent deviations in total mass (Mtot), the baryonic equatorial radius (RBe), and polar-to-equatorial baryonic radius ratio (RratioB) are within 3.9%, 1.8%, and 1.4%, respectively. These findings suggest that the universal relations governing neutron star shape can be utilized to infer constraints on the properties of dark matter cores even in cases where the dark matter significantly softens the neutron star’s equation of state.

<div> γ-ray Fermi source, IceCube neutrino event, optical spectroscopy, redshift, jet activity

这篇文章报告了一项关于高能γ射线源的研究，发现了与IceCube中微子事件IC-240105A可能相关的对应光谱。研究发现了红移为z = 2.153的Lyα发射线，表明了源的红移。与先前的光谱相比，连续谱增加了约10倍，而C iv 1550发射线的流量减少了约5倍，其等效宽度从约20 Å降至0.8 Å，表明了非常高的喷流活动。发现的发射线的半峰宽介于类星体的宽线区域和窄线区域之间，基于这些结果，源的分类介于平谱射电类星体和BL Lac天体之间。 <br /><br />总结: 这项研究发现了一种高能γ射线源，并确定了其红移，发现了非常高的喷流活动，并将其分类为介于平谱射电类星体和BL Lac天体之间。 <div>
Following the high activity of the γ-ray Fermi source 4FGL J0449.1+1121 (PKS 0446+112), possibly associated with a IceCube neutrino event IC-240105A, we obtained optical spectroscopy with the Gran Telescopio Canarias of the counterpart. We detect a clear emission line at 3830 Å identified as Lyα that confirms the redshift of source at z = 2.153. Comparing with previous spectroscopy, we find an increase of the continuum by a factor ∼10, and a significant decrease of the C iv 1550 emission line flux by a factor ∼5. This produces a dramatic drop of the equivalent width from ∼20 to 0.8 Å, which is suggestive of a very high jet activity. The full width half maximum of the emission lines are midway (1000–2000 km s −1) between those typical of the broad and narrow regions of quasars. Based on this, the source classification is intermediate between flat spectrum radio quasar and BL Lac object.

总结:<br />
本研究利用JWST确定的红移范围为z = 9–14.5的星系紫外线亮度函数，推导出对暖暗物质模型的约束。通过与HST在红移z = 4–8进行的空白场调查相结合，同时对天体物理参数（双重幂律星系形成效率的β、γ、ϵN和Mc，以及高斯等级-暗物质质量关系）和WDM参数（暗物质粒子质量mx）施加约束。在95%的置信水平下，得到了热暗物质粒子质量mx ≥ 3.2千电子伏的新界限。这个界限比之前使用HST数据得到的最严格结果更紧。未来JWST观测可能进一步减少观测不确定性，并改善这一约束。 <div>
We exploit the recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) determination of galaxy UV luminosity functions over the redshift range z = 9–14.5 to derive constraints on warm dark matter (WDM) models. The delayed structure formations in WDM universes make high-redshift observations a powerful probe to set limits on the particle mass mx of WDM candidates. By integrating these observations with blank-field surveys conducted by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) at redshifts z = 4–8, we impose constraints on both astrophysical parameters (β, γ, ϵN, and Mc for a double-power-law star formation efficiency, and for a Gaussian magnitude–halo mass relation) and the WDM parameter (dark matter particle mass mx) simultaneously. We find a new limit of mx ≥ 3.2 keV for the mass of thermal relic WDM particles at a 95% confidence level. This bound is tighter than the most stringent result derived using HST data before. Future JWST observations could further reduce the observation uncertainties and improve this constraint.

<div> 关键词: 二进制星系统, 密集环境, 气体相互作用, 软-硬界限, 形成过程
总结:<br /><br />
本研究探讨了在密集环境中气体对二进制星系统软化的影响以及其后果。我们发现气体相互作用实际上可以硬化二进制星系统，并将软–硬界限扩展到更大的分离距离。这为二进制星系统硬化提出了一个“屏蔽半径”的概念，使得一部分最初被分类为“软”二进制系统在考虑到气体和恒星的情况下实际上变得“硬”。我们提出了硬二进制系统的两阶段形成过程：初始形成软二进制系统，无论是动力学而来还是通过气体辅助捕获，然后经过气体诱导硬化，最终发生破裂。在气体密度低但气体含量高的环境中，屏蔽半径可能超过典型的硬–软界限一个数量级，导致显著比例的最初软二进制系统实际上成为硬二进制系统。相反，在气体密度较高的环境中，气体诱导硬化可能占主导地位，潜在地使整个二进制星系统呈硬状态。气体硬化成为塑造气体丰富环境中二进制星系统群体的关键因素，例如星团、成星区和可能的活动星系核盘中。这凸显了气体动力学和恒星相互作用在密集环境中二进制星系统演化中的复杂相互作用。 <div>
Binaries in dense environments are traditionally classified as soft or hard based on their binding energy relative to the kinetic energy of surrounding stars. Heggie’s law suggests that stellar encounters tend to soften soft binaries and harden hard binaries, altering their separations. However, interactions with gas in such environments can significantly modify this behavior. This study investigates the impact of gas on binary softening and its consequences. We find that gas interactions can actually harden binaries, extending the soft–hard boundary to larger separations. This introduces a “shielding radius” within which binaries are likely to harden due to gas interactions, surpassing the traditional soft–hard limit. Consequently, a notable portion of binaries initially classified as “soft” may become “hard” when both gas and stars are considered. We propose a two-stage formation process for hard binaries: initial soft binary formation, either dynamically or through gas-assisted capture, followed by gas-induced hardening before eventual disruption. In environments with low gas density but high gas content, the shielding radius could exceed the typical hard–soft limit by 1 order of magnitude, leading to a significant fraction of originally soft binaries effectively becoming hard. Conversely, in high-gas-density environments, gas-induced hardening may dominate, potentially rendering the entire binary population hard. Gas hardening emerges as a crucial factor in shaping binary populations in gas-rich settings, such as clusters, star-forming regions, and possibly active galactic nucleus disks. This highlights the complex interplay between gas dynamics and stellar interactions in binary evolution within dense environments.

We present the rest-frame ultraviolet−optical spectral properties of 65 broad absorption line (BAL) quasars from the Gemini Near Infrared Spectrograph−Distant Quasar Survey (GNIRS-DQS). These properties are compared with those of 195 non-BAL quasars from GNIRS-DQS in order to identify the drivers for the appearance of BALs in quasar spectra. In particular, we compare equivalent widths and velocity widths, as well as velocity offsets from systemic redshifts, of principal emission lines. In spite of the differences between their rest-frame ultraviolet spectra, we find that luminous BAL quasars are generally indistinguishable from their non-BAL counterparts in the rest-frame optical band at redshifts 1.55 ≲ z ≲ 3.50. We do not find any correlation between BAL trough properties and the Hβ-based supermassive black hole masses and normalized accretion rates in our sample. Considering the Sloan Digital Sky Survey quasar sample, which includes the GNIRS-DQS sample, we find that a monochromatic luminosity at rest-frame 2500 Å of ≳1045 erg s−1 is a necessary condition for launching BAL outflows in quasars. We compare our findings with other BAL quasar samples and discuss the roles that accretion rate and orientation play in the appearance of BAL troughs in quasar spectra.

We report on an observational campaign on the bright black hole (BH) X-ray binary Swift J1727.8–1613 centered around five observations by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer. These observations track for the first time the evolution of the X-ray polarization of a BH X-ray binary across a hard to soft state transition. The 2–8 keV polarization degree decreased from ∼4% to ∼3% across the five observations, but the polarization angle remained oriented in the north–south direction throughout. Based on observations with the Australia Telescope Compact Array, we find that the intrinsic 7.25 GHz radio polarization aligns with the X-ray polarization. Assuming the radio polarization aligns with the jet direction (which can be tested in the future with higher-spatial-resolution images of the jet), our results imply that the X-ray corona is extended in the disk plane, rather than along the jet axis, for the entire hard intermediate state. This in turn implies that the long (≳10 ms) soft lags that we measure with the Neutron star Interior Composition ExploreR are dominated by processes other than pure light-crossing delays. Moreover, we find that the evolution of the soft lag amplitude with spectral state does not follow the trend seen for other sources, implying that Swift J1727.8–1613 is a member of a hitherto undersampled subpopulation.

A fundamental prediction of the Lambda cold dark matter cosmology is the centrally divergent cuspy density profile of dark matter haloes. Density cusps render cold dark matter haloes resilient to tides, and protect dwarf galaxies embedded in them from full tidal disruption. The hierarchical assembly history of the Milky Way may therefore give rise to a population of “microgalaxies”; i.e., heavily stripped remnants of early accreted satellites, which can reach arbitrarily low luminosity. Assuming that the progenitor systems are dark matter dominated, we use an empirical formalism for tidal stripping to predict the evolution of the luminosity, size, and velocity dispersion of such remnants, tracing their tidal evolution across multiple orders of magnitude in mass and size. The evolutionary tracks depend sensitively on the progenitor distribution of stellar binding energies. We explore three cases that likely bracket most realistic models of dwarf galaxies: one where the energy distribution of the most tightly bound stars follows that of the dark matter, and two where stars are defined by either an exponential density or surface brightness profile. The tidal evolution in the size–velocity dispersion plane is quite similar for these three models, although their remnants may differ widely in luminosity. Microgalaxies are therefore best distinguished from globular clusters by the presence of dark matter; either directly, by measuring their velocity dispersion, or indirectly, by examining their tidal resilience. Our work highlights the need for further theoretical and observational constraints on the stellar energy distribution in dwarf galaxies.

EX Lupi, a low-mass young stellar object, went into an accretion-driven outburst in 2022 March. The outburst caused a sudden phase change of ∼112° ± 5° in periodically oscillating multiband lightcurves. Our high-resolution spectra obtained with the High Resolution Spectrograph (HRS) on board the Southern African Large Telescope also revealed a consistent phase change in the periodically varying radial velocities (RVs), along with an increase in the RV amplitude of various emission lines. The phase change and increase in RV amplitude morphologically translates to a change in the azimuthal and latitudinal location of the accretion hotspot over the stellar surface, which indicates a reconfiguration of the accretion funnel geometry. Our three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations reproduce the phase change for EX Lupi. To explain the observations, we explored the possibility of forward shifting of the dipolar accretion funnel as well as the possibility of the emergence of a new accretion funnel. During the outburst, we also found evidence of the hotspot’s morphology extending azimuthally asymmetrically with a leading hot edge and cold tail along the stellar rotation. Further, our high-cadence photometry showed that the accretion flow has clumps. We also detected possible clumpy accretion events in the HRS spectra that showed episodically highly blueshifted wings in the Ca ii IR triplet and Balmer H lines.

通过Chandra任务观测的软X射线区域的O vii和Fe xvii线系，估计了卡佩拉的日冕密度。分析结合了由于基础原子数据不确定性导致的误差和Chandra数据中的统计误差，推导出了卡佩拉日冕的密度的总体不确定性。我们考虑了两种贝叶斯框架。第一种是所谓的务实贝叶斯方法，该方法将原子数据及其不确定性视为完全指定和不可校正。另一种完全贝叶斯方法允许观察到的谱数据更新原子数据及其不确定性，从而降低了所推导参数的整体误差。为了纳入原子数据的不确定性，我们获得了一组原子数据副本，它们的分布捕获了其不确定性。这些副本的主成分分析允许我们用低维多元高斯分布来表示原子不确定性。我们通过t分布近似了包含先验温度信息的部分等离子体参数的不确定性，该信息来自于对温度敏感的Fe xvii谱线分析。我们实施了基于马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛模型拟合，包括多步蒙特卡洛吉布斯采样器和哈密顿蒙特卡洛。我们的分析得出了近似等温的日冕等离子体温度为≈5 MK，日冕等离子体密度为≈1010 cm−3，对应的不确定性分别为0.1和0.2 dex。

We estimate the coronal density of Capella using the O vii and Fe xvii line systems in the soft X-ray regime that have been observed over the course of the Chandra mission. Our analysis combines measures of error due to uncertainty in the underlying atomic data with statistical errors in the Chandra data to derive meaningful overall uncertainties on the plasma density of the coronae of Capella. We consider two Bayesian frameworks. First, the so-called pragmatic Bayesian approach considers the atomic data and their uncertainties as fully specified and uncorrectable. The fully Bayesian approach, on the other hand, allows the observed spectral data to update the atomic data and their uncertainties, thereby reducing the overall errors on the inferred parameters. To incorporate atomic data uncertainties, we obtain a set of atomic data replicates, the distribution of which captures their uncertainty. A principal component analysis of these replicates allows us to represent the atomic uncertainty with a lower-dimensional multivariate Gaussian distribution. A t-distribution approximation of the uncertainties of a subset of plasma parameters including a priori temperature information, obtained from the temperature-sensitive-only Fe xvii spectral line analysis, is carried forward into the density- and temperature-sensitive O vii spectral line analysis. Markov Chain Monte Carlo based model fitting is implemented including Multi-step Monte Carlo Gibbs Sampler and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. Our analysis recovers an isothermally approximated coronal plasma temperature of ≈5 MK and a coronal plasma density of ≈1010 cm−3, with uncertainties of 0.1 and 0.2 dex, respectively.

<br />根据最近的观测，高红移星系中有相当比例的星系具有湍流的、富含气体的盘状结构，其中有规律的旋转和高水平的星形成。一些星系盘还显示出螺旋臂和棒状结构。这些观测结果鼓励我们利用agama/Ramses模拟框架探索一种新的动力学自洽模型，模拟高红移时期可能的银河系的祖先。我们研究了盘状气体分数为fgas = 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 和 100%的情况，并追踪了恒星和金属的形成。高气体表面密度促进了剧烈的恒星形成，而后者又与气体耦合产生湍流。我们研究了三种不同的发展历程：(i) 没有持续的吸积，气体被恒星形成消耗；(ii) 星形成的气体通过冷却在热暗物质晕中得到补充；(iii) 在另一篇文章中，我们讨论这些模型在存在强扰动力的情况下的情况。对于低fdisk（≲0.3）的情况，即盘状暗物质相对于2.2 Rdisk内盘状暗物质的质量分数，星系盘不会形成棒状结构；即使在气体主导内部盘的情况下也是如此。对于占主导地位的重子盘（fdisk ≳ 0.5），在所有气体分数下，湍流气体形成强烈的径向剪切流，大约在500百万年内形成间歇性的形成棒状结构；与无气体模型相比，湍流气体加速了形成棒状结构的速度。对于fgas≲ 60%，所有的棒状结构都能生存，但对于更高的气体分数，棒状结构在1亿年后演变为中央的星系球状结构。这些正在形成恒星的棒状结构与近期发现的高红移阿塔卡马大口径/亚毫米阵列观测到的气体盘结构相似。<br /><br />总结:

Recent observations of high-redshift galaxies (z ≲ 7) reveal that a substantial fraction have turbulent, gas-rich disks with well-ordered rotation and elevated levels of star formation. In some instances, disks show evidence of spiral arms, with bar-like structures. These remarkable observations have encouraged us to explore a new class of dynamically self-consistent models using our agama/Ramses hydrodynamic N-body simulation framework that mimic a plausible progenitor of the Milky Way at high redshift. We explore disk gas fractions of fgas = 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% and track the creation of stars and metals. The high gas surface densities encourage vigorous star formation, which in turn couples with the gas to drive turbulence. We explore three distinct histories: (i) there is no ongoing accretion and the gas is used up by the star formation, (ii) the star-forming gas is replenished by cooling in the hot halo gas, and (iii) in a companion paper, we revisit these models in the presence of a strong perturbing force. At low fdisk (≲0.3), where fdisk is the baryon mass fraction of the disk relative to dark matter within 2.2 Rdisk, a bar does not form in a stellar disk; this remains true even when gas dominates the inner disk potential. For a dominant baryon disk (fdisk ≳ 0.5) at all gas fractions, the turbulent gas forms a strong radial shear flow that leads to an intermittent star-forming bar within about 500 Myr; turbulent gas speeds up the formation of bars compared to gas-free models. For fgas ≲ 60%, all bars survive, but for higher gas fractions, the bar devolves into a central bulge after 1 Gyr. The star-forming bars are reminiscent of recent discoveries in high-redshift Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of gaseous disks.

<div> 波动火车, 快速传播, 阶段振荡, 能量释放, 爆发太阳丝<br />
总结:<br />
本文描述了2023年4月21日发生的三种不同的波动火车：一个宽广的准周期快速传播(QFP)波动火车和双向窄QFP波动火车。宽广的QFP波动火车以圆形波前向外扩散，而双向窄QFP波动火车分别向南北方向传播。这些波动火车的同时出现提供了一个研究它们各自触发机制的良好机会。测量结果显示，宽广的QFP波动火车在不同传播方向的速度范围为300-1100 km/s。双向窄QFP波动火车的速度有显著差异：以1400 km/s的速度向南传播，而向北传播只达到约550 km/s，并伴随着约1-2 km/s²的减速。使用小波分析，我们发现向南北方向传播的波动火车的周期性与耀斑所表现出的准周期脉动非常相似。基于这些结果，窄QFP波动火车很可能是由伴随耀斑的间歇能量释放所激发的。相反，宽广的QFP波动火车与喷发的太阳丝紧密相关，可能归因于喷发太阳丝的展开运动或者快速腔波在太阳丝体内的泄漏。 <div>
This paper presents three distinct wave trains that occurred on 2023 April 21: a broad quasiperiodic fast-propagating (QFP) wave train and bidirectional narrow QFP wave trains. The broad QFP wave train expands outward in a circular wave front, while bidirectional narrow QFP wave trains propagate in the northward and southward directions, respectively. The concurrent presence of the wave trains offers a remarkable opportunity to investigate their respective triggering mechanisms. Measurement shows that the speed of the broad QFP wave train is in the range of 300–1100 km s−1 in different propagating directions. There is a significant difference in the speed of the bidirectional narrow QFP wave trains: the southward propagation achieves 1400 km s−1, while the northward propagation only reaches about 550 km s−1 accompanied by a deceleration of about 1–2 km s−2. Using the wavelet analysis, we find that the periodicity of the propagating wave trains in the southward and northward directions closely matches the quasiperiodic pulsations exhibited by the flares. Based on these results, the narrow QFP wave trains were most likely excited by the intermittent energy release in the accompanying flare. In contrast, the broad QFP wave train had a tight relationship with the erupting filament, probably attributed to the unwinding motion of the erupting filament, or the leakage of the fast sausage wave train inside the filament body.

<div> 关键词: 太阳风, 火星, 地球, 磁层重连接, 能量传输

总结:
太阳风对火星和地球的影响被用全球磁流体力学数值模拟进行了比较。火星缺乏类似地球的全球偶极磁场，而是在南半球高地附近有小尺度的地壳磁场。与地球磁层重连接不同的是，火星的磁堆积边界重连接发生在太阳天顶角约45°的位置（在南向IMF下，或在北向IMF下接近太阳尾部），导致了南北半球之间能量传输的不对称性。在南向（北向）IMF下，火星机械能的流出在太阳天顶角约45°的位置出现（太阳天顶角约30°和60°），伴随着“太阳风拾取”过程的流入。在不论IMF是北向还是南向的情况下，磁堆积边界的能量传输中，电磁能输入是机械能输入的两倍，这与地球在南向IMF下的磁层重连接相似，但在北向IMF下则相反。火星磁堆积边界的能量传输速率在北向IMF下略高于南向IMF，而地球磁层的能量传输速率在南向IMF下远高于北向IMF。 <div>
Using a global magnetohydrodynamics numerical simulation, this work compares the interaction of the solar wind with Mars and Earth from the perspective of energy transfer under north–south interplanetary magnetic fields (IMFs). Mars lacks a global dipole magnetic field like Earth’s and instead has a small-scale crustal magnetic field near highlands in the southern hemisphere. Unlike Earth’s magnetopause reconnection (at the subsolar point or tail under a southward IMF, or behind the cusp under a northward IMF), the reconnection of the Martian magnetic pileup boundary (MPB) occurs near solar zenith angle (SZA) ≈ 45° (SZA ≈ 30° and 60°) for a southward (northward) IMF, resulting in asymmetric energy transfer between the northern and southern hemispheres. The Martian outflow of mechanical energy appears near SZA ≈ 45° (SZA ≈ 30° and 60°) under a southward (northward) IMF, accompanied by an inflow due to the process of “solar wind pickup.” For energy transfer across the MPB, whether the IMF is northward or southward, the input of electromagnetic energy is twice as large as the input of mechanical energy, which is similar to Earth’s magnetopause for a southward IMF, but opposite to it for a northward IMF. The energy transfer rate of the MPB is slightly higher in a northward IMF than in a southward one, whereas the energy transfer rate of Earth’s magnetopause is far higher in a southward IMF than in a northward one.

<div> 关键词: 磁洞, 等离子体, 电子, 磁场, 不稳定性
总结: 
磁洞是空间等离子体中的磁场凹陷，本文报道了两个大尺度磁洞MH1和MH2，首次在其中探测到高达100keV的高能电子。两个磁洞具有许多相似特征，如空间尺度、温度和总压力增加，以及其中的高能电子呈幂律分布。然而，它们也存在一些不同之处，MH1内部探测到了离子流涡和离子尺度的磁结构，并且高能电子的行为也不同于MH2。此外，MH1周围存在镜模不稳定性，而MH2周围则稳定，这表明两个磁洞可能处于不同的镜模不稳定性阶段。观测结果表明，在不同的阶段，电子可能在磁洞内得到显著加速。 <div>
Magnetic holes, characterized as magnetic field depressions, have been widely observed in space plasma. Two large-scale magnetic holes, MH1 and MH2, were reported in this paper and the energetic electrons up to 100 keV were detected for the first time inside both holes. The two holes showed many similar features, comparable spatial scale, temperature and total pressure increase, and energetic electrons up to 100 keV with a power-law distribution inside them. On the other hand, distinct features were also found between these two holes. A potential ion flow vortex was detected inside the MH1 and an ion-scale magnetic structure was observed in its core region. The electron flux enhancements were associated with this ion-scale structure and the energetic electrons were nonadiabatic around the ion-scale structure inside MH1, while the energetic electrons were adiabatic inside the MH2. The mirror-mode instability was unstable around MH1 while stable around MH2, which suggested that the two holes might be in a different phase of the mirror-mode instability. The observations suggested that the electrons could be significantly accelerated inside magnetic holes in the different phases.

For the first time, systematic studies of dwarf galaxies are being conducted throughout the Local Volume, including the dwarf satellites of the nearby giant elliptical galaxy Centaurus A (NGC 5128). Given Centaurus A's mass (roughly 10 times larger than that of the Milky Way), AGN activity, and recent major mergers, investigating the dwarf galaxies of Centaurus A and their star formation physics is imperative. However, simulating the faintest dwarfs around a galaxy of Centaurus A's mass with sufficient resolution in a hydrodynamic simulation is computationally expensive and currently infeasible. In this study, we seek to reproduce the properties of Centaurus A dwarfs using the semianalytic model Galacticus to model dwarfs within a 700 kpc region around Centaurus A, corresponding approximately to its splashback radius. We investigate the effects of host halo mass and environment and predict observable properties of Centaurus A dwarfs using astrophysical prescriptions and parameters previously tuned to match properties of the Milky Way’s satellite galaxies. This approach allows us to approximately replicate cumulative luminosity functions, and luminosity–metallicity and luminosity–half-light-radii relations observed in the Centaurus A satellites. We provide predictions for the velocity dispersions, and star formation histories of Centaurus A dwarfs. The agreement between our predicted star formation histories for Centaurus A dwarfs and those of the Milky Way dwarfs implies the presence of universal processes governing star formation in dwarf galaxies. Overall, our findings shed light on the star formation physics of dwarf galaxies in the Centaurus A system, revealing insights into their properties and dependence on the host environment.

<div> 3D磁流体动力学模型, 高能粒子输运模型, CIR, 压缩磁场区域, 异常各向异性
总结:
本研究提出了一种新的三维磁流体动力学模型和一种新的三维高能粒子输运模型。磁流体动力学模型使用松弛总变差减小方案数值求解理想MHD方程。在磁流体动力学模拟中，使用了高速流的简单边界条件，清晰地识别了一个具有前向冲击波和反向冲击波特征的日冕相互作用区（CIR）。高能粒子输运模型使用Fokker-Planck输运方程求解太阳高能粒子，利用了磁场和太阳风速场的MHD结果。我们的模拟结果表明，压缩磁场区域可以作为散射高能粒子的屏障，并且粒子可能在强磁场区域扩散困难。这一结果可用于复制航天器观测到的异常各向异性现象。 <div>
We present a new three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model and a new 3D energetic particle transport (EPT) model. The 3D MHD model numerically solves the ideal MHD equations using the relaxing total variation diminishing scheme. In the 3D MHD simulations, we use simple boundary conditions with a high-speed flow, and we can clearly identify a corotating interaction region (CIR) with the characteristics of forward shock and reverse shock. The 3D EPT model solves the Fokker–Planck transport equation for the solar energetic particles (SEPs) using backward stochastic processes, with the magnetic field and solar wind velocity field from MHD results. For comparison, the 3D EPT model results with Parker fields are also obtained. We investigate the transport of SEPs with particle sources and observers in different positions in MHD fields with a CIR, and we compare the results with those in the Parker fields. Our simulation results show that the compression region with local enhancement of the magnetic field, i.e., CIR, can act as a barrier to scatter energetic particles back, and particles can struggle to diffuse through the strong magnetic field regions. Usually, a normal anisotropy profile is commonly present in SEP simulation results with Parker fields, and it is also typically present in that with MHD fields. However, because of the compression region of the magnetic field, energetic particles may exhibit anomalous anisotropy. This result may be used to replicate the spacecraft observation phenomena of the anomalous anisotropy.

总结: 
多探测方法对星系团并合提供了重要信息，但是观测到的信号复杂且难以解释。ICM-SHOX框架以系统性的方式利用多种观测方法，并通过与模拟观测数据的比较得出星系团并合的各项参数。研究结果表明MACS J0018.5+1626的并合在近地点通过后约0-60百万年，观测角度离并合轴线倾斜约27°-40°。影响参数约为250千秒差距，质量比约为1.5-3.0，初次相对速度约在1700-3000km/s。同时发现DM和气体成分在速度空间上分离，这与并合的历史、几何结构和观测角度相关。 <div>
Galaxy cluster mergers are rich sources of information to test cluster astrophysics and cosmology. However, cluster mergers produce complex projected signals that are difficult to interpret physically from individual observational probes. Multi-probe constraints on the gas and dark matter (DM) cluster components are necessary to infer merger parameters that are otherwise degenerate. We present Improved Constraints on Mergers with SZ, Hydrodynamical simulations, Optical, and X-ray (ICM-SHOX), a systematic framework to jointly infer multiple merger parameters quantitatively via a pipeline that directly compares a novel combination of multi-probe observables to mock observables derived from hydrodynamical simulations. We report a first application of the ICM-SHOX pipeline to MACS J0018.5+1626, wherein we systematically examine simulated snapshots characterized by a wide range of initial parameters to constrain the MACS J0018.5+1626 merger geometry. We constrain the epoch of MACS J0018.5+1626 to the range 0–60 Myr post-pericenter passage, and the viewing angle is inclined ≈27°–40° from the merger axis. We obtain constraints for the impact parameter (≲250 kpc), mass ratio (≈1.5–3.0), and initial relative velocity when the clusters are separated by 3 Mpc (≈1700–3000 km s−1). The primary and secondary clusters initially (at 3 Mpc) have gas distributions that are moderately and strongly disturbed, respectively. We discover a velocity space decoupling of the DM and gas distributions in MACS J0018.5+1626, traced by cluster-member galaxy velocities and the kinematic Sunyaev–Zel'dovich effect, respectively. Our simulations indicate this decoupling is dependent on the different collisional properties of the two distributions for particular merger epochs, geometries, and viewing angles.

总结:<br />
文章讨论了太阳辐射通过太阳冕层和太阳风传播时受到的影响，提出了一种新的密度波动模型，并推断了等离子体速度以解释观测到的信号频率扩散。推断的速度与太阳风的主导运动一致，但较小尺度范围内的频率扩展需要额外的径向和/或横向速度。推断的径向速度与声速或质子热速度一致，而垂直径向方向的速度与解释为阿尔文波动的冠层多普勒线展宽测量的非热运动一致。文章还讨论了离子声波阻尼的兰道阻尼，提出了质子加热率的估算，以及能量转移的相关内容。 <div>
Radio signals propagating via the solar corona and solar wind are significantly affected by compressive waves, impacting the properties of solar bursts as well as sources viewed through the turbulent solar atmosphere. While static fluctuations scatter radio waves elastically, moving, turbulent, or oscillating density irregularities act to broaden the frequency of the scattered waves. Using a new anisotropic density fluctuation model from the kinetic scattering theory for solar radio bursts, we deduce the plasma velocities required to explain observations of spacecraft signal frequency broadening. The inferred velocities are consistent with motions that are dominated by the solar wind at distances ≳10 R⊙, but the levels of frequency broadening for ≲10 R⊙ require additional radial speeds ∼(100–300) km s−1 and/or transverse speeds ∼(20–70) km s−1. The inferred radial velocities also appear consistent with the sound or proton thermal speeds, while the speeds perpendicular to the radial direction are consistent with nonthermal motions measured via coronal Doppler-line broadening, interpreted as Alfvénic fluctuations. Landau damping of parallel propagating ion-sound (slow MHD) waves allows an estimate of the proton heating rate. The energy deposition rates due to ion-sound wave damping peak at a heliocentric distance of ∼(1–3) R⊙ are comparable to the rates available from a turbulent cascade of Alfvénic waves at large scales, suggesting a coherent picture of energy transfer, via the cascade or/and parametric decay of Alfvén waves to the small scales where heating takes place.

<br /><br />总结: 本研究使用Tomo-e Gozen北天移动天体调查的数据，对241个BL Lacertae (BL Lacs)和83个平谱射线类星体(FSRQs)进行了光学变异性研究，平均每个类星体进行了约50次的观测。研究排除了由于宿主星系光度影响而低估光学变异性的类星体。研究发现，γ射线光子指数高于2.6的FSRQs表现出非常低的光学变异性，并且它们的光度标准差分布与其他FSRQs明显不同。在任何特定的宇宙时期，具有较低γ射线光度的类星体往往具有较低的光学变异性。此外，高γ射线光子指数的FSRQs的结构函数振幅显著低于低γ射线光子指数的FSRQs。这表明高γ射线光子指数的FSRQs的光学组分可能受主星系的影响。 <div>
We studied the optical variability of 241 BL Lacertae (BL Lacs) and 83 flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) from the 4LAC catalog using data from the Tomo-e Gozen Northern Sky Transient Survey, with ∼50 epochs per blazar on average. We excluded blazars whose optical variability may be underestimated due to the influence of their host galaxy based on their optical luminosity (LO). FSRQs with γ-ray photon index greater than 2.6 exhibit very low optical variability, and their distribution of standard deviation of repeated photometry is significantly different from that of the other FSRQs (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test p-value equal to 5 × 10−6). Among a sample of blazars at any particular cosmological epoch, those with lower γ-ray luminosity (Lγ) tend to have lower optical variability, and those FSRQs with a γ-ray photon index greater than 2.6 tend to have low Lγ. We also measured the structure function of optical variability and found that the amplitude of the structure function for FSRQs is higher than previously measured and higher than that of BL Lacs at multiple time lags. Additionally, the amplitude of the structure function of FSRQs with high γ-ray photon index is significantly lower than that of FSRQs with low γ-ray photon index. The structure function of FSRQs of high γ-ray photon index shows a characteristic timescale of more than 10 days, which may be the variability timescale of the accretion disk. In summary, we infer that the optical component of FSRQs with high γ-ray photon index may be dominated by the accretion disk.

X-ray obscuration of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is considered in the context of ionized winds of stratified structure launched from accretion disks. We argue that a Compton-thick layer of a large-scale disk wind can obscure continuum X-rays and also lead to broad UV absorption, such as in the blue wing of C iv; the former originates from the inner wind and the latter from the outer wind, as a dual role. Motivated by a number of lines of observational evidence showing strong AGN obscuration phenomena in Seyfert 1 AGNs such as NGC 5548, we demonstrate in this work, by utilizing a physically motivated wind model coupled to post-process radiative transfer calculations, that an extended disk wind under certain physical conditions (e.g., morphology and density) could naturally cause a sufficient obscuration qualitatively consistent with UV/X-ray observations. Predicted UV/X-ray correlation is also presented as a consequence of variable spatial size of the wind in this scenario.

The paper shows the thermodynamic nature of the evolution of the pickup ion (PUI) distributions through their incorporation and subsequent expansion as the solar wind moves outward through the heliosphere. In particular, the PUI expansive cooling is connected to thermodynamic polytropic processes and the thermodynamic kappa parameter. Previously, the characterization of the cooling was phenomenologically given by a “cooling index” α, which is the exponent involved in the power-law relationship between PUI speed and position. Here, we develop the relationship between the cooling and polytropic indices. Then, we show the connection between the cooling index and the thermodynamic parameter kappa. Finally, we verify the derived thermodynamic relations with direct heliospheric observations over varying distances from the Sun. Going forward, we suggest that studies of PUIs seeking to understand the underlying physics of these important particles rely on the thermodynamic parameter of kappa, and its association with the polytropic index, and not on an ad hoc cooling index.

We present the detection of a magnetized dust ring (M0.8–0.2) in the central molecular zone (CMZ) of the Galactic center. The results presented in this paper utilize the first data release of the Far-Infrared Polarimetric Large Area CMZ Emission (FIREPLACE) survey (i.e., Paper I of this series). The FIREPLACE survey is a 214 μm polarimetric survey of the Galactic center using the SOFIA/HAWC+ telescope. The M0.8–0.2 ring is a region of gas and dust that has a circular morphology with a central depression. The dust polarization in the M0.8–0.2 ring implies a curved magnetic field that traces the ring-like structure of the cloud. We posit an interpretation in which an expanding shell compresses and concentrates the ambient gas and magnetic field. We argue that this compression results in strengthening of the magnetic field, as we infer from the observations toward the interior of the ring.

We present the results of an investigation of a highly variable C iv broad absorption line (BAL) feature in spectra of the quasar SBS 1408+544 (z = 2.337) that shows a significant shift in velocity over time. This source was observed as a part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Reverberation Mapping project and the SDSS-V Black Hole Mapper Reverberation Mapping project, and has been included in two previous studies, both of which identified significant variability in a high-velocity C iv BAL on timescales of just a few days in the quasar rest frame. Using ∼130 spectra acquired over 8 yr of spectroscopic monitoring with SDSS, we have determined that this BAL is not only varying in strength, but is also systematically shifting to higher velocities. Using cross-correlation methods, we measure the velocity shifts (and corresponding acceleration) of the BAL over a wide range of timescales, measuring an overall velocity shift of km s−1 over the 8 yr monitoring period. This corresponds to an average rest-frame acceleration of a = 1.04 cm s−2, though the magnitude of the acceleration on shorter timescales is not constant throughout. We place our measurements in the context of BAL-acceleration models and examine various possible causes of the observed velocity shift.

After correcting for the accretion disk contamination in the observed IR flux, we constrain the torus size (Rdust) and AGN bolometric luminosity (Lbol) relationship with the best-fit slope of 0.39 (0.33) for the W1 (W2) band, which is shallower than expected from the dust radiation equilibrium model. By combining the previous K-band lag measurements, we find that the measured torus size depends on the observed wavelength of the dust radiation, as Rdust,K: Rdust,W1: Rdust,W2 = 1.0:1.5:1.8 (Rdust ∝ λ0.80) at Lbol = 1046 erg s−1, confirming a stratified structure of the torus, where wavelength-dependent emissions originate from distinct regions of the torus. By investigating the deviation from the best-fit torus size–luminosity relation, we find a moderate correlation between the offset from the Rdust–Lbol relation and Eddington ratio. This suggests a possible influence of the Eddington ratio on the observed flattening of the Rdust–Lbol relationship.

<div> VLBI, highest-resolution images, high-frequency observations, ngehtsim, EHT

在这篇论文中，作者使用一个名为ngehtsim的新工具来探索高频VLBI观测的限制。他们使用历史大气模型来模拟观测条件，并通过启发式能见度检测标准来模拟单频和多频VLBI校准策略。作者展示了ngehtsim的预测的准确性，并通过与EHT现有的230 GHz数据的对比来验证其方法。在345 GHz的观测中，预测到EHT的性能会大大降低，M87*的观测可能达不到成像的水平，预计检测率约为20%。通过扩大带宽和/或延长积分时间来提高阵列灵敏度，例如，下一代EHT设想的同时多频升级，可以改善345 GHz的观测前景，并获得与230 GHz相媲美的检测水平。在460 GHz的大气窗口中进行的M87*和Sgr A*观测可能会在长基线上定期获得多次检测，但在690和875 GHz进行的类似观测几乎完全没有检测到。 <br /><br />总结: 高频VLBI观测的限制是由于大气噪声增加导致的灵敏度下降，模拟结果表明，在345 GHz的观测中，EHT的性能可能大大降低，但通过提高阵列灵敏度和观测技术升级，未来仍有望提高观测前景。 <div>
Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) provides the highest-resolution images in astronomy. The sharpest resolution is nominally achieved at the highest frequencies, but as the observing frequency increases, so too does the atmospheric contribution to the system noise, degrading the sensitivity of the array and hampering detection. In this paper, we explore the limits of high-frequency VLBI observations using ngehtsim, a new tool for generating realistic synthetic data. ngehtsim uses detailed historical atmospheric models to simulate observing conditions, and it employs heuristic visibility detection criteria that emulate single- and multifrequency VLBI calibration strategies. We demonstrate the fidelity of ngehtsim’s predictions using a comparison with existing 230 GHz data taken by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), and we simulate the expected performance of EHT observations at 345 GHz. Though the EHT achieves a nearly 100% detection rate at 230 GHz, our simulations indicate that it should expect substantially poorer performance at 345 GHz; in particular, observations of M87* at 345 GHz are predicted to achieve detection rates of ≲20% that may preclude imaging. Increasing the array sensitivity through wider bandwidths and/or longer integration times—as enabled through, e.g., the simultaneous multifrequency upgrades envisioned for the next-generation EHT—can improve the 345 GHz prospects and yield detection levels that are comparable to those at 230 GHz. M87* and Sgr A* observations carried out in the atmospheric window around 460 GHz could expect to regularly achieve multiple detections on long baselines, but analogous observations at 690 and 875 GHz consistently obtain almost no detections at all.

该研究开发了一套用于低质量和太阳型经典T Tauri恒星（CTTS; 0.3M⊙ < M* < 1.2M⊙）的恒星自旋模型。这些模型结合了恒星-盘相互作用和磁层喷射，以研究恒星自旋速率随恒星质量M*、磁场(B*)和恒星风( )的演变。该研究收集和确定了208颗CTTS的恒星参数，如投影自转速度、质量吸积率、恒星质量M*、年龄，并利用Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite(TESS)数据估计了其自转周期。我们还利用[O i] λ 6300谱线估计了样本的代表性质量流失率。研究结果证实了在吸积驱动的恒星风模型中CTTS的自转速率与观测一致。此外，还利用近似贝叶斯计算技术探索了模型参数与CTTS观测特性之间的联系。研究发现，随着年龄的演变,可能会受到B*强度和吸积流在磁风中喷射的分数的变化的调节。我们的样本中最年轻的恒星（∼1 Myr）显示了一个中值分支比和中值B*∼2000 G，而年龄≳3 Myr的恒星的值分别约为∼0.01和1000 G。

We developed a grid of stellar rotation models for low-mass and solar-type classical T Tauri stars (CTTS; 0.3M⊙ < M* < 1.2M⊙). These models incorporate the star–disk interaction and magnetospheric ejections to investigate the evolution of the stellar rotation rate as a function of the mass of the star M*, the magnetic field (B*), and stellar wind ( ). We compiled and determined stellar parameters for 208 CTTS, such as projected rotational velocity , mass accretion rate , stellar mass M*, ages, and estimated rotational periods using Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) data. We also estimated a representative value of the mass-loss rate for our sample using the [O i] λ 6300 spectral line. Our results confirm that measurements in CTTS agree with the rotation rates provided by our spin models in the accretion-powered stellar winds picture. In addition, we used the approximate Bayesian computation technique to explore the connection between the model parameters and the observational properties of CTTS. We find that the evolution of with age might be regulated by variations in (1) the intensity of B* and (2) the fraction of the accretion flow ejected in magnetic winds, removing angular momentum from these systems. The youngest stars in our sample (∼1 Myr) show a median branching ratio and median B* ∼ 2000 G, in contrast to ∼0.01 and 1000 G, respectively, for stars with ages ≳3 Myr.

总结: 
PSR J1849-0001和其脉冲星风星云(PSR J1849-000)与TeV源HESS J1849-000重合。研究通过分析新旧CXO数据，解析了脉冲星和PWN，探索了PWN的形态并测量了不同区域的光谱。脉冲星和内部PWN的光谱均呈硬态。PWN具有相对较低的亮度，缺乏γ射线脉冲，观测结果表明脉冲星的自旋和磁偶极轴之间的角度较小，与一些MeV脉冲星具有相似特性。尽管联合X射线和TeV能谱的单一区模型可以描述，但得到的磁场值不切实际，更合理的场景是存在一个遗迹星风星云，不再通过同步辐射发出X射线，但仍通过逆Compton散射在TeV波段辐射。此外，还偶然检测到一个非常明亮的广泛双星X射线辐射。 <br /><br /> <div>
We obtained a 108 ks Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO) observation of PSR J1849-0001 and its pulsar wind nebula (PWN) coincident with the TeV source HESS J1849-000. By analyzing the new and old (archival) CXO data, we resolved the pulsar from the PWN, explored the PWN morphology on arcsecond and arcminute scales, and measured the spectra of different regions of the PWN. Both the pulsar and the compact inner PWN spectra are hard with power-law photon indices of 1.20 ± 0.07 and 1.49 ± 0.20, respectively. The jet-dominated PWN has a relatively low luminosity, lack of γ-ray pulsations, relatively hard and nonthermal spectrum of the pulsar, and sine-like pulse profile, which indicates a relatively small angle between the pulsar’s spin and magnetic dipole axis. In this respect, it shares similar properties with a few other so-called MeV pulsars. Although the joint X-ray and TeV spectral energy distribution can be roughly described by a single-zone model, the obtained magnetic field value is unrealistically low. A more realistic scenario is the presence of a relic PWN, no longer emitting synchrotron X-rays but still radiating in TeV via inverse-Compton upscattering. We also serendipitously detected surprisingly bright X-ray emission from a very wide binary whose components should not be interacting.

总结:<br /><br />本研究通过推导离子化至V-XI态的La至Ra元素（Z = 57-88）的原子不透明度，研究了中子星合并早期（t < 1天）的kilonova现象。结果显示，具有开放f-壳层的元素的高温下光学厚度异常高，而相同温度和波长下具有开放d-、p-和s-壳层的元素的光学厚度分别为0.1和0.01 cm2 g−1。研究发现，富含镧系元素的喷射物的全波段光度显示出明显的特征，并且比不含镧系元素的喷射物要暗淡。早期光度受薄外层存在的影响而受到抑制。研究还指出，能够复制有或无镧系元素的全波段光曲线的灰色不透明度分别为1-10和0.8 cm2 g−1。研究结果表明，这样的kilonova现象是未来紫外卫星和巡天项目的理想观测目标。 <div>
We investigate early (t < 1 day) kilonova from a neutron star merger by deriving atomic opacities for all the elements from La to Ra (Z = 57–88) ionized to the states V–XI. The opacities at high temperatures for the elements with open f-shells (e.g., lanthanides) are exceptionally high, reaching at λ ≤ 1000 Å at T ∼ 70,000 K, whereas the opacities at the same temperature and wavelengths for the elements with open d-, p-, and s-shells reach , 0.1, and 0.01 cm2 g−1, respectively. Using the new opacity data set, we derive early kilonovae for various compositions and density structures expected for neutron star merger ejecta. The bolometric luminosity of the lanthanide-rich ejecta shows distinct signatures and is fainter than that of the lanthanide-free ejecta. Early luminosity is suppressed by the presence of a thin outer layer, agreeing with the results of Kasen et al. and Banerjee et al. The early brightness in the Swift UVOT filters and in the optical g, r, i, and z filters for a source at 100 Mpc are about ∼22–19.5 and ∼21–20 mag, respectively, at t ∼ 0.1 day. Such kilonovae are ideal targets for the upcoming UV satellites, such as ULTRASAT, UVEX, and DORADO, and the upcoming surveys, e.g., the Vera Rubin Observatory. We suggest that the gray opacities that reproduce the bolometric light curves with and without lanthanides are ∼1–10 and ∼0.8 cm2 g−1.

The principal regular satellites of gas giants are thought to be formed by the accumulation of solid materials in circumplanetary disks (CPDs). While there has been significant progress in the study of satellite formation in CPDs, details of the supply of satellite building blocks to CPDs remain unclear. We perform the orbital integration of solid particles in the protoplanetary disk (PPD) approaching a planet, considering the gas drag force by using the results of three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of a local region around the planet. We investigate the planetary mass dependence of the capture positions and the capture rates of dust particles accreting onto the CPD. We also examine the degree of dust retention in the accreting gas onto the CPD, which is important for determining the ratio of the dust-to-gas inflow rates, a key parameter in satellite formation. We find that the degree of dust retention increases with increasing planetary mass for a given dust scale height in the PPD. In the case of a small planet (Mp = 0.2MJup), most particles with insufficient initial altitudes in the PPD are isolated from the gas in the accreting region. On the other hand, in the case of a massive planet (Mp = 1MJup), dust particles can be coupled to the vertically accreting gas, even when the dust scale height is about 10%–30% of the gas scale height. The results of this study can be used for models of dust delivery and satellite formation in the CPDs of gas giants of various masses, including exoplanets.

Flows driven by photons have been studied for almost a century, and a quantitative description of the radiative forces on atoms and ions is important for understanding a wide variety of systems with outflows and accretion disks, such as active galactic nuclei (AGN). Quantifying the associated forces is crucial to determining how these outflows enable interactive mechanisms within these environments, such as AGN feedback. The total number of spectral lines in any given ion of the outflow material must be tabulated in order to give a complete characterization of this force. Here, we provide calculations of the dimensionless line force multiplier for AGN environments. For a wide array of representative AGN sources, we explicitly calculate the photoionization balance at the proposed wind-launching region above the accretion disk, compute the strength of the line-driving force on the gas, and revisit and formalize the role of the commonly used ionization parameter ξ in ultimately determining the line-driving force. We perform these computations and analyses for a variety of AGN central source properties, such as black hole mass, initial wind velocity, and number density. We find that, while useful, the ionization parameter provides an incomplete description of the overall ionization state of the outflow material. We use these findings to provide an updated method for calculating the strength of the radiative line-driving using both the X-ray spectral index ΓX and the ionization parameter.

FRB观测研究了128个非重复快速射电暴的偏振特性，发现89个具有线偏振检测，29个无线偏振，10个受到仪器偏振的影响；对于线偏振的FRB，发现RM在0.5–1160 rad m−2范围内，大部分与银河系类似；FRB的偏振位置角分为四种类型；未发现整体频率相关消偏振的证据，因此线偏振分布差异可能源于FRB的发射机制；提出了一种新方法用于判断偏振FRB的红移下限。 <br /><br />总结: <div>
We present a 400–800 MHz polarimetric analysis of 128 nonrepeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) from the first CHIME/FRB baseband catalog, increasing the total number of FRB sources with polarization properties by a factor of ∼3. A total of 89 FRBs have >6σ linearly polarized detections, 29 FRBs fall below this significance threshold and are deemed linearly unpolarized, and for 10 FRBs, the polarization data are contaminated by instrumental polarization. For the 89 polarized FRBs, we find Faraday rotation measure (RM) amplitudes, after subtracting approximate Milky Way contributions, in the range 0.5–1160 rad m−2 with a median of 53.8 rad m−2. Most nonrepeating FRBs in our sample have RMs consistent with Milky Way–like host galaxies, and their linear polarization fractions range from ≤10% to 100% with a median of 63%. We see marginal evidence that nonrepeating FRBs have more constraining lower limits than repeating FRBs for the host electron-density-weighted line of sight magnetic field strength. We classify the nonrepeating FRB polarization position angle (PA) profiles into four archetypes: (i) single component with constant PA (57% of the sample), (ii) single component with variable PA (10%), (iii) multiple components with a single-constant PA (22%), and (iv) multiple components with different or variable PAs (11%). We see no evidence for population-wide frequency-dependent depolarization, and, therefore, the spread in the distribution of fractional linear polarization is likely intrinsic to the FRB emission mechanism. Finally, we present a novel method to derive redshift lower limits for polarized FRBs without host galaxy identification and test this method on 20 FRBs with independently measured redshifts.

We report on a multiwavelength study of the Wolf–Rayet star [KSF2015] 1381-19L, which is located in the solar metallicity region (Z = 0.014) of the Milky Way, strongly obscured by interstellar dust. We perform a detailed characterization of the stellar atmosphere by fitting the spectral emission lines observed in the optical and near-infrared (NIR) bands, using CMFGEN. The best-fitted spectroscopic model indicates a highly luminous (105.89L⊙) star with a large radius (15 R⊙) and effective temperature, wind terminal velocity, and chemical composition similar to those of Galactic WC9-dusty (WC9d)-type stars. The atmospheric ionization structure shows coexisting ionization states of different elements, simultaneously affecting the opacity and thermal electron balance. Fitting of the spectral energy data reveals high interstellar optical extinction (AV = 8.87), while the IR extinction is found to be comparatively lower ( ). We do not detect any excess emission at NIR wavelengths due to dust. Upon comparison of our results with the GENEVA single-star evolutionary models (Z = 0.014), we identify the best possible progenitors (a rotating star of 67 M⊙ and a nonrotating star of 90 M⊙).

Radiation pressure exerted by solar photon output is salient to the motion of primary neutral hydrogen atoms streaming into the inner heliosphere directly from the local interstellar medium. The action of a time-dependent radiation pressure force, when coupled with the usual gravitational force, changes the characteristic velocities, and therefore energies, of the atoms when they reach regions in which explorer probes are present. A study is presented that uses a 2D code to backtrace neutral hydrogen trajectories from representative target points located 1 au from the Sun. It makes use of both a radiation pressure function and a function for the photoionization rate at 1 au that both oscillate with time based on measurements over a typical solar cycle, as well as a time-independent charge exchange ionization rate at 1 au. Assuming a Maxwellian distribution in the distant upwind direction, phase space data is calculated at the target points, at different moments in time. The dependence of the force on the radial particle velocity has been omitted in the analysis, such that the emphasis is on the effects of the global solar UV intensity variations through the solar cycle. This process allows for the analysis of direct and indirect Maxwellian components through time and space in the time-dependent force environment. Additionally, pseudo-bound orbits caused by energy losses associated with this force environment are observed, and their properties are evaluated with the aim of determining their effects on potential measurements by explorer probes.

<div> TDEs, super-Eddington accretion, slim-disk model, radiation-driven disk wind, Cloudy modeling<br /> 

总结:<br />本文探讨了来自潮汐破坏事件形成的包层的演化，通过解决slim-disk模型的全局解。我们的模型能大致再现TDEs的典型温度、亮度和光球大小。通过Cloudy建模，我们发现仅考虑辐射驱动的盘风时，发射线亮度通常远低于典型的观测结果，这是由于包层外部的有限大气层质量所致。我们提出了通过星体碎片围绕过程中的自碰撞所产生的喷流推出盘风光球外部足够的物质。我们计算的光谱能够大致再现几种典型发射线（如Hα，Hβ和He ii）的主要性质，这在TDE候选AT2018dyb上得到了很好的应用。 <div>
The theoretical debris supply rate from a tidal disruption of stars can exceed about 100 times of Eddington accretion rate for a 106−7M⊙ supermassive black hole. It is believed that a strong wind will be launched from the disk surface due to the radiation pressure in the case of super-Eddington accretion, which may be one of the mechanisms for the formation of the envelope, as observed in tidal disruption events (TDEs). In this work, we explore the evolution of the envelope that formed from the optical thick winds by solving the global solution of the slim-disk model. Our model can roughly reproduce the typical temperature, luminosity, and size of the photosphere for TDEs. Based on Cloudy modeling, we find that, if only considering the radiation-driven disk wind, the emission line luminosities are normally much lower than the typical observational results, due to the limited atmosphere mass outside the envelope. We propose that the ejection of the outflow from the self-collision of the stellar debris during the circularization may provide enough matter outside the disk-wind photosphere. Our calculated spectra can roughly reproduce the main properties of several typical emission lines (e.g., Hα, Hβ, and He ii), which was applied well to a TDE candidate AT2018dyb.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a set of 1194 Type-1 Rosseland-mean opacity tables for four different metallicity mixtures. These new Los Alamos OPLIB atomic radiative opacity tables are an order of magnitude larger in number than any previous opacity table release, and span regimes where previous opacity tables have not existed. For example, the new set of opacity tables expands the metallicity range to Z = 10−6 to Z = 0.2, which allows improved accuracy of opacities at low and high metallicity, increases the table density in the metallicity range Z = 10−4 to Z = 0.1 to enhance the accuracy of opacities drawn from interpolations across neighboring metallicities, and adds entries for hydrogen mass fractions between X = 0 and X = 0.1 including X = 10−2, 10−3, 10−4, 10−5, 10−6 that can improve stellar models of hydrogen deficient stars. We implement these new OPLIB radiative opacity tables in MESA and find that calibrated solar models agree broadly with previously published helioseismic and solar neutrino results. We find differences between using the new 1194 OPLIB opacity tables and the 126 OPAL opacity tables range from ≈20% to 80% across individual chemical mixtures, up to ≈8% and ≈15% at the bottom and top of the solar convection zone respectively, and ≈7% in the solar core. We also find differences between standard solar models using different opacity table sources that are on par with altering the initial abundance mixture. We conclude that this new, open-access set of OPLIB opacity tables does not solve the solar modeling problem, and suggest the investigation of physical mechanisms other than the atomic radiative opacity.

<title>Spectropolarimetric Radio Imaging of Faint Gyrosynchrotron Emission from a CME: A Possible Indication of the Insufficiency of Homogeneous Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The geo-effectiveness of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is determined primarily by their magnetic fields. Modeling of gyrosynchrotron (GS) emission is a promising remote sensing technique to measure the CME magnetic field at coronal heights. However, faint GS emission from CME flux ropes is hard to detect in the presence of bright solar emission from the solar corona. With high dynamic-range spectropolarimetric meter wavelength solar images provided by the Murchison Widefield Array, we have detected faint GS emission from a CME out to ∼8.3 R⊙, the largest heliocentric distance reported to date. High-fidelity polarimetric calibration also allowed us to robustly detect circularly polarized emission from GS emission. For the first time in the literature, Stokes V detection has jointly been used with Stokes I spectra to constrain GS models. One expects that the inclusion of polarimetric measurement will provide tighter constraints on the GS model parameters. Instead, we found that homogeneous GS models, which have been used in all prior works, are unable to model both the total intensity and circular polarized emission simultaneously. This strongly suggests the need for using inhomogeneous GS models to robustly estimate the CME magnetic field and plasma parameters.

<title>Equator to Pole Solar Chromospheric Differential Rotation Using Ca-K Features Derived from Kodaikanal Data</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Differential rotation is one of the basic characteristics of the Sun, and it plays an important role in generating the magnetic fields and its activities. We investigated rotation rate using chromospheric features such as plages, enhanced network (EN), active network (AN), and quiet network (QN) separately (for the first time). The digitized Ca-K images from Kodaikanal Observatory for 1907–1996 are used to study rotation over 0°–80° latitudes at an interval of 10°. We find that plages and all types of networks exhibit the differential rotation of the chromosphere. Furthermore, the rotation rate shows a decreasing pattern as one move from the equator to the higher polar latitudes for all the features used in the study. At the equator the rotation rate (rotation period) is obtained to be ∼13.98° day−1 (25.74 days), ∼13.91° day−1 (25.88 days), ∼13.99° day−1 (25.74 days), and ∼14.11° day−1 (25.51 days) for plage, EN, AN, and QN areas, respectively. By analyzing how the area of chromospheric features varies over time, we can effectively map the Sun’s rotation rate at all latitudes, including the polar regions. Interestingly, both plages and small-scale networks exhibit a similar differential rotation rate. This suggests these features likely rooted at the same layer below the visible surface of the Sun. Therefore, the long-term Ca-K data is very useful for studying the solar rotation rate at all latitudes including the polar regions.

<title>Properties of Galactic B[e] Supergiants. X. Refined Orbit and Fundamental Parameters of the HD 327083 Binary System</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
HD 327083 is a binary system that consists of two supergiant components and exhibits the B[e] phenomenon. In this paper, we report the determination of a new set of the system’s fundamental parameters using a combination of photometric and spectroscopic data as well as the Gaia EDR3 distance. We found that the orbital period of the system is 107.68 ± 0.02 days. The spectral line content implies the effective temperatures of ≈7000 K and 25,400 ± 1400 K, while the photometric variations are consistent with the radii of ≈106 R⊙ and ≈10 R⊙ for the cool and hot components, respectively. The absorption lines of the cool component show a radial velocity semiamplitude of 48.3 ± 1.7 km s−1, similar to that of the emission lines that originate around the hot component. The inclination of the system to the line of sight is °. Modeling of the system's evolutionary history suggests that the components have masses of ∼12.5 M⊙ and currently undergo mass transfer between them. This configuration, which takes in heating of the surface of the cool component by the radiation from the hot one, can reproduce the photometric and spectroscopic data and is in agreement with previous infrared observations of the circumbinary disk. The results of this study further confirm the hypothesis that the reason for the presence of the B[e] phenomenon in most objects is a consequence of the evolution of various binary systems.

<title>Investigating the Ultracompact X-Ray Binary Candidate SLX 1735-269 with NICER and NuSTAR</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present two simultaneous NICER and NuSTAR observations of the ultracompact X-ray binary (UCXB) candidate SLX 1735−269 while the source was in two different spectral states. Using various reflection modeling techniques, we find that xillverCO, a model used for fitting X-ray spectra of UCXBs with high carbon and oxygen abundances is an improvement over relxill or relxillNS, which instead contains solar-like chemical abundances. This provides indirect evidence in support of the source being ultracompact. We also use this reflection model to get a preliminary measurement of the inclination of the system, degrees. This is consistent with our timing analysis, where a lack of eclipses indicates an inclination of i < 80°. The timing analysis is otherwise inconclusive, and we cannot confidently measure the orbital period of the system.

<title>The Relation between the Cool-core Radius and the Host Galaxy Clusters: Thermodynamic Properties and Cluster Mass</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad4298</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad4298</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a detailed study of cool-core systems in a sample of four galaxy clusters (RXCJ1504.1-0248, A3112, A4059, and A478) using archival X-ray data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory. Cool cores are frequently observed at the centers of galaxy clusters and are considered to be formed by radiative cooling of the intracluster medium (ICM). Cool cores are characterized by a significant drop in the ICM temperature toward the cluster center. We extract and analyze X-ray spectra of the ICM to measure the radial profiles of the ICM thermodynamic properties, including temperature, density, pressure, entropy, and radiative cooling time. We define the cool-core radius as the turnover radius in the ICM temperature profile and investigate the relation between the cool-core radius and the properties of the host galaxy clusters. In our sample, we observe that the radiative cooling time of the ICM at the cool-core radius exceeds 10 Gyr, with RXCJ1504.1-0248 exhibiting a radiative cooling time of Gyr at its cool-core radius. These results indicate that not only radiative cooling but also additional mechanisms, such as gas sloshing, may play an important role in determining the size of cool cores. Additionally, we might find that the best-fit relation between the cool-core radius and the cluster mass (M500) is consistent with a linear relation. Our findings may suggest that cool cores are linked to the evolution of their host galaxy clusters.

<title>Understanding Solar Activity after the Maunder Minimum: Sunspot Records by Rost and Alischer</title>

<div> Maunder Minimum, solar activity, sunspot, observers, transition
<br /><br />总结:  Maunder Minimum是一个太阳活动显著降低的时期，这项研究对此进行了重新审视。研究中发现，对于这一时期的太阳活动水平存在差异。通过重新统计太阳黑子观测数据，发现了对于1716年至1726年太阳活动的错误解读。研究还发现，通过主动日分数方法获取的太阳活动数值明显低于官方太阳黑子观测值，但与放射性同位素等太阳活动代理数值一致。这一研究结果表明，Maunder Minimum后太阳活动的恢复过程比之前认为的更为缓慢且强度较低。 <div>
The Maunder Minimum was a period with significantly reduced solar activity between 1645 and 1715, approximately. The transition between the low solar activity in the Maunder Minimum and the subsequent “normal” regime of solar activity was gradual. However, there are discrepancies in the solar activity level from sunspot number indices and solar activity proxies in that period. Among the contemporaneous observers, Johann L. Rost and Sebastian Alischer were two key sunspot observers to understand the solar activity in this transition just after the Maunder Minimum. We have revised all their sunspot records, counting the number of groups and individual sunspots to derive reliable data for the solar activity level for the period 1716–1726. We found significant misinterpretations of the sunspot group counting assigned to these astronomers in the existing group number databases. Our new group sunspot counting significantly reduces the number of groups for Rost and Alischer’s observations compared to entries in existing databases. Furthermore, our sunspot number estimates (obtained from the active day fraction methodology) of the maximum amplitude of Solar Cycles −3 and −4 are significantly lower than the amplitudes according to the official sunspot number, but they are compatible with sunspot number values obtained from solar activity proxies such as radioisotopes. Our result would imply that solar activity after the Maunder Minimum recovered more gradually and with a lower intensity than previously considered.

总结:<br />
本研究分析了Chandra X射线望远镜对NGC 4945星系进行的观测，研究了星系中心热气体的性质以及其质量流出率。研究发现，热气体的温度和数密度在星系中心最大，沿着流出区逐渐减小，这和球对称且绝热膨胀的风模型不一致，暗示了需要考虑质量加载和/或非球对称的外流几何形状。研究估计热风的质量流出率约为每年1.6太阳质量。在北部流出区检测到了来自电荷交换的辐射，估计其贡献了约12%的X射线流量。 <div>
We analyze 330 ks of Chandra X-ray imaging and spectra of the nearby, edge-on starburst and Seyfert type 2 galaxy NGC 4945 to measure the hot gas properties along the galactic outflows. We extract and model spectra from 15 regions extending from −0.55 to +0.85 kpc above and below the galactic disk to determine the best-fit parameters and metal abundances. We find that the hot gas temperatures and number densities peak in the central regions and decrease along the outflows. These profiles are inconsistent with a spherical, adiabatically expanding wind model, suggesting the need to include mass loading and/or a nonspherical outflow geometry. We estimate the mass outflow rate of the hot wind to be 1.6 M⊙ yr−1. Emission from charge exchange is detected in the northern outflow, and we estimate it contributes 12% to the emitted, broadband (0.5–7 keV) X-ray flux.

总结：<br /><br />这项研究使用Fermi All-sky Variability Analysis对779周的Fermi大面积望远镜数据进行分析，估计在银河系中的γ射线闪烁的发生率，并寻找新的变化的γ射线暂现象。研究发现每年大约有8.5个银河γ射线闪烁事件发生，其中有大约1个来自未知来源。此外，研究还发现了六个新的γ射线暂现现象，这些现象可能是脉冲星或未知性质的天体，它们在空间位置上与已知的超新星遗迹或脉冲星星风星雾重叠。此外，研究还发现了九次不太可能来自已知γ射线源的未关联的闪烁事件。 <div>
The Fermi All-sky Variability Analysis (FAVA) provides a photometric alternative for identifying week-long gamma-ray flares across the entire sky while being independent of any diffuse Galactic or isotropic emission model. We reviewed 779 weeks of Fermi Large Area Telescope data analyzed by FAVA to estimate the rate and origin of Galactic gamma-ray flares, and to search for new variable Galactic gamma-ray transients. We report an estimated yearly rate of ∼8.5 Galactic gamma-ray flares yr–1, with ∼1 flare yr–1 coming from unknown sources. Out of the known gamma-ray sources that are spatially coincident with these detected flares, we report gamma-ray flares for six of them for the first time. All six are classified as pulsars, or a source of unknown nature but which positionally overlaps with known supernova remnants or pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe). This potentially means these sites are tentative candidates to be the second known site of a variable gamma-ray PWN, after the famous Crab Nebula’s PWN. Additionally, we identify nine unassociated flares that are unlikely to have originated from known gamma-ray sources.

<div> FAST, THINGS, diffuse H i, tidal interactions, rotational motion
总结:<br /><br />这项统计研究对比了通过FAST（FEASTS program）和干涉仪 Very Large Array（THINGS program）探测到的10个邻近星系中弥散H i的性质。THINGS观测由于干涉仪的短基线问题和有限的灵敏度，平均错过了23%的H i。研究提取了通过THINGS数据和统一流量密度阈值获得的密集H i，然后从FAST探测到的总H i中减去，得到了弥散H i。在样本中，弥散H i的中值比例为34％，在展现更显著潮汐相互作用迹象的星系中发现了更多的弥散H i。我们发现的弥散H i似乎分布在典型厚度为1 kpc的盘状层内，与之前的研究中发现的NGC 4631周围更类似于halo的弥散H i。大部分弥散H i与密集H i 在空间上重合，并具有1017.7–1020.1 cm−2的典型柱密度。弥散和密集的H i表现出类似的旋转运动，但弥散H i至少在内部盘中落后中值25％，并且其速度离散通常是密集H i的两倍。根据环星系介质性质的简化估算并假设压力平衡，弥散H i的体积密度在每个星系内似乎保持恒定，这暗示了其作为冷却界面的作用。与现有模型相比，这些结果与潮汐相互作用、弥散H i的形成和气体吸积之间可能存在的联系是一致的。 <div>
We present a statistical study of the properties of diffuse H i in 10 nearby galaxies, comparing the H i detected by the single-dish telescope FAST (FEASTS program) and the interferometer Very Large Array (THINGS program), respectively. The THINGS observation missed H i with a median of 23% due to the short-spacing problem of interferometry and limited sensitivity. We extract the diffuse H i by subtracting the dense H i, which is obtained from the THINGS data with a uniform flux-density threshold, from the total H i detected by FAST. Among the sample, the median diffuse-H i fraction is 34%, and more diffuse H i is found in galaxies exhibiting more prominent tidal-interaction signatures. The diffuse H i we detected seems to be distributed in disk-like layers within a typical thickness of 1 kpc, different from the more halo-like diffuse H i detected around NGC 4631 in a previous study. Most of the diffuse H i is cospatial with the dense H i and has a typical column density of 1017.7–1020.1 cm−2. The diffuse and dense H i exhibit a similar rotational motion, but the former lags by a median of 25% in at least the inner disks, and its velocity dispersions are typically twice as high. Based on a simplified estimation of circumgalactic medium properties and assuming pressure equilibrium, the volume density of diffuse H i appears to be constant within each individual galaxy, implying its role as a cooling interface. Comparing with existing models, these results are consistent with a possible link between tidal interactions, the formation of diffuse H i, and gas accretion.

<div> Modified Newtonian dynamics, MOND, breakdown, Newton's laws, gravity, dark matter

总结: 本文介绍了MOND假设在太阳系中的测试，研究结果表明，在使用Bekenstein-Milgrom AQUAL公式进行模拟时，MOND无法解释来自地球可探测到的长周期和奥尔特云彗星的结合能分布。这个结论经过了多种变化的检验，包括行星的迁移历史、太阳的迁移历史、AQUAL的转换函数、太阳出生星团的影响以及长周期彗星的褪色特性。此外，对于AQUAL的最受欢迎版本而言，我们的MOND模拟也无法再现逆行盘中外天王星以外天体的轨道分布（近日点 q > 38 au）。因此，这些结果并不排除一些比AQUAL更为复杂的MOND理论，其中非牛顿效应在小空间尺度、小质量或与临界加速度相当的外部引力场中被屏蔽。 <div>
Modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND), which postulates a breakdown of Newton's laws of gravity/dynamics below some critical acceleration threshold, can explain many otherwise puzzling observational phenomena on galactic scales. MOND competes with the hypothesis of dark matter, which successfully explains the cosmic microwave background and large-scale structure. Here we provide the first solar system test of MOND that probes the subcritical acceleration regime. Using the Bekenstein–Milgrom “aquadratic Lagrangian” (or AQUAL) formulation, we simulate the evolution of myriads of test particles (planetesimals or comets) born in the trans-Neptunian region and scattered by the giant planets over the lifetime of the Sun to heliocentric distances of 102–105 au. We include the effects of the Galactic tidal field and passing stars. While Newtonian simulations reproduce the distribution of binding energies of long-period and Oort-cloud comets detectable from Earth, MOND-based simulations do not. This conclusion is robust to plausible changes in the migration history of the planets, the migration history of the Sun, the MOND transition function, effects of the Sun's birth cluster, and the fading properties of long-period comets. For the most popular version of AQUAL, characterized by a gradual transition between the Newtonian and MOND regimes, our MOND-based simulations also fail to reproduce the orbital distribution of trans-Neptunian objects in the detached disk (perihelion q > 38 au). Our results do not rule out some MOND theories more elaborate than AQUAL, in which non-Newtonian effects are screened on small spatial scales, at small masses, or in external gravitational fields comparable in strength to the critical acceleration.

<div> 关键词: sub-GeV dark matter, Milky Way, cosmic-ray fluxes, annihilation, XMM-Newton
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了亚GeV暗物质粒子，可能通过湮灭或衰变产生在银河系中留下痕迹的光子和宇宙射线流量。特别是，暗物质粒子可能会湮灭或衰变成e+e−、μ+μ−或π+π−，并通过它们的e±产生光子辐射。得出的e±产品可以在探测器中直接观察到，例如Voyager 1号。另外，e±产品可能会产生布伦喷射辐射并通过逆康普顿过程向低能银河光子场进行反散射，产生从X射线到γ射线能量的广泛辐射，可在XMM-Newton等实验中观测到。研究发现，包括最佳CR传播和扩散参数后，从XMM-Newton获得了对DM湮灭和衰变的显著改进限制。这对于1 MeV到几GeV范围内的DM质量来说是最强大的天体物理限制，并且甚至在各种质量上超过了宇宙学限制。 <div>
We study sub-GeV dark matter (DM) particles that may annihilate or decay into Standard Model particles producing an exotic injection component in the Milky Way that leaves an imprint in both photon and cosmic-ray (CR) fluxes. Specifically, the DM particles may annihilate or decay into e+e−, μ+μ−, or π+π− and may radiate photons through their e± products. The resulting e± products can be directly observed in probes such as Voyager 1. Alternatively, the e± products may produce bremsstrahlung radiation and upscatter the low-energy Galactic photon fields via the inverse Compton process, generating a broad emission from X-ray to γ-ray energies observable in experiments such as XMM-Newton. We find that we get a significant improvement in the DM annihilation and decay constraints from XMM-Newton (excluding thermally averaged cross sections of 10−31 cm3 s−1 ≲ 〈σv〉 ≲ 10−26 cm3 s−1 and decay lifetimes of 1026 s ≲ τ ≲ 1028 s, respectively) by including best-fit CR propagation and diffusion parameters. This yields the strongest astrophysical constraints for this mass range of DM of 1 MeV to a few GeV and even surpasses cosmological bounds across a wide range of masses as well.

Planets in multiplanet systems are expected to migrate inward as near-resonant chains, thus allowing them to undergo gravitational planet–planet interactions and possibly maintain a nonzero obliquity. The TRAPPIST-1 system is in such a near-resonant configuration, making it plausible that TRAPPIST-1e has a nonzero obliquity. In this work, we use the ExoCAM general circulation model to study the possible climates of TRAPPIST-1e at varying obliquities and atmospheric compositions. We vary obliquity from 0° to 90° and the partial pressure of carbon dioxide from 0.0004 bar (modern Earth-like) to 1 bar. We find that models with a higher obliquity are hotter overall and have a smaller day–night temperature contrast than the lower-obliquity models, which is consistent with previous studies. Most significantly, the superrotating high-altitude jet becomes subrotating at high obliquity, thus impacting cloud and surface temperature patterns. As the amount of carbon dioxide increases, the climate of TRAPPIST-1e becomes hotter, cloudier, and less variable. From modeled thermal phase curves, we find that the impact of obliquity could potentially have observable consequences due to the effect of cloud coverage on the outgoing longwave radiation.

SDSS J022932.28+713002.7是一个处于形成阶段的极低质量白矮星，其轨道周期为36小时，围绕着一颗质量大于1太阳质量的伴星运转。作者利用光谱学和光度学数据，测量了主要的前ELM白矮星的星体参数。主要白矮星的光变曲线表现为椭球形变化，结合径向速度数据和PHOEBE二进制模拟，估算出了看不见的伴星的质量。主白矮星的质量为太阳质量，而不可见的二级伴星的质量为太阳质量。伴星的质量表明它很可能是一个接近钱德拉塞卡极限质量的白矮星或是一个中子星。这个系统很可能最近从可见的主星向不可见的伴星发生罗奇波溢出。这个二进制系统的动力学配置与理论演化路径一致，主要白矮星目前正处于收缩阶段。测得的轨道周期将使这个系统走上稳定的演化路径，在数十亿年内，会形成一颗紧缩的ELM白矮星围绕着一颗致密的伴星。<br /><br />总结:SDSS J022932.28+713002.7是一个处于形成阶段的极低质量白矮星，其伴星质量较大，可能是一个接近钱德拉塞卡极限质量的白矮星或是一个中子星。该系统最近可能发生了罗奇波溢出。主要白矮星目前正处于收缩阶段，而测得的轨道周期将使这个系统走上稳定的演化路径。 <div>
We report the discovery of SDSS J022932.28+713002.7, a nascent extremely low-mass (ELM) white dwarf (WD) orbiting a massive (>1 M⊙ at 2σ confidence) companion with a period of 36 hr. We use a combination of spectroscopy, including data from the ongoing fifth-generation Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-V), and photometry to measure the stellar parameters of the primary pre-ELM WD. The lightcurve of the primary WD exhibits ellipsoidal variation, which we combine with radial velocity data and PHOEBE binary simulations to estimate the mass of the invisible companion. We find that the primary WD has mass M1 = M⊙ and the unseen secondary has mass M2 = M⊙. The mass of the companion suggests that it is most likely a near-Chandrasekhar-mass WD or a neutron star. It is likely that the system recently went through a Roche lobe overflow from the visible primary onto the invisible secondary. The dynamical configuration of the binary is consistent with the theoretical evolutionary tracks for such objects, and the primary is currently in its contraction phase. The measured orbital period puts this system on a stable evolutionary path which, within a few gigayears, will lead to a contracted ELM WD orbiting a massive compact companion.

<div> late-type, highly inclined disk galaxies, extraplanar X-ray point sources, Virgo cluster, Chandra observations, excess of X-ray sources

总结: 本研究对维尔戈星系团中的19个高度倾斜的后期型盘状星系进行了系统搜索，发现了在离盘面4.4-12千秒差距的区域内约20个超额的X射线源。这些发现无法被个体星系的恒星总体或宇宙X射线背景所解释，但在采用类似探测灵敏度的野外后期型边缘星系中，并没有发现相似的超额X射线源。文章讨论了观察到的超额的来源可能包括与球状团相关的低质量X射线双星、超新星引发的X射线双星以及因盘面气体被压缩而诱发的高质量X射线双星，以及维尔戈星系团中早期成员星系周围先前鉴定的一类星团内X射线源。结果表明这些X射线群体中没有一类能够自然主导观察到的超额，尽管超新星引发的X射线双星和压缩效应最有可能与观察到的超额有关。 <div>
We present a systematic search for extraplanar X-ray point sources around 19 late-type, highly inclined disk galaxies residing in the Virgo cluster, based on archival Chandra observations reaching a source detection sensitivity of L(0.5–8 keV) ∼ 1038 erg s−1. Based on the cumulative source surface density distribution as a function of projected vertical distance from the disk midplane, we identify a statistically significant (∼3.3σ) excess of ∼20 X-ray sources within a projected vertical off-disk distance of (∼4.4–12 kpc), the presence of which cannot be explained by the bulk stellar content of the individual galaxies, nor by the cosmic X-ray background. On the other hand, there is no significant evidence for an excess of extraplanar X-ray sources in a comparison sample of field late-type edge-on galaxies, for which Chandra observations reaching a similar source detection sensitivity are available. We discuss the possible origins for the observed excess, including low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) associated with globular clusters, supernova-kicked LMXBs, and high-mass X-ray binaries born in recent star formation induced by ram pressure stripping of the disk gas, as well as a class of intracluster X-ray sources previously identified around early-type member galaxies of Virgo. We find that none of these X-ray populations can naturally dominate the observed extraplanar excess, although supernova-kicked LMXBs and the effect of ram pressure are most likely relevant.

The recent discoveries of a remarkable glitch/antiglitch accompanied by fast radio burst (FRB)-like bursts from the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 have revealed the physical connection between the two. In this work, we study the statistical properties of radio bursts from the hyperactive repeating source FRB 20201124A and of glitches from the pulsar PSR B1737–30. For FRB 20201124A, we confirm that the probability density functions of fluctuations of energy, peak flux, duration, and waiting time well follow the Tsallis q-Gaussian distribution. The derived q values from q-Gaussian distribution keep approximately steady for different temporal interval scales, which indicates that there is a common scale-invariant structure in repeating FRBs. Similar scale-invariant properties can be found in PSR B1737–30's glitches, implying an underlying association between the origins of repeating FRBs and pulsar glitches. These statistical features can be well understood within the same physical framework of self-organized criticality systems.

<div> 关键词: 月球表面、伽玛射线、宇宙射线、数据反漲转、空间分布

总结:<br />
本文介绍了通过伽玛射线谱仪数据的反漲转过程所揭示的月球表面放射性元素的相对含量和空间分布特征的翻转对预测月球表面组成具有重要意义。研究发现，银河宇宙射线在数据的分布图上引起了破坏性的“条纹噪音”，大大妨碍了数据的解释和月球表面信息的提取。提出的方法通过使用经验模态分解法，巧妙地将银河宇宙射线的影响从月球表面的计数率分布图中分离出来，从而精确地推断了嫦娥二号伽玛射线谱仪数据中的银河宇宙射线背景。与前人使用的传统宇宙射线背景推断方法相比，这一模型不需要重复处理大量原始数据。此外，它通过简化的程序和减少的时间投资，准确地推断了宇宙射线背景，因而具有显著的优势。 <div>
The inversion of the relative content and spatial distribution characteristics of radioactive elements on the lunar surface, as inferred from gamma-ray spectrometer data, holds substantial importance for forecasting lunar surface compositions. During the inversion process of gamma-ray spectrometer data, galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) have engendered disruptive “stripe noise” in the distribution map of radioactive elements. This phenomenon significantly hampers the interpretation of data and the extraction of lunar surface information. The proposed approach adeptly separates the influence of GCR from the counting rate distribution map of the lunar surface by employing the empirical mode decomposition method. It achieves the deduction of GCR background from the Chang’e-2 gamma-ray spectrometer data with precision. Compared to conventional GCR background deduction methods employed by predecessors, this model does not need to process a large amount of original data repeatedly. Moreover, it achieves an accurate deduction of the GCR background without intricate formulaic derivations. The procedural simplicity and reduced time investment make this approach significantly superior.

红移大于3的光学暗淡和极为红的星系在过去的星系普查中被忽略。通过JADES、JEMS和SMILES的深度JWST成像，我们对这些星系进行了表征，发现存在大量含尘、后星暴型的星系，质量低至10的8次方太阳质量，低于Spitzer和ALMA的灵敏度极限。我们发现，在z大于6时，样本中包括大量“小红点”（NIRCam选定的尘埃泛红的活动星系核（AGN）候选体）。此外，我们还发现了5个具有巴尔望线断裂和高质量恒星的证据。这些结果表明，在JWST之前，来自暗淡源的被遮蔽的星形成率密度的贡献可能被低估了。我们还观察到，LRD中的老化恒星成分和高质量恒星量排除了来自热尘发射的主要贡献，这些源物理学上需要进一步的研究。调查测量系统性是探索未来数据的可能。 <br /><br />总结: 通过JWST的深度成像，我们发现了在先前的星系普查中被忽略的高红移星系种类。这些星系对星系总质量和星形成率的贡献被低估，尤其是在z大于6的时候。同时，我们发现了一些具有特殊性质的星系，需要进一步的观测和研究。 <div>
Using deep JWST imaging from JADES, JEMS, and SMILES, we characterize optically faint and extremely red galaxies at z > 3 that were previously missing from galaxy census estimates. The data indicate the existence of abundant, dusty, and poststarburst-like galaxies down to 108 M⊙, below the sensitivity limit of Spitzer and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Modeling the NIRCam and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) photometry of these red sources can result in extremely high values for both stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR); however, including seven MIRI filters out to 21 μm results in decreased masses (median 0.6 dex for > 10) and SFRs (median 10× for SFR > 100 M⊙ yr−1). At z > 6, our sample includes a high fraction of “little red dots” (LRDs; NIRCam-selected dust-reddened active galactic nucleus (AGN) candidates). We significantly measure older stellar populations in the LRDs out to rest-frame 3 μm (the stellar bump) and rule out a dominant contribution from hot dust emission, a signature of AGN contamination to stellar population measurements. This allows us to measure their contribution to the cosmic census at z > 3, below the typical detection limits of ALMA (LIR < 1012 L⊙). We find that these sources, which are overwhelmingly missed by HST and ALMA, could effectively double the obscured fraction of the star formation rate density at 4 < z < 6 compared to some estimates, showing that prior to JWST, the obscured contribution from fainter sources could be underestimated. Finally, we identify five sources with evidence for Balmer breaks and high stellar masses at 5.5 < z < 7.7. While spectroscopy is required to determine their nature, we discuss possible measurement systematics to explore with future data.

A near-infrared spectrum of nova V1716 Scorpii (PNV J17224490-4137160), a recent bright ( mag), Fermi-LAT detected γ-ray source, was modeled using the photoionization code CLOUDY. Abundances were estimated for He, C, N, O, Si, Al, Mg, Fe, Ne, S, Ca, and P. Notably, P (a factor of 120) and N (a factor of 248) are highly overabundant. It was necessary to assume the ejecta consist of two components (with a cylindrical geometry): a dense component from which the bulk of the H, He, and neutral O i and N emission arises and a more diffuse component from which most of the coronal lines arise. Some of the coronal lines are found to originate from both the dense and diffuse components. The mass of the ejecta, including neutral and ionized gas, is ≃4.19 × 10−4M⊙. Our analysis indicates that in the case of V1716 Sco (which has a carbon–oxygen white dwarf), a fraction of 25% white dwarf matter rather than 50% is favored for the mixing between a white dwarf and the accreted envelope before the outburst. This mixing ratio is like that found for oxygen–neon novae where a 25% mixing fraction is also indicated. Helium hydride—the first molecule to form after the Big Bang—may have formed in the ejecta of V1716 Sco based on photoionization modeling. This prediction suggests that novae may be potential formation sites of this important molecular ion.

总结: 
詹姆斯·韦伯空间望远镜发现了许多模糊的活跃星系核，它们对我们理解超大质量黑洞的形成、它们与宿主星系的共同演化，以及活跃星系核在宇宙再电离中的作用至关重要。研究人员利用光度颜色和大小测量，在JWST/NIRCam领域内进行了对紧凑红色天体的搜索，并发现了260个红移在4 < zphot < 9的红移星系核候选者。这些天体的模型拟合显示它们中度受尘埃消光（AV ∼ 1.6）, 具有辐射的光度（Lbol = 1044–47 erg s−1）和较暗的紫外光度（MUV ≃ −17 to −22）。另外，研究人员还对灰尘星系核的光度函数进行了估算，发现它们的数量密度比同等光度的紫外选取类星体高100倍。研究还显示这些天体只占了同等红移下所有紫外选取星系的一小部分，但在z ∼ 7时MUV ∼ −22时这个比例上升到约10%。最后，根据一个保守的Eddington速率的引力累积假设，研究人员得出了z ∼ 5时超大质量黑洞质量函数的下限，并发现它与之前的理论和JWST的观测一致。 <br /><br /> <div>
Observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have uncovered numerous faint active galactic nuclei (AGN) at z ∼ 5 and beyond. These objects are key to our understanding of the formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), their coevolution with host galaxies, as well as the role of AGN in cosmic reionization. Using photometric colors and size measurements, we perform a search for compact red objects in an array of blank deep JWST/NIRCam fields totaling ∼640 arcmin2. Our careful selection yields 260 reddened AGN candidates at 4 < zphot < 9, dominated by a point-source-like central component (〈reff〉 < 130 pc) and displaying a dichotomy in their rest-frame colors (blue UV and red optical slopes). Quasar model fitting reveals our objects to be moderately dust-extincted (AV ∼ 1.6), which is reflected in their inferred bolometric luminosities of Lbol = 1044–47 erg s−1 and fainter UV magnitudes MUV ≃ −17 to −22. Thanks to the large areas explored, we extend the existing dusty AGN luminosity functions to both fainter and brighter magnitudes, estimating their number densities to be ×100 higher than for UV-selected quasars of similar magnitudes. At the same time, they constitute only a small fraction of all UV-selected galaxies at similar redshifts, but this percentage rises to ∼10% for MUV ∼ − 22 at z ∼ 7. Finally, assuming a conservative case of accretion at the Eddington rate, we place a lower limit on the SMBH mass function at z ∼ 5, finding it to be consistent with both theory and previous JWST observations.

总结：<br /><br />本研究介绍了一种针对伽玛射线天文数据的新型去噪算法，利用局部密度取样技术。该算法优先放大局部密度高的区域，减弱低密度区域的影响。这种选择性增强显著增强了聚类算法在定位点源方面的性能，有效地减少了被误认为真实源的高密度噪音的干扰。我们已经在费米大面积望远镜数据上实施了该算法，结果显示聚类算法在丢弃虚假源方面取得了显著进展。 <div>
Reducing background noise is essential for clear data analysis and signal detection. In this study, we introduce a novel denoising algorithm tailored for gamma-ray astronomical data, utilizing local density sampling techniques. The proposed algorithm preferentially amplifies regions of high local density, which are indicative of potential sources, while diminishing the influence of low-density areas. This selective enhancement significantly bolsters the performance of clustering algorithms in pinpointing point sources, effectively minimizing the interference of high-density noise that could be mistaken for genuine sources. We have implemented this algorithm on Fermi Large Area Telescope data, and our results showcase a marked advancement in the clustering algorithm's capacity to discard false sources.

总结:
通过动力学粒子在电磁场模拟中，我们可以观察到在电子-质子冲击波的上游区域存在着不同的过程。在远上游区域，电流主要由非热质子驱动，产生静电模式并产生超热电子，进入上游无穷远处。接近冲击波（在前趋区），电流密度和束流的动量通量增加，导致电磁流动不稳定性，有助于超热电子的热化。在冲击波脚附近，这些电子暴露在冲击波反射质子中，导致了双流不稳定性。这些发现对于理解磁场的放大以及可能导致超热电子进入扩散冲击加速过程的过程非常重要。 <div>
Collisionless shocks tend to send charged particles into the upstream, driving electric currents through the plasma. Using kinetic particle-in-cell simulations, we investigate how the background thermal plasma neutralizes such currents in the upstream of quasi-parallel non-relativistic electron–proton shocks. We observe distinct processes in different regions: the far upstream, the shock precursor, and the shock foot. In the far upstream, the current is carried by nonthermal protons, which drive electrostatic modes and produce suprathermal electrons that move toward upstream infinity. Closer to the shock (in the precursor), both the current density and the momentum flux of the beam increase, which leads to electromagnetic streaming instabilities that contribute to the thermalization of suprathermal electrons. At the shock foot, these electrons are exposed to shock-reflected protons, resulting in a two-stream type instability. We analyze these processes and the resulting heating through particle tracking and controlled simulations. In particular, we show that the instability at the shock foot can make the effective thermal speed of electrons comparable to the drift speed of the reflected protons. These findings are important for understanding both the magnetic field amplification and the processes that may lead to the injection of suprathermal electrons into diffusive shock acceleration.

在这篇文章中，研究者利用A1063的星系红移数据，结合宇宙学模型，并考虑干扰因素和采样效应，推断出逃逸速度剖面，进而直接约束了引力势剖面。通过对比三种不同的密度模型，发现它们之间有很好的一致性。对于纳瓦罗-弗兰克-怀特模型，研究者发现log10(M200,crit) = M⊙，与六个最近出版的透镜质量估计结果一致。这种一致性因逃逸技术与透镜技术除了径向分bin之外没有共同系统偏差。这些质量估计结果比利用X射线数据和戈梅兹等人的速度离散度估计结果偏低2-4σ。研究者测量了r200内的1D速度离散度为km/s，结合逃逸速度质量估计值，使A1063的速度离散度首次与流体动力学宇宙模拟保持一致。 <br /><br />总结: 本研究利用星系红移数据推断了A1063的逃逸速度剖面，并利用引力势方程约束了引力势剖面，得到了与透镜质量估计结果一致的质量估计。这些估计结果明显低于利用X射线数据和速度离散度估计的结果。此外，研究还发现A1063的速度离散度与宇宙模拟结果保持一致。 <div>
We measure the radius–velocity phase-space edge profile of A1063 using galaxy redshifts from Karman et al. and Mercurio et al. Combined with a cosmological model and after accounting for interlopers and sampling effects, we infer the escape velocity profile. Using the Poisson equation, we then directly constrain the gravitational potential profile and find excellent agreement between three different density models. For the Navarro–Frenk–White profile, we find log10(M200,crit) = M⊙, consistent to within 1σ of six recently published lensing masses. We argue that this consistency is due to the fact that the escape technique shares no common systematics with lensing other than radial binning. These masses are 2–4σ lower than estimates made using X-ray data, in addition to the Gómezet al. velocity dispersion estimate. We measure the 1D velocity dispersion within r200 to be km s−1, which combined with our escape velocity mass, brings the dispersion for A1063 in-line with hydrodynamic cosmological simulations for the first time.

Parker Solar Probe搭载的IS⊙IS套件中的HET观测到了首次太阳γ射线事件，该事件与硬X射线耀斑、日冕物质喷发和太阳高能粒子事件有关。通过蒙特卡洛建模重建了入射γ射线光谱，展示了IS⊙IS仪器结合能够测量60keV至7MeV的硬X射线和γ射线。尽管这是任务的辅助科学目标，但IS⊙IS仪器测量γ射线的能力对于研究这一能量粒子群是重要的，因为目前观测太阳γ射线的仪器非常有限。 <div>
High-energy neutral solar radiation in the form of γ-rays and neutrons is produced as secondary products in solar flares. The characteristics of this emission can provide key information regarding the energization of charged particles, particularly when primary particles remain trapped in the corona. The Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun (IS⊙IS) suite on Parker Solar Probe is composed of instruments primarily intended to measure energetic charged particles. However, the High Energy Telescope (HET) in IS⊙IS was also designed with a supplementary neutral mode intended to measure γ-rays and neutrons. HET observed its first clear solar γ-ray event in connection with a hard X-ray flare, the eruption of a coronal mass ejection, and a solar energetic particle event on 2022 September 5. The X-ray spectral shape was observed to harden over the course of the event, culminating with the observation of γ-rays by HET. A coincident enhancement in the lower-energy Energetic Particle Instrument (EPI-Lo) was also observed, likely produced by incident solar γ-rays despite the EPI-Lo instrument not having any special neutral measurement capabilities. We use Monte Carlo modeling to reconstruct the incident γ-ray spectrum based on the measured spectrum to demonstrate that the combination of IS⊙IS instruments can measure hard X-rays and γ-rays from ∼60 keV–7 MeV. Despite the fact that this is a supplemental science goal of the mission, the capability of the IS⊙IS instruments to measure γ-rays is important for the study of this population due to the very limited instruments currently observing the Sun in γ-rays.

这篇文章研究了ZFOURGE调查中约400个低质量（<10^9M⊙）Hα发射体（HAEs）的星系特性。这些HAEs的选择基于观测到的Ks波段通量与从最佳拟合光谱能量分布估计的恒星连续体之间的过剩。这些低质量HAEs的SFR（Hα）高于星系主序列，可能是宇宙再电离纪元中再电离宇宙的星系的潜在类比体。低质量HAEs的离子化光子产生效率（ξion）中位数值为，假设对恒星连续体进行Calzetti（SMC）曲线的尘埃校正。这个值比相似红移下主序星系的ξion高约0.2 dex，表明低质量HAEs在产生电离光子方面更有效。我们的结果也加强了ξion随红移增加的趋势，但揭示了随着红移增加ξion与恒星质量（M⊙）之间的“减小”关系。我们进一步探讨了ξion与其他星系特性的依赖关系，比如紫外光谱斜率（βUV）、紫外光度（MUV）和Hα以及[O iii]发射线的当量宽度。紫外光谱斜率更蓝、紫外光度更暗、以及具有更高等当量宽度的星系的ξion提高了约2倍，与我们样本的ξion中位数相比。JWST数据将提供机会扩展我们的方法，并进一步研究高红移处低质量星系的特性。

We investigate the galaxy properties of ∼400 low-mass (<109M⊙) Hα emitters (HAEs) at z ∼ 2.3 in the ZFOURGE survey. The selection of these HAEs is based on the excess in the observed Ks broadband flux compared to the stellar continuum estimated from the best-fit spectral energy distribution. These low-mass HAEs have elevated SFR(Hα) above the star formation main sequence, making them potential analogs of the galaxies that reionized the Universe during the Epoch of Reionization. The ionizing photon production efficiencies (ξion) of the low-mass HAEs have a median value of , assuming the Calzetti (SMC) curve for the stellar continuum dust correction. This value is higher than that of main-sequence galaxies by ∼0.2 dex at similar redshift, indicating that the low-mass HAEs are more efficient in producing ionizing photons. Our results also consolidate the trend of increasing ξion with redshift, but reveal a “downsizing” relationship between ξion and stellar mass (M⊙) with increasing redshift. We further explore the dependence of ξion on other galaxy properties, such as the UV spectral slope (βUV), the UV magnitude (MUV), and the equivalent widths of Hα and [O iii] emission lines. Galaxies with bluer UV slopes, fainter UV luminosities, and higher equivalent widths exhibit elevated ξion by a factor of ∼2 compared to the median ξion of our sample. JWST data will provide an opportunity to extend our method and further investigate the properties of low-mass galaxies at high redshifts.

这篇文章描述了对δ Scorpii双星系统中Be星周围盘的演变进行的研究。通过观测V波段和B − V光度，以及Hα光谱学，结合新的多频偏振数据，详细比较了盘在每次最接近次星的时期的物理条件。研究使用三维蒙特卡洛辐射传输代码HDUST和平滑粒子流体动力学代码，以模拟盘的演化。发现Hα发射区域的范围在每次最接近次星的时期都增加了，并且盘的暂时不对称性逐渐显现。Hα和He i 6678 Å线的不对称性表明在2011年时出现了扰动。当盘的运行方向与次星相反时，由于盘粒子与次星的相对速度很快，模型中产生的螺旋密度增强在Hα发射区域不明显。次星对盘的影响是短暂的，每次最接近次星的事件之间盘都表现出独立的演化。 <br /><br />总结: 这篇文章通过对δ Scorpii双星系统中Be星周围盘的观测和数值模拟，研究了盘的物理特性随着系统的演化而发生的变化。研究发现在每次最接近次星的时期，盘的Hα发射区域范围都会增加，并且会出现暂时的不对称性。此外，还发现了在2011年时出现了明显的扰动。此外，发现当盘的运行方向与次星相反时，由于盘粒子与次星的相对速度很快，模型中产生的螺旋密度增强在Hα发射区域不明显。次星对盘的影响是短暂的，每次最接近次星的事件之间盘都表现出独立的演化。 <div>
We examine the evolution of the disk surrounding the Be star in the highly eccentric 10.8 yr binary system δ Scorpii over its three most recent periastron passages. V-band and B − V photometry, along with Hα spectroscopy, are combined with a new set of extensive multiband polarimetry data to produce a detailed comparison of the disk's physical conditions during the time periods surrounding each closest approach of the secondary star. We use the three-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative transfer code HDUST and a smoothed particle hydrodynamics code to support our observations with models of disk evolution, discussing the behavior of the Hα and He i 6678 Å lines, V-band magnitude, and polarization degree. We compare the characteristics of the disk immediately before each periastron passage to create a baseline for the unperturbed disk. We find that the extent of the Hα emitting region increased between each periastron passage, and that transient asymmetries in the disk become more pronounced with each successive encounter. Asymmetries of the Hα and He i 6678 Å lines in 2011 indicate that perturbations propagate inward through the disk near periastron. When the disk’s direction of orbit is opposite to that of the secondary, the parameters used in our models do not produce spiral density enhancements in the Hα emitting region because the tidal interaction time is short due to the relative velocities of the disk particles with the secondary. The effects of the secondary star on the disk are short-lived and the disk shows independent evolution between each periastron event.

<div> 关键词: 涡旋、原行星盘、垂直剪切不稳定性、辐射传输、热结构
总结: 
本研究利用Athena++辐射模块研究了完整和过渡盘中的垂直剪切不稳定性（VSI）作用，并考虑了辐射传输和恒星照射。我们发现，热结构和冷却时间显著影响了垂直剪切不稳定性的行为。盘的内缘位置和径向光学深度也影响了盘的动力学。通过合成图像，我们发现在具有较大空洞的盘中，子结构更加明显。我们的模拟预测了具有显著温度变化的区域伴随着显著的速度变化，并可以通过ALMA的动力学和化学观测进行验证。这些发现有助于我们更好地理解原行星盘的动力学过程。 <br /><br /> <div>
Turbulence is crucial for protoplanetary disk dynamics, and vertical shear instability (VSI) is a promising mechanism in outer disk regions to generate turbulence. We use the Athena++ radiation module to study VSI in full and transition disks, accounting for radiation transport and stellar irradiation. We find that the thermal structure and cooling timescale significantly influence VSI behavior. The inner rim location and radial optical depth affect disk kinematics. Compared with previous vertically isothermal simulations, our full disk and transition disks with small cavities have a superheated atmosphere and cool midplane with long cooling timescales, which suppresses the corrugation mode and the associated meridional circulation. This temperature structure also produces a strong vertical shear at τ* = 1, producing an outgoing flow layer at τ* < 1 on top of an ingoing flow layer at τ* ∼ 1. The midplane becomes less turbulent, while the surface becomes more turbulent with effective α reaching ∼10−2 at τ* ≲ 1. This large surface stress drives significant surface accretion, producing substructures. Using temperature and cooling time measured/estimated from radiation-hydro simulations, we demonstrate that less computationally intensive simulations incorporating simple orbital cooling can almost reproduce radiation-hydro results. By generating synthetic images, we find that substructures are more pronounced in disks with larger cavities. The higher velocity dispersion at the gap edge could also slow particle settling. Both properties are consistent with recent near-IR and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations. Our simulations predict that regions with significant temperature changes are accompanied by significant velocity changes, which can be tested by ALMA kinematics/chemistry observations.

总结：<br />
该研究进行了线性计算，确定了3D本地等离子体中带有径向温度梯度的I型行星迁移速率。通过抑制朗道预测中的发散项，得到了波动解。尽管存在共旋点的奇异性，但我们还是得出了行星的旋转力矩。与以前的3D流体力学模拟结果一致，得出了地行星梯度对总、林布拉德和共转力矩的影响。我们的线性计算还提供了3D龙卷风力矩，与以前的3D流体力学模拟结果接近。 <div>
We performed linear calculations to determine the Type I planetary migration rate for 3D locally isothermal disks with radial temperature gradients. For 3D disks with radial temperature gradients, the linear wave equation has a divergent term of the third pole, which makes corotation a nonremoval singularity. We suppressed the divergence with the Landau prescription to obtain the wave solutions. Despite the singularity at corotation, we derived a definite torque on the planet because the divergent term amplifies the waves only in the neighborhood of corotation and has little effect on the planetary torque. Consequently, we derived the formulas for the total, Lindblad, and corotation torques for locally isothermal disks. The resulting torque term due to the disk temperature gradient agrees well with the results of previous 3D hydrodynamical simulations for locally isothermal disks. Our linear calculation also provides the 3D horseshoe torque, which is close to the results of previous 3D hydrodynamical simulations.

总结:
本文分析了Messier 101中SN 2023ixf的红超巨星（RSG）候选天体的大量爆发前地面和太空红外观测数据的整体集合，以及爆炸前在哈勃太空望远镜（HST）上获得的光学数据。作者们确认了候选天体与超新星（SN）的关联，并根据用Gemini-North仪器进行的SN观测，限定了SN点位的金属丰度。此外，通过高分辨率的Keck光谱，还确认了SN的内部宿主灭光。作者们运用尘埃辐射传输建模拟合了恒星的观测光谱能量分布（SED），考虑到其固有变化，该模型假设了位于潜在恒星光球之前的富含硅酸盐的尘埃壳。这颗星受尘埃遮挡严重，可能是迄今为止遇到的最尘埃丰富的候选天体。作者们得出了该星的有效温度和10^4L ⊙的中位估计值分别为2770K和9.0×。感谢提供给我们这样的非凡视角，这应该在未来几年继续在HST和詹姆斯·韦伯太空望远镜上进行跟踪观测。 <div>
We follow our first paper with an analysis of the ensemble of the extensive preexplosion ground- and space-based infrared observations of the red supergiant (RSG) progenitor candidate for the nearby core-collapse supernova SN 2023ixf in Messier 101, together with optical data prior to the explosion obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We have confirmed the association of the progenitor candidate with the supernova (SN), as well as constrained the metallicity at the SN site, based on SN observations with instruments at Gemini-North. The internal host extinction to the SN has also been confirmed from a high-resolution Keck spectrum. We fit the observed spectral energy distribution (SED) for the star, accounting for its intrinsic variability, with dust radiative-transfer modeling, which assumes a silicate-rich dust shell ahead of the underlying stellar photosphere. The star is heavily dust obscured, likely the dustiest progenitor candidate yet encountered. We found median estimates of the star’s effective temperature and luminosity of 2770 K and 9.0 × 104L⊙, with 68% credible intervals of 2340–3150 K and (7.5–10.9) × 104L⊙, respectively. The candidate may have a Galactic RSG analog, IRC −10414, with a strikingly similar SED and luminosity. Via comparison with single-star evolutionary models we have constrained the initial mass of the progenitor candidate from 12 M⊙ to as high as 14 M⊙. We have had available to us an extraordinary view of the SN 2023ixf progenitor candidate, which should be further followed up in future years with HST and the James Webb Space Telescope.

Protostars are born in magnetized environments. As a consequence, the formation of protostellar disks can be suppressed by the magnetic field, efficiently removing the angular momentum of the infalling material. Nonideal MHD effects are proposed as one way to allow protostellar disks to form. Thus, it is important to understand their contributions to observations of protostellar systems. We derive an analytical equation to estimate the ambipolar diffusivity coefficient at the edge of the protostellar disk in the Class 0/I protostar, HOPS-370, for the first time, under the assumption that the disk radius is set by ambipolar diffusion. Using previous results of the protostellar mass, disk mass, disk radius, density and temperature profiles, and magnetic field strength, we estimate the ambipolar diffusivity coefficient to be . We quantify the contribution of ambipolar diffusion by estimating its dimensionless Elsässer number to be , indicating its dynamical importance in this region. We compare our results to those of the chemical calculations of the ambipolar diffusivity coefficient using the Non-Ideal Magnetohydrodynamics Coefficients and Ionization Library, which are consistent with our results. In addition, we compare our derived ambipolar diffusivity coefficient to the diffusivity coefficients for ohmic dissipation and the Hall effect, and find ambipolar diffusion is dominant in our density regime. These results demonstrate a new methodology to understand nonideal MHD effects in observations of protostellar disks. More detailed modeling of the magnetic field, envelope, and microphysics, along with a larger sample of protostellar systems, is needed to further understand the contributions of nonideal MHD.

We present a simulation of Jupiter’s quasi-quadrennial oscillation (QQO) in a 2D radiative-dynamical model. Launching an eastward Kelvin wave and a westward Rossby-gravity wave in the lower boundary, we successfully generate a 4 yr-period oscillation in the equatorial stratosphere. The momentum flux of waves initiates overlying easterly–westerly wind jets descending in altitude with the maximum temperature variation of ±5 K near 10 hPa at the equator. The tropical stratospheric region is dominated by upwelling and downwelling circulation cells induced by the QQO, affecting the midlatitude where stratospheric aerosols enrich. The simulation results are consistent with the previous satellite and ground-based observations in the low latitudes and provide the ability to examine the QQO’s influence in Jupiter’s extratropical stratosphere. The QQO influence further extends into the upper troposphere, forming a weak anticorrelation with the stratosphere oscillation in agreement with the result from 40 yr of telescope observations.

Luminous, compact emission-line galaxies (LCGs) are the most abundant class of confirmed Lyman continuum (LyC) emitters. An optical integral field study of the nearby LCG NGC 2366 reveals an outflow originating at the star cluster “knot B” thought to clear a channel via mechanical feedback that enables LyC escape. We observed NGC 2366 with the Chandra X-ray Observatory and detected X-ray emission from a point source coincident with the apex of the outflow at knot B. The pointlike nature and variability of the X-ray emission suggests accretion onto a compact object. The accretion could produce sufficient kinetic energy to power the outflow.

We present a complete census of candidate nuggets, i.e., dense galaxies likely formed by compaction with intense gas influx, within the volume-limited redshift z ∼ 0 REsolved Spectroscopy Of a Local VolumE (RESOLVE) survey. These nuggets span all evolutionary stages and 3 orders of magnitude in stellar mass (M* ∼ 108 to 1011M⊙) from the dwarf to the giant regime. We develop selection criteria for our z ∼ 0 nugget candidates based on structure and introduce the use of environmental criteria to eliminate nugget-like objects with suspected non-compaction origins. The resulting z ∼ 0 nuggets follow expectations with respect to structure (i.e., density, size), population frequency, and likely origins. We show that the properties of our nugget census are consistent with permanent quenching above the gas-richness threshold scale (halo mass Mhalo ∼ 1011.4M⊙), cyclic temporary quenching below the threshold scale, and feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) assisting in permanent quenching. As predicted in simulations, most nuggets quench within a halo mass range of Mhalo ∼ 1011.45 to 1011.9M⊙. We find ∼0.29 dex scatter around the star-forming main sequence for candidate blue nuggets below the threshold scale, which is consistent with temporary quenching as seen in simulations. A transitional population of green nuggets appears above the threshold scale. AGN also become more common in nuggets above this scale, and we see a likely AGN excess in nuggets versus comparably selected non-nuggets. Our results provide the first observational confirmation of the mass-dependent, AGN-mediated shift from cyclic quenching to halo quenching in nuggets.

GRB-SNe是与大质量恒星前体相关的伽玛射线暴超新星，它们可能产生了重元素。研究表明，在观测到的GRB-SNe中存在颜色的多样性，这可能与r过程物质的丰度有关。通过对四个GRB-SNe进行光学到近红外的颜色测量，结果表明其中三个可能含有0.01-0.15太阳质量的r过程物质，而第四个不符合r过程物质大于等于0.01太阳质量的模型。由于r过程物质可能被隐藏在超新星喷射物中，导致现有模型无法准确测量其质量，因此得到的结果可能被低估。建议未来的观测策略应该更多地关注GRB-SNe产生的r过程物质的全部分布。 <br /><br />总结: <br />GRB-SNe与重元素的r过程丰度存在着多样性，模型可能低估了r过程物质的质量，未来需要更多观测以全面探查GRB-SNe产生的r过程物质。 <div>
The existence of a secondary (in addition to compact object mergers) source of heavy element (r-process) nucleosynthesis, the core-collapse of rapidly rotating and highly magnetized massive stars, has been suggested by both simulations and indirect observational evidence. Here, we probe a predicted signature of r-process enrichment, a late-time (≳40 days post-burst) distinct red color, in observations of gamma-ray burst supernovae (GRB-SNe), which are linked to these massive star progenitors. We present optical to near-IR color measurements of four GRB-SNe at z ≲ 0.4, extending out to >500 days post-burst, obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope and large-aperture ground-based telescopes. Comparison of our observations to models indicates that GRBs 030329, 100316D, and 130427A are consistent with both no enrichment and producing 0.01–0.15 M⊙ of r-process material if there is a low amount of mixing between the inner r-process ejecta and outer supernova (SN) layers. GRB 190829A is not consistent with any models with r-process enrichment ≥0.01 M⊙. Taken together the sample of GRB-SNe indicates color diversity at late times. Our derived yields from GRB-SNe may be underestimated due to r-process material hidden in the SN ejecta (potentially due to low mixing fractions) or the limits of current models in measuring r-process mass. We conclude with recommendations for future search strategies to observe and probe the full distribution of r-process produced by GRB-SNe.

The PHANGS survey uses Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, Hubble Space Telescope, Very Large Telescope, and JWST to obtain an unprecedented high-resolution view of nearby galaxies, covering millions of spatially independent regions. The high dimensionality of such a diverse multiwavelength data set makes it challenging to identify new trends, particularly when they connect observables from different wavelengths. Here, we use unsupervised machine-learning algorithms to mine this information-rich data set to identify novel patterns. We focus on three of the PHANGS-JWST galaxies, for which we extract properties pertaining to their stellar populations; warm ionized and cold molecular gas; and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), as measured over 150 pc scale regions. We show that we can divide the regions into groups with distinct multiphase gas and PAH properties. In the process, we identify previously unknown galaxy-wide correlations between PAH band and optical line ratios and use our identified groups to interpret them. The correlations we measure can be naturally explained in a scenario where the PAHs and the ionized gas are exposed to different parts of the same radiation field that varies spatially across the galaxies. This scenario has several implications for nearby galaxies: (i) The uniform PAH ionized fraction on 150 pc scales suggests significant self-regulation in the interstellar medium, (ii) the PAH 11.3/7.7 μm band ratio may be used to constrain the shape of the non-ionizing far-ultraviolet to optical part of the radiation field, and (iii) the varying radiation field affects line ratios that are commonly used as PAH size diagnostics. Neglecting this effect leads to incorrect or biased PAH sizes.

<div> AGN feedback, poststarburst galaxies, MUSE/VLT observations, kinematic components, galactic-scale flows
<br /><br />总结:
研究了后星爆星系中AGN反馈的作用，使用MUSE/VLT观测对五个星系进行了空间分辨的研究。发现所有星系都存在相互作用/并合的迹象，且在某些情况下，宽动能成分更符合相互作用诱发的星系尺度流动。建议使用NaID P-Cygni谱线作为流出的更有效示踪，并利用其估算了流出的能量。 <div>
Poststarburst galaxies are believed to be in a rapid transition between major merger starbursts and quiescent ellipticals, where active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback is suggested as one of the processes responsible for the quenching. To study the role of AGN feedback, we constructed a sample of poststarburst candidates with AGN and indications of ionized outflows in optical. We use MUSE/VLT observations to spatially resolve the properties of the stars and multiphase gas in five of them. All galaxies show signatures of interaction/merger in their stellar or gas properties, with some at an early stage of interaction with companions ∼50 kpc, suggesting that optical poststarburst signatures may be present well before the final starburst and coalescence. We detect narrow and broad kinematic components in multiple transitions in all the galaxies. Our detailed analysis of their kinematics and morphology suggests that, contrary to our expectation, the properties of the broad kinematic components are inconsistent with AGN-driven winds in three out of five galaxies. The two exceptions are also the only galaxies in which spatially resolved NaID P-Cygni profiles are detected. In some cases, the observations are more consistent with interaction-induced galactic-scale flows, an often overlooked process. These observations raise the question of how to interpret broad kinematic components in interacting and perhaps also in active galaxies, in particular when spatially resolved observations are not available or cannot rule out merger-induced galactic-scale motions. We suggest that NaID P-Cygni profiles are more effective outflow tracers, and use them to estimate the energy that is carried by the outflow.

这篇论文报道了对Tucana V系统中三颗恒星的化学丰度分析。发现这些星之间的化学丰度存在显著的差异，其中一颗星富含快中子俘获元素（r-I星），另一颗星富含C、N和O，但缺乏中子俘获丰度（CEMP-no星）。分析显示，这些星的金属丰度范围超过1 dex，确认Tuc V是一个超微弱矮星系。不同元素如Ca、Sc和Ni的丰度变化范围很大，这表明Tuc V的化学丰度历史非常不均匀。与Tucana II一样，Tuc V是第二个对位于远离银河中心的恒星进行分析的超微弱矮星系。研究发现，非中心成员星的组成对这两个星系的化学多样性起着重要作用，这表明在分类暗淡卫星时需要包括远离中心的成员星，并且这些系统可能经历了比预期更复杂的化学丰度历史。<br /><br />总结: 这篇论文分析了Tucana V系统中的恒星化学丰度，发现了丰富的化学多样性，证实了Tuc V是一个超微弱矮星系，其化学丰度历史非常不均匀。同时，这也提示对于暗淡卫星的分类需要包括远离中心的成员星，并且这些系统可能经历了更为复杂的化学丰度历史。 <div>
The growing number of Milky Way satellites detected in recent years has introduced a new focus for stellar abundance analysis. Abundances of stars in satellites have been used to probe the nature of these systems and their chemical evolution. However, for most satellites, only centrally located stars have been examined. This paper presents an analysis of three stars in the Tucana V system, one in the inner region and two at ∼10′ (7–10 half-light radii) from the center. We find a remarkable chemical diversity between the stars. One star exhibits enhancements in rapid neutron-capture elements (an r-I star), and another is highly enhanced in C, N, and O but with low neutron-capture abundances (a CEMP-no star). The metallicities of the stars analyzed span more than 1 dex from [Fe/H] = −3.55 to −2.46. This, combined with a large abundance range of other elements like Ca, Sc, and Ni, confirms that Tuc V is an ultrafaint dwarf (UFD) galaxy. The variation in abundances, highlighted by [Mg/Ca] ratios ranging from +0.89 to −0.75, among the stars demonstrates that the chemical enrichment history of Tuc V was very inhomogeneous. Tuc V is only the second UFD galaxy in which stars located at large distances from the galactic center have been analyzed, along with Tucana II. The chemical diversity seen in these two galaxies, driven by the composition of the noncentral member stars, suggests that distant member stars are important to include when classifying faint satellites and that these systems may have experienced more complex chemical enrichment histories than previously anticipated.

The secular Laplace–Lagrange orbital solution, decomposing eccentricities into a set of uniformly precessing eigenmodes, is a classical result that is typically solved numerically. However, in the limit where orbits are closely spaced, several simplifications make it possible to make analytical progress. We derive simple expressions for the eccentricity eigenmodes in a coplanar three-planet system where the middle planet is much less massive than its neighbors, and we show that these approximate the true eigenmodes of more general systems with three massive planets in various limits. These results provide intuition for the secular dynamics of real systems, and have applications for understanding the stability boundary for compact multiplanet systems.

<br /><br />
这篇文章研究了关于星盘的稳定性问题，发现了一种新的非轴对称不稳定性——超声速旋转不稳定性(SARIs)。它们在复杂的本征频率平面上填充了大量不稳定区域，能够与当地多普勒速度同步，且在阿尔文共振区域之间径向局部化。研究使用了新型磁流体动力学模拟代码Legolas，验证了这些新型模式的存在并计算了它们的增长率。此外，研究还探讨了磁场强度和方向对不稳定性的影响，发现非轴对称模式在高模数时能够显著扩展不稳定区域，且其最大增长率可与MRI相媲美。最后，研究还重新审视了最近的色散关系，并强调了它们与全局框架的关系。 <div>
Accretion disks are highly unstable to magnetic instabilities driven by shear flow, where classically, the axisymmetric, weak-field magnetorotational instability (MRI) has received much attention through local WKB approximations. In contrast, discrete nonaxisymmetric counterparts require a more involved analysis through a full global approach to deal with the influence of the nearby magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) continua. Recently, rigorous MHD spectroscopy identified a new type of ultralocalized, nonaxisymmetric instability in global disks with super-Alfvénic flow. These super-Alfvénic rotational instabilities (SARIs) fill vast unstable regions in the complex eigenfrequency plane with (near eigen)modes that corotate at the local Doppler velocity and are radially localized between Alfvénic resonances. Unlike discrete modes, they are utterly insensitive to the radial disk boundaries. In this work, we independently confirm the existence of these unprecedented modes using our novel spectral MHD code Legolas, reproducing and extending our earlier study with detailed eigenspectra and eigenfunctions. We calculate the growth rates of SARIs and MRI in a variety of disk equilibria, highlighting the impact of field strength and orientation, and find correspondence with analytical predictions for thin, weakly magnetized disks. We show that nonaxisymmetric modes can significantly extend instability regimes at high mode numbers, with maximal growth rates comparable to those of the MRI. Furthermore, we explicitly show a region filled with quasi-modes whose eigenfunctions are extremely localized in all directions. These modes must be ubiquitous in accretion disks, and play a role in local shearing box simulations. Finally, we revisit recent dispersion relations in the appendix, highlighting their relation to our global framework.

<title>On the Roles of Stellar Rotation and Binarity in NGC 2423's Main-sequence Turnoff Region</title>

<div> eMSTO, NGC 2423, 星团, 恒星自转, 二元系统
<br /><br />
NGC 2423是一个位于银河系中的相对年老的开放星团，其表现出的eMSTO现象由恒星自转所驱动。研究发现，与快速自转的恒星相比，缓慢自转的恒星更有可能形成年轻的恒星群。这引发了对它们是否经历了内部旋转混合过程的猜测，其中一个设想是许多缓慢自转的恒星存在于紧密的双星系统中，而这些系统的潮汐力来自伴星，导致了它们的自转减速。然而，观测结果不符合这些预测。有趣的是，在观测到的两个质量相等的双星系统中，我们发现其中一个是潮汐锁定的双星系统，这进一步验证了我们数值模拟结果的有效性。总结：NGC 2423星团的eMSTO表现受恒星自转驱动，与当前的研究结果一致，并未观测到与缓慢自转恒星有关的特定现象。 <div>
Research has shown that many young and intermediate-age clusters (younger than ∼2 Gyr) have extended main sequences and extended main-sequence turnoffs (eMSTOs), which cannot be adequately described by a single isochrone. The reason for the extended main sequences is now known, with the most probable cause being the fast rotation of stars. However, a significant fraction of slowly rotating stars form a younger stellar population than their fast-rotating counterparts, leading to speculation that they have undergone rotational mixing processes internally. One speculation is that a considerable number of slowly rotating stars reside in close binary systems, where tidal forces from companion stars are the cause of their rotational deceleration. In this work, we report a relatively old open star cluster in the Milky Way, NGC 2423 (∼1 Gyr old), which exhibits an apparent eMSTO. As anticipated, many characteristics of NGC 2423 indicate that its eMSTO is driven by stellar rotations. Our calculations indicate that if slowly rotating stars commonly have a close companion star, they should exhibit significant differences in radial velocities observationally, and binary systems that can be tidally locked within the age of NGC 2423 should have a mass ratio close to 1. However, none of these predictions align with our observations. Interestingly, among the only two equal-mass binary systems in the observed region for which spectroscopic data could be obtained, we discovered that one of them is a tidally locked binary system. This further suggests the validity of our numerical simulation results.

We combine pulsar population synthesis with simulation-based inference (SBI) to constrain the magnetorotational properties of isolated Galactic radio pulsars. We first develop a framework to model neutron star birth properties and their dynamical and magnetorotational evolution. We specifically sample initial magnetic field strengths, B, and spin periods, P, from lognormal distributions and capture the late-time magnetic field decay with a power law. Each lognormal is described by a mean, , and standard deviation, , while the power law is characterized by the index, alate. We subsequently model the stars’ radio emission and observational biases to mimic detections with three radio surveys, and we produce a large database of synthetic P– diagrams by varying our five magnetorotational input parameters. We then follow an SBI approach that focuses on neural posterior estimation and train deep neural networks to infer the parameters’ posterior distributions. After successfully validating these individual neural density estimators on simulated data, we use an ensemble of networks to infer the posterior distributions for the observed pulsar population. We obtain , and , for the lognormal distributions and for the power law at the 95% credible interval. We contrast our results with previous studies and highlight uncertainties of the inferred alate value. Our approach represents a crucial step toward robust statistical inference for complex population synthesis frameworks and forms the basis for future multiwavelength analyses of Galactic pulsars.

We present observations and analysis of the starburst PACS-819 at z = 1.45 (M* = 1010.7M⊙), using high-resolution (0.″1; 0.8 kpc) Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and multiwavelength JWST images from the COSMOS-Web program. Dissimilar to Hubble Space Telescope (HST) ACS images in the rest-frame UV, the redder NIRCam and MIRI images reveal a smooth central mass concentration and spiral-like features, atypical for such an intense starburst. Through dynamical modeling of the CO (J = 5–4) emission with ALMA, PACS-819 is rotation dominated and thus consistent with having a disk-like nature. However, kinematic anomalies in CO and asymmetric features in the bluer JWST bands (e.g., F150W) support a more disturbed nature likely due to interactions. The JWST imaging further enables us to map the distribution of stellar mass and dust attenuation, thus clarifying the relationships between different structural components not discernible in the previous HST images. The CO (J = 5–4) and far-infrared dust continuum emission are cospatial with a heavily obscured starbursting core (<1 kpc) that is partially surrounded by much less obscured star-forming structures including a prominent arc, possibly a tidally distorted dwarf galaxy, and a massive clump (detected in CO), likely a recently accreted low-mass satellite. With spatially resolved maps, we find a high molecular gas fraction in the central area reaching ∼3 (Mgas/M*) and short depletion times (Mgas/SFR ∼ 120 Myr, where SFR is star formation rate) across the entire system. These observations provide insights into the complex nature of starbursts in the distant Universe and underscore the wealth of complementary information from high-resolution observations with both ALMA and JWST.

本文研究了不同恒星群合成模型对高红移星系测量和复离子时期电离光子预算的影响。研究发现，不同模型会导致紫外光度函数振幅相差≲0.5 dex；同时，包含双星的模型产生的电离光子比不包含双星的模型多约40%。然而，这些差异比不同恒星群合成模型造成的差异要小，例如BPASS模型产生的电离光子比其他模型多约100%。 <div>
The luminosity and spectral energy distribution of high-z galaxies are sensitive to the stellar-population synthesis (SPS) models. In this paper, we study the effects of different SPS models on the measurements of high-z galaxies and the budget of ionizing photons during the epoch of reionization by employing each of them in the semianalytical galaxy formation model L-Galaxies 2020. We find that the different SPS models lead to ≲0.5 dex differences on the amplitudes of UV luminosity functions, while two modes of the same SPS model with and without the inclusion of binary stars lead to similar UV luminosity functions at z ≥ 6. Instead, the binary stars produce ∼40% more ionizing photons than the single stars, while such differences are smaller than those caused by different SPS models; for example, the BPASS model produces ∼100% more ionizing photons than other models.

文章研究了基于Adhikari等人开发的方法，利用Kolmogorov现象学，研究了各种湍流级联速率与太阳周期的相关性。我们还扩展了这种方法，推导了Iroshnikov-Kriachnan (IK)现象学的加热速率。我们从1995年到2020年的WIND航天器的等离子体和磁力计数据中得出了观测到的湍流级联速率。我们发现，(i) Kolmogorov现象学和IK现象学得出的湍流级联速率随太阳周期变化，太阳最活跃期时速率最大，最不活跃期时速率最小；(ii) 湍流能量Kolmogorov级联速率随着θUB（平均磁场和速度之间的夹角）从0°变化到90°时增加，并在θUB ≈ 90°时达到峰值，然后随着θUB接近180°而减小；(iii) 二维湍流加热速率大于板条加热速率；(iv) 二维和板条的磁能密度级联速率大于湍动动能的级联速率；(v) 总湍流能量级联速率与太阳风速和温度以及标准交叉亲和性级联速率呈正相关。最后，我们发现总湍流能量Kolmogorov级联速率大于IK级联速率。 <div>
We study the solar cycle dependence of various turbulence cascade rates based on the methodology developed by Adhikari et al. that utilizes Kolmogorov phenomenology. This approach is extended to derive the heating rates for an Iroshnikov–Kriachnan (IK) phenomenology. The observed turbulence cascade rates corresponding to the total turbulence energy, fluctuating magnetic energy density, fluctuating kinetic energy, and the normalized cross helicity are derived from WIND spacecraft plasma and magnetometer data from 1995 through 2020. We find that (i) the turbulence cascade rate derived from a Kolmogorov phenomenology and an IK phenomenology changes with solar cycle, such that the cascade rate is largest during solar maximum and smallest during solar minimum; (ii) the turbulence energy Kolmogorov cascade rate increases from θUB (angle between mean magnetic field and velocity) = 0° to 90° and peaks near θUB = 90°, and then decreases as θUB tends to 180°; (iii) the 2D turbulence heating rate is larger than the slab heating rate; (iv) the 2D and slab fluctuating magnetic energy density cascade rates are larger than the corresponding cascade rates of the fluctuating kinetic energy; and (v) the total turbulence energy cascade rate is positively correlated with the solar wind speed and temperature and the normalized cross-helicity cascade rate. Finally, we find that the total turbulent energy Kolmogorov cascade rate is larger than the IK cascade rate.

Galaxy formation models within cosmological hydrodynamical simulations contain numerous parameters with nontrivial influences over the resulting properties of simulated cosmic structures and galaxy populations. It is computationally challenging to sample these high dimensional parameter spaces with simulations, in particular for halos in the high-mass end of the mass function. In this work, we develop a novel sampling and reduced variance regression method, CARPoolGP, which leverages built-in correlations between samples in different locations of high dimensional parameter spaces to provide an efficient way to explore parameter space and generate low-variance emulations of summary statistics. We use this method to extend the Cosmology and Astrophysics with machinE Learning Simulations to include a set of 768 zoom-in simulations of halos in the mass range of 1013–1014.5M⊙h−1 that span a 28-dimensional parameter space in the IllustrisTNG model. With these simulations and the CARPoolGP emulation method, we explore parameter trends in the Compton Y–M, black hole mass–halo mass, and metallicity–mass relations, as well as thermodynamic profiles and quenched fractions of satellite galaxies. We use these emulations to provide a physical picture of the complex interplay between supernova and active galactic nuclei feedback. We then use emulations of the Y–M relation of massive halos to perform Fisher forecasts on astrophysical parameters for future Sunyaev–Zeldovich observations and find a significant improvement in forecasted constraints. We publicly release both the simulation suite and CARPoolGP software package.

这篇文章讨论了SOL2023-05-09T03:54M6.5的耀斑事件，通过微波和硬X射线仪器记录到了六个流量峰值。研究发现，微波源起源于耀斑环的顶部，并随着频率变化呈现出空间分散的趋势。观测到的微波光谱表明，耀斑事件的电子加速区域较为集中，这对电子加速和耀斑间歇性重连接过程提供了新的约束。 <br /><br /> <div>
The origin of multiple peaks in light curves of various wavelengths remains illusive during flares. Here we discuss the flare of SOL2023-05-09T03:54M6.5 with six flux peaks as recorded by a tandem of new microwave and hard X-ray (HXR) instruments. According to its microwave spectra, the flare represents a high-turnover-frequency (>15 GHz) event. The rather-complete microwave and HXR spectral coverage provides a rare opportunity to uncover the origin of such an event together with simultaneous EUV images. We concluded that (1) the microwave sources originates around the top section of the flaring loops with a trend of source spatial dispersion with frequency; (2) the visible movement of the microwave source from peak to peak originates from the process of new flaring loops appearing sequentially along the magnetic neutral line; (3) the optically thin microwave spectra are hard with the indices (αtn) varying from ∼−1.2 to −0.4, and the turnover frequency always exceeds 15 GHz; (4) higher turnover/peak frequency corresponds to stronger peak intensity and harder optically thin spectra. Using the Fokker–Planck and GX Simulator codes we obtained a good fit to the observed microwave spectra and spatial distribution of the sources at all peaks, if assuming the radiating energetic electrons have the same spatial distribution and single-power-law spectra but with the number density varying in a range of ∼30%. We conclude that the particle acceleration in this flare happens in a compact region nearing the loop-top. These results provide new constraints on the acceleration of energetic electrons and the underlying flare intermittent reconnection process.

<div> 红点，红移，光谱斜率，星系密度，星团

总结:
本研究对31个小红点（LRD）进行了研究，发现它们主要由恒星辐射组成，能够快速估算恒星质量。红移中值和四分位数为55%的光谱测量提供了重要信息。LRD的数量密度为10^-4.0±0.1 Mpc^-3，占全球类似红移和质量的星系总数的14% ± 3%。在红移平均值附近的近红外/中红外（2-4μm）光谱斜率显示出大量暖尘。研究还发现LRD的自然多样性，但许多最佳拟合模型对应于极其强烈和紧凑的恒星形成星系，其全局能量输出主要由OB恒星的直接（在平坦的静止波段紫外光和光谱范围中）和尘埃再循环辐射组成，同时也有一些来自红外线的暗藏AGN的贡献。 <div>
We study 31 little red dots (LRD) detected by JADES/NIRCam and covered by the SMILES/MIRI survey, of which ∼70% are detected in the two bluest MIRI bands and 40% in redder MIRI filters. The median/quartiles redshifts are (55% spectroscopic). The spectral slopes flatten in the rest-frame near-infrared, consistent with a 1.6 μm stellar bump but bluer than direct pure emission from active galactic nuclei (AGN) tori. The apparent dominance of stellar emission at these wavelengths for many LRDs expedites stellar mass estimation: the median/quartiles are . The number density of LRDs is 10−4.0±0.1 Mpc−3, accounting for 14% ± 3% of the global population of galaxies with similar redshifts and masses. The rest-frame near-/mid-infrared (2–4 μm) spectral slope reveals significant amounts of warm dust (bolometric attenuation ∼3–4 mag). Our spectral energy distribution modeling implies the presence of <0.4 kpc diameter knots, heated by either dust-enshrouded OB stars or an AGN producing a similar radiation field, obscured by A(V) > 10 mag. We find a wide variety in the nature of LRDs. However, the best-fitting models for many of them correspond to extremely intense and compact starburst galaxies with mass-weighted ages 5–10 Myr, very efficient in producing dust, with their global energy output dominated by the direct (in the flat rest-frame ultraviolet and optical spectral range) and dust-recycled emission from OB stars with some contribution from an obscured AGN (in the infrared).

<div> starless cores, protostellar cores, Orion B North, ALMA observations, virial analysis
总结:
ALMA进行了对Orion B North分子云内73个无恒星和原恒星核的第三个循环观测。在106 GHz处检测到34个连续源，其中四个被确定为无恒星。通过合成观测模拟发现，应该可以检测到至少两个无恒星核，与实际数据一致。通过对核进行简单的维里分析，发现Chamaeleon I的核的特性不同于Ophiuchus和Orion B North的核，这可能解释了它们没有遵循湍流模型预测的原因，而后两者与模型一致。 <div>
We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Cycle 3 observations of 73 starless and protostellar cores in the Orion B North molecular cloud. We detect a total of 34 continuum sources at 106 GHz, and after comparisons with other data, four of these sources appear to be starless. Three of the four sources are located near groupings of protostellar sources, while one source is an isolated detection. We use synthetic observations of a simulation modeling a collapsing turbulent, magnetized core to compute the expected number of starless cores that should be detectable with our ALMA observations and find at least two (1.52) starless cores should be detectable (at 5σ), consistent with our data. We run a simple virial analysis of the cores to put the Orion B North observations into context with similar previous ALMA surveys of cores in Chamaeleon I and Ophiuchus. We conclude that the Chamaeleon I starless core population is characteristically less bounded than the other two populations, along with external pressure contributions dominating the binding energy of the cores. These differences may explain why the Chamaeleon I cores do not follow turbulent model predictions, while the Ophiuchus and Orion B North cores are consistent with the model.

<br /><br />总结:
本文使用ALMA和NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array对31个红移大于6.5的强光学类星体进行了[C ii]发射线和FIR连续谱的调查。研究发现，大约40%的类星体宿主星系显示出[C ii]发射线的速度梯度，其余的则显示出主要由离散度或扰动动力学的特征。此外，研究还发现类星体黑洞质量和宿主星系动力质量的比值约为当地MBH-Mdyn关系的10倍，但存在较大的离散度和不确定性。调查结果为了解早期星系的星形成和动力学特性提供了重要参考。 <div>
The [C ii] 158 μm emission line and the underlying far-infrared (FIR) dust continuum are important tracers for studying star formation and kinematic properties of early galaxies. We present a survey of the [C ii] emission lines and FIR continua of 31 luminous quasars at z > 6.5 using the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) and the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array at sub-arcsec resolution. This survey more than doubles the number of quasars with [C ii] and FIR observations at these redshifts and enables statistical studies of quasar host galaxies deep into the epoch of reionization. We detect [C ii] emission in 27 quasar hosts with a luminosity range of L[C II] = (0.3–5.5) × 109L⊙ and detect the FIR continuum of 28 quasar hosts with a luminosity range of LFIR = (0.5–13.0) × 1012L⊙. Both L[C II] and LFIR are correlated (ρ ≃ 0.4) with the quasar bolometric luminosity, albeit with substantial scatter. The quasar hosts detected by ALMA are clearly resolved with a median diameter of ∼5 kpc. About 40% of the quasar host galaxies show a velocity gradient in [C ii] emission, while the rest show either dispersion-dominated or disturbed kinematics. Basic estimates of the dynamical masses of the rotation-dominated host galaxies yield Mdyn = (0.1–7.5) × 1011M⊙. Considering our findings alongside those of literature studies, we found that the ratio between MBH and Mdyn is about 10 times higher than that of local MBH–Mdyn relation on average but with substantial scatter (the ratio difference ranging from ∼0.6 to 60) and large uncertainties.

This paper presents a newly established sample of 103 unique galaxies or galaxy groups at 0.4 ≲ z ≲ 0.7 from the Cosmic Ultraviolet Baryon Survey (CUBS) for studying the warm-hot circumgalactic medium (CGM) probed by both O vi and Ne viii absorption. The galaxies and associated neighbors are identified at <1 physical Mpc from the sightlines toward 15 CUBS QSOs at zQSO ≳ 0.8. A total of 30 galaxies or galaxy groups exhibit associated O viλλ 1031, 1037 doublet absorption within a line-of-sight velocity interval of ±250 km s−1, while the rest show no trace of O vi to a detection limit of . Meanwhile, only five galaxies or galaxy groups exhibit the Ne viiiλλ 770, 780 doublet absorption, down to a limiting column density of . These O vi- and Ne viii-bearing halos reside in different galaxy environments with stellar masses ranging from to ≈11.5. The warm-hot CGM around galaxies of different stellar masses and star formation rates exhibits different spatial profiles and kinematics. In particular, star-forming galaxies with show a significant concentration of metal-enriched warm-hot CGM within the virial radius, while massive quiescent galaxies exhibit flatter radial profiles of both column densities and covering fractions. In addition, the velocity dispersion of O vi absorption is broad with συ > 40 km s−1 for galaxies of within the virial radius, suggesting a more dynamic warm-hot halo around these galaxies. Finally, the warm-hot CGM probed by O vi and Ne viii is suggested to be the dominant phase in sub-L* galaxies with based on their high ionization fractions in the CGM.

We present a study of spectral line width measurements from the Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer on Hinode. We used spectral line profiles of Fe xvi 262.984 Å, Fe xiv 264.787 Å, Fe xiv 270.519 Å, Fe xiv 274.203 Å, and Fe xv 284.160 Å, and studied 11 active regions. Previous studies of spectral line widths have shown that in hot loops in the cores of active regions, the observed nonthermal velocities are smaller than predicted from models of reconnection jets in the corona or shock heating associated with Alfvén waves. The observed line widths are also inconsistent with models of chromospheric evaporation due to coronal nanoflares. We show that recent advances in higher resolution Alfvén wave turbulence modeling enables us to obtain nonthermal velocities similar to those measured in active regions. The observed nonthermal velocities for the 11 active regions in our study are in the range of 17–30 km s−1, consistent with the spectral line nonthermal widths predicted from our model of 16 interacting flux tubes, which are in the range of 15–37 km s−1.

Synchrotron emissivities, absorptivities, and Faraday rotation and conversion coefficients are needed in modeling a variety of astrophysical sources, including Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) sources. We develop a method for estimating transfer coefficients that exploits their linear dependence on the electron distribution function, decomposing the distribution function into a sum of parts each of whose emissivity can be calculated easily. We refer to this procedure as stochastic averaging and apply it in two contexts. First, we use it to estimate the emissivity of an isotropic κ distribution function with a high-energy cutoff. The resulting coefficients can be evaluated efficiently enough to be used directly in ray-tracing calculations, and we provide an example calculation. Second, we use stochastic averaging to assess the effect of subgrid turbulence on the volume-averaged emissivity and along the way provide a prescription for a turbulent emissivity. We find that for parameters appropriate to EHT sources turbulence reduces the emissivity slightly. In the infrared, turbulence can dramatically increase the emissivity.

Quiescent galaxies generally possess denser cores than star-forming galaxies with similar mass. As a measurement of the core density, the central stellar mass surface density within a radius of 1 kpc (Σ1) was thus suggested to be closely related to galaxy quenching. Massive star-forming galaxies with high Σ1 do not fit into this picture. To understand the origin of such galaxies, we compare the spatially resolved stellar population and star formation properties of massive (>1010.5M⊙) blue spiral galaxies with high and low Σ1, divided by Σ1 = 109.4M⊙ kpc−2, based on the final release of MaNGA integral field unit data. We find that both high-Σ1 and low-Σ1 blue spirals show large diversities in stellar population and star formation properties. Despite the diversities, high-Σ1 blue spirals are statistically different from the low-Σ1 ones. Specifically, the radial profiles of the luminosity-weighted age and Mgb/〈Fe〉 show that high-Σ1 blue spirals consist of a larger fraction of galaxies with younger and less α-element-enhanced centers than their low-Σ1 counterparts, ∼55% versus ∼30%. The galaxies with younger centers mostly have higher central specific star formation rates, which still follow the spaxel-based star formation main-sequence relation. Examinations of the Hα velocity field and the optical structures suggest that galactic bars or galaxy interactions should be responsible for the rejuvenation of these galaxies. The remaining ∼45% of high-Σ1 blue spirals are consistent with the inside-out growth scenario.

We recently introduced three new parameters that describe the shape of the normalized cumulative radial distribution (nCRD) of the innermost stars in globular clusters (GCs) and trace the clusters’ dynamical evolution. Here, we extend our previous investigations to the case of a large set of Monte Carlo simulations of GCs, started from a broad range of initial conditions. All the models are analyzed at the same age of 13 Gyr when they have reached different evolutionary phases. The sample of models is well representative of the structural properties of the observed population of Galactic GCs. We confirm that the three nCRD parameters are powerful tools to distinguish systems in the early stages of dynamical evolution from those that have already experienced core collapse. They might also help disentangle clusters hosting a low-mass intermediate-mass black hole of a few hundred solar masses from cases with large concentrations of dark remnants in their centers. With respect to other dynamical indicators, the nCRD parameters offer the advantage of being fully empirical and easier to measure from observational data.

研究利用哈勃太空望远镜对年轻银河开放星团NGC 3293中的8颗早期B星进行了硼丰度或上限的测定，现在该星团中有18颗早期B星的硼测量数据。新观测到的六颗旋转速度大于200 km/s，为主序星旋转混合提供了新的约束。研究发现，大部分样本星符合预测的旋转速度与质量或光度增大时硼耗尽加剧的趋势，表明较小的旋转混合效率。而五颗旋转较慢的星显示出比旋转混合预期更大的硼耗尽，推测这些星可能源自双星合并。 <div>
New boron abundances or upper limits have been determined for eight early B stars in the young Galactic open cluster NGC 3293, using UV spectra obtained by the Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic Origins Spectrograph. With previous observations, there are now 18 early B stars in this cluster with boron measurements. Six of the newly observed stars have projected rotational velocities greater than 200 km s−1, allowing new constraints on rotationally driven mixing in main-sequence stars. When comparing to synthetic model populations, we find that the majority of our sample stars agree well with the predicted trends of stronger boron depletion for larger rotation and for larger mass or luminosity. Based on those, a smaller than the canonical rotational mixing efficiency (fc ≈ 0.0165 versus the more standard value of 0.033) appears to be favored. In addition, the five mostly slowly rotating stars, when considered as a group, tend to show more boron depletion than expected from rotational mixing, and we speculate that most or all of these originate from binary mergers.

Rapidly spinning magnetars are potential candidates for the energy source of supernovae (SNe) and gamma-ray bursts and the most promising sources for continuous gravitational waves (GWs) detected by ground-based GW detectors. Continuous GWs can be radiated from magnetars due to magnetic-induced deformation or fluid oscillations, compatible with magnetic dipole (MD) radiation for spin-down energy. In this paper, we investigate the diverse light curves of magnetar-driven SNe in the scenario that the spin-down is dominated by GW radiation and/or MD radiation. By simulating the light curves of SNe and employing the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, we constrain the parameters of the magnetars and SN explosions and show that the signature of GW radiation may be indicated by the bolometric luminosity curves of SNe Ic-BL 2007ru and 2009bb. We find that the ellipticity of magnetars in the order of 10−3 can be induced by the magnetic field of ∼1016 G. If such continuous GWs associated with SNe can be detected in the future by the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors, this would be a smoking gun for a magnetar engine powering SNe.

总结:<br />
磁场可能在巨大恒星和星团形成的初期条件中起着至关重要的作用。研究人员使用了SOFIA-HAWC+ 214 μm观测偏振热尘埃辐射和高分辨率GBT-Argus C18O(1-0)观测，得出了对质量星际暗云G28.37+0.07磁场强度的地图。研究表明，这些区域的磁场在调节崩缩过程中起着主导作用，而且与密度梯度方向呈明显一致。但是，原恒星的喷流方向与磁场方向没有明显的偏好。这些结果表明磁场在调节巨大恒星和星团形成过程中起着至关重要的作用，因此在理论模型中必须考虑磁场的作用。 <div>
Magnetic fields may play a crucial role in setting the initial conditions of massive star and star cluster formation. To investigate this, we report SOFIA-HAWC+ 214 μm observations of polarized thermal dust emission and high-resolution GBT-Argus C18O(1-0) observations toward the massive Infrared Dark Cloud (IRDC) G28.37+0.07. Considering the local dispersion of B-field orientations, we produce a map of the B-field strength of the IRDC, which exhibits values between ∼0.03 and 1 mG based on a refined Davis–Chandrasekhar–Fermi method proposed by Skalidis & Tassis. Comparing to a map of inferred density, the IRDC exhibits a B–n relation with a power-law index of 0.51 ± 0.02, which is consistent with a scenario of magnetically regulated anisotropic collapse. Consideration of the mass-to-flux ratio map indicates that magnetic fields are dynamically important in most regions of the IRDC. A virial analysis of a sample of massive, dense cores in the IRDC, including evaluation of magnetic and kinetic internal and surface terms, indicates consistency with virial equilibrium, sub-Alfvénic conditions, and a dominant role for B-fields in regulating collapse. A clear alignment of magnetic field morphology with the direction of the steepest column density gradient is also detected. However, there is no preferred orientation of protostellar outflow directions with the B-field. Overall, these results indicate that magnetic fields play a crucial role in regulating massive star and star cluster formation, and therefore they need to be accounted for in theoretical models of these processes.

<div> 关键词: HFSs, G6.55-0.1, 星团形成, CO和射电连续波, 重力坍缩

总结:
本研究通过射电连续波和CO分子的观测，研究了与G6.55-0.1相关的Hub-filament系统(HFSs)。射电连续波图显示了多个峰值，与远红外尘埃连续波峰值重合，表明在HFSs的中心存在多个年轻的大质量恒星。通过C18O(2–1)地图得到的速度信息，确定了G6.55-0.1与超新星遗迹W28无物理联系，并识别了与G6.55-0.1真正相关的速度组分。结果显示，13.8和17.3 km/s处的两个纤维丝 contribute a total mass accretion rate of 3000 M⊙ Myr−1 to the hub。这两个纤维丝的速度剖面显示了V字形结构，表明了其重力坍缩的特征。研究还发现，纤维丝的单位长度质量小于由平衡考虑得出的临界线密度，这表明纤维丝并非整体重力坍缩，尽管其内部清晰地显示了年轻的恒星形成核心。观测到的速度梯度与从质量和尺寸估算出的主源的重力坍缩一致。 <div>
Hub–filament systems (HFSs) being the potential sites of formation of star clusters and high-mass stars, provide a testbed for the current theories that attempt to explain star formation globally. It is thus important to study a large number of HFSs using both intensity and velocity information to constrain these objects better observationally. Here, we present a study of the HFS associated with G6.55-0.1 using newly obtained observations of the radio continuum and the J = 2–1 transition of CO, 13CO, and C18O. The radio continuum maps show multiple peaks that coincide with far-infrared dust continuum peaks, indicating the presence of more than one young massive star in the hub of the HFS. We used the velocity information from the C18O(2–1) map to (a) show that the source G6.55-0.1 is not physically associated with the supernova remnant W28 and (b) disentangle and identify the velocity components genuinely associated with G6.55-0.1. Among the velocity-coherent structures identified in the region, we conclude that only the two filaments at 13.8 and 17.3 km s−1 contribute a total mass accretion rate of 3000 M⊙ Myr−1 to the hub. Both the filaments also show a V-shaped structure, characteristic of gravitational collapse, in their velocity profile at the location of the hub. The estimated mass per unit length of the segments of the filaments is smaller than the critical line masses derived from virial equilibrium considerations. This suggests that the filaments are not gravitationally collapsing as a whole, although their inner parts clearly show evidence of collapse in the form of young star-forming cores. We further conclude that the observed velocity gradients are consistent with the gravitational collapse of the main source in the region as estimated from its mass and size.

<div> Advanced Composition Explorer, solar wind, turbulence, anisotropy, plasma density fluctuations
<br /><br />总结:
本文研究了太阳风湍流中等能量范围和惯性范围内等离子体密度涨落的各向异性问题。研究发现，在几乎所有速度范围内，密度相关尺度在准平行于大尺度平均磁场方向时略大于准垂直方向。其中，在小的相关水平上，如能量含量尺度及更大尺度上，快速风中密度涨落接近各向同性，而慢速和中速风则略倾向于更快的垂直方向相关消失。而在较小的惯性范围内，密度涨落的各向异性方向在所有速度范围内都是相反的，尤其在快速风样本中更加明显。与已发表的速度和磁场相关结果相对比，表明了不同的发现。 <div>
A well-known property of solar wind plasma turbulence is the observed anisotropy of the autocorrelations, or equivalently the spectra, of velocity and magnetic field fluctuations. Here we explore the related but apparently not well-studied issue of the anisotropy of plasma density fluctuations in the energy-containing and inertial ranges of solar wind turbulence. Using 10 yr (1998–2008) of in situ data from the Advanced Composition Explorer mission, we find that for all but the fastest wind category, the density correlation scale is slightly larger in directions quasi-parallel to the large-scale mean magnetic field as compared to quasi-perpendicular directions. The correlation scale in fast wind is consistent with isotropic. The anisotropy as a function of the level of correlation is also explored. We find at small correlation levels, i.e., at energy-containing scales and larger, the density fluctuations are close to isotropy for fast wind, and slightly favor more rapid decorrelation in perpendicular directions for slow and medium winds. At relatively smaller (inertial range) scales where the correlation values are larger, the sense of anisotropy is reversed in all speed ranges, implying a more “slablike” structure, especially prominent in the fast wind samples. We contrast this finding with published results on velocity and magnetic field correlations.

<div> 关键词: luminous galaxies, high-redshift, Balmer breaks, baryonic minihalos, ΛCDM cosmological model

总结:
该研究报告了在标准宇宙学模型预测的暗物质晕的质量函数和存在于明亮的高红移星系之间存在紧张关系。研究提出了一种改进的测试方法，利用高红移巴尔默跃迁来探测早期104-105M⊙的重子迷你暗物质晕的形成。与先前的测试不同，这不依赖于质量与光度比，并且仅在很小程度上依赖于金属丰度、恒星初始质量函数和星形成历史，这些在高红移处的约束都较弱。研究表明，在最简单的ΛCDM宇宙学模型下，允许在z=9时的最强巴尔默跃迁的D4000约为1.26，在包括真实反馈模型的情况下D4000≤1.14。由于当前对JWST源的光度学模板拟合推断出在z≳11时存在更强的巴尔默跃迁，即将进行的光谱学后续研究将证明这些模板在高红移处无效，或者暗示“纯正”ΛCDM之外的新物理。 <div>
Recent studies have reported tension between the presence of luminous, high-redshift galaxies and the halo mass functions predicted by standard cosmology. Here, an improved test is proposed using the presence of high-redshift Balmer breaks to probe the formation of early 104–105M⊙ baryonic minihalos. Unlike previous tests, this does not depend upon the mass-to-light ratio and has only a slight dependence upon the metallicity, stellar initial mass function, and star formation history, which are all weakly constrained at high redshift. We show that the strongest Balmer breaks allowed at z = 9 using the simplest ΛCDM cosmological model would allow a D4000 as high as 1.26 under idealized circumstances and D4000 ≤ 1.14 including realistic feedback models. Since current photometric template fitting to JWST sources infers the existence of stronger Balmer breaks out to z ≳ 11, upcoming spectroscopic follow-up will either demonstrate those templates are invalid at high redshift or imply new physics beyond “vanilla” ΛCDM.

<br /><br />总结:
本文介绍了在Keck II望远镜上安装Zernike波前传感器（ZWFS）进行分段主镜闭环距离控制的研究。分段主镜的协同误差是Keck望远镜对比度限制的主要贡献因素，也是必须纠正的问题，特别是对于下一代太空任务和基于地面的超大型望远镜。ZWFS的目标是在科学观测中监测和纠正主镜协同误差。该研究使用的ZWFS是非常适合测量相位不连续性的传感器，并且对此非常敏感，但动态范围有限。Keck的向量型ZWFS在自适应光学校正波前上工作，并且采用了一个超表面焦平面掩模，在点扩散函数的核心上施加了两种不同的相位移动，产生两个正交的瞳像。这种设计扩展了动态范围，相对于标量ZWFS而言。通过ZWFS，通过闭环控制主镜分段的距离，能够将NIRC2科学相机的Strehl比提高10个百分点。我们分析了闭环测试的性能，对NIRC2科学数据的影响，并讨论了ZWFS测量的结果。 <div>
We present the first on-sky segmented primary mirror closed-loop piston control using a Zernike wavefront sensor (ZWFS) installed on the Keck II telescope. Segment cophasing errors are a primary contributor to contrast limits on Keck and will be necessary to correct for the next generation of space missions and ground-based extremely large telescopes, which will all have segmented primary mirrors. The goal of the ZWFS installed on Keck is to monitor and correct primary mirror cophasing errors in parallel with science observations. The ZWFS is ideal for measuring phase discontinuities such as segment cophasing errors and is one of the most sensitive WFSs, but has limited dynamic range. The vector-ZWFS at Keck works on the adaptive-optics-corrected wavefront and consists of a metasurface focal plane mask that imposes two different phase shifts on the core of the point-spread function to two orthogonal light polarizations, producing two pupil images. This design extends the dynamic range compared with the scalar ZWFS. The primary mirror segment pistons were controlled in closed loop using the ZWFS, improving the Strehl ratio on the NIRC2 science camera by up to 10 percentage points. We analyze the performance of the closed-loop tests, the impact on NIRC2 science data, and discuss the ZWFS measurements.

通过使用Large Array Survey Telescope (LAST)进行观测，独立探测长时间伽马射线暴 (GRBs) 的早期光学发射。该方法利用小型光学望远镜组成的阵列，可以扫描广泛的天空区域，并在需要时集中于较小的视场以提高灵敏度。阵列的模块化结构便于快速切换望远镜指向，从而显著增加了对短时间尺度内盲目调查的有效天空覆盖面积。通过对伽马射线对应事件的早期数据的补充，可以为高能观测提供宝贵的信息。即使没有伽马射线关联，探测也可能用于探索与GRBs相关的各种现象，如孤立余辉、污染火球和窒息喷流。我们模拟了一组GRBs及其早期光学信号，考虑动态采样率后，将光变曲线输入到一个机器学习分类器中，用于识别天文现象。通过将LAST阵列的一半用于盲目搜索，预计每年可以独立检测7-11个GRBs，相当于每年大约0.12deg-2的内在事件率。
<br /><br />总结: 通过使用LAST阵列，可以探测到GRBs的早期光学发射。这种方法利用小型望远镜阵列的模块化结构，可以对天空进行快速高效的观测，为GRBs研究提供了新的途径。模拟结果表明，采用机器学习分类器的方法可以识别并独立检测出GRBs，并为研究员提供有价值的数据。 <div>
We present an observational approach for the independent detection of the early optical emission of long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). For this purpose, we explore the potential of the Large Array Survey Telescope (LAST). This array of small optical telescopes can be used to scan a wide region of the sky, and to focus on a smaller field of view with increased sensitivity, as needed. The modularity of the array facilitates dynamic scanning of multiple fields, by shifting telescope pointing directions with high cadence. This can significantly increase the effective sky-coverage of a blind survey on short timescales. For events associated with gamma-ray counterparts, the valuable early time data can supplement high-energy observations. Regardless of gamma-ray association, detections can potentially be used to explore various phenomena associated with GRBs, such as orphan afterglows; dirty fireballs; and choked jets. We simulate a sample of GRBs and their respective optical signals at early times. After accounting for dynamic cadence, the light curves are given as input to a machine-learning classifier, used to identify astrophysical transients. We find that, by dedicating half of an LAST array to a blind search, one would expect to independently detect 7–11 GRBs yr–1, corresponding to an approximate intrinsic event rate of 0.12 deg–2 yr–1.

We present Selective Amplification of Ultra Noisy Astronomical Signal (SAUNAS), a pipeline designed for detecting diffuse X-ray emission in the data obtained with the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) of the Chandra X-ray Observatory. SAUNAS queries the available observations in the Chandra archive and performs photometric calibration, point-spread function modeling and deconvolution, point-source removal, adaptive smoothing, and background correction. This pipeline builds on existing and well-tested software including CIAO, VorBin, and LIRA. We characterize the performance of SAUNAS through several quality performance tests and demonstrate the broad applications and capabilities of SAUNAS using two galaxies already known to show X-ray-emitting structures. SAUNAS successfully detects the 30 kpc X-ray superwind of NGC 3079 using Chandra/ACIS data sets, matching the spatial distribution detected with more sensitive XMM-Newton observations. The analysis performed by SAUNAS reveals an extended low surface brightness source in the field of UGC 5101 in the 0.3–1.0 keV and 1.0–2.0 keV bands. This source is potentially a background galaxy cluster or a hot gas plume associated with UGC 5101. SAUNAS demonstrates its ability to recover previously undetected structures in archival data, expanding exploration into the low surface brightness X-ray Universe with Chandra/ACIS.

JWST 的 PROJECT-J 计划使用 NIRSpec 和 MIRI 光谱技术研究了 HH46 IRS 和其流出物。数据显示了前所未有的射线、分子流和空腔细节。首次探测到源头附近约90天文单位处的红移射流。观测到了数十条受激禁忌线，包括[Ne iii] 15.5 μm等高度电离的物质，表明气体受到高速冲击（>80 km/s）在相对高密度介质中的激发。H2线的图像展示了复杂的分子流动，明亮的空腔、分子壳和喷流驱动的弓形冲击与周围条件相互作用并受其塑造。NIRCam 2 μm 图像解析了 HH46 IRS 大约110天文单位的二元系统，并表明在射流和H2广角发射之间观察到的巨大不对称可能是由两个不同的喷流驱动的。未解析二元系统的光谱显示深的冰带和吸收中的大量气体线，可能源自冷包层或盘。总之，JWST 首次揭示了 HH46 IRS 复杂的流出物的起源，证明了其对于研究年轻恒星周围的嵌入区域，即使在近红外波长下依然神秘的能力。<br /><br />总结: <div>
We present the first results of the JWST program PROJECT-J (PROtostellar JEts Cradle Tested with JWST), designed to study the Class I source HH46 IRS and its outflow through NIRSpec and MIRI spectroscopy (1.66–28 μm). The data provide line images (∼6.″6 in length with NIRSpec, and up to ∼20″ with MIRI) revealing unprecedented details within the jet, the molecular outflow, and the cavity. We detect, for the first time, the redshifted jet within ∼90 au from the source. Dozens of shock-excited forbidden lines are observed, including highly ionized species such as [Ne iii] 15.5 μm, suggesting that the gas is excited by high velocity (>80 km s−1) shocks in a relatively high-density medium. Images of H2 lines at different excitations outline a complex molecular flow, where a bright cavity, molecular shells, and a jet-driven bow shock interact with and are shaped by the ambient conditions. Additional NIRCam 2 μm images resolve the HH46 IRS ∼110 au binary system and suggest that the large asymmetries observed between the jet and the H2 wide-angle emission could be due to two separate outflows being driven by the two sources. The spectra of the unresolved binary show deep ice bands and plenty of gaseous lines in absorption, likely originating in a cold envelope or disk. In conclusion, JWST has unraveled for the first time the origin of the HH46 IRS complex outflow demonstrating its capability to investigate embedded regions around young stars, which remain elusive even at near-IR wavelengths.

<div> 部分潮汐破坏，中间质量黑洞，平滑粒子流体动力学，回落率，恒星残骸

这篇论文利用平滑粒子流体动力学方法，对恒星部分潮汐破坏后的回落现象进行了全面的数值分析。研究了单个太阳质量的白矮星在抛物线轨道上被一个质量为103太阳质量的非自旋中间质量黑洞部分潮汐破坏的数值模拟，并确定了碎片回落到黑洞内的核心质量分数和回落率。对于超大质量黑洞，在完全破坏过程中，已知延迟时间的回落率遵循t−5/3的幂律，而近期有推测称部分潮汐破坏的回落率在后期会饱和为更陡的t−9/4幂律，与遗留的核心质量无关。然而，本文表明，对于中间质量黑洞，部分破坏显著改变了这一结论。也就是说，后期的回落率并不会渐近于t−9/4的幂律，而且这一率还强烈依赖于核心质量。我们推导了一个关于后期回落率的稳健公式，作为核心质量分数的函数，与白矮星的质量无关，我们通过对其进行多次数值验证进行了验证。 <br /><br />总结: 本文利用平滑粒子流体动力学方法对中间质量黑洞部分潮汐破坏后的回落现象进行了数值分析，并发现后期的回落率不会趋近于t−9/4的幂律，且这一率也极大地依赖于核心质量。研究结果对进一步理解中间质量黑洞的特征具有重要意义。 <div>
The fallback rate of debris after the partial tidal disruption of a star by an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) might provide important signatures of such black holes rather than supermassive ones. Here using smoothed particle hydrodynamics methods, we provide a comprehensive numerical analysis of this phenomenon. We perform numerical simulations of single partial tidal disruptions of solar-mass white dwarfs in parabolic orbits, with a nonspinning 103 M⊙ IMBH for various values of the impact parameter, and determine the core mass fractions and fallback rates of debris into the IMBH. For supermassive black holes, in full disruption processes, it is known that the late-time fallback rate follows a power law t−5/3, whereas for partial disruptions, such a rate has recently been conjectured to saturate at a steeper power law t−9/4, independent of the mass of the remnant core. We show here that for IMBHs, partial disruptions significantly alter this conclusion. That is, the fallback rate at late times does not asymptote to a t−9/4 power law, and this rate is also a strong function of the core mass. We derive a robust formula for the late-time fallback rate as a function of the core mass fraction, which is independent of the mass of the white dwarf, as we verify numerically by varying it.

White dwarf stars are ubiquitous in the Galaxy, and are essential to understanding stellar evolution. While most white dwarfs are photometrically stable and reliable flux standards, some can be highly variable, which can reveal unique details about the endpoints of low-mass stellar evolution. In this study, we characterize a sample of high-confidence white dwarfs with multi-epoch photometry from Gaia Data Release 3. We compare these Gaia light curves with light curves from the Zwicky Transiting Facility and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite to see when Gaia data independently can accurately measure periods of variability. From this sample, 105 objects have variability periods measured from the Gaia light curves independently, with periods as long as roughly 9.5 days and as short as 256.2 s (roughly 4 minutes), including seven systems with periods shorter than 1000 s. We discover 86 new objects from the 105 target samples, including pulsating, spotted, and binary white dwarfs, and even a new 68.4 minute eclipsing cataclysmic variable. The median amplitude of the absolute photometric variability we confirm from Gaia independently is 1.4%, demonstrating that Gaia epoch photometry is capable of measuring short-term periods even when observations are sparse.

这篇文章利用哈勃太空望远镜成像数据对四个超微型矮星系进行了低质量恒星初始质量函数(IMF)的研究。研究采用了Kolmogorov-Smirnov检验来确定观测到的明度分布是否能够排除给定的IMF参数和二元分数。针对Reticulum II和Ursa Major II两个系统还确定了最佳拟合参数值，并发现Reticulum II的IMF与银河系的类似，而Ursa Major II的IMF更偏重底部。但Ursa Major II的结果可能存在来自两个已知背景星系团的污染。总结:本研究利用哈勃太空望远镜数据对超微型矮星系进行了低质量恒星初始质量函数(IMF)的研究，发现这些星系排除了多种IMF，未能排除的IMF与银河系的相似。对Reticulum II和Ursa Major II两个系统确定了最佳拟合参数值，但Ursa Major II的结果可能存在污染。 <div>
The stellar initial mass function (IMF) describes the distribution of stellar masses that form in a given star formation event. The long main-sequence lifetimes of low-mass stars mean that the IMF in this regime (below ∼ 1 M⊙) can be investigated through star counts. Ultrafaint dwarf galaxies are low-luminosity systems with ancient, metal-poor stellar populations. We investigate the low-mass IMF in four such systems (Reticulum II, Ursa Major II, Triangulum II, and Segue 1), using Hubble Space Telescope imaging data that reaches to ≲ 0.2 M⊙ in each galaxy. The analysis techniques that we adopt depend on the number of low-mass stars in each sample. We use Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests for all four galaxies to determine whether their observed apparent magnitude distributions can reject a given combination of IMF parameters and binary fraction for the underlying population. We forward model 1000 synthetic populations for each combination of parameters, and reject those parameters only if each of the 1000 realizations reject the null hypothesis. We find that all four galaxies reject a variety of IMFs, and the IMFs that they cannot reject include those that are identical, or similar, to that of the stellar populations of the Milky Way. We determine the best-fit parameter values for the IMF in Reticulum II and Ursa Major II and find that the IMF in Reticulum II is generally consistent with that of the Milky Way, while the IMF in Ursa Major II is more bottom heavy. The interpretation of the results for Ursa Major II is complicated by possible contamination from two known background galaxy clusters.

该研究对银河中心的Sgr B2北部进行了映射研究，首次在84 GHz检测到了Class I 甲醇(CH3OH)激光以及首次对5.29 GHz的甲醛(CH2NH)激光进行了干涉图。使用非LTE辐射传输模型和马尔可夫蒙特卡洛方法进行贝叶斯分析，以定量评估观察到的光谱轮廓。结果表明，对于低连续背景辐射区域，采用两链块模型来解释强烈的CH3OH Class I激光辐射。通过比较几种分子物种的激光辐射的空间起源和范围，发现5.29 GHz的CH2NH激光与84 GHz的CH3OH Class I激光有密切的空间关系，这提供了观测证据，暗示了这些激光跃迁具有相似的碰撞泵浦机制。 <div>
At centimeter wavelengths, single-dish observations have suggested that the Sagittarius (Sgr) B2 molecular cloud at the Galactic Center hosts weak maser emission from several organic molecules, including CH2NH, HNCNH, and HCOOCH3. However, the lack of spatial distribution information on these new maser species has prevented us from assessing the excitation conditions of the maser emission as well as their pumping mechanisms. Here, we present a mapping study toward Sgr B2 north (N) to locate the region where the complex maser emission originates. We report the first detection of the Class I methanol (CH3OH) maser at 84 GHz and the first interferometric map of the methanimine (CH2NH) maser at 5.29 GHz toward this region. In addition, we present a tool for modeling and fitting the unsaturated molecular maser signals with non-LTE radiative transfer models and Bayesian analysis using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. These enable us to quantitatively assess the observed spectral profiles. The results suggest a two-chain-clump model for explaining the intense CH3OH Class I maser emission toward a region with low continuum background radiation. By comparing the spatial origin and extent of maser emission from several molecular species, we find that the 5.29 GHz CH2NH maser has a close spatial relationship with the 84 GHz CH3OH Class I masers. This relationship serves as observational evidence to suggest a similar collisional pumping mechanism for these maser transitions.

<div> 关键词: 行星、温度、密度、压力、旋转
总结:
本文研究了行星如何随着温度和旋转率的变化而改变大小。研究表明，行星的半径主要取决于表面密度、重力和表面不可压缩性。小行星的半径会随温度变化而变化，而大行星则不会受到温度的影响。同样地，行星的半径还会受到其旋转率的影响。综合来看，地球和类地行星的半径在温度和旋转率方面处于一个中等状态。 <div>
Condensed planets contract or expand as their temperature changes. With the exception of the effect of phase changes, this phenomenon is generally interpreted as being solely related to the thermal expansivity of the planet’s components. However, changes in density affect pressure and gravity and, consequently, the planet’s compressibility. A planet’s radius is also linked to its rate of rotation. Here again, changes in pressure, gravity, and compressibility are coupled. In this article we clarify how the radius of a condensed planet changes with temperature and rotation, using a simple and rigorous thermodynamic model. We consider condensed materials to obey a simple equation of state which generalizes a polytopic EoS as temperature varies. Using this equation, we build simple models of condensed planet’s interiors including exoplanets, derive their mass–radius relationships, and study the dependence of their radius on temperature and rotation rate. We show that it depends crucially on the value of ρsgR/Ks (ρs being surface density, g gravity, R radius, Ks surface incompressibility). This nondimensional number is also the ratio of the dissipation number which appears in compressible convection and the Gruneïsen mineralogic parameter. While the radius of small planets depends on temperature, this is not the case for large planets with large dissipation numbers; Earth and a super-Earth like CoRoT-7b are in something of an intermediate state, with a moderately temperature-dependent radius. Similarly, while the radius of these two planets is a function of their rotation rates, this is not the case for smaller or larger planets.

<title>Global Coronal Plasma Diagnostics Based on Multislit Extreme-ultraviolet Spectroscopy</title>

Full-disk spectroscopic observations of the solar corona are highly desired to forecast solar eruptions and their impact on planets and to uncover the origin of solar wind. In this paper, we introduce a new multislit design (five slits) to obtain extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) spectra simultaneously. The selected spectrometer wavelength range (184–197 Å) contains several bright EUV lines that can be used for spectral diagnostics. The multislit approach offers an unprecedented way to efficiently obtain the global spectral data but the ambiguity from different slits should be resolved. Using a numerical simulation of the global corona, we primarily concentrate on the optimization of the disambiguation process, with the objective of extracting decomposed spectral information of six primary lines. This subsequently facilitates a comprehensive series of plasma diagnostics, including density (Fe xii 195.12/186.89 Å), Doppler velocity (Fe xii 193.51 Å), line width (Fe xii 193.51 Å), and temperature diagnostics (Fe viii 185.21 Å, Fe x 184.54 Å, Fe xi 188.22 Å, and Fe xii 193.51 Å). We find a good agreement between the forward modeling parameters and the inverted results at the initial eruption stage of a coronal mass ejection, indicating the robustness of the decomposition method and its immense potential for global monitoring of the solar corona.

<title>Discovery and Characterization of Two Ultrafaint Dwarfs outside the Halo of the Milky Way: Leo M and Leo K</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report the discovery of two ultrafaint dwarf galaxies, Leo M and Leo K, that lie outside the halo of the Milky Way (MW). Using Hubble Space Telescope imaging of the resolved stars, we create color–magnitude diagrams reaching the oldest main-sequence turnoff of each system and (i) fit for structural parameters of the galaxies; (ii) measure their distances using the luminosity of the horizontal branch stars; (iii) estimate integrated magnitudes and stellar masses; and (iv) reconstruct the star formation histories. Based on their location in the Local Group, neither galaxy is currently within the halo of the MW although Leo K is located ∼26 kpc from the low-mass galaxy Leo T and these two systems may have had a past interaction. Leo M and Leo K have stellar masses of M⊙ and 1.2 ± 0.2 × 104M⊙, and were quenched Gyr and Gyr ago, respectively. Given that the galaxies are at farther distances from the MW, it is unlikely that they were quenched by environmental processing. Instead, given their low stellar masses, their early quenching timescales are consistent with the scenario that a combination of reionization and stellar feedback shut down star formation at early cosmic times.

<title>Is the Compact Object Associated with HESS J1731-347 a Strange Quark Star? A Possible Astrophysical Scenario for Its Formation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The analysis of the central compact object within the supernova (SN) remnant HESS J1731-347 suggests that it has a small radius and, even more interestingly, a mass of the order or smaller than 1 M⊙. This raises the question of which astrophysical process could lead to such a small mass, since the analysis of various types of SN explosions indicate that is it not possible to produce a neutron star with a mass smaller than about 1.17 M⊙. Here we show that masses of the order or smaller than 1 M⊙ can be obtained in the case of strange quark stars and that it is possible to build a coherent model explaining not only the mass and the radius of that object, but also its slow cooling suggested in various analyses. We also show that an astrophysical path exists, which leads to the formation of such an object, and we discuss the role played in that scenario by strangelets assumed to constitute the dark matter.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Young stellar objects are thought to commonly undergo sudden accretion events that result in a rise in bolometric luminosity. These outbursts likely coincide with the onset of planet formation and could impact the formation of planets. The reason behind this dramatic enhancement of accretion is an active area of research, and the mass of the system is a critical parameter. Using the Northern Extended Millimeter Array, we survey five outbursting sources (three FU Ori, one EX Or, and one “peculiar” source) with the primary goal of determining the system’s mass using an optically thin line of CO. We estimate the mass of a central region for each object that using both continuum emission and C17O J = 2-1. The C17O emission likely includes both disk and inner envelope material, thus acts as an upper limit on the disk mass, ranging from 0.33 to 3.4 M⊙ for our sources. These derived masses suggest that the inner ∼1000 au contains enough mass along the line of sight for these sources to be gravitationally unstable.

总结: 本文研究了原行星盘（CPD）和行星的辐射对盘温度的影响，并进行了合成预测。通过水动力学模拟和辐射传递后处理，作者发现在大多数情况下，CPD和行星的辐射可以局部增加盘温度，且可能在毫米波辐射中产生可检测的特征。此外，CPD的存在还可以产生对连续光谱减法重要的方位不对称性。因此，结合局部尘埃气体比和吸积速率的综合分析，对原行星在其他波长的检测限制了它们的生长时间尺度。 <br /><br /> <div>
The discovery of protoplanets and circumplanetary disks provides a unique opportunity to characterize planet formation through observations. Massive protoplanets shape the physical and chemical structure of their host circumstellar disk by accretion, localized emission, and disk depletion. In this work, we study the thermal changes induced within the disk by protoplanet accretion and synthetic predictions through hydrodynamical simulations with postprocessed radiative transfer with an emphasis on radio millimeter emission. We explored distinct growth conditions and varied both planetary accretion rates and the local dust-to-gas mass ratios for a protoplanet at 1200 K. The radiative transfer models show that beyond the effect of disk gaps, in most cases, the circumplanetary disk (CPD) and the planet’s emission locally increase the disk temperature. Moreover, depending on the local dust-to-gas depletion and accretion rate, the presence of the CPD may have detectable signatures in millimeter emission. It also has the power to generate azimuthal asymmetries that are important for continuum subtraction. Thus, if other means of detection of protoplanets are proven, the lack of corresponding evidence at other wavelengths can set limits on their growth timescales through a combined analysis of the local dust-to-gas ratio and the accretion rate.

<div> 关键词：太阳活动周期，全球振荡模式，日震环图法，近表面剪切层，地球物理研究<br />
<br />总结:
本研究利用全球振荡模式分裂获取太阳近表面剪切层的旋转梯度，以了解太阳活动周期和地球船的动力学。在分析中发现，日震环图法能够提供高分辨率的结果，相较于全球振荡模式分裂。然而，默认参数会限制近表面梯度的准确性。作者通过拟合每个位置一年平均的功率谱，再进行12年平均的方法来解决这一挑战。结果显示，近表面剪切层可以分为三个明显的区域：深层、大范围、梯度逐渐加剧；狭窄的中间层，梯度大约是前者的3倍；接近表面的层，对数梯度接近零，但在向表面变得更陡。此外，研究还揭示了经度对梯度的差异以及东西方的对称成分。 <div>
The gradient of rotation in the near-surface shear layer (NSSL) of the Sun provides valuable insights into the dynamics associated with the solar activity cycle and the dynamo. Results obtained with global oscillation mode splittings lack resolution near the surface, prompting the use of the local helioseismic ring-diagram method. While the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager ring-analysis pipeline has been used previously for analyzing this layer, default pipeline parameters limit the accuracy of the near-surface gradients. To address these challenges, we fitted the flow parameters to power spectra averaged over one-year periods at each location, followed by additional averaging over 12 yr. We find that the NSSL can be divided into three fairly distinct regions: a deeper, larger region with a small shear, steepening toward the surface; a narrow middle layer with a strong shear, with a gradient approximately 3 times larger; and a layer very close to the surface, where the logarithmic gradient is close to zero but becomes steeper again toward the surface. The middle layer appears to be centered at 3 Mm, but the poor resolution in these layers implies that it is potentially located closer to the surface, around 1.5 Mm deep. While our analysis primarily focused on regions along the central meridian, we also investigated systematic errors at longitudes off the center. The east–west antisymmetric component of the gradient reveals a layer of substantial differences between the east and west longitude of around 1.7 Mm, and the amplitude of the differences increases with the longitude.

总结: <br />
引入引力波天文学使得我们能够研究宇宙中紧凑双星合并现象，这有助于理解恒星、它们所处的环境以及演化过程。目前，我们活跃地探讨的一个问题是紧凑双星形成的本质：促成黑洞诞生所需的环境和化学条件，以及双星合并前经历的时间延迟。然而，由于当前干涉仪的灵敏度限制，如今探测到的引力波事件主要发生在低或中红移处，限制了我们探测这些数量在高红移处的行为能力。为此，本文利用了另一种信息源：观测限制了远古宇宙中未解析双星引力波背景。利用来自LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA的前三次观测运行的引力波数据，我们将直接探测到的双星目录和对未解析背景的限制结合起来，以限制双黑洞演化的时间延迟分布和金属丰度的依赖性。同时，我们也探讨了这些约束在Advanced LIGO A+灵敏度下如何改善。尽管今天的数据无法强力约束双黑洞的形成方式，但Advanced LIGO A+未来对引力波背景的探测（或未探测）将对双黑洞的演化带来重大影响。 <div>
The advent of gravitational-wave astronomy is now allowing for the study of compact binary merger demographics throughout the Universe. This information can be leveraged as tools for understanding massive stars, their environments, and their evolution. One active question is the nature of compact binary formation: the environmental and chemical conditions required for black hole birth and the time delays experienced by binaries before they merge. Gravitational-wave events detected today, however, primarily occur at low or moderate redshifts due to current interferometer sensitivity, therefore limiting our ability to probe the high-redshift behavior of these quantities. In this work, we circumvent this limitation by using an additional source of information: observational limits on the gravitational-wave background from unresolved binaries in the distant Universe. Using current gravitational-wave data from the first three observing runs of LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA, we combine catalogs of directly detected binaries and limits on the stochastic background to constrain the time-delay distribution and metallicity dependence of binary black hole evolution. Looking to the future, we also explore how these constraints will be improved at the Advanced LIGO A+ sensitivity. We conclude that, although binary black hole formation cannot be strongly constrained with today’s data, the future detection (or a nondetection) of the gravitational-wave background with Advanced LIGO A+ will carry strong implications for the evolution of binary black holes.

Large-scale cosmic filaments may have played an important role in shaping the properties of galaxies. Meanwhile, cosmic filaments are believed to harbor a substantial portion of the missing baryons at redshift z < 2. To inspect the role of filaments in these issues, many properties of filaments need to be examined, including their lengths, thicknesses, and density profiles. However, measuring some of these properties poses challenges. This study concentrates on estimating filament width/thickness, investigating potential correlations between the local width of filaments and the properties of dark matter halos within filaments. We find that the local width of filaments generally increases with the mass of dark matter halos embedded in filaments per unit length, roughly following a second-order polynomial, although with notable scatter. We probe and discuss means that may refine our findings. After further verification and improvements, this relation could be applied to filament samples constructed from the observed galaxy distribution, aiding in understanding the roles of cosmic filaments in galaxy evolution and uncovering the missing baryons.

The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) provides an avenue to study black hole accretion flows on event-horizon scales. Fitting a semianalytical model to EHT observations requires the construction of synthetic images, which is computationally expensive. This study presents an image generation tool in the form of a generative machine-learning model, which extends the capabilities of a variational autoencoder. This tool can rapidly and continuously interpolate between a training set of images and can retrieve the defining parameters of those images. Trained on a set of synthetic black hole images, our tool showcases success in interpolating both black hole images and their associated physical parameters. By reducing the computational cost of generating an image, this tool facilitates parameter estimation and model validation for observations of black hole systems.

We simulate atmospheric fractionation in escaping planetary atmospheres using IsoFATE, a new open-source numerical model. We expand the parameter space studied previously to planets with tenuous atmospheres that exhibit the greatest helium and deuterium enhancement. We simulate the effects of extreme-ultraviolet-driven photoevaporation and core-powered mass loss on deuterium–hydrogen and helium–hydrogen fractionation of sub-Neptune atmospheres around G, K, and M stars. Our simulations predict prominent populations of deuterium- and helium-enhanced planets along the upper edge of the radius valley with mean equilibrium temperatures of ≈370 K and as low as 150 K across stellar types. We find that fractionation is mechanism dependent, so constraining He/H and D/H abundances in sub-Neptune atmospheres offers a unique strategy to investigate the origin of the radius valley around low-mass stars. Fractionation is also strongly dependent on retained atmospheric mass, offering a proxy for planetary surface pressure as well as a way to distinguish between desiccated enveloped terrestrials and water worlds. Deuterium-enhanced planets tend to be helium dominated and CH4 depleted, providing a promising strategy to observe HDO in the 3.7 μm window. We present a list of promising targets for observational follow-up.

We present the discovery of 13 new widely separated T dwarf companions to M dwarf primaries, identified using Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer/NEOWISE data by the CatWISE and Backyard Worlds: Planet 9 projects (hereafter BYW). This sample represents an ∼60% increase in the number of known M + T systems, and allows us to probe the most extreme products of binary/planetary system formation, a discovery space made available by the CatWISE2020 catalog and the BYW effort. Highlights among the sample are WISEP J075108.79-763449.6, a previously known T9 thought to be old due to its spectral energy distribution, which was found by Zhang et al. (2021b) to be part of a common proper motion pair with L34-26 A, a well-studied young M3 V star within 10 pc of the Sun; CWISE J054129.32-745021.5 B and 2MASS J05581644-4501559 B, two T8 dwarfs possibly associated with the very fast-rotating M4 V stars CWISE J054129.32745021.5 A and 2MASS J05581644-4501559 A; and UCAC3 52-1038 B, which is among the widest late-T companions to main-sequence stars, with a projected separation of ∼7100 au. The new benchmarks presented here are prime JWST targets, and can help us place strong constraints on the formation and evolution theory of substellar objects as well as on atmospheric models for these cold exoplanet analogs.

<div> HESS J1641−463, gamma-ray source, TeV spectrum, PeVatron candidate, NuSTAR data, X-ray counterpart<br />
<br />
这篇文章报告了对HESS J1641−463的NuSTAR数据分析结果。研究结果表明，在2-10 keV范围内存在X射线上限约为6 × 10^−13 erg cm^−2 s^−1 （在10-20 keV范围内约为3 × 10^−13 erg cm^−2 s^−1）。文章指出，如果伽玛射线的发射源是CR质子与周围物质相互作用产生的π0介子衰变，则在质子-质子相互作用中产生的次级电子可能会在X射线波段发出同步辐射光子。然而，本研究得到的X射线上限并不能对主要质子谱施加约束，需要未来硬X射线任务的进一步观测。 <br /><br />总结: HESS J1641−463是一个TeV能量谱的伽玛射线源，NuSTAR数据分析显示在X射线波段没有明显的对应源，并得到了X射线上限值。文章指出了这一结果对主要质子谱提供的约束不足，但也提出了未来研究的方向。 <div>
HESS J1641−463 is an unidentified gamma-ray source with a hard TeV gamma-ray spectrum, and thus it has been proposed to be a possible candidate for a cosmic-ray (CR) accelerator up to PeV energies (a PeVatron candidate). The source spatially coincides with the radio supernova remnant G338.5+0.1 but has not yet been fully explored in the X-ray band. We analyzed newly taken NuSTAR data, pointing at HESS J1641−463, with 82 ks effective exposure time. There is no apparent X-ray counterpart of HESS J1641−463, while nearby stellar cluster, Mercer 81, and stray-light X-rays are detected. Combined with the archival Chandra data, partially covering the source, we derived an upper limit of ∼6 × 10−13 erg cm−2 s−1 in 2–10 keV (∼3 × 10−13 erg cm−2 s−1 in 10–20 keV). If the gamma-ray emission is originated from the decay of π0 mesons produced in interactions between CR protons and ambient materials, secondary electrons in the proton–proton interactions can potentially emit synchrotron photons in the X-ray band, which can be tested by our X-ray observations. Although the obtained X-ray upper limits cannot place a constraint on the primary proton spectrum, it will be possible with a future hard X-ray mission.

该研究分析了 radio galaxy PKS 1007+142 的γ射线发射情况。通过对15年Fermi-LAT观测数据进行综合分析，发现PKS 1007+142是与未关联的LAT源4FGL J1010.0+1416最有可能对应的天体，并且其γ射线谱呈现出较软的特征。研究同时还讨论了PKS 1007+142的γ射线可能起源。总结：<br /><br />总结: 该研究利用Fermi-LAT观测数据分析了PKS 1007+142的γ射线发射情况，并确定了其与未关联的LAT源的对应关系，发现其γ射线谱较软。 <div>
The radio galaxy PKS 1007+142 is classified as a compact steep-spectrum source (CSS) and belongs to the class of young active galactic nuclei (AGNs). In this paper, we investigate the γ-ray emission from this CSS by conducting a comprehensive analysis of the 15 yr Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) observation data. The Fermi-LAT latest Source Catalog, 4FGL-DR4, includes an unassociated γ-ray source, 4FGL J1010.0+1416, located at 0.°24 away from the radio position of PKS 1007+142. Using the 15 yr Fermi-LAT observation data, we reestimate the best-fit position of the γ-ray source and find that PKS 1007+142 is in close proximity to the γ-ray source and falls within its 68% error circle. Therefore, we conclude that PKS 1007+142 is the most plausible counterpart to the unassociated LAT source with detection test statistics ∼ 43.4 (∼6.6σ). PKS 1007+142 exhibits a steep power-law spectrum in the 0.1–300 GeV band, with a photon spectral index (Γγ) of 2.86 ± 0.17. The average flux in the considered time interval is (2.14 ± 0.34) × 10−12 erg cm−2 s−1. Comparing PKS 1007+142 with other γ-ray emitting AGNs in both the Lγ–Γγ and Lγ–L1.4 GHz planes, it shows a softer γ-ray spectrum and lower luminosity compared to other γ-ray emitting CSSs. Furthermore, the possible origins of γ-ray in PKS 1007+142 are also discussed.

Most brown dwarfs show some level of photometric or spectral variability. However, finding the most variable dwarfs more suited for a thorough variability monitoring campaign remained a challenge until a few years ago with the design of spectral indices to find the most likely L and T dwarfs using their near-infrared (NIR) single-epoch spectrum. In this work, we designed and tested NIR spectral indices to preselect the most likely variable L4–L8 dwarfs, complementing the indices presented by Ashraf et al. and Oliveros-Gomez et al. We used time-resolved NIR Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 spectra of an L6.0 dwarf, LP 261–75b, to design our novel spectral indices. We tested these spectral indices on 75 L4.0–L8.0 NIR SpeX/IRTF spectra, providing 27 new variable candidates. Our indices have a recovery rate of ∼80% and a false negative rate of ∼25%. All the known nonvariable brown dwarfs were found to be nonvariable by our indices. We estimated the variability fraction of our sample to be %, which agrees with the variability fractions provided by Buenzli et al., Radigan et al., and Metchev et al. for L4–L8 dwarfs. These spectral indices may support the future selection of the most likely variable directly imaged exoplanets for studies with the James Webb Space Telescope and as well as the 30 m telescopes.

<title>Katachi (形): Decoding the Imprints of Past Star Formation on Present-day Morphology in Galaxies with Interpretable CNNs*</title>

总结:<br />
这篇文章介绍了一种名为Katachi的卷积神经网络框架，该框架学习了影响星系在不同空间和时间尺度上的星形成的因素之间的联系。通过对SDSS-IV MaNGA DR17样本中的9904个星系进行训练，Katachi能够预测星系的恒星质量、当前星形成率和半质量时间，并且能够从图像中重建每个星系的非参数化星形成史。使用SHAP来量化形态特征对星形成史预测的影响，发现了与恒星质量增长相关的星系球状体的预期趋势，以及与螺旋臂和其他星形成区域相关的星形成率趋势。此外，发现D4000的SHAP图可能比恒星质量和星形成率的更为复杂，而星系形态与半质量时间的相关性即使在质量和星形成率固定时也是存在的。Katachi可用于从大型成像调查中预测星系性质，包括Rubin、Roman和Euclid，并且可以处理高信噪比成像和有限光度波段的大数据集。 <div>
The physical processes responsible for shaping how galaxies form and quench over time leave imprints on both the spatial (galaxy morphology) and temporal (star formation history; SFH) tracers that we use to study galaxies. While the morphology–SFR connection is well studied, the correlation with past star formation activity is not as well understood. To quantify this, we present Katachi (形), an interpretable convolutional neural network framework that learns the connection between the factors regulating star formation in galaxies on different spatial and temporal scales. Katachi is trained on 9904 galaxies at 0.02 < z < 0.1 in the SDSS-IV MaNGA DR17 sample to predict stellar mass (M*; root mean square error (RSME) 0.22 dex), current star formation rate (SFR; RMSE 0.31 dex), and half-mass time (t50; RMSE 0.23 dex). This information allows us to reconstruct nonparametric SFHs for each galaxy from gri imaging alone. To quantify the morphological features informing the SFH predictions, we use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). We recover the expected trends of M* governed by the growth of galaxy bulges, as well as those of SFR correlating with spiral arms and other star-forming regions. We also find that the SHAP maps of D4000 are more complex than those of M* and SFR, and that morphology is correlated with t50 even at fixed mass and SFR. Katachi serves as a scalable public framework to predict galaxy properties from large imaging surveys including Rubin, Roman, and Euclid, with large data sets of high signal-to-noise ratio imaging across limited photometric bands.

TZlO由中子星和致密白矮星组成，可以解释GRB的特征。GRB 211211A可能是由引擎驱动的巨新星，而GRB 200826A的超新星颠簸可能是由喷射物与盘风壳的碰撞引起的。这项研究挑战了传统的collapsar模型，提出了新的理论解释，并与观测结果相一致。总结：<br /> 这项研究提出了Thorne–Żytkow–like objects (TZlO) 的模型来解释两种类型的伽马射线暴事件，给出了关于GRB 211211A和GRB 200826A的观测解释，并对传统的collapsar模型进行了挑战。 <div>
The Type II gamma-ray burst (GRB) 200826A challenges collapsar models by questioning how they can generate a genuinely short-duration event. The other Type I GRB 211211A confused us with a kilonova signature observed in the afterglow of a long burst. Here, we propose a comprehensive model in which both bursts are the results of the collapse of Thorne–Żytkow–like objects (TZlOs). The TZlO consists of a central neutron star (NS), with a dense white dwarf (WD) material envelope, which is formed as the aftermath of a WD-NS coalescence. We find that the characteristics of the resultant GRBs depend on whether the TZlO collapses immediately following the WD-NS merger or not. Additionally, the observational properties of the consequent GRBs manifest variations contingent upon whether the collapse of the TZlO results in a magnetar or a black hole. We also show that our model is consistent with the observations of GRB 211211A and GRB 200826A. Specifically, the optical excess in GRB 211211A can be attributed to an engine-fed kilonova, while the supernova bump in GRB 200826A is likely due to the collision between the ejecta and the disk wind shell.

总结:<br />
本研究提出并验证了一种自我调节伪标签半监督学习方法，有效提高了分类器性能，实现了从传统的全监督学习方法向更高效的射电脉冲星检测策略的过渡。实验结果表明，即使训练集仅包含100个已标记的脉冲星候选对象，该方法的召回率可达92.35%，F1得分为93.89%。当标记示例数量增加到800时，性能进一步提高，召回率达到97.50%，F1得分达到97.16%。半监督学习方法即使在标记数据量有限的情况下也能有效发现脉冲星候选对象。这突显了我们方法在促进早期脉冲星调查方面的潜力，并强调了其在标记数据短缺情况下产生实质性结果的能力。 <div>
In the field of astronomy, machine-learning technologies are becoming increasingly crucial for identifying radio pulsars. However, the process of acquiring labeled data, which is both time-consuming and potentially biased, poses a significant limitation to current methodologies. In response to these challenges, this study proposes and validates a self-tuning pseudolabeling semisupervised learning approach. This approach synthesizes a vast unlabeled data set with a considerably smaller set of labeled data, markedly enhancing classifier performance and effectuating a transition from traditional fully supervised learning methods to more efficient radio pulsar detection strategies. Our experimental outcomes demonstrate that even with a training set comprised of only 100 labeled pulsar candidates, this method can attain a recall rate of 92.35% and an F1 score of 93.89%. When the number of labeled examples is increased to 800, we observe a further improvement in performance, with the recall rate rising to 97.50% and the F1 score reaching 97.16%. The utility of the semisupervised learning approach is evident even with minimal labeled data, which is a common scenario in the search for pulsars, including in environments like globular clusters. What stands out is the method’s capacity to detect pulsar candidates effectively with only a limited number of labeled examples. This emphasizes the robust potential of our approach to facilitate early-stage pulsar surveys and highlights its capability to yield substantial results even when labeled data are in short supply.

<div> UHECRs, photons, CMB, SU(2)CMB, cosmogenic neutrinos
<br />总结:
作者重新审视了超高能宇宙射线（UHECRs）与宇宙微波背景（CMB）光子的相互作用，探讨了改变的温度-红移关系T(z)。该改变的温度-红移关系是根据将热化和各向同性的光子气体（如CMB）置于SU(2)而不是U(1)规范群的假设提出的。这种ΛCDM的修改被称为SU(2)CMB，其中一些宇宙学参数似乎与相同量的局部测量结果更加吻合，特别是H0和S8。在本研究中，我们将SU(2)CMB下的减少的CMB光子密度应用于UHECRs的传播。这导致在宇宙射线谱线ankle以下的地方有更高的UHECR通量，在其他条件相等的情况下，宇宙成因中微子也会略微增多。最突出的是，在硬注入谱线和不考虑磁场效应的情况下，脉冲通量在ankle以下（5×1018 eV）显著增加了。CMB光子密度的减少也有利于较佳适合ΛCDM的宇宙射线源演化的减少。因此，似乎SU(2)CMB更有利于像恒星形成率这样的源的演化，例如恒星爆发星系和伽马射线暴，而不是活跃星系核作为UHECRs的起源。我们得出结论，CMB的温度-红移关系的假设直接影响了UHECRs的主要来源的性质。 <div>
We reexamine the interactions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) with photons from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) under a changed, locally nonlinear temperature–redshift relation T(z). This changed temperature–redshift relation has recently been suggested by the postulate of subjecting thermalized and isotropic photon gases such as the CMB to an SU(2) rather than a U(1) gauge group. This modification of ΛCDM is called SU(2)CMB, and some cosmological parameters obtained by SU(2)CMB seem to be in better agreement with local measurements of the same quantities, in particular H0 and S8. In this work, we apply the reduced CMB photon density under SU(2)CMB to the propagation of UHECRs. This leads to a higher UHECR flux just below the ankle in the cosmic ray spectrum and slightly more cosmogenic neutrinos under otherwise equal conditions for emission and propagation. Most prominently, the proton flux is significantly increased below the ankle (5 × 1018 eV) for hard injection spectra and without considering the effects of magnetic fields. The reduction in CMB photon density also favors a decreased cosmic ray source evolution than the best fit using ΛCDM. In consequence, it seems that SU(2)CMB favors sources that evolve like the star formation rate, such as starburst galaxies and gamma-ray bursts, over active galactic nuclei as origins of UHECRs. We conclude that the question about the nature of primary sources of UHECRs is directly affected by the assumed temperature–redshift relation of the CMB.

<div> 重要关键词: 3C 279, QPO, γ-ray light curve, 二元黑洞, 双喷流

这项研究首次报道了TeV类星体3C 279的γ射线光变曲线中出现的两次重复的瞬变准周期振荡（QPO）。研究使用加权小波Z变换、Lomb–Scargle周期图和REDFIT技术在光变曲线中搜索周期性，并评估其置信水平。主要结果如下：（1）在2009年6月至11月的117天内的耀斑期间（MJD 55008–55125），发现了一个约33天的QPO（＞2.5σ），有趣的是，相同的QPO（约39天）在MJD 59430至59585的持续耀斑期间重新出现，置信水平＞4σ；（2）在2019年2月至2020年5月的455天内的一段时间（MJD 58430–58985），发现了另一个约91天的瞬变QPO，显著性＞3.8σ。考虑到文献中报道的QPO，约40天的QPO出现了三次，约91天的QPO出现了两次。我们讨论了一些可以解释这个类星体QPO的物理模型。研究可能表明，这两种QPO源自3C 279中心的双黑洞的双喷流。相似尺度的QPO的重复出现强烈支持一个在喷流内部螺旋运动的斑块的几何情景。此外，喷流中的外层也可能是解释光变曲线中观察到的重复γ射线耀斑模式的潜在解释。 <br /><br />总结: 首次报道了TeV类星体3C 279的γ射线光变曲线中出现的两次重复的瞬变准周期振荡（QPO）。这些QPO出现在不同时间段内，且重复出现，可能与双喷流的二元黑洞有关。对于这类光变现象的物理模型有了新的解释和理解。 <div>
In this work, we report for the first time two repeated transient quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) in the γ-ray light curve of the TeV blazar 3C 279. We search for the periodicity in the light curve and estimate its confidence level using the weighted wavelet Z-transform, the Lomb–Scargle periodogram, and the REDFIT techniques. The main results are as follows: (1) a QPO of ∼33 days (>2.5σ) is found during the flare of 117 days (MJD 55008–55125) from 2009 June to November. Interestingly, the same QPO (∼39 days) reappeared in the flaring duration from MJD 59430 to 59585, with the confidence level of >4σ. (2) Another transient QPO of ∼91 days with a significance of >3.8σ is found during a period with 455 days (MJD 58430–58985) from 2019 February to 2020 May. Under the premise of considering the QPOs reported in the literature, the QPO of ∼40 days is repeated three times and the QPO of ∼91 days is repeated twice. We discuss several physical models explaining the QPOs of this blazar. Our study may suggest that the two QPOs originate from the twin jets of the binary black holes at the center of 3C 279. The repeated occurrence of QPOs of a similar scale strongly supports the geometric scenario of a blob spiraling within the jet. Furthermore, the hypothesis of a sheath in the jet may also be a potential explanation for the repetitive γ-ray flare patterns observed in the light curve.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章讨论了紧凑天体物理过程中中微子的集体振荡现象及其在超新星环境中核合成产物的影响。研究发现，在高熵、富质子条件下，中微子相互作用会导致新的中子俘获过程的发生，被称为“νi-过程”，这将产生独特的质子富集低质量核素和中子富集高质量核素。此外，中微子之间的量子相关性也会影响产物的分布，与平均场振荡处理方式产生不同的结果。 <div>
In high-energy astrophysical processes involving compact objects, such as core-collapse supernovae or binary neutron star mergers, neutrinos play an important role in the synthesis of nuclides. Neutrinos in these environments can experience collective flavor oscillations driven by neutrino–neutrino interactions, including coherent forward scattering and incoherent (collisional) effects. Recently, there has been interest in exploring potential novel behaviors in collective oscillations of neutrinos by going beyond the one-particle effective or “mean-field” treatments. Here, we seek to explore implications of collective neutrino oscillations, in the mean-field treatment and beyond, for the nucleosynthesis yields in supernova environments with different astrophysical conditions and neutrino inputs. We find that collective oscillations can impact the operation of the νp-process and r-process nucleosynthesis in supernovae. The potential impact is particularly strong in high-entropy, proton-rich conditions, where we find that neutrino interactions can nudge an initial νp-process neutron-rich, resulting in a unique combination of proton-rich low-mass nuclei as well as neutron-rich high-mass nuclei. We describe this neutrino-induced neutron-capture process as the “νi-process.” In addition, nontrivial quantum correlations among neutrinos, if present significantly, could lead to different nuclide yields compared to the corresponding mean-field oscillation treatments, by virtue of modifying the evolution of the relevant one-body neutrino observables.

在这篇文章中，研究人员通过对大质量恒星形成过程中的模拟计算，发现了在喷流腔和落入的包层之间的冲击区域，存在高达10^7K的冲击加热和几乎完全电离的现象。与观测到的大质量原恒星G35.20-0.74N的数值一致。通过计算射电连续光度和光谱，将模型与观测样本进行比较发现，模型产生的射电亮度与低中质量原恒星的相似，但比较大质量原恒星的射电亮度要小10-100倍。最后，研究还观察到模型在内部1000天文单位范围内出现了约5%的10年射电流量变化，这与一些超紧致H ii区域的观测水平相当。<br /><br /> <div>
Massive protostars launch accretion-powered, magnetically collimated outflows, which play crucial roles in the dynamics and diagnostics of the star formation process. Here we calculate the shock heating and resulting free–free radio emission in numerical models of outflows of massive star formation within the framework of the Turbulent Core Accretion model. We postprocess 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulation snapshots of a protostellar disk wind interacting with an infalling core envelope, and calculate shock temperatures, ionization fractions, and radio free–free emission. We find heating up to ∼107 K and near-complete ionization in shocks at the interface between the outflow cavity and infalling envelope. However, line-of-sight averaged ionization fractions peak around ∼10%, in agreement with values reported from observations of massive protostar G35.20-0.74N. By calculating radio-continuum fluxes and spectra, we compare our models with observed samples of massive protostars. We find our fiducial models produce radio luminosities similar to those seen from low- and intermediate-mass protostars that are thought to be powered by shock ionization. Comparing to more massive protostars, we find our model radio luminosities are ∼10–100 times less luminous. We discuss how this apparent discrepancy either reflects aspects of our modeling related to the treatment of cooling of the post-shock gas or a dominant contribution in the observed systems from photoionization. Finally, our models exhibit 10 yr radio flux variability of ∼5%, especially in the inner 1000 au region, comparable to observed levels in some hypercompact H ii regions.

Byrd Green Bank望远镜进行了18厘米羟基（OH）线的极其敏感的探测。他们成功地测量到了微弱的发射信号，并且发现了与局部热力学平衡条件下预期的特征性比率。这是在其他星系中首次探测到非激射器状态下的18厘米OH发射。通过将他们的OH和H i观测结果与CO（1-0）观测结果进行比较，他们发现OH追踪到的H2气体比CO追踪到的数量多100%-140%。此外，尘埃数据暗示了更多的暗分子气体存在。因此，作者得出结论，18厘米OH线可能是在近邻星系中绘制“CO-暗”和“CO-微弱”分子气体相的有价值工具，尤其是在未来的多波束、相控阵饲养接收器上。这将大大提高对微弱信号的绘图速度。 <br /><br />总结:科学家在M31中成功探测到了18厘米OH线发射，并发现其追踪到的H2气体比CO更多。这表明18厘米OH线对于绘制星系中的“CO-暗”和“CO-微弱”分子气体相是有价值的工具。 <div>
The most abundant interstellar molecule, molecular hydrogen (H2), is practically invisible in cold molecular clouds. Astronomers typically use carbon monoxide (CO) to trace the bulk distribution and mass of H2 in our galaxy and many others. CO observations alone fail to trace a significant component of molecular gas known as “CO-dark” molecular gas, which can be probed with molecules such as OH and CH. We present an extremely sensitive pilot search for the 18 cm hydroxyl (OH) lines in the Andromeda galaxy (M31) with the 100 m Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope. We successfully detected the 1665 and 1667 MHz OH lines in faint emission. The 1665/1667 MHz line ratio displays the characteristic 5:9 ratio predicted under conditions of local thermodynamic equilibrium. To our knowledge, this is the first detection of nonmaser 18 cm OH emission in another galaxy. We compare our OH and H i observations with archival CO (1–0) observations. Our OH detection position overlaps with the previously discovered Arp Outer Arm in CO. Our best estimates show that the amount of H2 traced by OH is 100%–140% higher than the amount traced by CO in this sight line. The amount of dark molecular gas implied by dust data supports this conclusion. We conclude that the 18 cm OH lines hold promise as a valuable tool for mapping of the “CO-dark” and “CO-faint” molecular gas phase in nearby galaxies, especially with upcoming multibeam, phased-array feed receivers on radio telescopes, which will allow for drastically improved mapping speeds of faint signals.

<div> 关键词: Sigmoids, Filament chirality, Coronal magnetic connectivity, Eruptive events, Helicity

总结:<br /><br />这篇研究比较了日冕结构sigmoid的手征性和其中的丝状物的旋性，发现它们并非总是具有相同的螺旋性。另外，通过对具有sigmoid的区域下方的光球矢量磁图进行非线性自由力近似，得出了力自由参数的加权平均值，并将其与丝状物的旋性和观察到的日冕sigmoid的手性进行了相关性分析。研究表明，那些具有不同螺旋性标志的区域产生喷发事件的概率约为同螺旋性区域的3.5倍。此外，还对NOAA AR 12473的磁能量/螺旋性演变进行了案例研究。 <div>
Sigmoids produce strong eruptive events. Earlier studies have shown that the ICME axial magnetic field Bz can be predicted with some credibility by observing the corresponding filament or the polarity inversion line in the region of eruption and deriving the magnetic field direction from that. Sigmoids are coronal structures often associated with filaments in the sigmoidal region. In this study, we compare filament chirality with sigmoid handedness to observe their correlation. Second, we perform nonlinear force-free approximations of the coronal magnetic connectivity using photospheric vector magnetograms underneath sigmoids to obtain a weighted-average value of the force-free parameter and to correlate it with filament chirality and the observed coronal sigmoid handedness. Importantly, we find that the sigmoids and their filament counterparts do not always have the same helicity signs. Production of eruptive events by regions that do not have the same signs of helicities is ∼3.5 times higher than when they do. A case study of magnetic energy/ helicity evolution in NOAA AR 12473 is also presented.

We introduce a new Python 1D chemical kinetic code, Full and Reduced Exoplanet Chemical Kinetics distiLLed (FRECKLL), to evolve large chemical networks efficiently. FRECKLL employs “distillation” in computing the reaction rates, which minimizes the error bounds to the minimum allowed by double precision values (ϵ ≤ 10−15). Compared to summation of rates with traditional algorithms like pairwise summation, distillation provides a tenfold reduction in solver time for both full and reduced networks. Both the full and reduced Venot2020 networks are packaged in FRECKLL as well as a TauREx 3.1 plug-in for usage in forward modeling and retrievals of exoplanet atmospheres. We present TauREx retrievals performed on a simulated HD 189733b JWST spectra using the full and reduced Venot2020 chemical networks and demonstrate the viability of total disequilibrium chemistry retrievals and the ability for JWST to detect disequilibrium processes.

总结: 本研究利用ALMA、HST和JWST进行了对NGC 3351中心星暴环内的幼年大质量星团的研究。利用ALMA数据发现了18个明亮而紧凑的（亚）毫米连续源，其中8个在JWST图像中有对应物，只有6个在HST图像中有对应物。根据ALMA连续体和分子线数据，以及HST和JWST对应物的辅助测量，确定了14个具有高恒星和/或气体质量（~105M⊙）、小半径（≲ 5 pc）、大逃逸速度（6-10 km s−1）和短自由落体时间（0.5-1 Myr）的幼年星团。它们的多波段性质表明它们可分为四类，可能对应着从无星凝块到裸露的H ii区-星团复合体四个演化阶段。利用同一区域HST识别的星团的年龄估计，推断了一个演化时间线，从星团形成前约1-2百万年作为无星凝块，到形成后约4-6百万年呈裸露的H ii区-星团复合体。最后，我们发现幼年大质量星团构成了环的大部分新星形成，展现出非均匀的方位分布，没有非常连续的演化趋势，并且能够驱动大规模的气体流出。 <br /><br /> <div>
We use 0.1″ observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), Hubble Space Telescope (HST), and JWST to study young massive clusters (YMCs) in their embedded “infant” phase across the central starburst ring in NGC 3351. Our new ALMA data reveal 18 bright and compact (sub-)millimeter continuum sources, of which 8 have counterparts in JWST images and only 6 have counterparts in HST images. Based on the ALMA continuum and molecular line data, as well as ancillary measurements for the HST and JWST counterparts, we identify 14 sources as infant star clusters with high stellar and/or gas masses (∼105M⊙), small radii (≲ 5 pc), large escape velocities (6–10 km s−1), and short freefall times (0.5–1 Myr). Their multiwavelength properties motivate us to divide them into four categories, likely corresponding to four evolutionary stages from starless clumps to exposed H ii region–cluster complexes. Leveraging age estimates for HST-identified clusters in the same region, we infer an evolutionary timeline, ranging from ∼1–2 Myr before cluster formation as starless clumps, to ∼4–6 Myr after as exposed H ii region–cluster complexes. Finally, we show that the YMCs make up a substantial fraction of recent star formation across the ring, exhibit a nonuniform azimuthal distribution without a very coherent evolutionary trend along the ring, and are capable of driving large-scale gas outflows.

SGR J1550-5418是一颗类似SGR J1935+2154的活跃磁星。研究发现，SGR J1550-5418的最小变化时间尺度(MVT)遵循对数正态分布函数，平均值为6.4 ± 0.4毫秒。值得注意的是，MVT的平均值在2008年10月大约比2009年的平均值大3倍，这表明辐射区域可能存在变化，这可能归因于磁场拓扑的变化。此外，并未发现MVT与持续时间或能量之间存在显著相关性，也没有发现在不同能量范围内SGR J1550-5418和SGR J1935+2154的MVT分布存在显著差异，支持它们有着共同的物理起源。<br /><br />总结: 本研究对两颗活跃磁星SGR J1550-5418和SGR J1935+2154的X-ray burst进行了详细分析，发现它们的MVT遵循对数正态分布函数，且存在时间尺度的演化，但与持续时间和能量没有显著相关性，这一发现支持它们有着共同的物理起源。 <div>
The major observation of the X-ray burst (XRB) in association with the fast radio burst (FRB) FRB 200428 originating from SGR J1935+2154 on 2020 April 28 substantiates magnetars as one of the origins of FRBs. However, it is still unclear why only a few XRBs in association with FRBs have been observed solely in this magnetar. In this study, we investigate the minimum variation timescales (MVTs) of XRBs from SGR J1550-5418, an active magnetar similar to SGR J1935+2154, and conduct a comprehensive comparison of their MVT properties. Our analysis reveals that the distribution of the MVT for SGR J1550-5418 follows a lognormal Gaussian function with the mean 6.4 ± 0.4 ms. Interestingly, we detect an evolution in the MVTs, i.e., the fitted mean of the MVT distribution in 2008 October is about 3 times larger than that in 2009, indicating potential variations in radiation regions possibly attributed to changes in magnetic field topology. Besides, we do not find a significant correlation between the MVT and either duration or energy. Finally, there is no significant difference between the MVT distributions across different energy ranges for SGR J1550-5418 and SGR J1935+2154, which supports a common physical origin.

<div> 关键词: 高Lundquist数等离子体，揭示性重连接，磁流体力学，电离等离子体，撕裂性重连接

总结:<br /><br />本文研究了在电离较差的等离子体系统中撕裂介导的重连接的起始和线性演变过程。在较差电离的等离子体中，磁场的零点会通过环境扩散逐渐变得更加尖锐，从而抑制了重连接的开始。一旦电液层变得足够薄，离子将脱离中性粒子，电液层的变薄速度减慢，重连接即可开始。研究还发现，可以通过电离较差的撕裂色散关系来预测首次扰乱形成电流层的波长和增长率。随着等离子体复合速率的增加和离子化分数的减少，增长率将成为离子-中性碰撞频率的增倍数，而波长将成为Alfvén速度和离子-中性碰撞频率之比的减少倍数。 <div>
In high-Lundquist-number plasmas, reconnection proceeds via the onset of tearing, followed by a nonlinear phase during which plasmoids continuously form, merge, and are ejected from the current sheet (CS). This process is understood in fully ionized, magnetohydrodynamic plasmas. However, many plasma environments, such as star-forming molecular clouds and the solar chromosphere, are poorly ionized. We use theory and computation to study tearing-mediated reconnection in such poorly ionized systems. In this paper, we focus on the onset and linear evolution of this process. In poorly ionized plasmas, magnetic nulls on scales below vA,n0/νni0, with vA,n0 the neutral Alfvén speed and νni0 the neutral–ion collision frequency, will self-sharpen via ambipolar diffusion. This sharpening occurs at an increasing rate, inhibiting the onset of reconnection. Once the CS becomes thin enough, however, ions decouple from neutrals and the thinning of the CS slows, allowing the onset of tearing in a time of order . We find that the wavelength and growth rate of the mode that first disrupts the forming sheet can be predicted from a poorly ionized tearing dispersion relation; as the plasma recombination rate increases and ionization fraction decreases, the growth rate becomes an increasing multiple of νni0 and the wavelength becomes a decreasing fraction of vA,n0/νni0.

总结:  
本研究通过观测超过5500个涡旋星系的Hα发射线速度，比较了其在90%椭圆Petrosian半径R90处的旋转速度与其可见质量所预期速度的比值。我们计算了来自恒星、氢气、H2、重金属和尘埃质量的总可见质量，并将H2质量建立成r带绝对星等的函数。基于统计分析，我们得出结论，在涡旋星系的可见范围内，不能以95%的置信水平排除无暗物质的零假设。此外，我们发现，在考虑所有质量组分时，星系的可见质量与总质量之比随其亮度增加而增加。 <br /> <div>
We present a study of the ratio of visible mass to total mass in spiral galaxies to better understand the relative amount of dark matter present in galaxies of different masses and evolutionary stages. Using the velocities of the Hα emission line measured in spectroscopic observations from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) MaNGA Data Release 17 (DR 17), we evaluate the rotational velocity of over 5500 disk galaxies at their 90% elliptical Petrosian radii, R90. We compare this to the velocity expected from the total visible mass, which we compute from the stellar, H i, H2, and heavy metals and dust masses. H2 mass measurements are available for only a small subset of galaxies observed in SDSS MaNGA DR17, so we derive a parameterization of the H2 mass as a function of absolute magnitude in the r band using galaxies observed as part of SDSS DR7. With these parameterizations, we calculate the fraction of visible mass within R90 that corresponds to the observed velocity. Based on statistically analyzing the likelihood of this fraction, we conclude that the null hypothesis (no dark matter) cannot be excluded at a confidence level better than 95% within the visible extent of the disk galaxies. We also find that when all mass components are included, the ratio of visible to total mass within the visible extent of star-forming disk galaxies increases with galaxy luminosity.

总结: 该研究使用3000个ProDiMo盘模型讨论了原行星盘的质量、氢化二铟(HD)线流和尘埃谱能量分布(SED)之间的统计关系。他们发现质量加权的HD分数丰度几乎是恒定的，尽管紫外线通量变化了几个数量级。通过对物理量和HD流量之间的统计关系的探讨，他们发现低质量(光学薄)盘显示了平均盘气温与HD线流之间的紧密关联，而大质量盘则没有这种关联。研究还证明，中央恒星的光度、盘尺寸、尘埃尺寸分布和HD流量可以用来确定盘气体质量，精度在3倍以内。他们还发现，远红外和亚毫米/毫米波SED以及HD流量可以作为确定盘气体质量的强约束，精度在2倍以内。如果HD线完全光谱分辨(R≳1.5×10^6, Δv=0.2 km s^-1)，那么单独的56和112微米HD线剖面可以将盘气体质量确定在2倍以内。 <div>
We discuss statistical relationships between the mass of protoplanetary disks, the hydrogen deuteride (HD) line flux, and the dust spectral energy distribution (SED) determined using 3000 ProDiMo disk models. The models have 15 free parameters describing the disk physical properties, the central star, and the local radiation field. The sampling of physical parameters is done using a Monte Carlo approach to evaluate the probability density functions of observables as a function of physical parameters. We find that the mass-averaged HD fractional abundance is almost constant even though the ultraviolet flux varies by several orders of magnitude. Probing the statistical relation between the physical quantities and the HD flux, we find that low-mass (optically thin) disks display a tight correlation between the average disk gas temperature and HD line flux, while massive disks show no such correlation. We demonstrate that the central star luminosity, disk size, dust size distribution, and HD flux may be used to determine the disk gas mass within a factor of 3. We also find that the far-infrared and submillimeter/millimeter SEDs and the HD flux may serve as strong constraints for determining the disk gas mass to within a factor of 2. If the HD lines are fully spectrally resolved (R ≳ 1.5 × 106, Δv = 0.2 km s−1), the 56 and 112 μm HD line profiles alone may constrain the disk gas mass to within a factor of 2.

Solar magnetic flux rope (MFR) plays a central role in the physics of coronal mass ejections (CMEs). It mainly includes a cold filament at typical chromospheric temperatures (∼10,000 K) and a hot channel at high coronal temperatures (∼10 MK). The warm MFR at quiescent coronal temperatures of a million Kelvin is, however, rarely reported. In this study, using multiwavelength images from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamic Observatory and Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUVI) on board the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory-A, we present an eruption of a warm channel that represents an MFR with quiescent coronal temperatures (∼0.6–2.5 MK). On 2022 May 8, we observed the failed eruption of a hot channel, with the average temperature and emission measure (EM) of 10 MK and 1.1 × 1028 cm−5, using AIA high-temperature images in the active region (AR) 13007. This failed eruption was associated with a C8.2 flare, with no CME. Subsequently, we observed a warm channel that appeared in AIA and EUVI low-temperature images rather than in AIA high-temperature images. It then erupted and transformed into a semicircular shape. An associated C2.1 flare, along with the signatures of magnetic reconnection in AIA high-temperature images, were identified. Additionally, we observed a CME associated with this event. Compared with the hot channel, the warm channel is cooler and rarer with the average temperature and EM of 1.7 (1.6) MK and 2.0 × 1026 (2.3 × 1026) cm−5. All the results suggest an unambiguous observation of the million-Kelvin warm MFR that erupted as a CME and fill a gap in the temperature domain of coronal MFRs.

We report simultaneous detection of twin kHz and ∼40 Hz quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) in the time-resolved analysis of the AstroSat/LAXPC observation of the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary, 4U 1728-34. The frequencies of the multiple sets of triplets are correlated with each other and are consistent with their identification as the orbital, periastron precession, and twice the nodal precession frequencies. The observed relations, along with the known spin of the neutron star, put constraints on the mass and the ratio of the moment of inertia to the mass of the neutron star to be and under the simplistic assumption that the metric is a Kerr one. We crudely estimate that the mass and moment of inertia values obtained may differ by about 1% and 5%, respectively, if a self-consistent metric is invoked. Using the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff equations for computing the moment of inertia of a neutron star in slow rotation approximation, having different equations of state, we find that the predicted values of neutron star parameters favor stiffer equations of state. We expect more stringent constraints would be obtained using a more detailed treatment, where the equation of state–dependent metric is used to compute the expected frequencies rather than the Kerr metric used here. The results provide insight into both the nature of these QPOs and the neutron star interior.

<div> Pulsar wind nebula, HESS J1849-000, PeV γ-ray photons, nonthermal radiative properties, particle transport

总结:<br /><br />本研究使用时间相关模型研究了HESS J1849-000的非热辐射特性。通过对观测到的多波段数据进行分析，发现相对论性的轻子通过同步辐射和反向 Compton 效应很好地解释了观测数据，同时分析了粒子的输运和冷却过程。研究结果表明，粒子的绝热损失在低能带中占主导地位，而扩散占优势。在高能带中，粒子的同步辐射损失占主导地位，扩散也占优势。此外，粒子输运在低能带中起着重要作用，而粒子的冷却过程在高能带中更为重要。在电子能量为1 TeV时，得到了当前的扩散系数为3.4 × 10^26 cm² s^-1，这暗示了在星云内可能存在着较慢的扩散机制。最重要的是，我们的模型表明粒子的最大能量为3.6 PeV，使得HESS J1849-000成为 PeV 天体的候选。 <div>
Pulsar wind nebula HESS J1849-000 is one of the sources that may emit PeV γ-ray photons based on the recent measurement by the Tibet Air Shower Array and the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory. We use a time-dependent model to investigate the nonthermal radiative properties of HESS J1849-000. Observed multiband data are produced well by relativistic leptons through synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton processes, and the particle transport and cooling processes are analyzed. Our results show that the particle adiabatic loss dominates over the synchrotron loss and inverse Compton losses, and the particle advection dominates over diffusion for the low-energy band. On the other hand, the particle synchrotron loss dominates over the adiabatic loss and inverse Compton losses, and the diffusion dominates over advection for the high-energy band. Furthermore, particle transport would be playing a significant role in the low-energy band, whereas the particle cooling processes may play a more important role in the high-energy band. The current diffusion coefficient 3.4 × 1026 cm2 s−1 at an electron energy of 1 TeV is derived, which implies a slow diffusion mechanism may occur within the nebula. More importantly, our model suggests that the particle's maximum energy is 3.6 PeV, which makes HESS J1849-000 a PeVatron candidate.

TAP 26 是一个约 17 百万年的磁活动 T Tauri 星，据报道在距离约为 0.097 天文单位的轨道上环绕着一颗大质量行星。该文章报道了对 TAP 26 进行的 Chandra X 射线观测，观测结果显示星体 X 射线辐射的特性和变化情况，并对照射到行星大气的 X 射线离子化率和加热速率进行了估计。观测发现，星体 X 射线辐射具有较大的变化性，且存在较高的温度。这些观测结果对于未来建立更加真实的行星大气模型具有重要意义。<br /><br />总结: <br />磁活动 T Tauri 星; Chandra X 射线; 行星大气; X 射线辐射; 离子化率。 <div>
We present new Chandra X-ray observations of TAP 26, a ≈17 Myr old magnetically active weak-lined T Tauri star that has been reported to host a massive planet in a ≈10.8 day orbit. At a separation of a = 0.097 au the planet will be exposed to intense X-ray and UV radiation from the star. The first observation caught the star in a state of elevated X-ray emission with variability on a timescale of a few hours and an X-ray temperature kTx ≈ 2–4 keV. Two subsequent observations 5–10 days later showed slow variability and a lower X-ray flux and temperature (kTx ≈ 1 keV). We characterize the X-ray emission and estimate the X-ray ionization and heating rates that will need to be incorporated into realistic models of the planet’s atmosphere.

<div> 高分辨率模拟, 磁流体力学, 宇宙学, 星系团, 磁场结构

这篇文章报告了一项关于质量为2.0×1015太阳质量的大型星系团的高分辨率磁流体力学宇宙学模拟的初步结果。采用4×10^5太阳质量的质量分辨率，并在星系团中心区域实现了约250pc的最大空间分辨率。研究表明，在红移4之前，星系团中心区域内存在一个小尺度湍流动力学过程放大磁场的详细过程，直到红移2之后，磁场增长呈现弱化的趋势。磁场能量在系统接近红移零时略有下降，符合绝热膨胀的预测。磁场结构在中心区域呈高度湍流状态，并在几十千秒差距的尺度上显示出磁场反转和径向、角向分量的反相关性，这是由小尺度湍流动力学作用所引起的。在兆秒差距尺度上，大尺度磁场几乎是各向同性的，这表明大规模星系团形成过程抑制了初始磁场配置和湍流动力学放大形态的记忆。此外，研究还证明了能够同时揭示星际介质中小尺度磁场结构的极高分辨率模拟的可行性，这对于模拟宇宙射线的注入和输运过程具有重要意义。这项工作对于具有实时宇宙射线处理的后续研究，以及详细建模电子同步辐射和伽马射线发射过程都具有重要意义。

We present the first results of one extremely high-resolution, nonradiative magnetohydrodynamical cosmological zoom-in simulation of a massive cluster with a virial mass of Mvir = 2.0 × 1015 solar masses. We adopt a mass resolution of 4 × 105M⊙ with a maximum spatial resolution of around 250 pc in the central regions of the cluster. We follow the detailed amplification process in a resolved small-scale turbulent dynamo in the intracluster medium (ICM) with strong exponential growth until redshift 4, after which the field grows weakly in the adiabatic compression limit until redshift 2. The energy in the field is slightly reduced as the system approaches redshift zero in agreement with adiabatic decompression. The field structure is highly turbulent in the center and shows field reversals on a length scale of a few tens of kiloparsecs and an anticorrelation between the radial and angular field components in the central region that is ordered by small-scale turbulent dynamo action. The large-scale field on megaparsec scales is almost isotropic, indicating that the structure formation process in massive galaxy cluster formation suppresses any memory of both the initial field configuration and the amplified morphology via the turbulent dynamo. We demonstrate that extremely high-resolution simulations of the magnetized ICM are within reach that can simultaneously resolve the small-scale magnetic field structure, which is of major importance for the injection of and transport of cosmic rays in the ICM. This work is a major cornerstone for follow-up studies with an on-the-fly treatment of cosmic rays to model in detail electron-synchrotron and gamma-ray emissions.

<div> 小固体，行星形成，气态盘，固体吸积效率，质量通量<br />
这篇文章研究了小固体颗粒在嵌入气态盘的行星表面的吸积效率。研究发现，1cm ≤ Rs ≤ 100cm颗粒的最大吸积效率通常≲10％，而10m颗粒往往能够高效吸积或者排列在行星轨道之外。此外，研究还发现小行星核心的吸积效率近似于行星质量的一个指数函数。通过代表性的盘模型，估计得到的固体吸积速率在1-1.5百万年后下降至小于10^(-6) M⊕ yr^(-1)。最后，文章还应用得到的吸积速率进行了行星形成计算，结果显示，形成的行星种类各异，从主要由重元素组成的几倍地球质量的行星到巨行星都有。在固体吸积的时期，行星的峰值光度范围大约为10^(-7)到10^(-6)个太阳光度。<br /><br />总结:本文研究了小固体颗粒在气态盘中对行星形成的影响，发现不同尺寸的固体颗粒在行星吸积过程中的效率不同，还发现小行星核心的吸积效率与行星质量成正比，最后应用得到的吸积速率进行了行星形成计算，结果显示行星形成过程中可能出现多种结果。 <div>
We compute the accretion efficiency of small solids, with radii 1 cm ≤ Rs ≤ 10 m, on planets embedded in gaseous disks. Planets have masses 3 ≤ Mp ≤ 20 Earth masses (M⊕) and orbit within 10 au of a solar mass star. Disk thermodynamics is modeled via 3D radiation-hydrodynamics calculations that typically resolve the planetary envelopes. Both icy and rocky solids are considered, explicitly modeling their thermodynamic evolution. The maximum efficiencies of 1 ≤ Rs ≤ 100 cm particles are generally ≲10%, whereas 10 m solids tend to accrete efficiently or be segregated beyond the planet’s orbit. A simplified approach is applied to compute the accretion efficiency of small cores, with masses Mp ≤ 1 M⊕ and without envelopes, for which efficiencies are approximately proportional to . The mass flux of solids, estimated from unperturbed drag-induced drift velocities, provides typical accretion rates dMp/dt ≲ 10−5M⊕ yr−1. In representative disk models with an initial gas-to-dust mass ratio of 70–100 and total mass of 0.05–0.06 M⊙, the solids’ accretion falls below 10−6M⊕ yr−1 after 1–1.5 Myr. The derived accretion rates, as functions of time and planet mass, are applied to formation calculations that compute dust opacity self-consistently with the delivery of solids to the envelope. Assuming dust-to-solid coagulation times of ≈0.3 Myr and disk lifetimes of ≈3.5 Myr, heavy-element inventories in the range 3–7 M⊕ require that ≈90–150 M⊕ of solids cross the planet’s orbit. The formation calculations encompass a variety of outcomes, from planets a few times M⊕, predominantly composed of heavy elements, to giant planets. The peak luminosities during the epoch of the solids’ accretion range from ≈10−7 to ≈10−6L⊙.

<div> 光学和红外数据，MaDCoWS2，Galaxy cluster candidates, Detection algorithm, Redshift probability distribution functions<br />
总结:<br />
MaDCoWS2是原MaDCoWS调查的后继者，使用更深入的光学和红外数据以及更强大的检测算法(PZWav)。利用DECaLS和CatWISE2020目录的光度数据，得出宽场红外巡天探测器(WISE)选择的星系的光度红移的全概率分布函数。利用PZWav算法检测三维星系密度过度，得到了22,970个星系团候选者的目录，跨越0.1 < z < 2的红移范围。与其他调查相比，MaDCoWS2重新发现了60%–92%的星团，且偏差较小。研究了信噪比和富度之间的关系表现出较小的散布。 <div>
The Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey 2 (MaDCoWS2) is a new survey designed as the successor of the original MaDCoWS survey. MaDCoWS2 improves upon its predecessor by using deeper optical and infrared data and a more powerful detection algorithm (PZWav). As input to the search, we use grz photometry from the DECam Legacy Survey (DECaLS) in combination with W1 and W2 photometry from the CatWISE2020 catalog to derive the photometric redshifts with full redshift probability distribution functions for Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE)-selected galaxies. Cluster candidates are then detected using the PZWav algorithm to find three-dimensional galaxy overdensities from the sky positions and photometric redshifts. This paper provides the first MaDCoWS2 data release, covering 1461 (1838 without masking) deg2 centered on the Hyper-SuprimeCam Subaru Strategic Program equatorial fields. Within this region, we derive a catalog of 22,970 galaxy cluster candidates detected at a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) > 5. These clusters span the redshift range 0.1 < z < 2, including 1312 candidates at z > 1.5. We compare MaDCoWS2 to six existing catalogs in the area. We rediscover 60%–92% of the clusters in these surveys at S/N > 5. The medians of the absolute redshift offset are <0.02 relative to these surveys, while the standard deviations are less than 0.06. The median offsets between the detection position from MaDCoWS2 and other surveys are less than 0.25 Mpc. We quantify the relation between S/N and gas mass, total mass, luminosity, and richness from other surveys using a redshift-dependent power law relation. We find that the S/N-richness relation exhibits the lowest scatter.

总结:<br />
本文报道了利用Hobby-Eberly望远镜的低分辨率光谱仪对行星状星云Patchick 27（Pa 27）的中心星进行的光学光谱观测。光谱显示Pa 27为K0 III红巨星，但同时在近紫外波段也检测到了一个热的双星成分。研究还发现Pa 27表现出低幅度的7.36天正弦变化，可能是由于旋转和磁活跃的冷巨星表面出现恒星黑子导致的。Pa 27属于“A35型中心星”这一稀有类别，由一个有斑点的晚型恒星和一个热的白矮星前体组成。最后，研究提出了一些有用的后续观测建议。 <div>
We present optical spectroscopy of the 12th-magnitude central star of the planetary nebula (PN) Patchick 27 (Pa 27), obtained during a survey of faint PN nuclei (PNNs) with the Low-Resolution Spectrograph of the Hobby–Eberly Telescope. The optical spectrum of Pa 27 is that of a K0 III red giant with rotationally broadened lines. However, the star is detected in the near-ultraviolet (near-UV) with GALEX, showing that a hot binary component is also present. The spectral-energy distribution from the near-UV to the mid-infrared can be fitted with a combination of the K0 III giant and a hot PNN with an effective temperature of about 50,000 K. Photometric observations of Pa 27, both ground-based and from TESS, show a low-amplitude sinusoidal variation with a period of 7.36 days, probably due to starspots on a rotating and magnetically active cool giant. Pa 27 is a new member of the rare class of “A35-type central stars,” which are binary PNNs consisting of a spotted late-type star and a hot pre–white dwarf. They are likely the result of a situation where an asymptotic-giant-branch (AGB) star ejects its outer layers in a dense wind, part of which is captured by a distant companion, spinning up its rotation by accretion of material and angular momentum. We suggest several useful follow-up observations.

Summary: 
水星的轨道可能变得不稳定，导致与金星或太阳的碰撞。先前的工作将g1的变化近似为随机扩散，建立出一个可以在长达10亿年以上的时间尺度上复现水星不稳定统计的现象学模型。然而，新的研究表明，随机扩散模型在5亿年以下的时间尺度上显著低估了水星不稳定的概率。为了更好地模拟短时间尺度上的变化，研究人员建立了一个新的亚扩散现象学模型。他们选择了模型参数，使其能够在1到40亿年的时间尺度内复现水星的不稳定统计。这项工作引发了太阳系动力学领域的一些基本问题：为什么亚扩散更好地近似了g1的变化？为什么g1有一个上限，而没有阻止它达到g5的下限？<br /><br />总结: <br />水星可能与金星或太阳碰撞；现有的扩散模型无法准确预测水星不稳定性；新的亚扩散模型能够更好地模拟短时间尺度上的变化；这项工作引发了太阳系动力学领域的一些基本问题。 <div>
Mercury’s orbit can destabilize, generally resulting in a collision with either Venus or the Sun. Chaotic evolution can cause g1 to decrease to the approximately constant value of g5 and create a resonance. Previous work has approximated the variation in g1 as stochastic diffusion, which leads to a phenomological model that can reproduce the Mercury instability statistics of secular and N-body models on timescales longer than 10 Gyr. Here we show that the diffusive model significantly underpredicts the Mercury instability probability on timescales less than 5 Gyr, the remaining lifespan of the solar system. This is because g1 exhibits larger variations on short timescales than the diffusive model would suggest. To better model the variations on short timescales, we build a new subdiffusive phenomological model for g1. Subdiffusion is similar to diffusion but exhibits larger displacements on short timescales and smaller displacements on long timescales. We choose model parameters based on the behavior of the g1 trajectories in the N-body simulations, leading to a tuned model that can reproduce Mercury instability statistics from 1–40 Gyr. This work motivates fundamental questions in solar system dynamics: why does subdiffusion better approximate the variation in g1 than standard diffusion? Why is there an upper bound on g1, but not a lower bound that would prevent it from reaching g5?

<div> 红巨星，光谱观测，太空望远镜，Hubble Space Telescope，质量流失率
<br />总结:
研究使用哈勃空间望远镜上的STIS仪器对红巨星进行了光谱观测，发现早期K到中期M巨星主要表现为温暖的色球风。利用H i Lyα线的观察结果估算了红巨星的质量流失率，其中M巨星的流失率为M⊙ yr−1，而检测到流失吸收的K巨星具有较弱的流失率。此外，在观测两颗红巨星的光谱数据时发现了空间延展的Lyα发射，估算了可检测发射的极限范围。同时，也发现了Fe ii、Mg ii、Mg i、O i和C ii等线的空间特征。整体而言，M巨星的空间特征更为明显，与Lyα分析结果一致。 <div>
We describe recent spectroscopic observations of red giant stars made by the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) instrument on board the Hubble Space Telescope, which has provided spatially resolved observations of the warm chromospheric winds that predominate for early K to mid-M giants. The H i Lyα lines of a set of 11 red giants observed with the STIS/E140M echelle grating are first analyzed to ascertain wind H i column densities and total wind mass-loss rates. The M giants have estimated mass-loss rates of M⊙ yr−1, while the K giants with detected wind absorption have weaker winds with M⊙ yr−1. We use long-slit spectra of H i Lyα for two particular red giants, α Tau (K5 III) and γ Cru (M3.5 III), to study the spatial extent of the Lyα emission. From these data we estimate limits for the extent of detectable emission, which are r = 193 R* for γ Cru and r = 44 R* for α Tau. The cross-dispersion emission profiles in the STIS echelle spectra of the larger sample of red giants also show evidence for spatial resolution, not only for H i Lyα but for other lines with visible wind absorption, such as Fe ii, Mg ii, Mg i, O i, and C ii. We characterize the nature of these spatial signatures. The spatial extent is far more apparent for the M giants than for the K giants, consistent with the stronger winds found for the M giants from the Lyα analysis.

总结: 本研究评估了类地外行星上由硅制成的太阳能电池作为潜在技术标志的可能性。通过对近红外和可见光范围内的高反射特性进行评估，发现使用类似Habitable Worlds Observatory telescop的8米望远镜需要数百个小时的观测时间才能在10光年外的类太阳恒星附近的地球样行星上达到一定的信噪比。此外，论文还讨论了Kardeshev Type I/II文明和戴森球等概念在能源利用方面的作用，最后指出，即使是未来的人类文明也不太可能发展成为银河系范围的文明，因为能源需求存在一定的限制。 <br /> <div>
In this work, we assess the potential detectability of solar panels made of silicon on an Earth-like exoplanet as a potential technosignature. Silicon-based photovoltaic cells have high reflectance in the ultraviolet-to-visible (UV-VIS) and in the near-infrared, within the wavelength range of a space-based flagship mission concept like the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). Assuming that only solar energy is used to provide the 2022 human energy needs with a land cover of ∼2.4%, and projecting the future energy demand assuming various growth-rate scenarios, we assess the detectability with an 8 m HWO-like telescope. Assuming the most favorable viewing orientation, and focusing on the strong absorption edge in the UV-VIS (0.34–0.52 μm), we find that several hundreds of hours of observation time are needed to reach a signal-to-noise ratio of 5 for an Earth-like planet around a Sun-like star at 10 pc, even with a solar panel coverage of ∼23% land coverage of a future Earth. We discuss the necessity of concepts like Kardeshev Type I/II civilizations and Dyson spheres, which would aim to harness vast amounts of energy. Even with much larger populations than today, the total energy use of human civilization would be orders of magnitude below the threshold for causing direct thermal heating or reaching the scale of a Kardashev Type I civilization. Any extraterrestrial civilization that likewise achieves sustainable population levels may also find a limit on its need to expand, which suggests that a galaxy-spanning civilization as imagined in the Fermi paradox may not exist.

<div> ICMEs, solar wind, Vip, heavy ions, coronal abundance
总结:
本研究通过对ICMEs和太阳风中He2+、C5+、O6+和Fe10+的离子-质子差速进行统计研究，发现太阳风中Vip随着距离太阳的减小而增加，而在ICMEs中保持不变。因此，通过1天文单位附近的原位丰度推断日冕源的绝对丰度可能存在问题。然而，高兴的是，氧离子（O6+）的差速（Vio）在ICMEs和太阳风中都可以忽略不计，这意味着各种重离子总是以相同的速度流动，它们在1天文单位附近的相对丰度可以代表ICMEs和太阳风的日冕丰度。 <div>
The elemental abundance of interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) and solar wind near 1 au is often adopted to represent the abundance in the corresponding coronal sources. However, the absolute abundance of heavy ions (relative to hydrogen) near 1 au might be different from the coronal abundance due to the ion–proton differential speed (Vip). To illustrate the Vip characteristics and explore whether it influences the absolute abundance analysis for ICMEs and solar wind, we perform a statistical study on the Vip for He2+, C5+, O6+, and Fe10+ in both ICMEs and solar wind based on measurements of Advanced Composition Explorer. The results show that the Vip is negligible within ICMEs and slow solar wind (< 400 km s−1), while obvious in the intermediate (400–600 km s−1) and fast wind (> 600 km s−1). Previous studies showed that the Vip in ICMEs keeps negligible during propagation from 0.3 to 5 au, but in solar wind it increases with the decreasing heliocentric distance. Therefore, it might be questionable to infer the absolute abundance of coronal sources through in situ abundance near 1 au for solar wind. Fortunately, the ion–oxygen (O6+) differential speed (Vio) is negligible for He2+, C5+, and Fe10+ within both ICMEs and solar wind, and previous studies suggested that the Vio does not vary significantly with the heliocentric distance. This indicates that various heavy ions always flow at the same bulk speed and their relative abundance (relative to oxygen) near 1 au can represent the coronal abundance for both ICMEs and solar wind.

<div> 关键词: NYMGs, β-Pictoris moving group, Age estimation, Kinematic traceback analysis, Systematic reevaluation
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章讨论了附近年轻移动星团（NYMGs）年龄估计的重要性，特别是β-Pictoris 移动星团（BPMG）的年龄。研究使用了三种方法确定了BPMG的运动学年龄，得出的估计年龄在14-20 Myr之间。通过对径向速度进行校正后，得出的年龄比之前的估计年龄年轻了2-4 Myr。这一年龄远小于之前通过锂耗尽边界分析确定的年龄（24 Myr），这可能指出了流明演化和锂耗损模型之间的差异或者方法中存在未考虑的系统误差。因此，迫切需要对附近年轻移动星团的年龄估计方法进行系统重新评估。 <div>
Accurate age estimation of nearby young moving groups (NYMGs) is important as they serve as crucial testbeds in various fields of astrophysics, including the formation and evolution of stars and planets, as well as loose stellar associations. The β-Pictoris moving group (BPMG), being one of the closest and youngest NYMGs, has been extensively investigated, and its estimated ages have a wide range from ∼10–25 Myr, depending on the age estimation methods and data used. Unlike other age dating methods, kinematic traceback analysis offers a model-independent age assessment hence the merit in comparing many seemingly discordant age estimates. In this study, we determine the kinematic ages of the BPMG using three methods: probabilistic volume calculation, mean pairwise distance calculation, and covariance matrix analysis. These methods yield consistent results, with estimated ages in the range of 14–20 Myr. Implementing corrections to radial velocities due to gravitational redshift and convectional blueshift increases the ages by ∼2–4 Myr. Conversely, considering data uncertainties decreases the estimated ages by 1–2 Myr. Taken together, our analysis determined the kinematic age of the BPMG to be Myr. This age is significantly younger than the commonly accepted age of the BPMG (∼24 Myr) determined primarily from the lithium depletion boundary analysis. This younger kinematic age may point to the discrepancy between the luminosity evolution and lithium depletion models or the presence of unaccounted systematic error in the method. This result underscores the necessity for systematic reevaluations of age-dating methods for nearby, young moving groups.

The distribution of magnetic energy across scales, represented by the turbulence spectrum, provides insights into magnetic field dynamics in astrophysical and space plasma. While the Earth’s magnetosheath exhibits a conventional two-slope spectrum, the Martian magnetosheath often displays a prominent plateau-like spectrum. However, the underlying physical mechanism remains unresolved. Based on MAVEN observations, we present appealing evidence of pickup ions (PUIs) modulating the plateau-like spectrum through proton cyclotron waves (PCWs). PCWs, driven by unstable pickup H+ ion distributions, significantly influence the formation of plateau-like spectra. Both case and statistical studies suggest that the spectral evolution is affected by the relative abundance of pickup O+ ions. A substantial presence of pickup O+ ions can suppress PCWs driven by pickup H+ ions, resulting in a decline in the slope of the plateau spectrum. Particle-in-cell simulations confirm the role of PUI-modulated PCWs in the plateau-range energy injection. Our results provide new insight into the impact of PUIs on magnetic turbulence evolution and associated energy transfer processes in space and astrophysical plasma.

<div> Haro 11, Lyman continuum emitter, escape processes, Hubble Space Telescope, ultraluminous X-ray sources
<br /><br />
总结: 作为距离最近的已确认的Lyman连续辐射(LyC)发射体，Haro 11是研究宇宙再电离关键过程的重要实验室。通过观察其三个星形成结，发现LyC源于B和C结，其903-912 Å的亮度分别为1.9 ± 1.5 × 1040 erg s−1和0.9 ± 0.7 × 1040 erg s−1。我们推导出Knots B和C的局部逃逸分数fesc,912分别为3.4% ± 2.9%和5.1% ± 4.3% 。Starburst99建模显示每个结中的主要群体在1-4 Myr和1-2 × 10^7M⊙，Knot B中拥有最年轻的群体。因此，拥有最强LyC检测的结具有最高的LyC产生率。然而，由于更高的中性气体覆盖，Knot B中的LyC逃逸可能不如Knot C。我们的研究强调了内在的电离亮度的重要性，而不仅仅是逃逸分数，对于LyC的检测也是如此。类似地，Lyα逃逸分数并未始终与LyC流量相关，狭窄的Lyα红峰也不符合这一规律。然而，观察到较高的Lyα亮度和较低的Lyα红峰速度分离与更高的LyC逃逸相关。未检测到的Knot A显示出绿豆星系的特性，密度边界条件暗示高度各向异性的LyC逃逸。最后，LyC泄漏的B和C结都有超亮X射线源(ULXs)。尽管星星在LyC发射中占据主导地位，但这个有趣的巧合强调了揭示吸积体在LyC逃逸和再电离中的作用的重要性。 <div>
As the nearest confirmed Lyman continuum (LyC) emitter, Haro 11 is an exceptional laboratory for studying LyC escape processes crucial to cosmic reionization. Our new Hubble Space Telescope/Cosmic Origins Spectrograph G130M/1055 observations of its three star-forming knots now reveal that the observed LyC originates in Knots B and C, with 903–912 Å luminosities of 1.9 ± 1.5 × 1040 erg s−1 and 0.9 ± 0.7 × 1040 erg s−1, respectively. We derive local escape fractions fesc,912 = 3.4% ± 2.9% and 5.1% ± 4.3% for Knots B and C, respectively. Our Starburst99 modeling shows dominant populations on the order of ∼1–4 Myr and 1–2 × 107M⊙ in each knot, with the youngest population in Knot B. Thus, the knot with the strongest LyC detection has the highest LyC production. However, LyC escape is likely less efficient in Knot B than in Knot C due to higher neutral gas covering. Our results therefore stress the importance of the intrinsic ionizing luminosity, and not just the escape fraction, for LyC detection. Similarly, the Lyα escape fraction does not consistently correlate with LyC flux, nor do narrow Lyα red peaks. High observed Lyα luminosity and low Lyα peak velocity separation, however, do correlate with higher LyC escape. Another insight comes from the undetected Knot A, which drives the Green Pea properties of Haro 11. Its density-bounded conditions suggest highly anisotropic LyC escape. Finally, both of the LyC-leaking Knots, B and C, host ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs). While stars strongly dominate over the ULXs in LyC emission, this intriguing coincidence underscores the importance of unveiling the role of accretors in LyC escape and reionization.

总结:
该研究基于包括504个L、T和Y矮星在内的最新的容积限制样本，提出了迄今为止对太阳附近单个超冷矮星的质量和年龄分布的最精确的约束。通过使用修正不完整性的统计学方法，他们获得了L0–Y2光谱类型的空间密度为pc-3。他们还计算了样本的辐射通量，使用了最新的“超级星等”方法来处理最暗的物体。通过使用得到的光度函数和基于似然的种群合成方法，他们同时约束了质量和年龄分布。他们的分析发现质量函数的指数为-0.64±0.12，表明了向较低质量物体的数量增加，与附近的星形成区域的测量结果一致。此外，他们还发现年龄分布的指数β为-0.44±0.14，表明了比通常假设的更少的老年天体，这可能反映了银河系平面的动力加热和历史上的棕矮星产生率。与Kirkpatrick等人的分析进行比较后，虽然质量函数的测量结果数值上是一致的，但他们对于年龄分布的假设在该研究中被否定，并且该研究还指出了两个研究之间的一些重要的方法论差异。该研究对太阳附近棕矮星的年龄分布的计算是基于容积限制样本的，这是首次的。 <div>
We present the most precise constraints to date for the mass and age distributions of single ultracool dwarfs in the solar neighborhood, based on an updated volume-limited sample of 504 L, T, and Y dwarfs within 25 pc. We develop a Monte Carlo approach using the statistic to correct for incompleteness and obtain a space density of pc−3 for spectral types L0–Y2. We calculate bolometric luminosities for our sample, using an updated “super-magnitude” method for the faintest objects. We use our resulting luminosity function and a likelihood-based population synthesis approach to simultaneously constrain the mass and age distributions. We employ the fraction of young L0–L7 dwarfs as a novel input for this analysis that is crucial for constraining the age distribution. For a power-law mass function , we find , indicating an increase in numbers toward lower masses, consistent with measurements in nearby star-forming regions. For an exponential age distribution b(t) ∝ e−βt we find β = −0.44 ± 0.14, i.e., a population with fewer old objects than often assumed, which may reflect dynamical heating of the Galactic plane as much as the historical brown dwarf birthrate. We compare our analysis to that of Kirkpatrick et al., who used a similar volume-limited sample. Although our mass function measurements are numerically consistent, their assumption of a flat age distribution is disfavored by our analysis, and we identify several important methodological differences between our two studies. Our calculation of the age distribution of solar neighborhood brown dwarfs is the first based on a volume-limited sample.

<title>The Impact of Extended H2O Cross Sections on Temperate Anoxic Planet Atmospheres: Implications for Spectral Characterization of Habitable Worlds</title>

<br />
总结: 该研究利用JWST为地球外行星大气特征的观测数据，探讨了H2O交叉分区在光化学反应中的影响。研究结果表明，更新的H2O交叉分区数据对模拟行星大气中追踪气体的丰度产生了显著影响，尤其是在太阳类恒星周围的无氧行星上，这种影响尤为明显。在未来直接成像任务中，这些差异将导致模拟行星光谱出现可观测的变化。这项研究强调了H2O及其他关键分子的交叉分区数据在中紫外波长(>200nm)上的需求。 <div>
JWST has created a new era of terrestrial exoplanet atmospheric characterization, and with it, the possibility to detect potential biosignature gases like CH4. Our interpretation of exoplanet atmospheric spectra, and the veracity of these interpretations, will be limited by our understanding of atmospheric processes and the accuracy of input modeling data. Molecular cross sections are essential inputs to these models. The photochemistry of temperate planets depends on photolysis reactions whose rates are governed by the dissociation cross sections of key molecules. H2O is one such molecule; the photolysis of H2O produces OH, a highly reactive and efficient sink for atmospheric trace gases. We investigate the photochemical effects of improved H2O cross sections on anoxic terrestrial planets as a function of host star spectral type and CH4 surface flux. Our results show that updated H2O cross sections, extended to wavelengths >200 nm, substantially impact the predicted abundances of trace gases destroyed by OH. The differences for anoxic terrestrial planets orbiting Sun-like host stars are greatest, showing changes of up to 3 orders of magnitude in surface CO levels, and over an order of magnitude in surface CH4 levels. These differences lead to observable changes in simulated planetary spectra, especially important in the context of future direct-imaging missions. In contrast, the atmospheres of planets orbiting M-dwarf stars are substantially less affected. Our results demonstrate a pressing need for refined dissociation cross-section data for H2O, where uncertainties remain, and other key molecules, especially at mid-UV wavelengths >200 nm.

通过VLBA观测LP 349-25AB的11个时段，发现这个接近的双星系统的两个成分，并通过非线性最小二乘法、遗传算法和马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛方法确定了它们的轨道参数。主要成分和次要成分的质量分别为0.08188 ± 0.00061 M⊙ 和 0.06411 ± 0.00049 M⊙，表示迄今为止超冷矮星（UCD）的最精确质量估计之一。这是对棕矮星进行VLBA观测的少数直接检测之一。我们还测得该双星系统的距离为14.122 ± 0.057 pc。使用恒星演化模型，我们找到了两颗星的模型推导的恒星参数。特别是，我们得到了该系统的模型推导年龄为262百万年，表明LP 349-25AB由两颗前主序星组成。此外，我们还发现次要恒星的演化程度明显低于主要恒星。<br /><br />总结: LP 349-25是一个由两颗迟M型矮星组成的双星系统，通过VLBA观测得到了它们的质量、距离和演化信息。这是对LP 349-25AB进行了最精确的质量估计，并且少数直接检测出棕矮星的观测之一。 <div>
LP 349−25 is a well-studied close stellar binary system comprised of two late M dwarf stars, where both stars are close to the limit between star and brown dwarf. This system was previously identified as a source of gigahertz radio emission. We observed LP 349−25AB over 11 epochs in 2020–2022, detecting both components in this nearby binary system using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). We fit simultaneously the VLBA absolute astrometric positions together with existing relative astrometric observations derived from optical/infrared observations with a set of algorithms that use nonlinear least-squares, genetic algorithm, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to determine the orbital parameters of the two components. We find the masses of the primary and secondary components to be 0.08188 ± 0.00061 M⊙ and 0.06411 ± 0.00049 M⊙, respectively, representing one of the most precise mass estimates of any ultracool dwarf (UCD) to date. The primary is a UCD of 85.71 ± 0.64 MJup, while the secondary has a mass consistent with being a brown dwarf of 67.11 ± 0.51 MJup. This is one of the very few direct detections of a brown dwarf with VLBA observations. We also find a distance to the binary system of 14.122 ± 0.057 pc. Using stellar evolutionary models, we find the model-derived stellar parameters of both stars. In particular, we obtain a model-derived age of 262 Myr for the system, which indicates that LP 349−25AB is composed of two pre–main-sequence stars. In addition, we find that the secondary star is significantly less evolved than the primary star.

In a previous paper, we showed that, like the migration speed, the eccentricity damping efficiency is modulated linearly by the depth of the partial gap a planet carves in the disk surface density profile, resulting in less efficient e-damping compared to the prescription commonly used in population synthesis works. Here, we extend our analysis to 3D, refining our e-damping formula and studying how the inclination damping efficiency is also affected. We perform high-resolution 3D locally isothermal hydrodynamical simulations of planets with varying masses embedded in disks with varying aspect ratios and viscosities. We extract the gap profile and orbital damping timescales for fixed eccentricities and inclinations up to the disk scale height. The limit in gap depths below which vortices appear, in the low-viscosity case, happens roughly at the transition between classical type-I and type-II migration regimes. The orbital damping timescales can be described by two linear trends with a break around gap depths ∼80% and with slopes and intercepts depending on the eccentricity and inclination. These trends are understood on physical grounds and are reproduced by simple fitting formulas whose error is within the typical uncertainty of type-I torque formulas. Thus, our recipes for the gap depth and orbital damping efficiencies yield a simple description for planet–disk interactions to use in N-body codes in the case of partial-gap opening planets that is consistent with high-resolution 3D hydrosimulations. Finally, we show examples of how our novel orbital damping prescription can affect the outcome of population synthesis experiments.

We present an imaging survey of the Spitzer I star-forming region in NGC 6822 conducted with the NIRCam and MIRI instruments on board JWST. Located at a distance of 490 kpc, NGC 6822 is the nearest non-interacting low-metallicity (∼0.2 Z⊙) dwarf galaxy. It hosts some of the brightest known H ii regions in the local universe, including recently discovered sites of highly embedded active star formation. Of these, Spitzer I is the youngest and most active, and houses 90 color-selected candidate young stellar objects (YSOs) identified from Spitzer Space Telescope observations. We revisit the YSO population of Spitzer I with these new JWST observations. By analyzing color–magnitude diagrams constructed with NIRCam and MIRI data, we establish color selection criteria and construct spectral energy distributions to identify candidate YSOs and characterize the full population of young stars, from the most embedded phase to the more evolved stages. In this way, we have identified 140 YSOs in Spitzer I. Comparing to previous Spitzer studies of the NGC 6822 YSO population, we find that the YSOs we identify are fainter and less massive, indicating that the improved resolution of JWST allows us to resolve previously blended sources into multiple objects.

<div> cosmic microwave background, inflation, Planck time, primordial power spectrum, alternative cosmologies
总结:<br />
该论文讨论了对宇宙微波背景的研究，通过对传统通用相对论模型中膨胀参数空间的逐步细化，发现膨胀理论存在一些不确定性和矛盾。新的缓慢膨胀模型需要在普朗克时间之后启动，但这可能会导致一些问题，比如缺乏合理的初始条件，量子化早期涨落的困难等。然而，通过引入非常规的膨胀修正，如暂时脱离缓慢膨胀动力学，多场驱动膨胀，或与引力的非最小耦合，可以避免这些问题。此外，基于循环量子引力的替代宇宙学也可能有助于解决这些困难。 <div>
Space-based missions studying the cosmic microwave background (CMB) have progressively refined the parameter space in conventional models of inflation shortly (∼10−37 s) after the Big Bang. While most inflationary scenarios proposed thus far in the context of general relativity have since been ruled out, the basic idea of inflation may still be tenable, albeit with several unresolved conundrums, such as conflicting initial conditions and inconsistencies with the measured CMB power spectrum. In the new slow-roll inflationary picture, inflation arising in plateau-like potentials requires an initiation beyond the Planck time. This delay may be consistent with the cutoff, , measured recently in the primordial power spectrum. However, the actual value of would imply an initiation time too far beyond the Big Bang for inflation to solve the horizon problem. In this paper, we also describe several other undesirable consequences of this delay, including an absence of well-motivated initial conditions and a significant difficulty in providing a viable mechanism for properly quantizing the primordial fluctuations. Nevertheless, many of these inconsistencies may still be avoided if one introduces nonconventional modifications to inflation, such as a brief departure from slow-roll dynamics, possibly due to a dramatic change in the inflationary potential, inflation driven by multiple fields, or a nonminimal coupling to gravity. In addition, some of these difficulties could be mitigated via the use of alternative cosmologies based, e.g., on loop quantum gravity, which replaces the initial Big Bang singularity with finite conditions at a bounce-like beginning.

总结:<br />
本研究利用Fermi/Gamma-ray Burst Monitor数据对SGR J1935+2154的X射线爆发进行了研究，发现爆发在FRB 20200428期间的等待时间明显较短，且XRBs的统计特性表明它们可能属于自组织临界系统，类似于地震现象。根据地震等待时间和能量以及余震之间的统一缩放定律，对XRBs进行了类比分析，发现FRB期间的爆发事件更加相互依赖。这表明FRB可能是由不同爆发事件之间的相互作用产生的，这可能对应于磁星进入全球密集活动期间时出现的不同地震/阿尔文波或不同爆炸流的碰撞情景。 <div>
By using the Fermi/Gamma-ray Burst Monitor data of the X-ray bursts (XRBs) of SGR J1935+2154, we investigate the temporal clustering of the bursts and the cumulative distribution of the waiting time and fluence/flux. It is found that the bursts occurring in the episode hosting FRB 20200428 have obviously shorter waiting times than those in the other episodes. The general statistical properties of the XRBs further indicate they could belong to a self-organized critical system (e.g., starquakes), making them very similar to the earthquake phenomena. Then, according to a unified scaling law between the waiting time and energy of the earthquakes as well as their aftershocks, we implement an analogy analysis on the XRBs and find that the fast radio burst (FRB) episode owns more dependent burst events than the other episodes. It is indicated that the FRB emission could be produced by the interaction between different burst events, which could correspond to a collision between different seismic/Alfvén waves or different explosion outflows. Such a situation could appear when the magnetar enters into a global intensive activity period.

Recent astrophysical mass inferences of compact stars HESS J1731-347 and PSR J0952-0607, with extremely small and large masses respectively, as well as the measurement of the neutron skin of Ca in the CREX experiment challenge and constrain the models of dense matter. We examine the concept of hybrid stars—objects containing quark cores surrounded by nucleonic envelopes—as models that account for these new data along with other inferences. We employ a family of 81 nucleonic equations of state (EOSs) with variable skewness and slope of symmetry energy at saturation density and a constant speed-of-sound EOS for quark matter. For each nucleonic EOS, a family of hybrid EOSs is generated by varying the transition density, the energy jump, and the speed of sound. These models are tested against the data from GW170817 and J1731-347, which favor low-density soft EOS and J0592-0607 and J0740+6620, which require high-density stiff EOS. The addition of J0592-0607's mass measurement to the constraints has no significant impact on the parameter space of the admissible EOS, but allows us to explore the potential effect of pulsars more massive than J0740+6620, if such exists. We then examine the occurrence of twin configurations and quantify the ranges of masses and radii that they can possess. It is shown that including J1731-347 data favors EOSs that predict low-mass twins with M ≲ 1.3 M⊙ that can be realized if the deconfinement transition density is low. If combined with large speed of sound in quark matter such models allow for maximum masses of hybrid stars in 2.0–2.6 M⊙.

In this work, we show that the SEP Si detectors have detected populations of secondary charged particles and low-energy primary photons from the GRB. Our analysis relies on a series of simplified Geant4 Monte Carlo simulations. We show that electromagnetic and hadronic interactions between the GRB photons and the spacecraft’s passive material and Si detectors produced the detected secondary particles.

<title>Analytical Study of Damped Standing Longitudinal MHD Waves in Flowing Coronal Loops: The Effect of Thermal Conduction</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The longitudinal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) oscillations of coronal loops have been investigated in dissipative flowing loops. Thermal conduction has been considered as the damping mechanism of the wave. We aim to construct the damped longitudinal waves by superposing two propagating waves that propagate in opposite directions. The two propagating components must have the same oscillation frequencies and damping rates, which has been described impossible by some authors, but we have used a technique to overcome this difficulty. The equations of motion are combined to obtain a differential equation for the velocity perturbation. Using the weak damping condition, the perturbation method is used to solve the dispersion relation. In the leading order approximation, the oscillation frequency of the standing waves is determined. In the first-order approximation, we let both the oscillation frequency and wavelength of the propagating waves be perturbed due to the presence of thermal conduction, which enables us to determine the damping rate of the standing waves. Our results show that the plasma flow is an essential parameter in determining the effectiveness of the damping mechanism. Also, the exact solutions of the dispersion relation have been determined without using weak damping assumption. Interestingly the two solutions are the same. Introducing plasma flow to the coronal loop causes the period ratio of the fundamental mode to the first overtone to decrease more.

<br />研究使用Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array观测了NGC 1977区域的射电源，发现了34个NGC 1977星团成员和37个背景物体的连续辐射。其中，3个与已知的NGC 1977星云相关联，22个与其他NGC 1977中的年轻恒星物体相关联，9个是新发现的星团成员。研究还分析了这些NGC 1977射电源的光谱能量分布、循环极化和变化性，并鉴定了10个新的候选星云，其射电流量主要由光学薄自由-自由辐射支配。利用自由-自由辐射测量计算了NGC 1977已知星云和新候选星云的质量流失率，得到大约10^(-9)到10^(-8)太阳质量每年的值。最后，研究表明NGC 1977中的光致蒸发盘可能被内部或外部的电离源照亮，具体取决于它们在星团内的位置。这项研究为一个具有较弱紫外环境的群集恒星形成区域中的盘特性提供了新的约束条件，这些环境代表了银河的典型恒星和行星形成条件。<br /><br />总结: 本研究利用射电观测研究了NGC 1977星团区域，发现了34个星团成员和37个背景物体的连续辐射。其中，对这些射电源进行了详细分析，识别了新的候选星云，并计算了它们的质量流失率。研究结果表明NGC 1977中的光致蒸发盘可能受到内部或外部电离源的照射。这些发现为我们提供了更多关于星团形成区域中盘特性的信息。 <div>
We present NSF's Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array observations covering the NGC 1977 region at 3.0, 6.4, and 15.0 GHz. We search for compact radio sources and detect continuum emission from 34 NGC 1977 cluster members and 37 background objects. Of the 34 radio-detected cluster members, 3 are associated with known proplyds in NGC 1977, 22 are associated with additional young stellar objects in NGC 1977, and 9 are newly identified cluster members. We examine the radio spectral energy distributions, circular polarization, and variability of the detected NGC 1977 sources and identify 10 new candidate proplyds whose radio fluxes are dominated by optically thin free–free emission. We use measurements of free–free emission to calculate the mass-loss rates of known proplyds and new candidate proplyds in NGC 1977, and find values ∼10−9 to 10−8M⊙ yr−1, which are lower than the mass-loss rates measured toward proplyds in the Orion Nebula Cluster but consistent with the mass-loss rates predicted by external photoevaporation models for spatially extended disks that are irradiated by the typical external ultraviolet (UV) fields encountered in NGC 1977. Finally, we show that photoevaporative disk winds in NGC 1977 may be illuminated by internal or external sources of ionization, depending on their positions within the cluster. This study provides new constraints on disk properties in a clustered star-forming region with a weaker UV environment than the Orion Nebula Cluster but a stronger UV environment than low-mass star-forming regions like Taurus. Such intermediate UV environments represent the typical conditions of Galactic star and planet formation.

<br />这篇论文报告了M15中62颗恒星的中子俘获元素丰度。使用Michigan/Magellan Fiber System光谱仪获取了波长范围约为4430到4630埃的光谱。测量了Fe i、Fe ii、Sr i、Zr ii、Ba ii、La ii、Ce ii、Nd ii、Sm ii、Eu ii和Dy ii的光谱线，对恒星进行了分类和中子俘获丰度模式的研究。其中44颗被发现为高Eu增强的r-II型恒星，另外17颗是中度Eu增强的r-I型恒星，还有一颗恒星显示出s-过程的特征。中子俘获模式表明，大多数恒星的富集过程符合r过程的特征。在Sr、Zr、Ba、La、Ce、Nd、Sm、Eu和Dy方面，这62颗恒星显示出显着的星际之间的差异，但在Fe方面没有显着的差异。中子俘获丰度还发现与文献中的钠丰度存在轻微相关性，这与以往研究的结论不同，需要进行后续研究来验证这一结果。这篇论文的发现表明M15中的Eu增强恒星是通过相同的过程进行富集的，这种铀污染的核合成源头是r过程，并且这r过程源头发生在星团形成的第一代恒星时期。<br /><br />总结: 这篇论文报告了M15中62颗恒星的中子俘获元素丰度研究结果，发现大多数恒星的富集过程符合r过程的特征，而且Eu增强恒星是通过相同的过程进行富集的。此外，还发现了中子俘获丰度与钠丰度之间存在轻微相关性，这与已有的研究结论不同。 <div>
M15 is a globular cluster with a known spread in neutron-capture elements. This paper presents abundances of neutron-capture elements for 62 stars in M15. Spectra were obtained with the Michigan/Magellan Fiber System spectrograph, covering a wavelength range from ∼4430 to 4630 Å. Spectral lines from Fe i, Fe ii, Sr i, Zr ii, Ba ii, La ii, Ce ii, Nd ii, Sm ii, Eu ii, and Dy ii were measured, enabling classifications and neutron-capture abundance patterns for the stars. Of the 62 targets, 44 are found to be highly Eu-enhanced r-II stars, another 17 are moderately Eu-enhanced r-I stars, and one star is found to have an s-process signature. The neutron-capture patterns indicate that the majority of the stars are consistent with enrichment by the r-process. The 62 target stars are found to show significant star-to-star spreads in Sr, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Nd, Sm, Eu, and Dy, but no significant spread in Fe. The neutron-capture abundances are further found to have slight correlations with sodium abundances from the literature, unlike what has been previously found; follow-up studies are needed to verify this result. The findings in this paper suggest that the Eu-enhanced stars in M15 were enhanced by the same process, that the nucleosynthetic source of this Eu pollution was the r-process, and that the r-process source occurred as the first generation of cluster stars was forming.

该研究利用长时间曝光的XMM-Newton数据对狭线塞弗特1星系RE J1034+396进行了光谱分析，发现了两种不同电离态的温暖吸收成分，分别对应着高和低离子化的WA组件，其估计的流出速度分别为-1400 km s−1和-(100-300) km s−1。这两种吸收体位于广谱线区域之外，对宿主环境影响不大。研究还分析了不同通量状态下的温暖吸收体，以及2007年5月观测期间的QPO低和高阶段。与以往研究不同的是，我们发现高离子化WA与QPO阶段之间没有负相关性，同时还发现了在约12-18 Å范围内的广泛发射峰，其强度可能与QPO阶段呈正相关。以往研究中对这一发射峰的发现缺失可能导致了之前提出的WA-QPO相关性推断。 
<br /><br />总结: <br /> XMM-Newton数据对RE J1034+396进行了光谱分析，发现了两种不同电离态的温暖吸收成分。这两种吸收体位于广谱线区域之外，对宿主环境影响不大。分析还发现了在约12-18 Å范围内的广泛发射峰，其强度可能与QPO阶段呈正相关。 <div>
We conduct an in-depth spectral analysis of ∼1 Ms XMM-Newton data of the narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxy RE J1034+396. The long exposure ensures high spectral quality and provides us with a detailed look at the intrinsic absorption and emission features toward this target. Two warm-absorber (WA) components with different ionization states ( and ) are required to explain the intrinsic absorption features in the Reflection Grating Spectrometer spectra. The estimated outflow velocities are around −1400 km s−1 and −(100–300) km s−1 for the high- and low-ionization WA components, respectively. Both absorbers are located beyond the broad-line region and cannot significantly affect the host environment. We analyze the warm absorbers in different flux states. We also examine the 2007 May observation in the low and high phases of quasiperiodic oscillation (QPO). In contrast to previous analyses showing a negative correlation between the high-ionization WA and the QPO phase, we have found no such variation in this WA component. We discover a broad emission bump in the spectral range of ∼12–18 Å, covering the primary features of the high-ionization WA. This emission bump shows a dramatic change in different source states, and its intensity may positively correlate with the QPO phase. The absence of this emission bump in previous work may contribute to the suggested WA–QPO connection.

在这项研究中，我们使用平滑粒子流体动力学模拟探索超大质量黑洞对L*星系的星际介质和星系周围介质的影响。我们从25Mpc的宇宙体积Romulus25中选取了140个星等质量在log(M*/M⊙) = 9.5–11.5之间的星系进行分析。我们测量了每个星系星际介质和星系周围介质中金属的比例，并根据MBH–σ关系(Kormendy & Ho 2013)计算了每个超大质量黑洞的预期质量。我们发现，吸积质量超过MBH–σ的超大质量黑洞比质量不足的黑洞在抑制星系总体形成和将金属从星际介质排放到星系周围介质方面更为有效。然而，与其他模拟不同的是，我们观察到星系周围介质中的气体几乎没有从星系的暗物质晕中排放出去。最后，我们预测L*星系的C iv柱密度不太可能受宿主星系超大质量黑洞质量的影响。我们的结果表明，MBH–σ关系低质量端的离散可能表示一个超大质量黑洞在其宿主星系中局部质量再分布的有效性。 <br /><br />总结: 超大质量黑洞对星系的影响、金属流动、星系形成的抑制、气体的排放、C iv柱密度预测。 <div>
The interaction between supermassive black hole (SMBH) feedback and the circumgalactic medium (CGM) continues to be an open question in galaxy evolution. In our study, we use smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations to explore the impact of SMBH feedback on galactic metal retention and the motion of metals and gas into and through the CGM of L* galaxies. We examine 140 galaxies from the 25 Mpc cosmological volume Romulus25, with stellar masses between log(M*/M⊙) = 9.5–11.5. We measure the fraction of metals remaining in the interstellar medium (ISM) and CGM of each galaxy and calculate the expected mass of each SMBH based on the MBH–σ relation (Kormendy & Ho 2013). The deviation of each SMBH from its expected mass, ΔMBH, is compared to the potential of its host via σ. We find that SMBHs with accreted mass above MBH–σ are more effective at removing metals from the ISM than undermassive SMBHs in star-forming galaxies. Overall, overmassive SMBHs suppress the total star formation of their host galaxies and more effectively move metals from the ISM into the CGM. However, we see little to no evacuation of gas from the CGM out of their halos, in contrast with other simulations. Finally, we predict that C iv column densities in the CGM of L* galaxies are unlikely to depend on host galaxy SMBH mass. Our results show that the scatter in the low-mass end of the MBH–σ relation may indicate how effective an SMBH is in the local redistribution of mass in its host galaxy.

<div> Monte Carlo simulation, X-ray resonant-line emission, supernova remnants, RS effect, physical properties<br /><br />总结:
本文使用蒙特卡洛模拟了超新星遗迹中X射线共振线辐射的共振散射效应。研究发现RS效应在边缘区域最为显著，造成线谱的非对称性，并且使得线辐射的表面亮度在不同区域有所变化。在Cygnus Loop的观测数据中，O vii Heα r线的G-比可以被RS影响而显著提高。此外，对Cas A等以喷射物为主导阶段的超新星遗迹进行的额外模拟结果表明，RS在冲击喷射物中可能会明显影响氧共振线的观测特性。 <div>
Resonant scattering (RS) of X-ray line emission in supernova remnants (SNRs) may modify the observed line profiles and fluxes and has a potential impact on estimating the physical properties of the hot gas and hence on understanding the SNR physics, but has not been theoretically modeled ever. Here we present our Monte Carlo simulation of the RS effect on X-ray resonant-line emission, typified by the O vii Heα r line, from SNRs. We employ the physical conditions characterized by the Sedov–Taylor solution and some basic parameters similar to those in Cygnus Loop. We show that the impact of the RS effect is most significant near the edge of the remnant. The line profiles are predicted to be asymmetric because of different temperatures and photon production efficiencies of the expanding gas at different radii. We also predict the surface brightness of the line emission would decrease in the outer projected region but is slightly enhanced in the inner. The G-ratio of the O vii Heα triplet can be effectively elevated by RS in the outer region. We show that the RS effect of the O vii Heα r line in the southwestern boundary region of Cygnus Loop is nonnegligible. The observed O vii G-ratio of ∼1.8 of the region could be achieved with RS taken into account for properly elevated O abundance from the previous estimates. Additional simulation performed for the SNRs in ejecta-dominated phases like Cas A shows that RS in the shocked ejecta may have some apparent effects on the observational properties of oxygen-resonant lines.

GJ 1148系统包括两颗类土星质量的行星围绕着一个M型矮星在星系结构上呈现出层级和离心轨道运动，这两颗行星的轨道周期比为13，离心率均为0.375。通过数值实验研究了行星-行星散射模型对这种轨道结构的形成过程。研究考虑了初始GJ 1148系统中第三颗质量为0.1MJ的行星，初始轨道间隔为3.5、4和4.5个相互希尔半径，并且内行星的初始半长轴范围为0.10-0.50 au。大多数散射结果都导致了行星-行星碰撞，随后是行星被抛出和行星-星体近距离接近。在这些结果中，只有行星被抛出产生了轨道离心率大且相互分离的两行星系统，其中一些具有与GJ 1148系统相似的轨道特性。研究还考察了广义相对论进动和第三颗行星质量升高至0.227MJ的影响。模拟结果表明，GJ 1148系统可能丢失了一颗巨行星。我们还进行了关于暖木星的形成机制的其他模拟。与GJ 1148的模拟结果一样，一定数量的稳定的两行星系统是通过行星被抛出而产生的，这与之前的研究结果不符，前者显示两行星系统仅仅通过行星-行星碰撞形成。 <br /><br />总结: GJ 1148系统包括两颗类土星质量的行星围绕M型矮星运动，在数值实验中发现可能丢失了一颗巨行星，通过对行星-行星碰撞和行星被抛出的模拟研究分析了系统形成的可能机制。 <div>
The GJ 1148 system has two Saturn-mass planets orbiting around an M dwarf star on hierarchical and eccentric orbits, with orbital period ratio of 13 and eccentricities of both planets of 0.375. The inner planet is in the regime of eccentric warm Jupiters. We perform numerical experiments to study the planet–planet scattering scenario for the origin of this orbital architecture. We consider a third planet of 0.1MJ (Jupiter's mass) in the initial GJ 1148 system with initial orbital separations of 3.5, 4, and 4.5 mutual Hill radii and initial semimajor axis of the innermost planet in the range of 0.10–0.50 au. The majority of scattering results in planet–planet collisions, followed by planet ejections, and planet–star close approaches. Among them, only planet ejections produce eccentric and widely separated two-planet systems, with some having similar orbital properties to the GJ 1148 system. We also examine the effects of general relativistic apsidal precession and a higher mass of 0.227MJ for the third planet. The simulation results suggest that the GJ 1148 system may have lost a giant planet. We also perform simulations of the general problem of the origin of warm Jupiters by planet–planet scattering. As in the GJ 1148 simulations, a nontrivial number of stable two-planet systems are produced by ejection, which disagrees with the result from a previous study showing that two-planet systems arise exclusively through planet–planet collisions.

总结:
能量均分和喷流能量预算在HBLs的辐射机制中很重要。该研究使用费米卫星的4LAC-DR3目录汇编了348个高频峰值BL Lac对象(HBLs)，并采用JetSet来拟合这些HBLs的光谱能量分布(SEDs)。研究结果表明，HBLs的SEDs可以很好地通过单区电子模型来重现，但无法实现能量均分，且相对论电子能量密度远大于磁场能量密度。大多数HBLs位于tcool < tdyn区域，具有较低的辐射效率，推测可能有光学薄的平流主导吸积流。此外，HBLs的喷流动能大于辐射功率，表明了存在非常低的辐射效率。最后，关系Ue > USyn ∼ UB, Le ∼ Lp > LB ∼ Lrad也被建立，表明HBLs的大部分能量存储在低能电子中。 <div>
Energy equipartition and the energy budget in the jet are important issues for the radiation mechanism of blazars. Early work predominantly concentrated on flat-spectrum radio quasars and a limited number of BL Lacertae (BL Lac) objects. In this paper, we compile 348 high-frequency peaked BL Lac objects (HBLs) based on the catalog of active galactic nuclei (4LAC-DR3) from Fermi-LAT, and employ JetSet to fit the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of these HBLs in the framework of the one-zone lepton model. We aim to determine whether the energy budget is reasonable and whether energy equipartition is satisfied in HBLs. The results of the statistical analysis suggest that: (1) SEDs of HBLs can be reproduced well by using the one-zone lepton model; however, it cannot achieve energy equalization, and the relativistic electron energy density is far greater than the magnetic field energy density, Ue ≳ 100UB; (2) the majority of HBLs are located in the tcool < tdyn region (where the horizontal coordinate represents the jet power of electrons, while the ordinate indicates the ratio of the dynamic timescale to the cooling timescale), and the jet kinetic power of HBLs is greater than the jet power of radiation; there is a very low radiation efficiency, we deduce that HBLs may have optically thin advection-dominated accretion flows; (3) of HBLs is less than zero, which indicates that the jet kinetic power of HBLs is not affected by Poynting flux; (4) the relationships Ue > USyn ∼ UB, Le ∼ Lp > LB ∼ Lrad, and are established. These relations indicate that most of the energy of HBLs is stored in the population of low-energy electrons.

Modeling of time profiles of solar energetic particle (SEP) observations often considers transport along a large-scale magnetic field with a fixed path length from the source to the observer. Here, we point out that variability in the turbulent field line path length can affect the fits to SEP data and the inferred mean free path and injection profile. To explore such variability, we perform Monte Carlo simulations in representations of homogeneous 2D MHD + slab turbulence adapted to spherical geometry and trace trajectories of field lines and full particle orbits, considering proton injection from a narrow or wide angular region near the Sun, corresponding to an impulsive or gradual solar event, respectively. We analyze our simulation results in terms of field line and particle path length statistics for 1° × 1° pixels in heliolatitude and heliolongitude at 0.35 and 1 au from the Sun, for different values of the turbulence amplitude b/B0 and turbulence geometry as expressed by the slab fraction fs. Maps of the most probable path lengths of field lines and particles at each pixel exhibit systematic patterns that reflect the fluctuation amplitudes experienced by the field lines, which in turn relate to the local topology of 2D turbulence. We describe the effects of such path length variations on SEP time profiles, both in terms of path length variability at specific locations and the motion of the observer with respect to turbulence topology during the course of the observations.

<br /><br />该研究使用哈勃空间望远镜获取的紫外-光学-近红外光度数据，研究小星系NGC 4449中年轻星团的性质。他们发现这些星团的质量在102 < M⊙ < 105之间，年龄为1-20百万年，颜色消光E(B-V)范围在0-1.4之间。在选择了质量大于3000 M⊙的星团后，他们发现红外选择的星团具有中位质量约为7 × 10^3 M⊙，并在周围的气体和尘埃中保持5-6百万年。相反，从现有的紫外/光学目录中选择的发射线源具有中位质量约为3.5 × 10^4 M⊙，并在4百万年内清除了周围的环境。研究发现NGC 4449的环境压力过低，无法驱动这些差异。这些发现表明，星团的清除时间尺度与其质量有关，并且存在随机取样的效应。这种效应可能通过减少注入周围介质的能量和动量来增加这些星团的清除时间尺度；目前模型和观测还没有明确探讨过这种依赖性。未来的研究和观测，例如使用JWST，将填补这一空白。
<br /><br />总结: 该研究通过观测NGC 4449中的年轻星团，发现了星团质量对星团周围环境清除时间尺度的依赖关系，并指出了随机取样效应可能导致这一关联。这为未来的研究和观测提供了方向，以填补现有模型和观测中的空白。 <div>
We survey the young star cluster population in the dwarf galaxy NGC 4449 with the goal of investigating how stellar feedback may depend on the clusters’ properties. Using ultraviolet (UV)–optical–near-infrared photometry obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope, we have recovered 99 compact sources exhibiting emission in the Paβ hydrogen recombination line. Our analysis reveals these sources possess masses of 102 < M⊙ < 105, ages of 1–20 Myr, and a color excess E(B − V) in the range 0–1.4. After selecting clusters with masses above 3000 M⊙ to mitigate stochastic sampling of the stellar initial mass function, we find that our IR-selected clusters have a median mass ∼ 7 × 103 M⊙ and remain embedded in their surrounding gas and dust for 5–6 Myr. In contrast, line-emitting sources selected from existing UV/optical catalogs have a median mass ∼ 3.5 × 104 M⊙ and have cleared their surroundings by 4 Myr. We further find that the environment in NGC 4449 has too low pressure to drive these differences. We interpret these findings as evidence that the clearing timescale from presupernova and supernova feedback is cluster mass dependent. Even in clusters with masses ∼ 7000 M⊙, stochastic sampling of the upper end of the stellar initial mass function is present, randomly decreasing the number of massive stars available to inject energy and momentum into the surrounding medium. This effect may increase the clearing timescales in these clusters by decreasing the effectiveness of both presupernova and supernova feedback; neither models nor observations have so far explored such dependence explicitly. Future studies and observations with, e.g., the JWST, will fill this gap.

这篇文章对29个高Galactic BL Lac对象进行了14年Fermi大面积望远镜数据的短时间尺度γ射线耀斑的系统性搜索。通过贝叶斯块和HOP算法，发现了来自3个源的七个高质量的轨道时间尺度的耀斑段，以及量化了24个短时间尺度的耀斑结构。主要结果如下：（1）耀斑对称性参数A呈“U”形分布，短时间尺度的耀斑是对称的，而长时间尺度的耀斑是不对称的。快升慢降和慢升快降类型的耀斑数量相等。发现A与峰值/积分流量之间没有相关性，也没有在连续耀斑之间观察到参数演变。观察结果支持了长时间尺度的耀斑来自对称的短时间尺度亚小时耀斑的叠加情景。（2）年度至小时尺度上的PSD采用CARMA过程建模。在较低频率下，PSD遵循典型的破裂幂律形式。PSD的高频区域呈现连续的幂律形状，表明γ射线变异性源自跨越所有探测时间尺度的单一物理过程。（3）流量-光子指数分布显示“亮时更硬”或“亮时更软”的模式，但在达到一定临界流量后变得平坦，即Γ≈2。这种行为不能简单地用两分量或BL Lac序列模型解释，我们推测这可能与电子加速和冷却之间复杂的相互作用有关。

<br /><br />总结:
本研究首次对高Galactic BL Lac对象进行了长达14年的Fermi大面积望远镜数据的系统性分析，结果发现了短时间尺度的γ射线耀斑的特征及其对称性、功率谱密度的模型及流量-光子指数关系的复杂性。研究表明，长时间尺度的耀斑可能由短时间对称的亚小时耀斑叠加而成，γ射线变异性可能源自跨越所有时间尺度的单一物理过程，而流量-光子指数关系则可能与电子加速和冷却之间的复杂相互作用相关。 <div>
We present here the first systematic search of short-timescale γ-ray flares from 29 high Galactic latitude BL Lac objects over 14 yr of Fermi Large Area Telescope data. Using a combined Bayesian Blocks and HOP algorithm, we identified seven high-quality orbital timescale flare segments from three sources and quantified 24 short-timescale flare structures. We then performed a comprehensive analysis of flare symmetry, power spectral density (PSD) of variability, and flux–photon index relation. The main results are as follows. (1) The flare symmetry parameter A shows a “U-shaped” distribution. Short-timescale flares are symmetric while long-timescale flares are asymmetric. The number of fast-rise, slow-decay and slow-rise, fast-decay type flares are equal. No correlation is found between A and peak/integral flux. No parameter evolution is seen between consecutive flares, either. The observations support a scenario where longer-timescale flares originate from the superposition of short, symmetric subhour flares. (2) PSD from yearly to hourly timescales is modeled using the CARMA process. At lower frequencies, the PSD follows the typical broken power-law form. The high-frequency region of the PSD exhibits a continuous power-law shape, indicating that γ-ray variability originates from a single physical process across all probed timescales. (3) The flux–photon index distribution shows a pattern of “harder-when-brighter” or “softer-when-brighter,” but becomes flat above a certain critical flux, with Γ ≈ 2. This behavior cannot be simply explained by a two-component or blazar sequence model, and we speculate it may be related to complex interplay between electron acceleration and cooling.

总结:
本文研究了围绕着前主序M矮星的类地行星大气中水的流失情况。研究发现，由于H2O再生反应的有效性以及O2对紫外线的屏蔽作用，导致水的流失速率显著降低。这意味着目前在M矮星的宜居区内的类地行星更有可能保留地表水。该研究为我们更好地理解M矮星周围的行星的环境条件提供了重要线索。 <div>
Terrestrial planets currently in the habitable zone around M dwarfs are estimated to have been in runaway greenhouse conditions for up to ∼1 Gyr due to the long-term pre-main-sequence phase of M dwarfs. These planets likely lose a significant portion of water during the pre-main-sequence phase owing to H2O photolysis followed by hydrogen and oxygen loss to space. However, the effects of H2O reproduction reactions and UV shielding by chemical products that reduce photolysis-induced water loss have yet to be estimated. Here, we apply a 1D photochemical model to a H2O-dominated atmosphere of an Earth-like planet around a pre-main-sequence M dwarf to estimate these effects. We find that water loss is suppressed by efficient H2O reproduction reactions and by UV shielding due to O2. The water loss rate decreases by several to several hundred times compared to that in previous studies, with the assumption that the water loss rate is limited by stellar X-ray and extreme-ultraviolet flux or hydrogen diffusion through the atmosphere. Our results imply that terrestrial planets currently in the habitable zone around M dwarfs are more likely to retain surface water than previously estimated.

In this paper, we use two methods, an algorithm of the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise combined with the Gaussian mixture model, and the maximum likelihood method, to study two open clusters: IC 2488 and IC 2714 with Gaia Data Release 3 data. We compare the two methods in terms of cluster star number, isochrone fitting, cluster mass, and radius. The comparison shows that the selections of cluster stars by the two methods are consistent. The parameters obtained by the two methods are very close. But there are slight differences between the two methods for faint stars in IC 2714. The maximum likelihood method selects more faint stars outside of the main-sequence stripe. We conclude that the maximum likelihood method is more likely affected by field stars.

<title>Revisiting High-energy Polarization from Leptonic and Hadronic Blazar Scenarios</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
X-ray and MeV polarization can be powerful diagnostics for leptonic and hadronic blazar models. Previous predictions are mostly based on a one-zone framework. However, recent IXPE observations of Mrk 421 and 501 strongly favor a multizone framework. Thus, the leptonic and hadronic polarization predictions need to be revisited. Here we identify two generic radiation transfer effects, namely, double depolarization and energy stratification, that can have an impact on the leptonic and hadronic polarization. We show how they are generalized from previously known multizone effects of the primary electron synchrotron radiation. Under our generic multizone model, the leptonic polarization degree is expected to be much lower than the one-zone prediction, unlikely detectable in most cases. The hadronic polarization degree can reach a value as high as the primary electron synchrotron polarization during simultaneous multiwavelength flares, consistent with the one-zone prediction. Therefore, IXPE and future X-ray and MeV polarimeters such as eXTP, COSI, and AMEGO-X, have good chances to detect hadronic polarization during flares. However, the hadronic polarization cannot be well constrained during the quiescent state. Nonetheless, if some blazar jets possess relatively stable large-scale magnetic structures, as suggested by radio observations, a nontrivial polarization degree may show up for the hadronic model after a very long exposure time (≳1 yr).

<title>Sp1149. II. Spectroscopy of H ii Regions near the Critical Curve of MACS J1149 and Cluster Lens Models</title>

Galaxy-cluster gravitational lenses enable the study of faint galaxies even at large lookback times, and, recently, time-delay constraints on the Hubble constant. There have been few tests, however, of lens model predictions adjacent to the critical curve (≲8″) where the magnification is greatest. In a companion paper, we use the GLAFIC lens model to constrain the Balmer L–σ relation for H ii regions in a galaxy at redshift z = 1.49 strongly lensed by the MACS J1149 galaxy cluster. Here we perform a detailed comparison between the predictions of 10 cluster lens models that employ multiple modeling assumptions with our measurements of 11 magnified, giant H ii regions. We find that that the models predict magnifications an average factor of 6.2 smaller, a ∼2σ tension, than that inferred from the H ii regions under the assumption that they follow the low-redshift L–σ relation. To evaluate the possibility that the lens model magnifications are strongly biased, we next consider the flux ratios among knots in three images of Sp1149, and find that these are consistent with model predictions. Moreover, while the mass-sheet degeneracy could in principle account for a factor of ∼6 discrepancy in magnification, the value of H0 inferred from SN Refsdal’s time delay would become implausibly small. We conclude that the lens models are not likely to be highly biased, and that instead the H ii regions in Sp1149 are substantially more luminous than the low-redshift Balmer L–σ relation predicts.

<title>Measurement of Interstellar Magnetization by Synchrotron Polarization Variance</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad452c</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Since synchrotron polarization fluctuations are related to the fundamental properties of the magnetic field, we propose the polarization intensity variance to measure the Galactic interstellar medium (ISM) magnetization. We confirm the method’s applicability by comparing it with the polarization angle dispersion and its reliability by measuring the underlying Alfvénic Mach number of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. With the finding of the power-law relation of between polarization intensity variance and Alfvénic Mach number MA, we apply the new technique to the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey data, achieving the Alfvénic Mach number of the Galactic ISM. Our results show that the low-latitude Galactic ISM is dominated by sub-Alfénic turbulence, with MA approximately between 0.5 and 1.0.

总结:<br /><br />
本文研究了地球椭球性对地—空和空—空VLBI轨道选择的影响，发现可以通过调整轨道参数利用J2效应来增加短基线覆盖，填补(u,v)平面中的空白区域。通过简单的分析方法，得出了M87*和Sgr A*的(u,v)平面覆盖图，并展示了J2效应对短基线和长基线的影响。 <div>
Earth-based very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) has made rapid advances in imaging black holes. However, due to the limitations imposed on terrestrial VLBI by the Earth’s finite size and turbulent atmosphere, it is imperative to have a space-based component in future VLBI missions. This paper investigates the effect of the Earth’s oblateness, also known as the J2 effect, on orbiters in Earth–space and space–space VLBI. The paper provides an extensive discussion on how the J2 effect can directly impact orbit selection for black hole observations and how, through informed choices of orbital parameters, the effect can be used to a mission’s advantage, a fact that has not been addressed in previous space VLBI investigations. We provide a comprehensive study of how the orbital parameters of several current space VLBI proposals will vary specifically due to the J2 effect. For black hole accretion flow targets of interest, we demonstrate how the J2 effect leads to a modest increase in shorter-baseline coverage, filling gaps in the (u, v) plane. Subsequently, we construct a simple analytical formalism that allows isolation of the impact of the J2 effect on the (u, v) plane without requiring computationally intensive orbit propagation simulations. By directly constructing (u, v) coverage using J2-affected and J2-invariant equations of motion, we obtain distinct coverage patterns for M87* and Sgr A* that show extremely dense coverage on short baselines as well as long-term orbital stability on longer baselines.

总结: 
该研究提出了一种新的模型，可以通过使用来自AKARI–Spitzer星系外交叉档案数据集的多环芳烃（PAH）发射来光谱约束3–17 μm范围内的MIR灭尽/衰减曲线。他们采用PAH带在尘埃星爆星系内相对一致的内在比率的基本假设，首次经验地确定了MIR衰减曲线的整体形状，通过测量特定PAH波长处的差分衰减。研究结果显示，在大多数（超）亮红外星系中，PAH发射清楚地受到衰减的影响，并且随着遮挡的增加，PAH带经历差异衰减。与已有结果相比，模型推导的MIR衰减曲线偏好于相对灰色的连续吸收从3–8 μm，并且在9.7 μm处具有中等强度的硅酸盐特征，但18 μm的不透明度比典型值更高。<br /><br /> <div>
We introduce a novel model to spectroscopically constrain the mid-infrared (MIR) extinction/attenuation curve from 3–17 μm, using polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission drawn from an AKARI–Spitzer extragalactic cross-archival data set. Currently proposed MIR extinction curves vary significantly in their slopes toward the near-infrared, and the variation in the strengths and shapes of the 9.7 μm and 18 μm silicate absorption features make MIR spectral modeling and interpretation challenging, particularly for heavily obscured galaxies. By adopting the basic premise that PAH bands have relatively consistent intrinsic ratios within dusty starbursting galaxies, we can, for the first time, empirically determine the overall shape of the MIR attenuation curve by measuring the differential attenuation at specific PAH wavelengths. Our attenuation model shows PAH emission in most (ultra)luminous infrared galaxies is unambiguously subjected to attenuation, and we find strong evidence that PAH bands undergo differential attenuation as obscuration increases. Compared to preexisting results, the MIR attenuation curve derived from the model favors relatively gray continuum absorption from 3–8 μm and silicate features with intermediate strength at 9.7 μm but with stronger than typical 18 μm opacity.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章介绍了使用Gaia DR3数据发现的87条星流，其中28条是新发现。重点是利用这些星流来优化银河的质量模型。通过双幂律暗物质晕的拟合，得出了内部幂律斜率、尺度半径、密度扁平度和局部暗物质密度的数值。同时得出了恒星盘的质量、尺度长度和高度，以及所提出的银河模型的维里质量和50千秒差距内的质量。另外，作者还引入了大麦哲伦星云，对光环流进行拟合并得出了一致的质量估计。文章还提到了一些重要的发现，如ω Cen的附近尾迹、一条曾经是Sagittarius矮星系卫星的非常金属贫乏的星流，以及GD-1星流周围明显存在的热成分。 <div>
We present an atlas and follow-up spectroscopic observations of 87 thin stream-like structures detected with the STREAMFINDER algorithm in Gaia DR3, of which 28 are new discoveries. Here, we focus on using these streams to refine mass models of the Galaxy. Fits with a double-power-law halo with the outer power-law slope set to −βh = −3 yield an inner power-law slope of , a scale radius of , a halo density flattening qm,h = 0.75 ± 0.03, and a local dark matter density of ρh,⊙ = 0.0114 ± 0.0007 M⊙ pc−3. Freeing β yields , but this value is heavily influenced by our chosen virial mass limit. The stellar disks are found to have a combined mass of , with the thick disk contributing 12.4% ± 0.7% to the local stellar surface density. The scale lengths of the thin and thick disks are and , respectively, while their scale heights are and , respectively. The virial mass of the favored model is , while the mass inside of 50 kpc is MR<50 = 0.46 ± 0.03 × 1012M⊙. We introduce the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) into the derived potential models, and fit the Orphan stream therein, finding a mass for the LMC that is consistent with recent estimates. Some salient highlights include the nearby trailing arm of ω Cen, and a nearby very metal-poor stream that was once a satellite of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. Finally, we unambiguously detect a hot component around the GD-1 stream, consistent with it having been tidally preprocessed within its own dark matter subhalo.

The hour-long, gradual phase of solar flares is well observed across the electromagnetic spectrum, demonstrating many multiphase aspects, where cold condensations form within the heated post-flare system, but a complete 3D model is lacking. Using a state-of-the-art 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulation, we identify the key role played by the Lorentz force through the entire flare lifespan, and show that slow variations in the post-flare magnetic field achieve the bulk of the energy release. Synthetic images in multiple passbands closely match flare observations, and we quantify the role of conductive, radiative, and Lorentz force work contributions from flare onset to decay. This highlights how the non-force-free nature of the magnetic topology is crucial to trigger Rayleigh–Taylor dynamics, observed as waving coronal rays in extreme ultraviolet observations. Our C-class solar flare reproduces multiphase aspects such as post-flare coronal rain. In agreement with observations, we find strands of cooler plasma forming spontaneously by catastrophic cooling, leading to cool plasma draining down the post-flare loops. As there is force balance between magnetic pressure and tension and the plasma pressure in gradual-phase flare loops, this has potential for coronal seismology to decipher the magnetic field strength variation from observations.

We analyze 15 yr of eclipse timings of the polar V808 Aur. The rapid ingress/egress of the white dwarf and bright accretion region provide timings as precise as a few tenths of a second for rapid cadence photometric data. We find that between 2015 and 2018, the eclipse timings deviated from a linear ephemeris by more than 30 s. The rapid timing change is consistent with the periastron passage of a planet in an eccentric orbit about the polar. The best-fit orbital period is 11 ± 1 yr and we estimate a projected mass of Jupiter masses. We also show that the eclipse timings are correlated with the brightness of the polar with a slope of 1.1 s mag−1. This is likely due to the change in the geometry of the accretion curtains as a function of the mass transfer rate in the polar. While an eccentric planet offers an excellent explanation to the available eclipse data for V808 Aur, proposed planetary systems in other eclipsing polars have often struggled to accurately predict future eclipse timings.

In this paper, we introduce a new method for exact decomposition of propagating, nonlinear magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) disturbances into their component eigenenergies associated with the familiar slow, Alfvén, and fast wave eigenmodes, and the entropy and field-divergence pseudoeigenmodes. First, the mathematical formalism is introduced, where it is illustrated how the ideal-MHD eigensystem can be used to construct a decomposition of the time variation of the total energy density into contributions from the eigenmodes. The decomposition method is then demonstrated by applying it to the output of three separate nonlinear MHD simulations. The analysis of the simulations confirms that the component wave modes of a composite wavefield are uniquely identified by the method. The slow, Alfvén, and fast energy densities are shown to evolve in exactly the way expected from comparison with known linear solutions and nonlinear properties, including processes such as mode conversion. Along the way, some potential pitfalls for the numerical implementation of the decomposition method are identified and discussed. We conclude that the exact, nonlinear decomposition method introduced is a powerful and promising tool for understanding the nature of the decomposition of MHD waves as well as analyzing and interpreting the output of dynamic MHD simulations.

本文研究了AGN盘周边的引力不稳定性导致盘的碎裂和形成大约300个太阳质量的超大质量恒星，这些恒星可能有很长的寿命。另外，恒星也可以从盘外被俘获并从AGN盘的气体吸积中生长。研究推导了两种极限情况下的平衡恒星表面密度分布。对于AGN中心超大质量黑洞质量为106-108太阳质量，Eddington效率为0.1的情况，估计了总共103-105个大质量恒星的数量以及恒星合并的速率为10^-3到1每年。通过水动力学和N体模拟，初步研究了一组大质量恒星之间的相互作用，以提供更准确的恒星群体估计。 <div>
Gravitational instability in the outskirts of active galactic nuclei (AGN) disks leads to disk fragmentation and formation of ∼300 M⊙ supermassive stars with potentially long lifetimes. Alternatively, stars can be captured ex situ and grow from gas accretion in the AGN disk. However, the number density distribution throughout the disk is limited by thermal feedback as their luminosities provide the dominant heating source. We derive equilibrium stellar surface density profiles under two limiting contexts: in the case where the stellar lifetimes are prolonged, due to the recycling of hydrogen-rich disk gas, only the fraction of gas converted into heat is removed from the disk accretion flow. Alternatively, if stellar composition recycling is inefficient and stars can evolve off the main sequence, the disk accretion rate is quenched toward smaller radii resembling a classical starburst disk, albeit the effective removal rate depends not only on the stellar lifetime, but also the mass of stellar remnants. For AGNs with central supermassive black hole masses of ∼106–108M⊙ accreting at ∼0.1 Eddington efficiency, we estimate a total number of 103–105 massive stars and the rate of stellar mergers to be 10−3 to 1 yr−1. We initiate the detailed study of the interaction between a swarm of massive stars through hydro and N-body simulations to provide better prescriptions of dynamical processes in AGN disks, and to constrain more accurate estimates of the stellar population.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章讨论了Enols在形成原生糖和糖酸的关键中间体角色，同时也探讨了在星际环境中形成Enols的机制。实验利用含一氧化碳和水的星际冰模拟物，在暴露于来自银河系宇宙射线产生的次生电子的情况下，发现了乙二醛和其亚烯醇异构体乙炔二醇的形成。通过真空紫外光电离飞行时间质谱技术，检测到了气相中的乙二醛和乙炔二醇。实验结果揭示了乙二醛的形成途径是两个甲醛自由基的自由基重组，而乙炔二醇则是通过酮-烯醇-炔醇互变异构化形成。由于星际冰中一氧化碳和水的丰富，乙二醛和乙炔二醇是未来天文搜索的合适候选物质。此外，在天体物理学上检测到乙炔二醇有助于我们更深入地了解在深空中形成高能异构体（如烯醇体）的途径。 <div>
Enols—tautomers of ketones or aldehydes—are considered key intermediates in the formation of prebiotic sugars and sugar acids. Although laboratory simulation experiments suggest that enols should be ubiquitous in the interstellar medium, the underlying formation mechanisms of enols in interstellar environments are largely elusive. Here, we present the laboratory experiments on the formation of glyoxal (HCOCHO) along with its ynol tautomer acetylenediol (HOCCOH) in interstellar ice analogs composed of carbon monoxide (CO) and water (H2O) upon exposure to energetic electrons as a proxy for secondary electrons generated from Galactic cosmic rays. Utilizing tunable vacuum ultraviolet photoionization reflectron time-of-flight mass spectrometry, glyoxal and acetylenediol were detected in the gas phase during temperature-programmed desorption. Our results reveal the formation pathways of glyoxal via radical–radical recombination of two formyl (HĊO) radicals, and that of acetylenediol via keto-enol-ynol tautomerization. Due to the abundance of carbon monoxide and water in interstellar ices, glyoxal and acetylenediol are suitable candidates for future astronomical searches. Furthermore, the detection of acetylenediol in astrophysically relevant ices advances our understanding for the formation pathways of high-energy tautomers such as enols in deep space.

<div> 关键词: H i 21cm, 宇宙曙光, 电离层, 天线波束, 前景减去
总结: 
宇宙曙光和电离再结合时期的H i 21cm全球信号是理解宇宙演化的重要线索，但由于信号与污染的比率极低以及复杂的仪器系统，其检测存在重大挑战。(1) 分析了电离层和天线波束对数据分析的影响，电离层与地球大气中的电离等离子层相互作用，导致观测信号的频谱失真，使前景减去过程复杂化。(2) 评估了三种不同的前景拟合模板，发现EDGES和SVD模板通常优于对数多项式。(3) 进一步调查了特定的波束失真模型及其对信号提取过程的影响。 <div>
The H i 21 cm global signal from the Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) offers critical insights into the evolution of our Universe. Yet, its detection presents significant challenges, due to its extremely low signal-to-contamination ratio and complex instrumental systematics. In this paper, we examine the effects of the ionosphere and antenna beam on data analysis. The ionosphere, an ionized plasma layer in the Earth’s atmosphere, refracts, absorbs, and emits radio waves in the relevant frequency range. This interaction results in additional spectral distortion of the observed signal, complicating the process of foreground subtraction. Additionally, chromatic variations in the beam can also introduce further contamination into the global spectrum measurement. Notably, the ionospheric effect, being dependent on the direction of incoming light, interacts with the instrumental beam, adding another layer of complexity. To address this, we evaluate three different fitting templates of foreground: the logarithmic polynomial, the physically motivated Experiment to Detect the Global EoR Signature (EDGES) template, and a singular value decomposition (SVD)-based template. Our findings indicate that the EDGES and SVD templates generally surpass logarithmic polynomials in performance. Recognizing the significance of beam chromaticity, we further investigate specific beam distortion models and their impacts on the signal extraction process.

<div> eDIG, 多小孔窄带光谱, NGC 3556, 气体压力平衡, 磁场
总结:<br /><br />这篇论文介绍了一种新的多小孔窄带光谱方法，用于对近邻边缘朝向盘状星系的eDIG进行空间分辨光谱研究。通过对NGC 3556（M108）的试点研究，发现eDIG的垂直范围可达几千帕尔塞克，与X射线和射电图像相媲美。观察到[N ii]/Hα线比没有显著的垂直变化。通过对不同外星餐物质相之间的压力平衡的初步研究，发现磁场与X射线产生的热气体之间存在粗略的压力平衡，并可能在下层晕中对eDIG和热气体的全局运动起重要作用。在观察到的Hubble Space Telescope/Cosmic Origins Spectrograph的紫外辐射明亮的背景活动星系核位于离NGC 3556中心约29千帕尔塞克处，磁场压力远低于热气体和UV吸收线追踪到的等离子气体，尽管通过压力剖面的外推可能导致在这一比较中存在一些偏差。通过比较光学和CO线的位置-速度图，发现两种气体相的动力学是一致的，没有全局进流/流出的证据，最大旋转速度约为150 km/s。 <div>
The extraplanar diffuse ionized gas (eDIG) represents ionized gases traced by optical/UV lines beyond the stellar extent of galaxies. We herein introduce a novel multislit narrow-band spectroscopy method to conduct spatially resolved spectroscopy of the eDIG around a sample of nearby edge-on disk galaxies (eDIG-CHANGES). In this paper, we introduce the project design and major scientific goals, as well as a pilot study of NGC 3556 (M108). The eDIG is detected to a vertical extent of a few kiloparsecs above the disk, comparable to the X-ray and radio images. We do not see significant vertical variation of the [N ii]/Hα line ratio. A rough examination of the pressure balance between different circumgalactic medium phases indicates the magnetic field is in a rough pressure balance with the X-ray emitting hot gas and may play an important role in the global motion of both the eDIG and the hot gas in the lower halo. At the location of an Hubble Space Telescope/Cosmic Origins Spectrograph observed UV bright background active galactic nucleus ∼29 kpc from the center of NGC 3556, the magnetic pressure is much lower than that of the hot gas and the ionized gas traced by UV absorption lines, although the extrapolation of the pressure profiles may cause some biases in this comparison. By comparing the position–velocity diagrams of the optical and CO lines, we also find the dynamics of the two gas phases are consistent with each other, with no evidence of a global inflow/outflow and a maximum rotation velocity of ∼150 km s−1.

<title>Measurement of Dependence of Microlensing Planet Frequency on the Host Star Mass and Galactocentric Distance by Using a Galactic Model</title>

We measure the dependence of planet frequency on host star mass, ML, and distance from the Galactic center, RL, using a sample of planets discovered by gravitational microlensing. We compare the two-dimensional distribution of the lens-source proper motion, μrel, and the Einstein radius crossing time, tE, measured for 22 planetary events from Suzuki et al. with the distribution expected from Galactic model. Assuming that the planet-hosting probability of a star is proportional to , we calculate the likelihood distribution of (m,r). We estimate that and under the assumption that the planet-hosting probability is independent of the mass ratio. We also divide the planet sample into subsamples based on their mass ratio, q, and estimate that for q < 10−3 and for q > 10−3. Although uncertainties are still large, this result implies a possibility that, in orbits beyond the snowline, massive planets are more likely to exist around more massive stars whereas low-mass planets exist regardless of their host star mass.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We perform high-resolution simulations of forming star clusters as they merge inside giant molecular clouds (GMCs) using hydrodynamics coupled to N-body dynamics to simultaneously model both the gas and stars. We zoom in to previously run GMC simulations and resolve clusters into their stellar and gas components while including the surrounding GMC environment. We find that GMC gas is important in facilitating the growth of clusters in their embedded phase by promoting cluster mergers. Mergers induce asymmetric expansion of the stellar component of the clusters in our simulations. As well, mergers induce angular momentum in the clusters’ stellar and gas components. We find that mergers can lead to an increase in the amount of dense gas present in clusters if a background gas distribution is present. We predict that this can lead to new star formation that can change the overall distribution of cluster stars in velocity space. Our results suggest that subcluster mergers in the presence of background gas can imprint dynamical signatures that can be used to constrain cluster formation histories.

<title>Enhanced Acceleration and Escape of Hydrogen Pickup Ions Upstream from Mars by Interplanetary Shocks</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The pickup process of newly ionized hydrogen (H) from the Martian extended exosphere represents an important H+ escape channel on Mars. It is generally believed that interplanetary (IP) shocks can accelerate the pickup ions and, in turn, affect the pickup process. However, the underlying processes inherent to the acceleration are not yet fully understood. Here, we concentrate on the dynamic processes involved in acceleration arising from IP shock compression. We examine two typical IP shock events characterized by a sudden increase in the average energy of upstream H+ pickup ions across the shock. The H+ pickup ions continuously enter the field of view of Supra-Thermal And Thermal Ion Composition or Solar Wind Ion Analyzer on board the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN spacecraft in a narrow angular range. Moreover, they correspond to a similar part of their respective ring distributions in velocity space. By comparing measured and theoretical H+ pickup ion energies, we attribute the more energetic H+ pickup ions to the enhanced convection electric field acceleration caused by the shock compression. An increase in the guiding center drift speed across the shock implies a higher escape rate of the H+ pickup ions. Furthermore, the pitch-angle scattering could facilitate the escape of the higher energy H+ pickup ions from Mars. The results may shed light on the understanding of the energization and escape of planetary pickup ions in the solar system.

<title>Joint r-process Enrichment by Supernovae with a Metallicity Threshold and Neutron Star Mergers</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The enrichment history of r-process elements has been imprinted on the stellar abundances that change in accordance with increasing metallicity in galaxies. Close examination of the [Eu/Fe] feature caused by stars in nearby galaxies, including the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), shows its perplexity. The decreasing trend of the [Eu/Fe] feature is followed by a nearly constant value; this trend is generally attributed to an onset of the delayed Fe release from Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), which is the same interpretation of the [α/Fe] feature. However, this feature appears in the LMC at [Fe/H] of approximately −0.7, which is significantly higher than that for the [α/Fe] case (≈−2). This result potentially indicates the presence of an overlooked property of the r-process site that remains unseen in the study of the Milky Way. Here, we propose that this [Eu/Fe]-knee feature is created by a fade-out of core-collapse SNe producing r-process elements; these elements along with neutron star mergers (NSMs) promote the r-process enrichment under the condition for this specific SNe such that their occurrence is limited to a low-metallicity environment. This metallicity threshold for the occurrence rate of r-process SNe at a subsolar is nearly identical to that for long gamma-ray bursts whose origin may be connected to fast-rotating massive stars. Moreover, we reason that the contribution of Eu from NSMs is crucial to maintain a high [Eu/Fe] at an early stage in dwarf galaxies by a balance with Fe from SNe Ia; both enrichments via NSMs and SNe Ia proceed with similar delay time distributions.

<title>Dependence of Lunar Pickup Ion Flux on Source Location: ARTEMIS Observations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The Moon is enveloped in an exosphere, which is comprised of a variety of neutral atoms and molecules. Once exospheric neutrals are ionized by photons, protons, or electrons from the Sun, the resulting ions are accelerated by the electromagnetic fields of their surroundings and can thereby travel away from their source locations. These ions are the so-called pickup ions and are frequently observed by the two Acceleration, Reconnection, Turbulence, and Electrodynamics of Moon’s Interaction with the Sun (ARTEMIS) spacecraft. In this study, we identify 115 events from an 11 yr period of ARTEMIS observations, which contain a total of 11,987 samples for our statistics. By using analytical ion trajectory calculations, we trace the source location of each pickup ion observation. Most pickup ion trajectories originate near the subsolar point, consistent with the efficiency of sputtering. We find that the flux of pickup ions strongly anticorrelates with the source altitude, providing indirect evidence of decreasing exospheric ion flux with increasing altitude. We also find that the flux of pickup ions does not show a significant relationship with the crustal magnetic field intensity. This implies that a depression of sputtering efficiency or the trapping of near-surface freshly born ions by a crustal magnetic anomaly may not reduce the subsequent pickup ion flux as effectively as expected. In summary, the present paper provides a statistical view of lunar pickup ion fluxes in association with the altitude, local time, and local crustal magnetic field of their source locations.

<div> 质量分布，星团年龄，星际物质，初始质量函数，质量吸积率 <br />
总结: 本研究采用贝叶斯方法分析了猎户座星云团中的星源光谱能量分布，得出了每个源的质量、年龄、消光、距离和吸积率。质量分布显示猎户座星云团中存在质量分离现象，而年龄分布支持星云团在大约1百万年前经历了一次重要的星形成事件。针对质量大于0.1太阳质量的星源，得出的初始质量函数与Chabrier系统的初始质量函数契合良好。质量吸积率和质量吸积光度表现为破折号幂律关系，这表明在该星团中，绝大多数年轻星周盘的过量辐射可能主要由中心恒星驱动的X射线光致蒸发造成，而非外部光致蒸发。这意味着幂律关系的斜率可能在星形成过程开始时就被初始条件确定，而这些条件在最终形成不同规模星团的区域可能是相似的。 <div>
We have performed a comprehensive study of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) combining the photometric data obtained by the two Hubble Space Telescope Treasury programs that targeted this region. To consistently analyze the rich data set obtained in a wide variety of filters, we adopted a Bayesian approach to fit the spectral energy distribution of the sources, deriving mass, age, extinction, distance, and accretion for each source in the region. The three-dimensional study of mass distribution for bona fide cluster members shows that mass segregation in the ONC extends to subsolar masses, while the age distribution strongly supports the idea that star formation in the ONC is best described by a major episode of star formation that happened ∼1 Myr ago. For masses ≳0.1 M⊙, our derived empirical initial mass function (IMF) is in good agreement with a Chabrier system IMF. Both the accretion luminosity (Lacc) and mass accretion rates ( ) are best described by broken power-law relations. This suggests that for the majority of young circumstellar disks in this cluster the excess emission may be dominated by X-ray-driven photoevaporation by the central star rather than external photoevaporation. If this is the case, the slopes of the power-law relations may be largely determined by the initial conditions set at the onset of the star formation process, which may be quite similar between regions that eventually form clusters of different sizes.

总结:
使用哈勃空间望远镜进行深度光度测量，对来自GO-14734计划的10个目标进行了研究，包括6个确认的超微弱矮星系、3个超微弱矮星系候选体和一个可能的球状星团。其中6个目标是大麦哲伦星系的卫星或曾与其相互作用。通过最大似然技术确定了它们的结构参数。研究发现，与银河系的超微弱矮星系在星等-大小平面上没有系统差异。此外，将文献中的超微弱矮星系模拟属性转换为可观测空间，对比当前暗物质和重子物质模拟来探讨是否可以限制暗物质的性质。研究发现，使用冷暗物质、温暗物质和自相互作用暗物质模拟的超微弱矮星系在星等-大小平面上没有差异，但目前使用非传统暗物质模型模拟的超微弱矮星系样本相当有限。随着更多深度、广域的调查数据的出现，我们将有更多机会发现和表征这些超微弱的恒星系统和更广阔的低表面亮度宇宙。 <div>
We present deep Hubble Space Telescope photometry of 10 targets from Treasury Program GO-14734, including six confirmed ultrafaint dwarf (UFD) galaxies, three UFD candidates, and one likely globular cluster. Six of these targets are satellites of, or have interacted with, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We determine their structural parameters using a maximum-likelihood technique. Using our newly derived half-light radius (rh) and V-band magnitude (MV) values in addition to literature values for other UFDs, we find that UFDs associated with the LMC do not show any systematic differences from Milky Way UFDs in the magnitude–size plane. Additionally, we convert simulated UFD properties from the literature into the MV–rh observational space to examine the abilities of current dark matter (DM) and baryonic simulations to reproduce observed UFDs. Some of these simulations adopt alternative DM models, thus allowing us to also explore whether the MV–rh plane could be used to constrain the nature of DM. We find no differences in the magnitude–size plane between UFDs simulated with cold, warm, and self-interacting DM, but note that the sample of UFDs simulated with alternative DM models is quite limited at present. As more deep, wide-field survey data become available, we will have further opportunities to discover and characterize these ultrafaint stellar systems and the greater low surface-brightness universe.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章报告了对三个z≃7.47–7.75星系进行的研究。研究利用JWST/NIRSpec观测数据确认了这些星系的光谱红移，并表明它们为高度电离并贫金属的星系。研究还探讨了Lyα发射线的性质，包括线流量、速度偏移和空间延展性，并发现在其中一个星系中，MOSFIRE的测量值要高出1.3–5倍。另外，红移信息还表明这些星系在再电离时期的Lyα的逃逸情况可能存在多种多样的情景。这篇文章的研究结果为利用JWST/NIRSpec的高光谱分辨率观测约束斑状再电离的物理过程提供了重要的信息。 <div>
We analyze rest-frame ultraviolet to optical spectra of three z ≃ 7.47–7.75 galaxies whose Lyα emission lines were previously detected with Keck/MOSFIRE observations, using the JWST/NIRSpec observations from the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science survey. From NIRSpec data, we confirm the systemic redshifts of these Lyα emitters, and emission-line ratio diagnostics indicate these galaxies were highly ionized and metal-poor. We investigate Lyα line properties, including the line flux, velocity offset, and spatial extent. For the one galaxy where we have both NIRSpec and MOSFIRE measurements, we find a significant offset in their flux measurements (∼1.3–5× greater in MOSFIRE) and a marginal difference in the velocity shifts. The simplest interpretation is that the Lyα emission is extended and not entirely encompassed by the NIRSpec slit. The cross-dispersion profiles in NIRSpec reveal that Lyα in one galaxy is significantly more extended than the nonresonant emission lines. We also compute the expected sizes of ionized bubbles that can be generated by the Lyα sources and discuss viable scenarios for the creation of sizable ionized bubbles (>1 physical Mpc). The source with the highest-ionization condition is possibly capable of ionizing its own bubble, while the other two do not appear to be capable of ionizing such a large region, but require additional sources of ionizing photons. Therefore, the fact that we detect Lyα from these galaxies suggests diverse scenarios for the escape of Lyα during the epoch of reionization. High-spectral-resolution spectra with JWST/NIRSpec will be extremely useful for constraining the physics of patchy reionization.

The nonresonant streaming instability (Bell instability) plays a pivotal role in the acceleration and confinement of cosmic rays (CRs), yet the exact mechanism responsible for its saturation and the magnitude of the final amplified magnetic field have not been assessed from first principles. Using a survey of hybrid simulations (with kinetic ions and fluid electrons), we study the evolution of the Bell instability as a function of the parameters of the CR population. We find that at saturation, the magnetic pressure in the amplified field is comparable with the initial CR anisotropic pressure, rather than with the CR energy flux, as previously argued. These results provide a predictive prescription for the total magnetic field amplification expected in the many astrophysical environments where the Bell instability is important.

<br /><br />通过3D广义相对论磁流体动力学仿真，研究了倾斜轨道上的黑洞与厚的AGN磁性阻尼吸积盘的相互作用。结果显示，次级黑洞会使射流产生2-4倍的非束缚质量流出率，在更大距离后融合为更连续的流出。另外，首次自洽地展示了主黑洞旋转与双黑洞轨道角动量之间的自旋轨道耦合会显著改变吸积盘和射流的方向，长时间内会产生60°-80°的进动。这一现象可能为厚AGN吸积盘持续进动提供了强有力的证据，并且表明如果在这样的系统中观察到这一效应，可能存在次级黑洞伴星。总体上，次级黑洞对盘的时间平均属性和主黑洞的吸积率影响微乎其微，与我们对扰动厚盘的估计一致。需要注意的是，在冷却的薄盘情况下，情况可能会发生显著变化。 <div>
Perturber objects interacting with supermassive black hole accretion disks are often invoked to explain observed quasiperiodic behavior in active galactic nuclei (AGN). We present global, 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of black holes on inclined orbits colliding with magnetically arrested thick AGN disks using a binary black hole spacetime with mass ratio 0.1. We do this by implementing an approximate time-dependent binary black hole metric into the GRMHD Athena++ code. The secondary enhances the unbound mass outflow rate 2–4 times above that provided by the disk in quasiperiodic outbursts, eventually merging into a more continuous outflow at larger distances. We present a simple analytic model that qualitatively agrees well with this result and can be used to extrapolate to unexplored regions of parameter space. We show self-consistently for the first time that spin–orbit coupling between the primary black hole spin and the binary orbital angular momentum causes the accretion disk and jet directions to precess significantly (by 60°–80°) on long timescales (e.g., ∼20 times the binary orbital period). Because this effect may be the only way for thick AGN disks to consistently precess, it could provide strong evidence of a secondary black hole companion if observed in such a system. Besides this new phenomenology, the time-average properties of the disk and accretion rates onto the primary are only marginally altered by the presence of the secondary, consistent with our estimate for a perturbed thick disk. This situation might drastically change in cooled thin disks.

The kinetic energy in tidal flows, when converted into heat, can affect the internal structure of a star and shift its location on a color–magnitude diagram from that of standard models. In this paper we explore the impact of injecting heat into stars with masses near the main-sequence turnoff mass (1.26 M⊙) of the open cluster M67. The heating rate is obtained from the tidal shear energy dissipation rate, which is calculated from first principles by simultaneously solving the equations that describe orbital motion and the response of a star’s layers to the gravitational, Coriolis, centrifugal, gas pressure, and viscous forces. The stellar structure models are computed with MESA. We focus on the effects of injecting heat in pulses lasting 0.01 Gyr, a time frame consistent with the synchronization timescale in binary systems. We find that the location of the tidally perturbed stars in the M67 color–magnitude diagram is shifted to significantly higher luminosities and effective temperatures than predicted by the standard model isochrone and includes locations corresponding to some of the blue straggler stars. Because tidal heating takes energy from the orbit, causing it to shrink, blue straggler stars could be merger or mass transfer progenitors, as well as products of these processes.

这篇文章报道了对围绕Herbig Ae星HD 163296的原行星盘进行的ALMA观测。研究得出了H2CO的柱密度、激发温度和正对顺相对比的径向分布，并确定了排放的垂直结构。研究结果表明，在盘的外部存在冷气相化学反应的辅助增加，且UV辐射可以穿透尘埃边缘，与冰体来源以及冷气相化学的结果一致。这一Herbig盘的结论与之前针对T Tauri盘TW Hya的研究结果形成对比，后者中冷气相化学的贡献更大。需要对其他源进行更多观测，以解开原行星盘中H2CO的主要形成途径。 <br /><br />总结: <br />本文报道了对Herbig Ae星HD 163296周围原行星盘的ALMA观测结果，分析了H2CO的径向、垂直分布以及正对顺比值，并得出了UV透射、冰体来源与冷气相化学的结论。 <div>
H2CO is a small organic molecule widely detected in protoplanetary disks. As a precursor to grain-surface formation of CH3OH, H2CO is considered an important precursor of O-bearing organic molecules that are locked in ices. Still, since gas-phase reactions can also form H2CO, there remains an open question on the channels by which organics form in disks, and how much the grain versus the gas pathways impact the overall organic reservoir. We present spectrally and spatially resolved Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of several ortho- and para-H2CO transitions toward the bright protoplanetary disk around the Herbig Ae star HD 163296. We derive column density, excitation temperature, and ortho-to-para ratio (OPR) radial profiles for H2CO, as well as disk-averaged values of NT ∼ 4 × 1012 cm−2, Tex ∼ 20 K, and OPR ∼ 2.7, respectively. We empirically determine the vertical structure of the emission, finding vertical heights of z/r ∼ 0.1. From the profiles, we find a relatively constant OPR ∼ 2.7 with radius, but still consistent with 3.0 among the uncertainties, a secondary increase of NT in the outer disk, and low Tex values that decrease with disk radius. Our resulting radial, vertical, and OPR constraints suggest an increased UV penetration beyond the dust millimeter edge, consistent with an icy origin but also with cold gas-phase chemistry. This Herbig disk contrasts previous results for the T Tauri disk, TW Hya, which had a larger contribution from cold gas-phase chemistry. More observations of other sources are needed to disentangle the dominant formation pathway of H2CO in protoplanetary disks.

<div> AGN, GRBs, energy injections, light curves, EFS model
总结:<br /><br />这篇论文研究了发生在AGN盘中的GRB，并分析了能量注入的情况。研究采用了标准的EFS模型，并考虑了短暂和长暂的GRB情形。计算了受加热盘物质辐射和GRB余辉两种辐射的光度曲线。发现能量注入有助于EFS以相对论速度突破低密度AGN盘的光球层，同时几乎不影响受加热盘物质辐射，但明显增强了GRB余辉的峰值流量。 <div>
Active galactic nucleus (AGN) disks are widely considered potential hosts for various high-energy transients, including gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The reactivation of GRB central engines can provide additional energy to shocks formed during the interaction of the initially ejected GRB jets with the circumburst material, commonly referred to as energy injections. In this paper, we study GRBs occurring in AGN disks within the context of energy injections. We adopt the standard external forward shock (EFS) model and consider both short- and long-duration GRB scenarios. Light curves for two types of radiation, namely, the radiation from the heated disk material (RHDM) and GRB afterglows, are computed. We find that the energy injection facilitates the EFS to break out from the photosphere of the low-density AGN disk at relativistic velocity. Moreover, the energy injection almost does not affect the RHDM but significantly enhances the peak flux of the GRB afterglows.

<title>Relative Occurrence Rate between Hot and Cold Jupiters as an Indicator to Probe Planet Migration</title>

<div> HJ, CJ, migration, planet occurrence rate, stellar mass<br />
<br />
本文提出了一个二阶统计参数ε，即热木星（HJ）和冷木星（CJ）的相对发生率（ε = ηHJ/ηCJ），以探测气态巨行星的迁移。通过对HJ和CJ频率的联合分析，可以揭示巨行星系统的动力学演变。研究发现，在观测中，随着恒星质量的变化，ε呈现出一个初步的趋势（97%的置信度），即当恒星质量从0.8到1.4太阳质量时，ε呈下降趋势，这可以通过不同恒星周围巨行星生长和盘面迁移时间尺度来解释。通过行星体和鹅卵石吸积模拟，证明经典的核心吸积+盘面迁移模型可以解释观察到的ε下降趋势。提出了两种方式来增加趋势的显著性并验证了反相关性。未来的工作需要更好地限制ε，特别是对M型矮星和更大质量的恒星。 <br /><br />总结: 本文提出了一个用于探测气态巨行星迁移的参数ε，并通过研究发现了其在不同恒星质量下的趋势，同时提出了对这一趋势的验证和进一步研究方向。 <div>
We propose a second-order statistic parameter ε, the relative occurrence rate between hot Jupiters (HJs) and cold Jupiters (CJs) (ε = ηHJ/ηCJ), to probe the migration of gas giants. Since the planet occurrence rate is the combined outcome of the formation and migration processes, a joint analysis of HJ and CJ frequency may shed light on the dynamical evolution of giant planet systems. We first investigate the behavior of ε as the stellar mass changes observationally. Based on the occurrence rate measurements of HJs (ηHJ) from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite survey and CJs (ηCJ) from the California Legacy Survey, we find a tentative trend (97% confidence) that ε drops when the stellar mass rises from 0.8 to 1.4 M⊙, which can be explained by different giant planet growth and disk migration timescales around different stars. We carry out planetesimal and pebble accretion simulations, both of which can reproduce the results of ηHJ, ηCJ, and ε. Our findings indicate that the classical core accretion + disk migration model can explain the observed decreasing trend of ε. We propose two ways to increase the significance of the trend and verify the anticorrelation. Future works are required to better constrain ε, especially for M dwarfs and for more massive stars.

<div> CAMIRA clusters, AGN power fraction, redshift, cluster center, multiwavelength data
总结:
本研究使用Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam选出大约100万个星系团和星系群成员星系，称为CAMIRA星系团，研究了活动星系核（AGN）的统计特性，重点关注AGN功率分数（fAGN）与星系团红移（zcl）以及距离星系团中心的关系。通过使用紫外-中红外波段的多波段数据和CIGALE代码与SKIRTOR AGN模型进行光谱能量分布拟合，确定了fAGN的值。研究发现，CAMIRA星系团中fAGN的值与zcl呈正相关，并且随着距离星系团中心的增加而增加。这些结果表明AGN群体的出现取决于红移和环境，并且高红移时期的星系群和星系团在AGN演化中起着重要作用。此外，研究还表明星系团合并可能会增强特别巨大星系团外围的AGN活动。我们的研究结果与CAMIRA星系团上的AGN数量分数相关的研究结果一致。 <div>
Herein, we present the statistical properties of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) for approximately 1 million member galaxies of galaxy groups and clusters with 0.1 < cluster redshift (zcl) < 1.4 selected using the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam, the so-called CAMIRA clusters. In this research, we focused on the AGN power fraction (fAGN), which is defined as the proportion of the contribution of AGNs to the total infrared (IR) luminosity, LIR (AGN)/LIR, and examined how fAGN depends on (i) zcl and (ii) the distance from the cluster center. We compiled multiwavelength data using the ultraviolet–mid-IR range. Moreover, we performed spectral energy distribution fits to determine fAGN using the CIGALE code with the SKIRTOR AGN model. We found that (i) the value of fAGN in the CAMIRA clusters is positively correlated with zcl, with the correlation slope being steeper than that for field galaxies, and (ii) fAGN exhibits a high value at the cluster outskirts. These results indicate that the emergence of the AGN population depends on the redshift and environment and that galaxy groups and clusters at high redshifts are important in AGN evolution. Additionally, we demonstrated that cluster–cluster mergers may enhance AGN activity at the outskirts of particularly massive galaxy clusters. Our findings are consistent with a related study on the CAMIRA clusters that was based on the AGN number fraction.
